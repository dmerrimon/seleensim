SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX001 -CL202 Amendment 4  
17 June 2016 
 
 
The Protocol Amendment 3 of UX001-CL202 (dated 07 October 2015) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_739472] also been made to provide supportive background information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consistency and clarity) but are not detailed in this summary. 
1. The Month 36 visit was defined  as the end of study visit. In addition, this amendment 
now provi des subjects the opportunity to enroll in the UX001-CL302, an  ongoing 
extension study. These changes affected the synopsis,  Table 2.2, and Sections  7.1 and 
7.5.1.  This amendment also clarifies that the Termination Visit is not required for  
subjects who are rolling over to the UX001-CL302 extension study, but is required for subjects who terminate study participation early or who decide not to participate in the UX001-CL302 extension study. 
Rationale: The changes were made to clarify the end of study visit, clarify which 
subjects are required to complete the Termination Visit, and to provide subjects  in the 
current study the opportunity to enroll in the UX001-CL302 extension study.  
2. Record Retention: S ection  8.4.[ADDRESS_739473] 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with natio nal law.  
Rationale:  This administrative change has been made to reflect upcoming changes to 
EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by [CONTACT_11831]. 
3. Updates were made to Section 7.4.2, Identity of Study Drug.  
Rationale: These changes were made for clarification. 
4. A change was made to Section  8.5.4, Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx.  
Rationale: This change was made to be consistent with the current Ultragenyx template language regarding this topic.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX001 -CL202 Amendment 3 
07 October 2015 
 
 
The Protocol Amendment 2 of UX001-CL202 (dated 17 December  2014) has been modified 
by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_739475] also been made to provide supportive background information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consi stency and clarity) but are not detailed in this summary.  
1. Part IV was added to change the formulation from sialic acid immediate release 
(SA-IR) to SA extended release ( SA-ER). The SA -IR dose formulation has been 
removed. This change affects multiple sections of the protocol synopsis and body of 
the protocol, including the Schedule of Events ( Table  2.2), Study Rationale 
(Section  5.4), Study Objectives ( Section 6), Investigational Plan ( Section 7), and 
Treatments ( Section 7.4).  
Rationale : By [CONTACT_941] 4th day of dosing in a nonclinical study conducted in dogs, AUC for 
free SA was similar between the immediate and extended release formulations. In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in the current study confirmed that 12g/day SA-IR did not appear to provide any additional benefit compared with 6g/day SA-ER, although some individual patients may have improved. Therefore, no further SA- IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; 
patients currently on 12g/day may continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562728]- ER.  
2. Updated Section 8.5.1 (Definition of Adverse Events ) with the following text: “Note 
that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g., for elective surgeries) are not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.” 
Rationale: Updated for clarification of the SAE definition . 
3. Updated Section s 8.5.4 with new text related to rep orting of adverse events. 
Rationale: Updated to align with other Ultragenyx protocols. 
4. Updated safety contact [CONTACT_3031] (Section 8.5.5).  
Rationale: Updated to inform proper reporting of serious adverse events.

UX001 -CL202 Amendment 2 
17 December 201 4 
 
 
The Protocol Amendment 1 of UX001-CL202 (dated 02 October 2013) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_739476] also been made to provide supportive background information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consistency and clarity) but are not detailed in this summary. 
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated Medical Monitor contact [CONTACT_3031] ( Section 8.5.6) have been updated to: 
, MD 
2. Part III was added t o the study design to allow for the reduction of the dose from 12g/day 
to 6g/day for a majority of participating subjects. This change affects  multiple sections  of 
the protocol synopsis and body of the protocol, including the Schedule of E vents 
(Table 2.2), Study Rationale  (Section 5.4), S tudy Objectives  (Section 6), Investigational 
Plan (Section 7), and T reatments (Section 7.4). 
Rationale : This change is based on a review of the data for the rol lover subjects from the 
parent study UX001-CL201 who had been receiving 12g/day in Part II of this extension study.  The data analysis suggests that an improvement of at least 15% in either the UEC or the LEC after 6 months of treatment with 12g/day SA represents a response that is 
suggestive of an added benefit from the higher dose.  T he small subset of rollover 
subjects  who meet these criteria , along with the ongoing naïve subjects, will have the 
option to remain on the 12g/day dose for the remainder of the study. 
3. The statistical methods were updated (synopsis and Section 7.6). 
Rationale : The s tatistical methods were updated to reflect the changes to the study design 
described in change #2 and to clarify which analyses populations were used for the Part 
II interim  analyses. 
4. The protocol was updated to include a coordinating investigator. The coordinating 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_562713] ( Section 8.2).

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX001 -CL202 Amendment 1  
02 October 2013 
 
 
The Original Protocol 01 version of UX001-CL202 (dated 01 March 2013) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 1 to incorporate a number of changes based on additional information acquired since the beginning of the study.  The majority of changes were predicated by  a complete analysis and review of pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic 
(PD), clinical efficacy, and safety results from the [ADDRESS_739478] 
also been made to provide supportive background information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consistency and clarity) but are not deta iled in this 
summary.  
1. Indication:   GNE Myopathy is now the preferred term used in the protocol for the 
indication.  The majority of references to HIBM have been replaced with GNE Myopathy.  
2. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated contact [CONTACT_562730].  
3. Overall Study Design and Plan. 
The study will now be conducted in two parts.  Part I of the study will provide additional information on the long- term safety and efficacy of 6g/day dose of SA -ER as initia lly 
designed, except the maximum treatment duration on 6g SA-ER has been shortened to approximately 12 weeks.  The Part I Termination Visit will also serve as the Baseline Visit for Part II of the study.  
Part II of the study will assess the long -term safety and efficacy of an increased SA dose 
(12g/day).  In this phase, SA treatment will be administered in the form of SA- ER tablets 
and sialic acid immediate release (SA -IR) capsules.  Beginning with the Part II- Baseline 
Visit, all subjects currently enrolled  in Part I will crossover to the SA -ER/SA -IR dosing 
regimen.  An additional 10 GNE Myopathy subjects will be enrolled into Part II of the study.  The additional subjects will provide an assessment of 12g/day SA- ER/SA -IR 
treatment in treatment- naïve subjects able to walk at least 200 meters (and < 80% 
predicted) in a screening [ADDRESS_739479] (6MWT).   Throughout the Part II Treatment Period, all subjects will be administered three 500 mg SA -ER tablets and three

500 mg SA-IR capsules orally four times per day (QID), in the morning, afternoon, early 
evening, and at bedtime (qHS), for a total dose of 12g/day.   
Evaluations of safety, changes in clinical endpoints such as muscle strength, mobility, 
and function, and changes in exploratory serum biomarkers will be performed according to the Schedule of Events specific to each phase of the study ( Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2).  
If reasonable efficacy and safety are demonstrated during an interim analysis following [ADDRESS_739481] dose of study 
drug. 
Rationale :  The modification of study design was predicated on results of planned PK, 
PD, clinical efficacy, and safety analyses following the 24 -week placebo -control led 
Treatment Period in the UX001-CL201 Phase 2 clinical study, wherein SA- ER treatment 
was administered at two dose levels, 3g and 6g SA-ER/day.  The goal of the Week [ADDRESS_739482] dose (6g/day SA-ER) provided sustained exposure, a 
modest clinical efficacy signal, and acceptable safety profile.   
The clinical efficacy data showed dose-dependent improvement in muscle strength relative to placebo in  some muscle groups, particularly in the upper extremities at the 
6g/day SA- ER dose. These changes were statistically significant or trended towards 
significance, and were more pronounced in subjects that had greater walking ability at baseline, a predefin ed subset.  Other clinical endpoints (e.g. weighted arm lift test) did 
not reveal measureable changes at the Week 24 interim assessment.  Creatine kinase (CK) levels showed a trend to improvement in the 6g/day SA-ER dose group compared with placebo.  Overa ll, SA -ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse 
events observed in either dose group. 
Based on data from the Week 24 analysis following the placebo- controlled Treatment 
Period, the 6g/day SA-ER dose level appears to be at the lower end of t he effective range, 
while 3g/day SA- ER had almost no effect.  An additional analysis of safety and efficacy 
data will be conducted at the end of the Treatment Continuation Period in UX001-CL201 
Phase [ADDRESS_739483] positive clinical efficacy signal and acceptable safety profile at the 6g/day dose suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index by [CONTACT_528613].  Therefore, investigation into optimizing the risk -benefit profile of SA substrate replacement by [CONTACT_562731].  
 
Protocol Number:   UX001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739484] and Tr eatment.   
Part II of the study will assess the safety and efficacy of 12g/day SA -ER/SA -IR treatment 
for 6 months.  If reasonable efficacy and safety are demonstrated, the subjects will 
continue SA- ER/SA -IR treatment for up to 36 months. 
The SA -ER/SA -IR st udy drugs administered in Part II of the study will consist of SA -ER 
tablets, each containing 500 mg of SA active ingredient in an extended release formulation, and SA-IR capsules, each containing 500 mg of SA active ingredient.  During the Part II Treatment Period, the 12g total daily SA- ER/SA -IR dose will be 
administered by [CONTACT_528605] a QID regimen: three SA -ER 
tablets (1.5g SA- ER) and three SA -IR capsules (1.5g SA-IR) taken in the morning, 
afternoon, early evening, and qHS.  If tolerability issues arise, the dose may be 
temporarily stepped down until symptoms resolve. 
Rationale :  Since successful use of SA replacement therapy in humans is believed to 
depend upon optimized exposure to the compound, an increased dose will be examined in Part II of the study.  Although administration of more extended release tablets could be utilized, data in canines suggests that administration of immediate release SA in combination with the SA- ER will maximize absorption in the GI tract. Therefo re, Part II 
will examine safety and efficacy of an increased dose level combining immediate release SA (SA -IR) with SA -ER. 
The SA -ER/SA -IR dose and regimen for Study UX001-CL202 was selected based on the 
apparent detectable treatment effect at the highest dose and the association of higher SA 
serum levels with better improvement in strength, suggesting that a higher dose might be useful.  PK data from canine studies suggest that adding immediate release SA was the most effective way to increase SA, and high er doses of SA should be safe.  Supportive 
information is summarized below:  
• Dose effect at 6g only.  Interim results from UX001 -CL201 suggest the 6g SA- ER 
dose level appears to be at the lower end of the effective range since a clinical efficacy signal was  observed but 3g SA- ER had almost no effect.   
• The SA level correlates with treatment effect based on HHD.   The Week 24 
interim data imply a positive PD signal and acceptable safety profile suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index by [CONTACT_562732].   
• Canine studies show that immediate release most effective way to increase SA.   
Studies in normal canines showed that more than proportional increases in absorption of SA are possible if an immediate release formulation was mixed with an extended 
release formulation.  The concept is that the immediate release product enhances stomach absorption which is not well utilized by [CONTACT_562733]. 
• QID therapy should support higher SA levels.   Since SA -IR is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_241625],  a 
QID dosing regimen is predicted to provide optimized continuous exposure to SA.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739485] 2013 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   Page 5 of 66 
Administration of a 12g total daily dose of SA would therefore be divided into 4 
equal doses of 3g each (1.5g SA-ER + 1.5g SA- IR), representing only a 50% increase 
for each  dose. 
• Safety of very high SA doses.  In a chronic toxicology study in rats, the NOAEL was 
2000 mg/kg SA, which provides a safety margin of approximately 1.4-fold for the 
proposed 12g/day dose level.  In a 6 month oral toxicity study in dogs, the NOAEL was 2000 mg/kg SA, which provides a safety margin of approximately 5-fold for the 
human 12g/day dose level.   
• Single doses of 6g SA- ER given in one dose, were well tolerated.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_739486] been modified to evaluate the safety of 12g/day SA in the treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects over a [ADDRESS_739487] to SA- ER/SA -IR.  An additional exploratory objective 
has been added to determine whether 12g /day of SA- ER/SA -IR administered as 
1.5g/1.5g four times per day is superior to prior treatment with 6g/day of SA- ER therapy 
administered as 2g three times per day in GNE Myopathy subjects.  
Rationale :  The objectives of the study have been revised to delineate specific aims for 
Part I and Part II of the study.  The change is in agreement with the overall study design and treatment regimens.  
6. Selection of Study Population and Sample Size.  
The sample size has been increased to enroll an additional 10 treatment naïve GNE Myopathy subjects into Part II of the study. 
Rationale :  Approximately [ADDRESS_739488] time GNE Myopathy subjects will be treated with 12g/day SA- ER/SA -IR.  Therefore, 10 additional subjects will be enrolled to assess 
safety and clinical efficacy of the higher 12 g/day dose level in a treatment naïve 
population.  
Protocol Number:   UX001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739489] inclusion criterion was modified to: 
• Enrollment in, and successful completion of the UX001-CL201 protocol OR  
(for 10 treatment naïve subjects): 
o Have a confirmed diagnosis of GNE Myopathy 
o Aged 18 -65 years of age, inclusive 
o Able to walk ≥ 200 meters and < 80% of predicted normal during the 6MWT 
(orthotics and assistive devices allowed)  
o No prior history of treatment with SA or MaNAc  
Rationale :   The modified criterion aids in defining the s tudy population, which consists 
primarily of GNE Myopathy subjects who completed the UX001- CL201 Phase [ADDRESS_739490] 200 meters during the 6MWT was an enrollment target for 60% of subjects in the UX001-CL201 protocol.  Since the strongest clinical efficacy signal in the We ek [ADDRESS_739491] tables.  The visit schedule and assessments to be conducted during Part I of the study are presented in Table 2.1.  The visit schedule and assessments to be conducted during Part II of the study are presented in Table 2.2.   
Rationale :  Specific assessments may differ depending on the phase of the study (i.e. Part 
I or Part II).  Evaluations of safety, changes in clinical endpoints such as muscle strength, mobility, and function, PK, and changes in exploratory serum biomarkers will be performed according to the Schedule of Events spe cific to each phase of the study.   
9. Exploratory Efficacy Measures .    
Exploratory efficacy assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Events for Parts I and II of the study ( Table 2.1 and Table 2.2, respectively).  However, 
samples to assess serum protein biomarkers (other than CK) will not be obtained in Part II of the study. 
Rationale:  Results from a panel of serum biomarkers at the Week 24 interim analysis of 
the Phase 2 study (UX001-CL201) were ambiguous.  Therefore, serum protein biomarkers will not be assessed in Part II of the study to avoid subjecting study participants to unnecessary procedures.  CK levels in serum will be assessed in both Parts 
Protocol Number:   UX001-CL202

I and II of the study since a positive, dose- dependent decrease in serum CK levels was 
observed in UX001-CL201. 
10. Safety Measures & Procedures .   
A detailed medical history, including a GNE Myopathy -specific medical history will be 
obtained at the Part II Screening/Baseline Visit for newly enrolled subjects only.  
There are no changes to safety measures, only revised timing of assessments.  
Safety  assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Events for Parts I 
and II of the study ( Table  2.1 and  Table 2.2, respectively).  
Rationale :  For continuing subjects, the Medical History information obtained during the 
UX001 -CL201 study will carry over to the current treatment extension study.  
Similar  information must be obtained for the treatment naïve subjects who will enroll 
directly into Part II of the study.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869].  
Specific language regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been modified as 
follows: 
“If two subjects develop the same unexpected  Grade [ADDRESS_739493] develops an unexpected  Grade 4 AE that is possibly 
or probably related to study drug, enrollment of new subjects will may be  suspended until 
a thorough evaluation can be performed.”  
Rationale :  Interim results following a 24 -week Treatment Period with SA -ER are now 
available and provide a profile of expected AEs; no SAEs have been reported to date in 
the ongoing study.   Should unexpected Grade 3 and 4 AEs occur as detailed above, a full clinical evaluation will performed by [CONTACT_7195], principal investigators, and the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) as detailed in the protocol.  Following the full evaluation, an informed decision can be made whether to suspend enrollment or stop the study.  
Protocol Number:   UX001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739494] information for Ultragenyx (Biosoteria/Dohmen Safety) has been 
updated. 
11. Drug Concentration Measurements.  
Free SA in the urine will be measured in Part I of the study only.  Free SA trough levels will be assessed in serum during Parts I and II of the study.  There will be no assessments of free SA in the urine during Part II o f the study. 
Rationale :  Results of PK assessments at the Week 24 interim analysis of the Phase 2 
study (UX001-CL201) suggest serum SA measurement is more reliable than urine for characterizing trough levels of SA.  Therefore, urine PK parameters will not be assessed in Part II of the study to avoid subjecting study participants to unnecessary procedures.   
12. Statistical Methods.  
An interim analysis will be conducted when the last subject has completed the Month 6 Visit of the Part II Treatment Period.  For Part II efficacy evaluation of the continuing 
subjects, change from baseline of Part II to Month 6 assessment at 12g/day SA- ER/SA -IR 
dose will be determined and compared with the improvement observed during the first 6 months of treatment with 6g/day SA -ER dose and to the rate of change observed with 
placebo or 3g treatments during the first 6 months of the study.  The 10 additional treatment naïve subjects will be evaluated for change from their baseline visit to Month 6 assessment at 12g/day SA -ER/SA -IR dose compared with placebo, 3 g and 6 g treatments 
for 24 weeks in subjects that walk more than 200m at baseline in the 6MWT.  
Rationale :  Changes to the planned statistical analysis are consistent with the modified 
study design to assess the efficacy and t olerability of the higher dose of sialic acid.  
The planned interim analysis following 6 -months treatment with SA -ER/SA -IR will 
provide an initial assessment of safety and efficacy.  If reasonable safety and efficacy are demonstrated, subjects will continue therapy for up to 36 months.  Full details of planned analysis will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan for UX001 -CL202.

TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open -label Phase 2 Extension Study to Evaluate the Long Term Safety and Efficacy of Sialic 
Acid -Extended Release (SA -ER) Tablets and Sialic Acid -Immediate Release (SA -IR) Capsules in 
Patients with GNE Myopathy or Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
UX001-CL202 
STUDY SITES: 
Four sites, globally 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2  
RATIONALE:  
GNE myopathy or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a rare and severely debilitating 
disease caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid (SA).  Substrate replacement of 
SA in an extended release formulation (SA -ER; also termed Ace- ER) is a potential therapeutic 
strategy based on evidence from relevant in vivo  models, supported by [CONTACT_133008] (PK) 
characterization in a Phase 1 clinical study, and stabilization in muscle strength in a Phase 2 
randomized controlled trial (UX001 -CL201) .  The interim data from the Phase [ADDRESS_739495] that administration of immediate release SA (SA -IR) in combination with the SA- ER will 
maximize absorption in the GI tract. Therefore a study testing an increased dose level combining SA-IR with SA -ER was proposed.   
Subjects completing the 48-week study (UX001-CL201) were eligible to continue treatment under this 
open-label extension protocol.  Additional GNE Myopathy subjects have been enrolled to as sess the 
safety and efficacy of SA -ER/SA -IR in a treatment naïve population. 
Ultragenyx is conducting this study (UX001 -CL202) in four parts:  Part I of the study will provide 
additional information on the long -term safety and efficacy of 6g/day SA -ER; Par t II of the study will 
assess the long -term safety and efficacy of 12g/day SA (comprised of 1.5g of SA-ER and 1.5g of 
SA-IR treatment 4 times per day ). Part s III and IV  will provide long -term safety and efficacy data on 
both 6 and 12g/day SA (both SA- ER/SA -IR [Part III] and SA -ER [Part IV]).  Part III was added  based 
on a review of individual subject data for the rollover subjects from the parent study UX001-CL201 at Month 6. The data analysis suggest ed that a small subset  of subjects received an added benefit from 
the higher dose (defined as at least a 15% increase in either the UEC or LEC).  The  rollover subjects 
who met these criteria, along with the ongoing naïve subjects, had the option to remain on the 12g/day 
dose for the remainder of t he study.  Part IV was added to change the formulation from SA- IR to 
SA-ER. The SA -IR dose formulation has been removed based on data showing that by [CONTACT_941] 4
th day of 
dosing in a nonclinical study conducted in dogs, AUC for free SA was similar between the immediate

and extended release formulations. In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in 
the current study confirmed that 12g/day SA -IR did not appear to provide any add itional benefit 
compared with 6g/day SA -ER, although some individual patients may have improved. Therefore, no 
further SA-IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; patients currently on 12g/day may 
continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562728]- ER. 
Patients who elect to decrease from 12g/day to 6g/day may be allowed to do so upon Sponsor 
approval.  
OBJECTIVES:  
 
The safety objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate additional long- term safety of SA-ER treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects previously 
treated with SA -ER at dose of 6g/day (Part I) 
• Evaluate the safety of 12g/day SA (delivered by 1.5g of SA-ER tablets and 1.5g of SA- IR 
capsules 4 times per day) in the treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects (P art II) over a 6 month 
treatment period. 
• Evaluate the safety of SA treatment at both 6g/day and  12g/day (Part III [ SA-ER/SA-IR] and 
Part IV [SA -ER]). 
 
The clinical objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate the long -term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects on muscle strength as 
measured by [CONTACT_35681]-held dynamometry (HHD) 
• Evaluate the long -term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects on mobility, strength, 
and function using a series of physical performance measures  
• Evaluate the long- term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy subjects on functional disability 
using an interview -based questionnaire.  
 The exploratory objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate the effect of SA treatment on serum biomarkers of sialylation in  GNE Myopathy 
subjects (Part I)  
• Determine whether 12g /day SA -ER/SA -IR administered 1.5g/1.5g four times per day is superior 
to prior treatment with SA -ER in GNE Myopathy subjects (Part II) 
o Determine whether a subset of subjects  have additional benefit on the higher dose 
treatment . 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
This open -label extension study of will assess the long -term safety and efficacy of SA  treatment over a 
period of approximately [ADDRESS_739496] meets all eli gibility criteria.  Data collected at the 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739497] will be dispensed a 6 -week supply of 
study drug.  Throughout the Part I Treatment Period of the study, all subjects will continue to take four 500 mg SA-ER tablets orally three times per day (TID), in the morning, early evening, and at bedtime 
(qHS), for a total dose of 6g/day.  The Part I Termination V isit will also serve as the Baseline Visit for 
Part II of the study. 
Beginning with the Part II -Baseline Visit, all subjects currently enrolled in Part I will crossover to the 
SA-ER/SA -IR dosing regimen.  Approximately 10 GNE Myopathy subjects will be enro lled into Part 
II of the study.  The additional subjects will provide an assessment of SA -ER/SA -IR treatment in SA 
naïve subjects able to walk at least 200 meters (and < 80% predicted) in a screening [ADDRESS_739498] (6MWT).    
Evaluations of safety, chan ges in clinical endpoints such as muscle strength, mobility, and function, 
and changes in exploratory serum biomarkers will be performed according to the Schedule of Events 
specific to each phase of the study ( Table  2.1 and Table  2.2).  A Termination Visit will be conducted 
[ADDRESS_739499] dose of study drug  (last dose of study drug received at Month 
36). For subjects who are eligible and choose to participate in the UX001-CL302 open- label extension 
study, the Month [ADDRESS_739500] dose of study drug, as per Schedule of Events. Efficacy data analyses will be conducted at the end 
of the Treatment Period, although interim analyses may be performed at the discretion of Ultragenyx.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on physical examinations, clinical laboratory analyses, and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).  An independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety information periodically an on an ad hoc basis 
as outlined in the DMC charter, which is maintained separately from this protocol.

regimen. The 12g total daily SA -ER dose will be administered by [CONTACT_562734] a TID or QID regimen.  
All doses should be taken with food (i.e. within 30 minutes following a meal or snack). 
DURATION OF TREATMENT : 
The Part I Treatment Period will be up to approximately 12 weeks (3 months) in duration.  The Part II, 
Part III , and Part IV Treatment period s will be up to 36 months in duration.  The total duration of the 
study will be up to 40 mon ths.  
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_562735].  Efficacy assessments 
may differ depending on the phase of the study (i.e. Part I, Part II, Part III, or Part IV ).   For Part I 
efficacy  evaluation, results from the last pre- treatment assessment from UX001 -CL201 will be 
compared with the last post- treatment assessment for the Part I Treatment Period as listed in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table  2.1), with efficacy conclusions based on change since SA- ER treatment 
initiation.   
An interim analysis will be conducted when a majority of subjects have completed the Month 6 Visit 
of the Part II  Treatment Period.  For Part II efficacy evaluation of the continuing subjects, change from 
baseline of Part II to Month 6 assessment at 12g/day SA -ER/SA -IR dose will be determined and 
compared with the improvement observed during the first 6 months of tre atment with 6 g/day SA -ER 
dose, and to the rate of change observed with placebo or 3g treatments during the first 6 months of the 
study.  The changes from baseline of the treatment -naïve subjects will be evaluated over time.   
In addition, changes in muscl e strength over the entire treatment period of subjects who started with 
6g/day and 3g/day will be evaluated and compared to the projected values of subjects who received placebo for the first 24 weeks of treatment in UX001-CL201. 
Clinical Efficacy Measures: 
• Hand -Held Dynamometry :  Muscle strength based on the maximum voluntary isometric 
contraction (MVIC) against a hand -held dynamometer will be measured in the following muscle 
groups: gross grip, pi[INVESTIGATOR_820], shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, elbow extensors, hip abductors, hip 
adductors, hip flexors, hip extensors, knee flexors and knee extensors.  The total force (kg) will be 
measured as well as the percent of predicted normal force based on age, gender, height and weight 
(where applicable).  
• Six-Minute Walk Te st:  The total distance walked (meters) in a six minute period will be 
measured as well as the percent of predicted normal distance based on age and gender.   
• Walking Speed Test :  The time required to walk 25 feet (7.62 meters) will be assessed at a 
comfor table and a maximum gait speed.  The total number of seconds required for each speed will 
be recorded.  Individual subject performance will also be compared to healthy peers based on 
normative data.  
• Weighted Arm Lift Test:  The number of times the subject can raise a [ADDRESS_739501] will be performed bilaterally. 
• HIBM Functional Activities Scale :  The total score, as well as subscale scores for mobility, 
self-care, and upper extremity function on an interview- administered functional disability measure 
will be recorded.

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 8 
Exploratory Efficacy Measures : 
• Serum protein markers:  Serum specimens will be evaluated to assess potential use as biomarkers 
of sialylation.  
• Creatine kinase levels in serum will b e assessed as a potential biomarker for muscle injury  
Safety:  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_11837], including clinically 
significant changes from Baseline to scheduled time points in:  
• Vital signs  
• Neurological and physical examination results  
• Laboratory evaluations 
• Interval history:  reported symptoms of increasing muscle weakness or pain, incidence of falls  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Details of the planned interim analysis, safety and efficacy analyses will be provided in a statistical 
analysis plan maintained separately from this protocol.  
Interim Analysis:  
An Interim analysis will be conducted when a majority of subjects have completed the Month 6 Visit 
during the Part II Treatment period.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
Efficacy data analyses will be conducted at the end of the 6 -month Treatment Period with 
SA-ER/SA -IR, when all subjects have completed 12 months of participation, and at the end of the 
36 month Treatment Period .  The treatment naïve subjects will  be studied as a separate subgroup.  
Clinical efficacy analyses will include:  1) Muscle strength as measured by [CONTACT_35710], and reported as force in kg and percent of predicted normal, 2) Walking ability as measured by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT, and 
reported as distance in meters and percent of predicted normal, 3) Walking speed as measured by [CONTACT_562736], which will be reported in seconds and percent of predicted normal for each 
walking speed, 4) Arm raising ability as measured by [CONTACT_562737], which will  be 
reported  as the total number of completed repetitions, and 5) Functional disability as measured by [CONTACT_562738] -FAS, which will be reported as a total score and subscale scores for mobility, self -care, and 
upper extremity function with lower scores associa ted with greater disability.   
For those clinical evaluations with repeated assessments (i.e., HHD, 6MWT, and the walking speed 
and weighted arm lift tests), the analysis will be performed using a repeated measures analysis.  
A full accounting of the analys es for Part s III and IV of the study will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.   
Safety Analyses:  
All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the safety analysis.  Safety will be evaluated 
on the incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs , and clinically significant change in vital signs, 
laboratory test results, or physical examinations.  Safety data will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_109393].

5 INTRODUCTION 
Sialic Acid -Extended Release (SA -ER, UX001; also termed Ace- ER) is an extended release 
formulation of sialic acid (SA, also known as N- acetylneuraminic acid or NANA) intended 
as a substrate replacement therapy for GNE myopathies.  GNE myopathy, hereditary 
inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV), and Nonaka disease are all different names of the same disorder, which is caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for SA.  For the purposes of this protocol, GNE Myopathy will be used as the term for this disorder.  
Patients with GNE Myopathy cannot produce sufficient SA in muscle tissues; consequently glycoproteins and glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_562715].  In humans, GNE Myopathy is a severe progressive myopathy with onset usually in affected 
patients 18- 30 years of age.  Initial diagnosis is followed by [CONTACT_562743], distal to proximal, which ultimately leads to loss of ambulation in 10 -20 years.  
By [CONTACT_528611], sialylation should be restored on key target glycoproteins and 
glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_562716], improved muscle physiology, and improved clinical function.   
The scientific rationale for this substrate replacement therapy is primarily based on the nature 
of the underlying genetic disease and on the work of Malicdan and colleagues, who demonstrated oral SA replacement therapy can be effective in restoring biochemical function with higher levels of sialylation in a relevant HIBM mouse model (Malicdan et al. 2009 ).  
The improved biochemical function in treated mice resulted in reduced or absent HIBM pathology, prevented clinical signs of muscle disease, and improved survival ( Malicdan et al. 
2009). 
SA has a short half- life in the cir culation.  Rapid clearance makes it difficult to use as a 
therapeutic replacement substrate in which a steady and constant supply of SA is required for 
use in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis.  The SA-ER formulation is expected to provide more stable blood levels of SA without spi[INVESTIGATOR_562717] 24 hour cycle in humans 
when dosed three or four times per day (TID or QID).  Continuous exposure is likely an important step in assuring adequate sialylation during peak periods of synthesis, particula rly 
during the night when maximal muscle growth and repair occur. 
The safety of SA has been evaluated in studies of chronic treatment of HIBM mice and in 
toxicology studies in multiple species of normal animals.  Data from these studies, summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), established a reasonable safety profile for 
SA and allow the determination of a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), setting the stage for the translation of this work to human GNE Myopathy patients.   
The SA -ER formulation was evaluated in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study to assess 
safety and exposure after a single dose and seven days of repeat dosing in SA -deficient GNE 
Myopathy subjects.  Data from this study suggests SA- ER is well tolerated by [CONTACT_562744] 6g/day, and sustained levels of SA in

blood and urine are achieved.  The TID dosing interval is sufficient to maintain trough levels 
of SA above background. 
A Phase 2 randomized, double-blind study has been perform ed to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SA -ER at two dose levels (6g/day and 3g/day) over 
48 weeks, including a 24- week placebo -controlled Treatment Period followed by a 24- week 
Treatment Continuation period on SA- ER.  Interim results  from the 24- week placebo 
controlled Treatment Period implied  a clinical efficacy signal and acceptable safety profile 
suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index by [CONTACT_528613].   Part I of the study will provide treatment contin uation for subjects completing the 
aforementioned Phase 2 study and elicit additional information on the long- term safety and 
efficacy of 6g/day SA -ER.  Part s II, III, and IV of the study will assess the long -term safety 
and efficacy of 12g/day  SA-ER/SA -IR or SA -ER treatment (1.5g/1.5g TID or QID)  and the 
long- term safety and efficacy of 6g/day SA -ER treatment (1.5g TID)  for up to 36 months.   
Ultragenyx is also sponsoring a GNE Myopathy- Disease Monitoring Program 
(GNEM -DMP), a novel registry/natural histor y study to obtain data on the disease 
characteristics of GNE Myopathy and its progression.   
5.[ADDRESS_739512] described by [CONTACT_562745] 1984 in a group of affected 
Iranian Jews in Israel (Argov et al. 1984) .  The patients showed progressive muscle weakness 
and atrophy, and rimmed vacuoles on biopsy.  Since that time, a variety of GNE Myopathy patients have been identified worldwide, including those of Italian, Japanese, Thai, Indian, American and African origin (Huizing et al. 2009) .  The clinical course is similar  among 
these populations, and includes disease onset usually after age 20  years (mean 26 years, 
range 15 –40 years; ( Nalini et al. 2010) ; (Nonaka et al. 2005) ; (Sadeh et al. 1993) ; (Sunohara  
et al. 1989) though it can be symptomatic earlier.  
Patients often have foot drop due to tibialis anterior weakness as a first sign of GNE Myopathy; general weakness is usually more pronounced peripherally, which then 
progresses proximally.  Both weakness and atrophy are noted in muscles, with some fatty replacement infiltration as the disease advances.  In many patients, there is a curious relative sparing of the quadriceps for unknown reasons.  The forearm flexors and axial musculature may become more involved over time.  The rate of progression is gradual and variable between patients over a 10 –20 year period leading to a wheelchair -bound state in a mean of 
12 years ( Nonaka et al. 2005) .  The ocular, pharyngeal and respi[INVESTIGATOR_562718] ( Argov et 
al. 1984).  A representative example of disease progression was chronicled in Japanese 
patients over a decade (Sunohara  et al. 1989) and showed the Medical Research Council 
(MRC) scale of manual motor assessment scores on a five point scale declining over a decade or so in three patients.  Disease progression is not rapid compared with some

myopathies but ultimately the level of function becomes severely compromised and 
equivalent to quadriplegia.  
Other clinical or physiological evaluations of GNE Myopathy patients show a variable 
number of abnormalities, all consistent with the myopathic pathologic process.  Unlike other myopathies, blood creatine kinase (CK) activities are only mildly elevated or remain in the normal range (22/58 patients reported by [CONTACT_562746]- times or higher 
elevations; (Sadeh et al. 1993) ; (Mizusawa et al. 1987) ; (Sunohara et al. 1989) but evaluation 
of CK may still be useful as a marker for GNE Myopathy.  The mouse model of HIBM showed elevated CK levels that improve substantially on treatment ( Malicdan et al. 2009 ).  
The decline in muscle bulk and function is substantial but the time course of decline may be 
sufficiently slow as to not cause acute CK elevations as observed in other disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
Electromyography (EMG) in GNE Myopathy patients is abnormal, with spontaneous 
fibrillations consistent with denervation.  A myopathic pattern (polyphasic muscle unit action potentials [MUAPs]) consistent with denervation is observed, however nerve conduction is generally normal (Sadeh et al. 1993) ; (Mizusawa et al. 1987).  Conducting EMG in clinical 
programs is very difficult as there are substantial difficulties with differences in operators 
and inconsistencies of findings. 
Imaging studies of the muscle by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan ( Sadeh et al. 1993 ); 
(Mizusawa et al. 1987) or magnetic resonance imaging (Huizing et al. 2009) show substantial 
and diffuse abnormalities to muscle structure with significant fat infiltration in affected 
muscles but the quadriceps have more normal appearance (Huizing et al. 2009) .  Many 
muscles have limited muscle tissue left, which could impact the potential for optimal treatment and substantial disease reversal in advanced patients.  
All GNE myo pathies (HIBM, DMRV and Nonaka disease) are caused by [CONTACT_562747] 
(Figure  5.1.1 ).  The GNE gene codes for the bifunctional enzyme glucosamine 
(UDP -N-acetyl) -2-epi[INVESTIGATOR_528587]/N -acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE/MNK) (Eisenberg et al. 
2001) ; (Jay et al. 2009) .  The enzyme is the rate -controlled and regulated first step in the 
biosynthesis of the SA that is required for the complete glycosylation of many glycoproteins and glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. 
Studies in tissues and mouse models have shown that the deficiency of SA production in 
GNE Myopathy is a key factor in the disease state, though the exact pathophysiologic effect of decreased sialylation on glycoproteins or glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_528588].  Sialylation is decreased in the most credible experiments and effects on proteins like neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) or on proteases like n eprilysin, have been proposed ( Malicdan et al.  
2008) ; (Broccolini et al. 2009) .  NCAM is essential for muscle enervation and is 
hyposialylated in GNE Myopathy ( Ricci et al. 2006 ).  The pattern of spontaneous fibrillation 
of denervation in GNE Myopa thy may be consistent with a pathophysiological role for 
NCAM hyposialylation ( Broccolini et al. 2009).  NCAM hyposialylation was used recently 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment 4

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 22 
to identify atypi[INVESTIGATOR_562719] a cohort of 
myopa thy patients (Broccolini et al. 2010) .  Another model involves a hyposialylation effect 
on neprilysin, an endopeptidase for hydrophobic proteins.  The accumulation of unfolded proteins and amyloid is consistent with neprilysin being deficient ( Malicdan et al.  2008).  
When hyposialylated, neprilysin is less stable and less active, potentially leading to the accumulation of unfolded, undigested proteins in vacuoles ( Broccolini et al. 2008).  
Among glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], GM3 is also decreased in GNE Myopathy but the role this glycolipid plays in the biology of the disease is not clear (Paccalet et al. 2010 ).  Even with these 
limitations as to the specific pathophysiological role of sia lylation, analyses of sialylation of 
these muscle components should still be useful in assessing the PD effects of substrate replacement therapy.  
Figure  5.1.1: The Sialic Acid Biosynthetic Pathway 
 
Although no proven pathway for the effect of hyposialylation in GNE Myopathy has been demonstrated conclusively, the pathology and data suggest that some combination of pathophysiologies is likely and that human skeletal muscle is prone to these problems because of normally lower expression levels of GNE/MNK.  In any case, replacement with either N -acetyl -D-mannosamine (ManNAc), which is located downstream of the block in 
GNE/MNK, or SA itself can restore CMP -SA synthesis and subsequent sialylation of 
proteins and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ( Figure  5.1.1).  The GNE/MNK protein may have other functions, but the 
substrate replacement work to date shows that its role in the synthesis of SA is its dominant role in the muscle cell and SA deficiency is at the core of the cause of this disease.

SA as an active ingredient was produced from N -acetylglucosamine using an enzyme 
catalyzed process.  The active ingredient was subjected to a series of nonclinical 
pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted by [CONTACT_11882]; evaluation of the active ingredient also included some data from prior published work on SA toxicology.  The NOAEL for the product was determined to be 2000 mg/kg in dogs and rats.  SA-ER, the 
extended release formul ation of SA to be used in the study, was developed to enhance the PK 
of the product due to its rapid clearance from the body.   
Following clearance of an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission by [CONTACT_24623] 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , a Phase 1 study of SA -ER was conducted.  
Over  a range of single or multiple day doses from 650 - 6,000 mg/day no safety problems 
were identified, and PK analysis showed acceptable absorption of the product with a PK curve that covered about 8-16 hours.  Repeat dosing for one week with dose levels from 1,950-6000 mg/day showed that trough levels could be maintained above the background level, as expected for a sustained release formulation.  
A Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study has been performed  to evaluate the safety 
and PD effects of SA -ER at two dose levels  (6g/day and 3g/day).  The study consist ed of a 
24-week placebo -controlled Treatment Period, followed by [CONTACT_33018] 24- week Treatment

SA (also known as N- acetylneuraminic acid or NANA) intended as a substrate replacement 
therapy for GNE Myopathy, which is caused by a defect in the de novo biosynthesis of sialic acid.  The choice of an extended release formulation is based on the fact that SA has a short 
half-life in the circulation and its rapid clearance makes it difficult to use as a therapeutic 
replacement substrate in which a steady and constant supply of SA is needed.  SA- ER was 
developed to improve the stability of exposure to SA and allow more appropriate dosing and efficient substrate replacement.  
SA-ER 500 mg tablets are white to off-white, uncoated or film- coated, extended release, oval 
tablets that are designed for oral administration.  The tablet formulatio n contains 
approximately 43.3% active pharmaceutical ingredient in a mixed polymer matrix developed for extended release of SA over 24 hours.  Tablets are manufactured by a formulation process using wet aqueous granulation; the blend is then dried and compressed into tablets.  Film- coated tablets are coated with Opadry II, a non -functional aqueous film coating.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739516]. Therefore a study 
testing an increased dose level combining immediate release SA (SA -IR) with SA -ER was 
proposed in Amendment 1. Amendment 2 allows for subjects to receive either 6g/day or 
12g/day based on the data collected and analyzed from  Part II. Refer to Section  7.[ADDRESS_739517] gelatin 
capsules designed for oral administration.  The capsule formulation contains approximately 93.5% active pharmaceutical ingredient.  Manufacturing consists of dry blending followed by [CONTACT_562748].  SA -IR capsules have a fill weight of approximately [ADDRESS_739518] shown that replacement by [CONTACT_562749], improve muscle pathology and function, and restore 
sialylation in muscle (Malicdan et al. 2009) .  The rational basis for the use of SA as a therapy 
in GNE Myopathy is primarily dependent on these results.  Key safety pharmacology, PK, and toxicology studies to support the use of SA in treating GNE Myopathy are summarized below; additional details ma y be found in the IB.   
Safety pharmacology:   Ultragenyx conducted the core battery of safety pharmacology 
studies of SA that are recommended by [CONTACT_16968].  These studies consisted of in vitro human ether-à- go-go-related gene (hERG) channel inhibition , neurobehavior in rats, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_528591].  SA did not show any potential for QT prolongation in the hERG assay at concentrations as high as 6 x 10- 3 mole/L.  There were no adverse effects on neurobehavior in rats or on respi[INVESTIGATOR_562720] 2000 mg/kg. 
PK study in dogs:   Ultragenyx conducted a multiple -dose, cumulative dosing, PK study in 
dogs to assess exposure following administration of SA-ER and the SA- ER/SA -IR treatment 
combination.  Each dog was administered SA-ER (200 mg/kg/day; human dose equivalent 
100 mg/kg/day) TID throughout the study duration (12 days).  Following 4 days of SA- ER 
treatment, SA -IR (100 mg/kg/day) TID was added to SA-ER treatment.  Following 4 days of 
SA-ER/SA -IR treatment, the SA -IR dose was increased to 200 mg/kg/day.  The highest dose 
level of SA -ER/SA -IR was equivalent to a human dose of 200 mg/kg/day.  The area under 
the curve (AUC) during the 8-hr dosing window increased proportionally to the dose of SA-IR, suggesting the administration of SA in extended- release and immediate- release forms 
can improve overall absorption of SA- ER and increase free SA levels up to 3X in the serum.   
Overall SA -ER/SA -IR was  well tolerated in this study.        
Chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs:   In an oral 6-month rat study, there were no 
treatment -related effects on clinical condition, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, clinical pathology (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) and in pathologic evaluations (gross, organ weight, and histopathology).  The no observed adverse

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739519] level (NOAEL) in this study was 2000 mg/kg which is equivalent to approximately a 
17 g daily human dose.  This provides a safety margin of approximately 1.4 –fold over the 
proposed highest dose (12g/day) in the Phase 2 UX001-CL201 Study.  The 9-month oral toxicity study in dogs did not show any adverse effects on clinical condition, body weight, food consumption ophthalmology, electrocardiography, clinical pathology (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) and in pathologic evaluations (gross, organ weight, and histopathology). The NOAEL in this study was 2000 mg/kg which is equivalent to a 60 g daily human dose. This provides a safety margin of approximately 5 –fold over the proposed 
highest dose (12g/day) proposed in the Phase 2 UX001-CL201 Study.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in rats and rabbits:  To date, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity stu dies at oral doses as high as 2000 mg/kg/day 
have not shown any adverse effects on fertility of male or female rats, or treatment -related 
effects on pregnant females  or embryo- fetal development parameters in rats and rabbits.   
5.2.3 Previous Clinical Studies  
Key results from studies to support the use of SA in treating GNE Myopathy are summarized 
below; additional details may be found in the IB.   Phase 1 PK and Safety (UX001-CL101):   “A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of Single and Repeat Doses of Sialic Acid Extended- Release (SA -ER) 
Tablets in Patients with Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM)” .   
The study was conducted in 28 subjects who received single and multiple doses to assess 
the PK and safety of SA -ER.  Subjects received S A-ER tablets orally at one of five dose 
levels in  the single dose phase, and one of four levels in the repeat dose phase.  Each of the 
28 enrolled subjects were sequentially assigned to a specific dose level and received two single -dose exposures at that same dose level (fasted and fed).  The low dose cohorts were 
filled before assigning higher dose cohorts.  The subjects were then assigned to receive one repeat -dose regimen.  The lower dose repeat- dose cohorts are being filled before proceeding 
to higher r epeat -dose levels.   Dose levels are as follows:  
• single doses :  650 mg (n = 6), 1,950 mg (n = 6), 2,925 mg (n = 6), 4,875 mg (n = 4), 
6000 mg (n=6).  
• multiple dosing:  650 mg TID (1,950 mg/day; n = 8), 975 mg TID (2,925 mg/day; n = 8), 
1,625 mg TID (4,875 mg/day; n = 6), 2000 mg TID (6000 mg/day; n = 6). 
Safety evaluations have not shown any significant drug- associated safety problems.  
Preliminary PK analyses show that the drug is absorbed with some variation in humans.  
Multi-day dosing has shown increased and sustained blood levels of free SA over a 24 hour cycle, consistent with expectations for an extended release formulation.

Phase 2 PK, PD and Safety (UX001-CL201):   “A Phase 2 Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Dose and Pharmacodynamic 
Efficacy of Sialic Acid -Extended Release (SA -ER) Tablets in Patients with GNE Myopathy or 
Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy” . 
A Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study has been performed  to evaluate the safety 
and PD effects of SA -ER at two dose levels (3g and 6g/day).  The study consists of a 
24-week placebo -controlled Treatment Period, followed by [CONTACT_33018] 24- week Treatment 
Continuation Period whereby [CONTACT_562750].  A planned analysis was 
conducted following completion of the 24- week placebo -controlled Treatment Period; the 
goal was to identify the dose that provides the best risk-benefit profile.   
Results of planned PK, PD, clinical efficacy, and safety an alyses following the 24- week 
placebo -controlled Treatment Period showed dose-dependent improvement in muscle 
strength relative to placebo, particularly in the upper extremities at the 6g SA -ER dose. 
These changes were statistically significant or trended towards significance, and were more 
pronounced in subjects that had greater walking ability at baseline, a predefined subset.  Other clinical endpoints did not reveal changes at this Week 24 interim assessment.  CK levels showed a trend to improvement in the 6g SA -ER dose group compared with 
placebo.  SA-ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in either dose group.  As expected, the highest dose (6g/day SA-ER) provided a sustained exposure, a clinical efficacy signal, and acceptable safety profile.   
GNE Myopathy-Disease Monitoring Program:   A natural history study collecting data on 
the disease characteristics and its progression is also in progress.   
5.[ADDRESS_739520] 
SA-ER administered alone or with SA -IR does not pose any significant safety risks that can 
be identified at this time.  Toxicology or adverse pharmacology findings were not observed in SA-treated animals; at very high doses, osmotic diarrhea may be observed in treated dogs.  Interim safety results following a 24 -week Treatment Period in a completed  Phase 2 study 
(UX001 -CL201), suggest ed an increase in diarrhea and GI symptoms relative to placebo.  
No correlation was observed between the GI events and fre e SA serum levels suggesting the 
frequency of GI events does not appear to be dose dependent.    
In patients with GNE Myopathy, replacement of the substrate SA has the potential to restore 
normal sialylation of muscle glycoproteins and glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], which could improve the function of muscle and limit the loss of muscle strength.  It is not clear how much the effects of GNE Myopathy are reversible or if and how fast reversal of muscle disease might occur.  The data in the HIBM mouse model suggest that over a one year period, substantial beneficial effects on the pathology of the disease are possible.  However, it is not clear

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739521] comparabl e to that observed by [CONTACT_562751] (IVIG) as a source of SA ( Sparks et al. 2007), then the 
benefit to GNE Myopathy patients in improving muscle strength and function might be substantial.  In clinical studies  conducted to date, the highest dose (6g/day SA-ER) provided 
a sustained exposure, a clinical efficacy signal, and acceptable safety profile.  Overall the risk-benefit ratio appears to be favorable based on the excellent safety record to date, and the 
potential benefit observed in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
5.[ADDRESS_739522] for sialic acid (SA).  Substrate replacement of SA is a potential therapeutic strategy based on evidence from relevant in vivo models, supported by [CONTACT_562752] a Phase [ADDRESS_739523] study showed some efficacy at the 6g dose level but not at 3g, indicating the dose level may be at the low end of the dose response curve.  The interim data implied  a clinical efficacy signal and acceptable safety profile 
suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index by [CONTACT_528613].  Since successful use of SA replacement therapy in humans is b elieved to depend upon 
optimized exposure to the compound, an increased dose was suggested.  Although administration of more extended release tablets could be utilized, data in canines suggests that administration of immediate release SA (SA -IR) in combination with the SA- ER will 
maximize absorption in the GI tract. Therefore a study testing an increased dose level combining SA- IR with SA -ER is proposed. 
Subjects completing the 48- week UX001 -CL201 study are eligible to continue treatment 
under this open- label extension protocol testing an increased dose of SA.  Additional GNE 
Myopathy subjects will be enrolled to assess the safety and efficacy of SA -ER/SA -IR in a 
treatment -naïve population.  Ultragenyx is conducting this study in four parts:  Part I of the 
study will provide additional information on the long- term safety and efficacy of 6g/day 
SA-ER; Part II of the study will assess the safety and efficacy of 12g/day of SA (comprised 
of 1.5 g of SA-ER / 1.5 g of SA- IR treatment QID).  Part III of the study reduces the dose 
from 12g/day to 6g/day for subjects who did not show additional benefit at 12g/day ; 
however, treatment -naïve subjects and a small subset of rollover subjects will be invited  to 
remain on the higher dose of 12g/day (described in  Section  7.2).  Part IV was added to 
change the formulation from SA- IR to SA -ER. The SA -IR dose formulation has been 
removed based on data showing that by [CONTACT_941] 4
th day of dosing in a nonclinical study conducted 
in dogs, AUC for free SA was similar between the immediate and extended release formulations. In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in the current study confirmed that 12g/day SA-IR did not appear to provide any additional benefit compared with 6 g/day SA -ER, although some individual patients may have improved. 
Therefore, no further SA -IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; patients 
currently on 12g/day may continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562728]-E R.

• Evaluate additional long- term safety of SA -ER treatment of GNE Myopathy  subjects 
previously treated with SA-ER at dose of 6g/day (Part I) 
• Evaluate the s afety of 12g  /day SA (delivered by 1.5g of SA-ER tablets and 1.5g of 
SA-IR capsules 4 times per day) in the treatment of GNE Myopathy  subjects (Part II) 
over a 6 month treatment period 
• Evaluate the safety of SA treatment at both 6g/day and 12 g/day (Part III  [SA -ER/SA -IR] 
and Part IV [SA -ER]).   
The clinical objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate the long -term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy  subjects on muscle 
strength as measured by [CONTACT_35681] -held dynamometry (HHD) 
• Evaluate the long -term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy  subjects on mobility, 
strength, and function using a series of physical performance measures 
• Evaluate the long- term effect of SA  treatment of GNE Myopathy  subjects on functional 
disability using an interview -based questionnaire.  
The exploratory objectives of the study are to: 
• Evaluate the effect of SA -ER treatment on serum biomarkers of sialylation in GNE 
Myopathy subjects (Part I)  
• Determine whether 12g/day SA -ER/SA -IR administered 1.5g/1.5g four times per day is 
superior to prior treatment with SA -ER in GNE Myopathy  subjects ( Part II) 
o Determine whether a subset of subjects  has additional benefit on the higher dose 
treatment . 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739524] will be dispensed a 6 -week supply of study drug.  Throughout the Part I 
Treatment Period of the study, all subjects will continue to take four 500 mg SA- ER tablets 
orally three times per day (TID), in the morning, early evening, and at be dtime (qHS), for a 
total dose of 6g/day.  The Part I Termination Visit will also serve as the Baseline Visit for Part II of the study.  
Beginning with the Part II -Baseline Visit, all subjects currently enrolled in Part I will 
crossover to the SA- ER/SA -IR do sing regimen.  A pproximately 10 treatment naïve GNE 
Myopathy subjects will be enrolled into Part II of the study.  The additional subjects will provide an assessment of SA- ER/SA -IR treatment in SA naïve subjects able to walk at 
least 200 meters (and < 80% predicted) in a screening [ADDRESS_739525] (6MWT).   
Throughout the 36- month Part II Treatment Period, all subjects will be administered 1.5g 
SA-ER and 1.5g SA-IR orally four times per day (QID), in the morning, afternoon, early 
evening, and qHS, for a total SA dose of 12g/day.  
Part III of the study reduce s the SA dose from 12g/day to 6g/day for subjects who did not 
show additional benefit at 12g/day at the interim analysis; however, treatment naïve subjects 
and a small subset of rollover subjects who showed a potential efficacy benefit will be 
invited  to remain  on the higher dose of 12g/day. Part III will assess the long -term safety 
and efficacy of 12g/day SA -ER/SA-IR treatment for the duration of the study for the subjects 
who stay on the higher dose in Part III and will provide additional information on the long- term safety and efficacy of 6g/day SA -ER for the remaining subjects.   
Part IV was added to change the formulation from SA- IR to SA -ER. The SA -IR dose 
formulation has been removed based on data showing that by [CONTACT_941] 4
th day of dosing in a 
nonclinical study conducted in dogs, AUC for free SA was similar between the immediate and extended release formulations. In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in the current study conf irmed that 12 g/day SA -IR did not appear to provide any 
additional benefit compared with 6 g/day SA -ER, although some individual patients may have 
improved. Therefore, no further SA- IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; 
patients currently on 12g/day may continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562753]-ER.

Evaluations of safety, changes in clinical endpoints such as muscle strength, mobility, and 
function, and changes in exploratory serum biomarkers will be performed according to the Schedule of Events specific to each phase of the study ( Table 2.1 and Table 2.2).  
A Termination Visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_739526] dose of study drug

the discretion of Ultragenyx. 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory analyses, and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and SAEs.  An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety information periodically an on an ad hoc basis as outlined in the DMC charter, which is maintained separately from this protocol. 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Part I of the study will focus on evaluating the long -term safety of 6g/day SA -ER treatment 
in GNE Myopathy subjects continuing SA-ER treatment as an extension of the 48- week, 
Phase 2 UX001- CL201 clinical study.  Part I of the study will also explore long -term effects 
of SA -ER on clinical measures of muscle strength, mobility, function, disability and 
health -related quality of life.  Exploratory evaluations of the effects of SA-ER on serum 
biomarkers will be performed in Part I of the study only.  
Since Part I of the study is designed as an open -label extension designed to continue SA- ER 
treatment for subjects successfully completing the Phase 2 UX001-CL201 study, the study 
size and population are therefore restricted to said individuals.  In UX001-CL201, safety and efficacy of SA -ER was examined in a randomized, double-blind study at two dose levels and 
compared to placebo treatment control.  The current study design is not powered to assess statistically significant comparisons between treatment groups.  Instead, the study population for Part I is intended to provide additional long- term safety data following maintenance 
treatment with 6g/day SA -ER.   Since all subjects will receive the same treatment, 
randomization or blinding of study drug is not necessary.  
The Week 24 interim data from the Phase 2 UX001-CL201 study implie d a positive PD 
signal and acceptable safety profile suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index 
by [CONTACT_528613].  Therefore, investigation into optimizing the risk- benefit profile 
of SA substrate replacement by [CONTACT_562754].  Part II of the study 
will assess the long -term safety and efficacy of an increased SA dose (total 12g/day)  for up to 
12 months.  In this phase, SA treatment will be in the form of SA- ER tablets and immediate 
release capsules (SA -IR) to maximize absorption from the GI tract based on data obtained 
from nonclinical studies in canines.  Continuing subjects will terminate Part I of the study

following approximately 12 weeks of treatment with 6g/day SA-ER and continue on to 
Part II of the st udy by [CONTACT_562755] 12g/day.  Since Part II 
of the study will be the first time GNE Myopathy subjects will be treated with the SA-ER/SA -IR investigational product, approximately  10 GNE Myopathy subjects will be 
enrolled to assess long -term safety and clinical efficacy of SA -ER/SA -IR in a treatment naïve 
population. 
An interim analysis was conducted after 6 months of treatment with SA -ER/SA -IR; the 
results of this interim analysis have  led to the establishment of Part III of  the study.  Part  III 
will provide long-term safety and efficacy data on both 6 and 12g/day SA.  This change is 
based on a review of individual subject data for the rollover subjects from the parent study UX001 -CL201. The data analysis suggests that a smal l subset of subjects received an added 
benefit from the higher dose (defined as at least a 15% increase in either the UEC or LEC).  The rollover subjects who met these criteria, along with the ongoing naïve subjects, had  the 
option to remain on the 12g/day dose for the remainder of the study. 
Part IV was added to change the formulation from SA- IR to SA -ER. The SA -IR dose 
formulation has been removed based on data showing that by [CONTACT_941] 4
th day of dosing in a 
nonclinical study conducted in dogs, AUC for free SA was similar between the immediate 
and extended release formulations. In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in the current study confirmed that 12 g/day SA -IR did not appear to provide any 
additional benefit compared with 6 g/day SA-ER, although some individual patients may have 
improved. Therefore, no further SA- IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; 
patients currently on 12g/day may continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562728]-ER.  
Patients who elect to decrease from 12 g/day to 6 g/day may be allowed to do so upon Sponsor approval.  
The 36-month treatment duration is intended to evaluate the long- term safety and efficacy of 
SA.  While the lack of a control group may introduce difficulties in discerning natural disease 
progression from treatment effectiveness, due to the progressive debilitative nature of the 
disease, a placebo -controlled study of this duration is not feasible

The majority of the study population will consist of approximately [ADDRESS_739529]

7.4.3 Selection of Doses and Study Duration  
Part I - SA -ER Treatment Period :  In Part I of this Phase 2 open label extension study, 
SA-ER will be administered orally TID for a total dose o f 6000 mg/day  (6g SA -ER).  
The SA-ER dose and regimen for Study UX001-CL202 was selected based on the following 
information: 
• Analyses of SA PK in the Phase 1 study UX001- CL101 indicate that orally administered 
doses of SA-ER at 2000 - 6000 mg/day divided into TID  dosing is effectively absorbed in 
humans, and multiple day dosing at doses up to 6000 mg/day achieves steady, increased 
levels of free SA in the serum with some individual variation. 
• In the Phase 1 study, single oral doses of SA-ER at up to 6g SA -ER and seven days of 
treatment at up to 6g/day have been administered without any significant drug- associated 
safety problems.  
• Malicdan and colleagues have demonstrated that 20 mg/kg/day SA given orally as 
replacement therapy effectively prevented disease i n a mouse model of HIBM ( Malicdan  
et al. 2009) .  Using the allometric scaling method suggested by [CONTACT_55257] (FDA 
Guidance for Industry 2005), the human equivalent dose is 12.5 times higher; a mouse 
dose of 20 mg/kg/day is equivalent to a human dose of 1.6 mg/kg/day.  
• Toxicology studies have identified the NOAEL to be 2000 mg/kg in dogs and rats, far above the proposed human dose level of 6g/day SA -ER in Part I of th e study . 
• TID dosing in conjunction with an extended release formulation is able to achieve steady 
increased levels of SA over the 24 hour cycle. 
• To date, no SAEs have been observed from an ongoing Phase 2 randomized, placebo -controlled study evaluating the  safety and PD effects of 3g/day and 6g/day 
SA-ER.   
Based on these data, the 6g/day total daily dose selected for Part I of the Phase 2 extension 
study is deemed reasonable.  The use of doses above that tested in preclinical mouse models accounts for species -specific differences in absorption and/or biological activity.  Based on 
Phase 1 clinical data, steady state SA levels are achieved with TID dosing:  in the morning, 
early evening, and qHS.  The qHS dose is particularly important to assure coverage dur ing 
the night.   
Part I I - SA -ER/SA -IR Treatment Period :  Successful use of SA replacement therapy in 
humans is believed to depend upon optimized  exposure to the compound.  Interim results 
from the UX001-CL201 study suggest an increased dose of therapy is warranted.  In Part II 
of this Phase 2 open label extension study, 12g SA will be administered orally via 1.5g of 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment 4 
17 June  2016  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 37 
SA-ER tablets and 1.5g SA- IR capsules, QID .  The SA- ER/SA-IR dose and regimen for 
Study UX001-CL202 was selected based on the following additional information: 
• Dose effect at 6g only.  Interim results from UX001 -CL201 suggest the 6g SA-ER dose 
level appears to be at the lower end of the effective range since a clinical efficacy signal 
was observed but 3g SA-ER had almost no effect.   
• The SA level correlates with treatment effect based on HHD.   The Week 24 interim 
data imply a positive PD signal and acceptable safety profile suggesting the potential to optimize the therapeutic index by [CONTACT_528613].   
• Canine studies show that immed iate release most effective way to increase SA.   
Studies in normal canines showed that more than proportional increases in absorption of SA are possible if an immediate release formulation was mixed with an extended release formulation.  The concept is tha t the immediate release product enhances stomach 
absorption which is not well utilized by [CONTACT_562733]. 
• QID therapy should support higher SA levels.   Since SA -IR is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_241625], a QID 
dosing regimen is predicted to provide optimized continuous exposure to SA.  Administration of a 12g total daily dose of SA would therefore be divided into 4 equal doses of 3g each (1.5g SA-ER + 1.5g SA- IR), representing only a 50% increase for each 
dose. 
• Safety of very high SA doses.   In a chr onic toxicology study in rats, the NOAEL was 
2000 mg/kg SA, which is provides a safety margin  of approximately 1.4- fold for the 
proposed 12g/day dose level.  In a 6 month oral toxicity study in dogs, the NOAEL was 2000 mg/ kg SA, which provides a safety mar gin of approximately 5-fold for the human 
12g/day dose level .   
• Single doses of 6g SA- ER given in one dose were well tolerated .  In the Phase 1 PK 
and tolerability study, 6g SA- ER was administered to GNE Myopathy  subjects in a single 
oral dose and was well  tolerated with no SAEs  observed. 
Based  on these data, the 12g/day total daily dose selected for Part II of the Phase [ADDRESS_739539] the administration of SA in extended- release an d immediate -release form can improve overall 
absorption of SA- ER and increase free SA levels in the serum.   Although administration of 
more extended release tablets could be utilized, data in canines suggests that administration of SA -ER/SA -IR will maximize absorption in the GI tract.  
Part III  – 12g/day SA -ER/SA-IR or 6g/day SA- ER Treatment Period :  This change is based 
on a review of individual subject data for the rollover subjects from the parent study UX001 -CL201. The data analysis suggests that a small subset of subjects received an added 
benefit from the higher dose.  The rollover subjects who meet these criteria, along with the ongoing naïve subjects, will have the option to remain on the 12g/day dose for the remainder of the study.

Part IV  – 12g/day SA -ER or 6g/day SA- ER Treatment Period : Part IV was added to change 
the formulation from SA- IR to SA -ER. The SA -IR dose formulation has been removed based 
on data showing that by [CONTACT_941] 4th day of dosing in a nonclinical study conducted in dogs, AUC 
for free SA was similar between the immediate and extended release formulations. 
In addition, a review of population data for Month 12 of Part III in the current study 
confirmed that 12 g/day SA -IR did not appear to provide any additional benefit compared 
with 6 g/day SA -ER, although some individual patients may have improved. Therefore, no 
further SA -IR will be administered after the initiation of Part IV; patients currently on 
12g/day may continue receiving the 12g/day dose, if desired, by [CONTACT_562728]- ER.  
Study Duration:  The maximum treatment duration for Part I of the study will be 12 weeks 
to allow crossover to Part II of the study.  The Parts II, III, and IV  treatment duration s of 
approximately 36 months enables a long- term assessment of the safety and efficacy of 
SA-ER/SA -IR and SA- ER in subjects with GNE Myopathy.

7.5.2 Clinical Efficacy Measures  
The clinical efficacy measures in this study will evaluate muscle strength, mobility and 
function using the evaluations detailed below.  Assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2, respectively).  Portions of the tests may be 
videotaped to monitor test administration and assess for qualitative changes in function (e.g.,  gait).  Subject identity will be protected by [CONTACT_562759](s).  
Refer to the Clinical Evaluator Manual for additional details on clinical efficacy measures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hand- held dynamometry  
In Part I of the study, HHD testing will be performed at the Baseline and Part I Termination 
Visits, to assess muscle strength.  For continuing subjects, the assessment at the Part I Termination Visit will serve as the baseline assessment for Part II of the study.  HHD testing in Part s II, III, and IV of the study will be performed at Baseline (for treatment naïve 
subjects), Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and Termination Visits.  Formal training will be conducted with the licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_562721].  The maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) 
against a dynamometer will be used to measure strength in the following muscle groups:  shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, elbow extensors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip flexors, hip extensors, knee flexors and knee extensors.  A hand dynamometer will be used to assess gross grip strength and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_562722].  Each  effort will last approximately three seconds with a slow build to  a maximum voluntary 
force.  Strength in the elbow flexors and elbow extensors will be measured with the subject lying in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_528595].  Strength in the hip extensors will be measured with the subject leaning over an examinatio n table in a prone position.  All other 
muscle groups will be tested with the subject in a sitting position.  All measurements will be taken bilaterally.  The administrator will attempt to obtain two force values within approximately 15% of each other for each muscle group.  Testing positions may be altered at the discretion of the administrator to improve the reliability of the test.  The total force 
(in kg) will be recorded at the time of test administration.  The highest force value collected 
for each mu scle group will be used for data analysis.  The percent of predicted normal values 
will be calculated after the testing using published normative data (Mathiowetz et al. 1985) ; 
(NIMS 1996) ; (Bohannon 1997b) ; (Bohannon et al. 2006) ; (Peters et al. 2011 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Six Minute Walk Test  
In Part I of the study, the 6MWT ( Solway et al. 2001) will be administered at Baseline and 
the Part I Termination Visits to assess walking ability.  For continuing subjects, the assessment at the Part I Termination Visit will serve as the baseline assessment for Part II of the study.  In Parts II, III, and IV of the study, the 6MWT will be administered at Baseline 
(for treatment naïve subjects), Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, [ADDRESS_739545] in accordance with 
American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines  (ATS 2002).  Blood pressure, heart rate and 
self-reported Borg scale dyspnea and fatigue ratings will be recorded before and after the test

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739546] resting heart  rate of less 
than 120 beats/minute, systolic blood pressure of less than [ADDRESS_739547] administration.  The percent of predicted 
normal values will be calculated after the testing using published normative data (Gibbons et 
al. 2001). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Walking Speed Test  
In Part I of the study, the walking speed test will be administered at Baseline and the Part I 
Termination Visits to assess gait speed.  In Part s II, III, and IV  of the s tudy, the walking 
speed test will be administered at Baseline (for treatment naïve subjects), Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, [ADDRESS_739548], once at a comfortable speed and onc e at a maximum speed.  Subjects will 
be instructed to walk the length of a pre-measured 25 foot (7.62 meter) course.  Traffic cones or tape on the floor will be used to standardize the distance.  Subjects will have a few feet at the beginning and the end of the [ADDRESS_739549] performance relative to peers will be calculated after the testing using published normative data (Bohannon 1997a ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Weighted Arm Lift Test  
In Part I of the study, the weighted arm lift test (Agarwal et al. 2006) will be administered at 
Baseline and the Part I Termination Visits, to assess upper limb function.  In Part s II, III, and 
IV of the study, the weighted arm lift test will be administered at Baseline (for treatment 
naïve subjects), Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, [ADDRESS_739550] administration.

[IP_ADDRESS] HIBM Functional Activities Scale  
In Part I of the study, the HIBM Functional Activities Scale (HIBM -FAS) will be 
administered at the Baseline and Part I Termination Visits, to assess functional disability.  
For continuing subjects, the assessment at the Part I Termination Visit will serve as the baseline assessment for Part II of the study.  Additional HIBM -FAS assessments in Part s II, 
III, and IV of the study will be performed at Baseline (for treatment naïve subjects), Months 
6, 18, 36 and Termination Visits.  The scale is being developed specifically for patients with GNE myopathy (HIBM) based on feedback received from affected individuals on the impact of the disease on their function.  Items in the scale assess the subject’s ability to independently perform various activities of living that involve self-care, mobility and use of the upper and lower e xtremities.  The scale will be administered in an interview format by a 
licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_562723].  
7.5.[ADDRESS_739551] methodology to monitor GNE Myopathy disease.  
Candidate biomarkers present in serum may include: 
• CK levels  
• Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) measured using an ELISA assay and/or 
immunoblot assay to characterize the NCAM types  present.  
• Other biomarkers of muscle injury and remodeling, including MMP9 and microRNAs 
Assessment of serum protein markers will only be conducted in Part I of the study.  In Parts 
II, III, and IV of the study, CK levels will be the only exploratory efficacy measure assessed.   
7.5.4 Safety Measures & General Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
For continuing subjects, the medical history information obtained during the UX001-CL201 study will carry over to this study.  A detailed medical history, including a GNE Myopathy- specific medical history, will be obtained at Screening/Baseline Visit for new 
subjects entering the study (i.e. treatment naïve individuals).  The medical history will solicit information on any prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety.  This medical history should elicit all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries to date.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interval History  
Each interval history is intended to record any signs, symptoms, or events (e.g., falls) 
experienced by [CONTACT_562741](s) performed at prior study visits or study drug.  Interval history may include exacerbation or

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 43 
improvement in existing medical conditions (including the clinical manifestations of GNE 
Myopathy) that might interfere with study participation, safety, and/or positively or negatively impact performance of functional assessments.  Interval history may identify under-reported AEs, and will be collected at the study visits indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Table  2.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).  Vital signs measurements will be performed at study visits indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Table 2.2).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Height and Weight Evaluations 
Measurements of height and weight will be collected on each subject using a stadiometer and a scale by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_562724] t esting.  Height and weight 
data will be used to evaluate each subject’s muscle strength and function using published normative data where available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
In Part I of the study, complete physical examinations will be performed at the Baseline and Part I Termination Visits.  For continuing subjects, findings in the Part I Termination Visit will serve as th e Part II baseline assessment.  In Part s II, III, and IV of the study, a complete 
physical examination will be performed at Baseline (for t reatment naïve subjects), Months 6, 
18, 36 and the Termination Visits.  Physical examinations will include assessments of general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, neurologic systems (at designated visits where a complete neurological examination is not performed ).  
Other  body systems may be examined and symptoms of increasing muscle weakness and 
pain will be recorded.  The presence of changes in muscle pain or weakness should be evaluated carefully by a complete neurologic exam when these changes are reported by [CONTACT_1766].  The specific muscle location and pain should be noted.  Clinically significant 
changes from Baseline will be recorded as AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurological Examination 
In Part I of the study, a neurological examination will be performed at the Baseline and Part I 
Termination Visits.  For continuing subjects, findings in the Part I Termination Visit will serve as the Part II baseline assessment.  In Part s II, III, and IV  of the study, a neurological 
examinations will be performed at Baseline (for treatment naïve subjects), Months 6, 18, 36 and the Termination Visits.  The neurological examination will include assessme nts of 
cognition, cranial nerves, motor function, coordination and gait, reflexes, and sensory function.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent until [ADDRESS_739552] signs the informed 
consent for the open-label extension study, UX001-CL302, whichever occurs sooner.  The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow-up of AEs will be per formed as 
outlined in Section 8.5.  At each visit subjects will be asked about any new or ongoing AEs since the previous visit.  Assessments of AEs will occur at every study visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded at each study visit.  A discussion of concomitant medications is provided in Section  7.4.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2 ).  Female patients with a positive pregnancy test 
at Baseline do not meet eligibility criteria for enrollment and will not be enrolled in the study.  Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have had total hysterectomy, have been in menopause for at least two years, or have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Baseline. 
Additional pregnancy tests will be performed at any visit in which pregnancy status is in 
question.  A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal urine pregnancy test result.  
Experience with UX001 in pregnant women is limited. The study drug may involve risks to a 
pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_435075].  Participants of child‐ bearing 
potential or with partners of child bearing potential who have not undergone a bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]‐ oophorectomy and are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective method 
of contraception as determined by [CONTACT_528634] [ADDRESS_739553] dose of study drug.  Examples of highly effective methods of contraception include oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives, vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier methods, surgical hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation or true abstinence (wh en this is in line with the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject), which means not having sex for the duration specified above because the subject chooses not to.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or Partner  
Pregnancies in subjects or partners must be reported  within [ADDRESS_739554] or partner through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and report the resolution to Ultragenyx or its designee. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the investigator should make every effort to obtain the

female partner’s consent for release of protected health information.  Refer to the Study 
Reference Manual for d etails on the reporting procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy. 
7.5.5 Drug Concentration Measurements  
Blood samples for the measurement of trough levels of free serum SA will be drawn at the time points shown in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and  Table 2.2 ); samples will be 
obtained from the subjects during blood draws for clinical laboratory samples.  Urine  samples for measurement of free serum SA will be collected during Part I of the study 
only.  The time elapsed from the last dose of study drug should be noted.  SA, the active 
study drug in UX001-CL202, occurs naturally in the human body, both through de novo synthesis and via the diet.  Consequently, the free serum SA level should reflect, but will not be a quantitative measure, of circulating study drug.  Refer to the central laboratory manual 
for details on the drug concentration measurements.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_739555] performance measures used in other neuromuscular diseases and 
conditions that cause muscle weakness and impaired function.  Based on the work of Aitkens (Aitkens  et al. 1989), the study will focus on quantitative muscle testing.  The strength of a 
set of muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities will b e assessed by [CONTACT_35710], a form of 
quantitative muscle testing that uses a device with a strain gauge to measure force during a MVIC (Sisto et al. 2007)  .  Walking abil ity will be assessed using the 6MWT test, a 
commonly used test of endurance used in clinical trials for various indications that has served as the basis for many product approvals.   In addition, an interview- based measure designed 
to evaluate disability in GNE Myopathy patients (HIBM- FAS) will be administered in this 
study to further validate the instrument. 
Exploratory measures will attempt to identify changes in serum biomarkers in Part I of the 
study.  Serum NCAM may be evaluated to provide some estimat e of the sialylation of 
NCAM in the regenerating muscle, albeit at low levels in the circulation.  Other biomarkers of muscle injury (e.g., MMP9 and microRNAs) may also be assessed.  However, interim data from the UX001-CL201 study suggests the results may be of limited value; therefore, exploratory serum protein markers will not be assessed in Parts II, III, and IV  of the study.   
Serum CK level will be assessed as a measure of muscle injury throughout the study; a positive dose-dependent decrease in serum CK levels was observed in the UX001-CL201 Week 24 analysis.  Unlike other myopathies, CK activities are mildly elevated or in the normal range for these patients; 22/58 patients reported by [CONTACT_562746]- times 
or higher elevations ( Sadeh et al. 1993) ; (Mizusawa et al. 1987) ; (Sunohara et al. 1989).  
The mouse model of HIBM showed elevated CK levels that improved substantially on 
treatment (Malicdan et al. 2009 ).  Given the modest CK levels in patients, it is unclear if this

is a universally evaluable endpoint in humans, however in the mouse model, the data on 
reduced CK levels during SA treatment was compelling (Malicdan et al. 2009 ).   
The safety parameters to be evaluated in this study include standard assessments such as recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, serum chemistry, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures.  In addition, symptoms of increasing mus cle weakness and pain which are 
characteristic of myopathy will be recorded.  
7.[ADDRESS_739556] and consistent methodology.  The detailed method for analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); the information below is intended as a guide to planned analyses.  
7.6.1 Clinical and Exploratory Efficacy Measures 
The clinical evaluation measures in this study are:  
• Improvement in quantitative muscle strength as measured by [CONTACT_562760] D. 
• Improvement in mobility, strength and gross motor function as measured by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT 
and walking speed and weighted arm lift tests.  
• Improvement in functional disability as measured by [CONTACT_562761] -FAS.  
The exploratory efficacy measures in this study will involve evaluation of novel biomarkers 
of sialylation and muscle injury.  The exploratory efficacy measures may include: 
• Improvement in serum biomarkers of muscle injury, including CK. 
• Improvement in other serum biomarkers of muscle injury, sialylation, and remodeling, 
including MMP9 (metalloproteinase level) and specific microRNAs associated with 
muscle disease.  
Serum biomarkers of sialylation will be evaluated as exploratory analyses in Part I of the study only.  Serum CK levels will be evaluated in Parts I, II, III, and IV of the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy Analyses  
All subjects with any post-dose data will be included in the intent- to-treat (ITT) efficacy 
analysis.   
Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_562735].  Efficacy 
assessments may differ depending on the phase of the study (i.e., Part I, Part II, Part III , or 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment 4 
17 June  2016  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 48 
Part IV ). For Part I efficacy evaluation, results from the last pre -treatment assessment from 
UX001 -CL201 will be compared with the last post- treatment assessment for the Part I 
Treatment Period as listed in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1), with efficacy conclusions 
based on change since SA -ER treatment initiation.  An interim analysis will be conducted 
when a majority of subjects have completed the Month 6 Visit of the Part II Treatment 
Period.  For Part II efficacy evaluation of the continuing subjects, change from baseline of Part II to Month 6 assessment at 12g/day SA- ER/SA -IR dose will be determined and 
compared with the improvement observed during the first 6 months of treatment with 6 g/day SA-ER dose, and to the rate of change observed with placebo or 3g treatment during the first 
6 months of the study.   
The changes from baseline of the treatment -naïve subjects will be evaluated over time. 
Potential comparisons of the changes from baseline to Month 6 will be performed for the 
6MWT, UE, and LE between the naïve group versus the placebo and 6g/day treatment groups for the first 24 weeks of treatments in subjects able to walk more than 200m at baseline.  In addition, changes in muscle strength  over the entire treatment period of subjects 
who started with 6g/day and 3g/day will be evaluated and compared to the projected values of subjects who received placebo for the first 24 weeks of treatment in UX001-CL201. 
A full accounting of the analyses for Pa rts III and IV  of the study will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.   
For those clinical evaluations with repeated assessments (i.e., HHD, 6 MWT, walking speed 
and weighted arm lift tests) the analysis will be performed using a repeated measures analysis.  An exchangeable variance- covariance structure will be used.  The final treatment 
effect estimate based on this model will be the estimated treatment difference at Month 36.  The purpose of including data from assessments prior to Month 36 is to increase the precision of the estimated variance, while using categorical effects of time -by-treatment to 
avoid modeling assumptions.  
Muscle strength as measured by [CONTACT_562762], gender, height and weight (where applicable).  Changes in force and percent of predicted normal force will be assessed for gross grip, pi[INVESTIGATOR_820], shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, elbow extensors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip flexors, hip extensors, knee flexors, and knee extensors.  Individual muscle groups will also be compared to assess individual muscle changes.  
Walking ability as measured by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT will be reported as distance in meters and percent of predicted normal based on age and gender.  Changes in distance and percent of predicted normal will be assessed.  The proportion of subjects with a normal percent predicted distance walked (i.e., a percent predicted distance walked of ≥ 80%) at each time point may be tabulated.  The relationship between 6MWT results and other and efficacy outcomes may also be explored. 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739557] will be reported as the total number of completed repetitions.  Changes from Baseline in repetitions between the treatment arms will be  assessed.  
Functional disability as measured by [CONTACT_562761]- FAS will be reported as a total score and 
subscale scores for mobility, self-care, and upper extremity function, with lower scores associated with greater disability.  Changes in the total score will be assessed.  
7.6.2 Safety Measures  
The safety measures in this study are:  
• Incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs 
• Clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, physical and neurological 
examination findings and laboratory evaluations 
• Interval history, including reported symptoms of increasing muscle weakness or pain, and incidence of falls  
The analyses of safety will include all subjects who receive any study drug at any time during 
the study and provide any post- treatment safety information.  Saf ety data will be periodically 
reviewed by [CONTACT_1363].  
For the safety analysis, the incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs will be evaluated.  All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC), Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, and severity for each treatment group.  A by -subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a SAE, including 
death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876].  The frequency 
and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (i.e., outside of reference ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug 
administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory measurement.  For each clinical laboratory measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for Baseline and all subsequent post-treatment scheduled visits.  Changes from Baseline to the post- treatment 
visits will also be provided.  Descriptive statistics of vital signs, imaging assessments, and concomitant medications will also be provided in a similar manner.  
The SAP will provide additional details on the planned statistical analysis.

• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study 
• Make other recommendations to Ultragenyx concerning continuation, termination or 
other modifications of the study based on their observations of the study. 
7.6.4 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 46 subjects may be enrolled in Part I of this open-label extension study.  
Sample size is limited to the number of subjects enrolled in the Phase 2 safety and efficacy study, UX001 -CL201.  As Part I of the study is intended to evaluate of the long- term safety 
of 6g/day SA-ER in subjects with GNE Myopathy, and ascertain the long- term effect of 
SA-ER treatment on muscle strength, mobility, and functional disability, the sample size is 
deemed reasonable to satisfy Part I study objectives.   
Approximately 10 treatment -naïve subjects will be enrolled into Part II of the study.  
This subset of treatment naïve GNE Myopathy subjects will provide additional safety and 
efficacy informatio n following treatment with SA -ER/SA -IR. 
The study design is open- label with all subjects receiving the same treatment.  Therefore, the 
study is not powered to assess statistically significant comparisons.  Instead, the sample size is intended to provide the maximum amount of long -term safety and efficacy data for the 
investigational product.

Following the close-out of the study, all unused study drug must be returned to Ultragenyx and/or its designee unless other instructions have been provided for final disposition of the study drug.  
8.[ADDRESS_739567].  A validated electronic data capture (EDC) system w ill be used for entry of the data 
into electronic CRFs.  Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by [CONTACT_11881].  All information recorded on CRFs for this study must be consistent with the subject's source documentation. 
Initial data entry a nd any changes to the data will be made only by [CONTACT_11882]-authorized 
users, and data entries and changes will be captured in an electronic audit trail.  
An explanation of any data change should be recorded in the CRF.  All data entered in to 
the CRF must be verifiable; therefore, CRFs will be routinely checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records by [CONTACT_11881].  The investigator must allow direct access to all source documents.  
8.4.2 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_11883]/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines.  Ultragenyx's  designated representative (the monitor) will contact [CONTACT_562764].  The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the investigator's qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, including proof of IRB/EC review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency 
with source documents including progress notes, laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or uninterruptable data will be resolved in coordination with the investigator.  
The monitor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory requirements.  Any a dministrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact [CONTACT_35716] e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and/or mail.  The investigator and all other site personnel agree

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 54 
to cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve 
any and all questions raised and any and all issues identified by [CONTACT_2037]. 
The investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/EC, and/or Ul tragenyx or its 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least two years after the last approval of a marketing  application or for at least two 
years after clinical development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The investigator is required to guaranty access to these documents and to cooperate with and support such audits and inspections. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_739568] with retention should the Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_739569] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Life-threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction is an  AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, in the view of either the investigator or Ultragenyx, places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment 4 
17 June  2016  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 55 
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. , for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. 
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE.  
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, m oderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require 
therap y or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening  (Grade 4):  Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death 
or are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death. 
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and "severe," whic h are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of r elatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same 
as "serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated 
Protocol Number:  UX 001-CL202  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_739570]'s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. 
• Not Related:   This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, another cause of the 
event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the exposure to study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
• Possibly Related:   This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Probably Related:   This category applies to an AE that is likely related to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  That is, the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a known or suspected pattern of response, and is strongly associated with study drug exposure. 
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting  to Ultragenyx 
[IP_ADDRESS] General  
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on the AE eCRF via the EDC system. The Principal In vestigator is responsible for evaluating all 
AEs, obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
All AEs will be collected fr om the time the subject signs the informed consent through 
[ADDRESS_739571] a 
comment in the source document by [CONTACT_528639], recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements 
for Immediate Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported within [ADDRESS_739572]'s treatment assignment or dosage. The reporting requirement for SAEs is from the time of signing of the ICF  through [ADDRESS_739573] notify the IRB/EC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, as soon as is practicable and in accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local law. A copy of this not ification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.     
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Reporting  
The regulations governing clinical studies state that the sponsor and investigator are required to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the Ethics Committee (EC) is notified at the same time.”  The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_739574] dose of study drug. Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures to Ultragenyx within  24 hours.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), Ethics Committees, and Investigators as per local laws and 
regulations. Fatal and life- threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_739575] knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_739576] knowledge of the event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX001 , major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within 
the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_739577] dose of study drug. 
The investigator will notify the IRBs/Research Ethics Boards (REB)/ECs of SAEs and urgent 
safety matters, in accordance with IRB/REB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designe e.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic s ummary reports to 
Regulatory Authorities and Ethics Committees, as per local laws and regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or Partner  
Pregnancies in subjects or partners must be reported within [ADDRESS_739578]’s partner, while participating in the study, will 
be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information. Pregnancy -associated SAEs will be processed and submitted, as necessary, as per the 
S[LOCATION_003]R reporting process ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).

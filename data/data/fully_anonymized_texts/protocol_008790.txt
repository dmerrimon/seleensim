1.1. Synopsis  
Sponsor:  EmbarkNeuro  
Study Title:  A Phase 2 Study of ANC -501 in the Treatment of Adults with Major Depressive Disorder  
Protocol Number:  ANC501D0005  Phase of Development:  [ADDRESS_245050]:  ANC -501 Capsules  
Study Design and Duration:  This is a single -arm, open- label Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of ANC -501 oral capsules as adjunctive treatment in 
subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).  
With the exception of subjects permitted to use current stable antidepressant treatment, initiation of psychotropic medications and other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day [ADDRESS_245051] data on 
biometrics, which may be used for exploratory analyses.  
Subjects will receive 50 mg ANC -501 Capsules (5 × 10 mg capsules) orally once daily at 
least [ADDRESS_245052] dose 
administered in the clinic on Day 1 and will return to the clinic for scheduled visits on 
Days 8, 15, 29, 43, and 56. F ollow -up visit s will occur on Day 70 and 112. All visits after 
Day 1 allow a visit window of ±3 days. 
Total duration of participation is 20 weeks  (up to 30 days screening, 8 weeks dosing, 8 
weeks follow -up). 
The following is a n overview of study procedures/ assessments  (refer to the Schedule of 
Events [ Section  1.3] for specific procedures/ assessments and  their timing, with further 
details located in  Section  
8): 
Screening Period (Day -30 to Day -1) 
After providing informed consent, eligibility assessments will include review of 
demographics, medical history, prior/concomitant medications, full physical examination, 
vital sign assessments, body weight/height/body mass index ( BMI ) measurements, urine 
pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential), urine drug and alcohol breath 
test screen, safety laboratory tests  (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis) , hep atitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen, and plas ma, urine  
and saliva  cortisol collection . 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 – Clinical Trials Version (SCID -5-CT) will 
be employed for the determination of MDD and will be performed by a qualified, trained, 
validated healthcare professional.  
Qualified staff will also complete the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A), Clinical Global Impression -Severity 
(CGI -S), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire (CTQ).  
Ophthalmic exams, including slit- lamp imaging, may be performed by [CONTACT_205496] [INVESTIGATOR_205467]. However, a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist must oversee this

[ADDRESS_245053] eligibility as per inclusion criteria #[ADDRESS_245054] and the qualified central rater will be scheduled to allow the 
rater to administer the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135426] (MGH ATRQ) for assessment of current antidepressant therapy (ADT), 
adequacy of duration and dose of prior and current ADT, as well as degree of 
improvement, to ensure only patients with inadequate response (<50% improvement) are 
included. The central rater will also complete the MADRS assessment and SAFER inventory (State vs trait, A ssessability, Face and Ecological validity, Rule of 3Ps  
[pervasive, persistent, and pathological] ) for confirmation of eligibility (diagnosis, severity, 
and treatment history). Results will be communicated to the site prior to Day 1.  
No changes to medications  are allowed during the screening period, a nd screen ing can be 
less than 30 days if all other criteria are met . 
 
Treatment Period (Day s 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 56 ) 
At the Day [ADDRESS_245055].  
During visits, safety procedures/assessments and administration of assessments/scales (including from Day [ADDRESS_245056], the Clinical Global Impression- Improvement [CGI- I] and 
the Patient Global Impression of Improvement [PGI -I]) will be c onducted. During specific 
visits, PK blood samples will be collected, as well as b lood samples for future exploratory 
biomarker and genetic analysis . Concomitant  medications and dosing diary will be 
reviewed, the dosing diary will be returned to the subjec t, and adverse events (AEs) 
recorded. At all visits after Day 1, recording/accounting for any returned/unused ANC -[ADDRESS_245057].  
At home activities  
Subjects will take study medication every morning (at least [ADDRESS_245058]) , make entries into  the dosing diary,  and wear their watch -like device  
throughout the day and night except when charging. Subjects will also complete 
EMA orienting questions,  the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (6 -item) 
(HAMD- 6) and the  General Anxiety Disorder (7- item) (GAD -7) twice a day for 
three days per week , and the Short Form -Health Survey (36 -item) (SF -36) weekly  
using the EMA Wellness smartphone/tablet application.  
At the Day 43 visit, s tudy site personnel will dispense equipmen t and retrain subjects on 
the 12-hour urine collection to measure cortisol levels (the collection will be returned to the 
site at the Day  56 visit) . On Day 54, the site will contact  [CONTACT_205497] 55.  
At the Day [ADDRESS_245059] study medication and visit the site to return 
their 12-hour urine collection,  all remaining medication , the dosing diary,  and wearable 
watch -like devices . Study procedures/assessments will be conducted, including an 
ophthalmic exam  and slit lamp  imaging  of the lenses of both eyes . Images  will be sent to a 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol

2.1. Major Depressive Disorder  
Depression is ranked as the leading cause of disability worldwide by [CONTACT_67848].1 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder that is characterized 
by [CONTACT_205505][INVESTIGATOR_1841], along with an absence of any 
history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. It is a serious, often recurrent medic al 
condition, which is associated with a 15.9% lifetime risk of suicide attempt.2 Results of the 
World Mental Health Survey Initiative (2011) found that the average lifetime incidence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition ( DSM -IV) major 
depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_149494] 14.6%, with a 12-month prevalence of 5.5% in higher income counties .
3 
Similarly, the National Comorbidity Survey -Replication4 found the incidence of depression to be 
6.6% over 12-months, with a 16.2% lifetime incidence. In addition to the high mortality rate due 
to suicide, depressed patients are more likely to develop coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.
5 
Current treatments available for depression include psychotherapy (for mild depression), antidepressant medications, a combination of medication and psychotherapy (for mild- to-
moderate depression), and electroconvulsive therapy (moderate- to-severe depression). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_205474] (e.g., monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] [SNRIs]), there remains an unmet need for the pharmacological treatment of 
MDD. With currently available medications, alleviation of depressive symptoms is often not 
observed until several weeks of treatment have been received. Even after an adequate duration of treatment, the most commonly used treatments today (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs) only result in 
approximately 35% to 45% of patients achieving clinical remission.
6 Approximately 30% of 
patients are resistant to a series of treatments according to STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment 
Alternatives to Relieve Depression) stud y.[ADDRESS_245072] of the hypothalamus- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis, which appears to be 
a prominent mechanism by [CONTACT_205506], including adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. In addition, both corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF) 
and arginine vasopressin (AVP), both of which are produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus8,[ADDRESS_245073] attracted much attention as potential targets for the treatment of depression and anxiety. 
ANC-501 is an investigational new drug with antagonistic activity of the vasopressin receptor 1b 
(V1b receptor), which plays a role in the modulation of stress and mood. Based on nonclinical 
studies conducted, ANC-501 appears to be a promising candidate for clinical development with 
a novel mode of action that may benefit MDD patients. 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -501  ANC501D0005  
03 March 2023 Version 6.0  Confidential  Page 29 of 63 2.2. Mechanism of Action of Vasopressin Receptor 1b (V1b Receptor)  
Arginine vasopressin, a cyclic nonapeptide, together with CRF, are principal factors in the 
regulation of ACTH release from the anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] ,[ADDRESS_245074] been reported to play an 
important role in mood regulation. Arginine vasopressin is synthesized in the parvocellular 
division of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is linked to activation of the 
HPA axis, and upon stress exposure, AVP is released from the median eminence into the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_205475], where it strongly potentiates the effects of CRF on the release of ACTH. Clinically, the plasma AVP levels are elevated in patients with major depression, 
compared with healthy controls.
10,11 In previous studies, subjects with melancholic-type or 
anxious-retarded depression exhibited elevated plasma AVP levels. Plasma AVP levels are also 
reportedly positively correlated with cortisol levels during depression, particularly in suicide 
victims .12 Moreover, the quantities of AVP-immunoreactive neurons and AVP messenger RNA 
(mRNA) in the paraventricular nucleus are increased during depression,13,14 particularly in 
subjects in the melancholic subgroup,13 and pi[INVESTIGATOR_205476].15 The involvement of the AVP system in anxiety disorders has also been 
suggested. 
AVP exerts its effects via three receptor subtypes: V 1a, V1b, and V 2. These subtypes are G -protein 
coupled receptors.[ADDRESS_245075] with high affinity and potent 
antagonistic activity for the V 1b receptor ,18 has been reported to attenuate increases in 
plasma  ACTH induced by [CONTACT_57633]-releasing hormone ( CRH )+AVP ,[ADDRESS_245076] of V 1b receptor in both in vitro and in vivo studies 
and has been shown to possess antidepressant activity in several animal models of depression, 
including one which mimics severely impaired HPA axis function. 
2.3. Rationale for Targeting V1b Receptor in Treatment of Depression  
A series of in vitro studies was conducted to define  the affinity of ANC-501 to the V 1b receptor, 
as well as a battery of in vivo studies to characterize the efficacy profile in MDD and its 
anxiolytic- like potential in animal models.  
During in vivo rat studies, the immobility time in the forced swimming tes t and the 
hyperemotionality in a rat olfactory bulbectomy model, both of which are indicative of depressive states, were each significantly reduced by [CONTACT_205507] -501. In the olfactory 
bulbectomy model, ANC-501 exhibited efficacy following chronic treatment for 14 days, as did 
fluvoxamine. In addition, ANC-501 significantly improved depressive-like behavior induced by 
[CONTACT_205508], a depression model which has been reported to be resistant to fluvoxamine and imipramine ,
21 indicating that ANC -501 may be effective for patients with 
severely impaired HPA axis function. In an anxiety model (social interaction behavior in rats), ANC -[ADDRESS_245077] may be useful in the treatment of MDD with co-morbid anxiety 
disorders. 
2.3.1. Evaluation in Humans  
Three Phase 1 studies (a single ascending dose [SAD] study [TS121-US101], a multiple 
ascending dose [MAD] study [TS121-US102], and a PET receptor occupancy study 
[TS121-US103]) and one Phase 2 study (TS121-US201) have been conducted in the Unit ed 
States .  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicate that f ollowing single and multiple oral administration of 
ANC -501, increases in plasma ANC-501 peak and total exposures ( maximum plasma 
concentration [C max] and area under the concentration- time curves [ AUCs ]) were observed with 
increases in dose. ANC -501 reached C max within 4 hours after dosing and declined with apparent 
half-life ( t½) of approximately [ADDRESS_245078] was observed on AUCs of ANC-501, 
while C max was red uced under fed conditions. In the MAD study, the plasma trough 
concentrations of ANC-501 appeared to reach steady state by 5 days after dosing and the exposures accumulated to approximately 2 times. Low renal clearance (CL
r) suggested minimal 
contribution of the urinary excretion of ANC-501. Though two metabolites (M5 and M9) were 
found in plasma, the unchanged form was proposed as a predominant component. In addition, 
PET study revealed the relationship between plasma exposure of ANC-501 and V 1b receptor 
occupancy in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]. 
Overall, 78 healthy and 32 adult subjects with MDD were administered ANC -501 to date. In the 
Phase 2 study, there was no statistically significant difference observed in the primary endpoint 
(Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating S cale [MADRS] Change from Baseline to Week 
6positive trends were observed for the scores of depression scales in ANC-501 treated groups 
(10 mg and 50 mg) versus placebo. The lack of statistical significance may be attributable to the 
small number of subjects enrolled. 
Safety Findings in Clinical Studies  
A top dose of 50 mg for 6 weeks  was deemed safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths or 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported in any of the studies. No safety trends were observed in 
clinical laboratory,  electrocardiogram ( ECG ), vital signs, physical examinations, or cardiac 
telemetry. In consideration of the nonclinical findings at the time of the MAD study, comprehensive eye examinations were performed. In Phase 2a study, eye examinations with a standardized lens opacity grading scale (Lens Opacities Classification System III [LOCS III]), 
were conducted to evaluate this risk in the study. Increase from baseline in the LOCS III grade of 
≥0.5 (Nuclear Opalescence [NO]), ≥0.8 (Cortical) or ≥0.5 (Posterior S ubcapsular), or changes 
considered to be clinically significant as per the ophthalmologist or optometrist , were defined in 
the protocol as events of clinical significance. Two events of lenticular opacities were reported in Phase 2a study TS121-US201 in patients dosed with ANC-[ADDRESS_245079] actual 
change in lens opacity but rather intra-observer variability. The I nvestigator rated the event as 
mild in intensity and considered it to be not related to the study drug. The second patient had an increase of NO score from baseline at visit 6 in the unilateral (right) eye of 0.[ADDRESS_245080] posterior polar or cortical changes. Further, the LOCS III scoring ha s a standardized range for NO from 1 –6, with [ADDRESS_245081], intra -grader 
variability likely accounted for these changes, as noted by [CONTACT_205509]. 
In the Phase 2 study, there was no statistically significant difference observed in the primary endpoint ( Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [ MADRS ] Change from Baseline to 
Week 6), although positive trends were observed for the scores of depression scales in ANC -501 
treated groups (10 mg and 50 mg) versus placebo. The lack of statistical significance may be 
attributable to the small number of subjects enrolled.  
In conclusion, these re sults suggest that ANC -501 (ANC -501) may be useful for the treatment of 
patients with MDD.  
2.4. Risk/Benefit  
Three Phase 1 studies, a SAD study (TS121- US101), a MAD study (TS121- US102) and a PET 
receptor occupancy study (TS121- US103), and one Phase 2 study in M DD (TS121 -US201) have 
been conducted in the US. Overall, 78 healthy male and female adult subjects and 32 adult 
subjects with MDD were administered ANC -501 to date. A top dose of 50 mg for 6 weeks was 
deemed safe and well -tolerated. There were no deaths or  SAEs reported in any of the studies. All 
events across trials were either mild or moderate in intensity. Moreover, no safety trends were observed in clinical laboratory, ECG, vital signs, physical examinations, or cardiac telemetry. 
In consideration of th e nonclinical findings (rat) at the time of the MAD study, comprehensive 
prospective slit lamp examinations were performed in the P hase 2 trial. Two events of lenticular 
opacity were reported as clinically significant by [CONTACT_205510] S III rating 
scale in 2 subjects (1 event each) in the 50 mg group. These events were rated as mild i n 
intensity , were not accompanied by [CONTACT_205511], and did not require treatment. One 
was judged as “possibly related” and the other was judged as “not related” to ANC 501. While Study TS121- US201 was not enrolled to completion, patients treated with ANC -501 in 
combination with their underlying antidepressant showed numerical improvement compared to 
placebo. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action of ANC -501, those patients with 
elevated baseline 12 -hour urine cortisol concentration showed substantially larger separation 
from placebo at the end of 6 weeks in both dose groups tested. In the case of the high cortisol 
50 mg sub- group, these di fferences continued to increase throughout the follow -up period.

4.1. Overall Design  
This is a single -arm, open-label Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics 
(PK), and efficacy of ANC -501 oral capsules as adjunctive treatment in subjects diagnosed with 
major depressive disorder (MDD).  
With the exception of subjects permitted to use current stable antidepressant treatment, initiation 
of psychotropic medications and other medications that may potentially have an impact on 
efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day [ADDRESS_245083] data on biometrics, which may be used for exploratory analyses. 
Subjects will receive 50 mg ANC -501 Capsules (5 × 10 mg capsules) orally once daily at least 
[ADDRESS_245084] dose administered in the clinic on Day 1, and will return to the clinic for scheduled visits on Days 8, 15, 29, 43, and 56. 
Follow-up visits will occur on Day 70 and 112. All visits after Day 1 allow a visit window of ±3 
days. 
Total duration of participation is 20 weeks (up to 30 days screening, 8 weeks dosing, 8 weeks 
follow-up). 
The following is an overview of study procedures/assessments (refer to the Schedule of Events 
[Section  1.3] for specific procedures/assessments and  their timing, with further details located in 
Section  8): 
Screening Period (Day -30 to Day -1) 
After providing informed consent, eligibility assessments will include review of demographics, 
medical histor y, prior/concomitant medications, full physical examination, vital sign 
assessments, body weight/height/body mass index ( BMI ) measurements, urine pregnancy test 
(for female subjects of childbearing potential), urine drug and alcohol breath test screen, safety laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), hepatitis and 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen, and plasma and saliva cortisol sample collection . 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 – Clinical Trials Version  (SCID -5-CT) will be 
employed for the determination of MDD and will be performed by a qualified, trained, validated healthcare professional.  
Qualified staff will also complete the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), 
Hamilton Anxiety R ating Scale (HAM -A), Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI- S), 
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire 
(CTQ).  
Ophthalmic exams , including slit- lamp imaging,  may be performed by [CONTACT_205512] [INVESTIGATOR_205479]. 
However, a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist must oversee this work and will make the 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -[ADDRESS_245085] eligibility as per inclusion criteria #4.   Slit lamp imaging of the lens of 
both eyes will be taken and sent to a central reader for assessment using the LOCS III 
classification . 
Study site personne l will dispense equipment for [ADDRESS_245086]  and the qualified  central rater will be scheduled to allow the rater  to 
administer the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135426] (MGH ATRQ) for assessment of current antidepressant therapy (ADT), adequacy 
of duration a nd dose of prior and current ADT, as well as degree of improvement, to ensure only 
patients with inadequate response (<50% improvement) are included. The central rater will also 
complete the MADRS assessment and SAFER inventory (State vs trait, Assessability, Face 
and Ecological validity, Rule of 3Ps  [pervasive, persistent, and pathological] ) for confirmation of 
eligibility (diagnosis, severity, and treatment history). Results will be communicated to the site prior to Day 1.  
No changes to medication s are allowed during the screening period, and screening can be less 
than 30 days if all other criteria are met .
 
Open -Label Treatment  Period  (Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 56)  
At the Day [ADDRESS_245087].  
During visits, safety procedures/assessments and administration of assessments/scales (including 
from Day [ADDRESS_245088], the Clinical Global Impression- Improvement [CGI -I] and the Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement [PGI -I]) will be conducted. During specific visits, PK blood samples 
will be collected, as well as blood samples for future exploratory biomarker and genetic analysis. Concomitant medications and dosing diary will be reviewed, the dosing diary will be returned to 
the subject, and adverse events (AEs) recorded. At all visits after Day 1, recording/accounting 
for any returned/unused ANC -[ADDRESS_245089].  
At home activities  
Subjects  will take study medication every morning (at least [ADDRESS_245090]) , 
make entries into  the dosing diary, and wear their wearable watch -like device throughout the 
day and night except when charging. Subjects will also complete  EMA orientin g questions , 
the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (6 -item) (HAMD -6) and the General Anxiety Disorder 
(7-item) (GAD -7) twice a day for three days per week, and the Short Form -Health Survey 
(36-item) (SF -36) weekly
 in the EMA Wellness smartphone/tablet application . 
At the Day 43 visit, study site personnel will dispense equipment and retrain subjects on the 
12-hour urine collection to measure cortisol levels (the collection will be returned to the site at 
the Day  56 visit). On Day 54, the site will contact  [CONTACT_205513] 55.  
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -[ADDRESS_245091] study medication and visit the site to return their  
12-hour urine collection, all remaining medication , the dosing diary, and wearable watches. 
Study procedures/assessments will be conducted, including an ophthalmic exam and  slit lamp 
imaging of the lenses of both eyes . Images  will be sent to a central reader for assessment using 
the LOCS III. Collection of plasma and saliva cortisol samples will also be conducted.   
The same rater should perform the CGI-S, CGI-I, and MADRS assessments throughout the study 
on a given subject when possible. 
Follow-up Period (Day 70 and Day 112) 
Subjects will return to the site for a follow-up visit on Day 70 and Day 112. Study 
procedures/assessments will be conducted, including an ophthalmic exam and slit lamp imaging 
of the lenses of both eyes. Images  will be sent to a central reader for assessment using the LOCS 
III. Concomitant medications will be reviewed, and Ae s reco rded. 
4.2. Justification for Dose  
ANC -501 dose selection was based on accumulated experience from preclinical studies 
and previous clinical trials. The SAD study (TS121-US101) and MAD study (TS121-US102) 
provide safety and tolerability support for the current doses. A PET receptor occupancy study 
(TS121-US103) provides rationale for doses of 10 mg and 50 mg orally once daily. From results 
of the PET receptor occupancy study, 10 mg and 50 mg doses were modeled to provide 
approximately 55% and 75% receptor occupancy, respectively. In the Phase 2 study (TS121-US201), the [ADDRESS_245092] has completed  the final  scheduled 
procedure shown in the Schedule of Events  (Section  1.3).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting and Evaluation of Laboratory Test Results  
Adverse event s will be collected from the first dose of ANC -501, therefore the screening 
laboratory results are considered ba seline. All laboratory test results ( except for those at 
screening , which are considered baseline) must be reviewed for clinical significance by [CONTACT_3786]. Laboratory test results outside the normal range (hematology, coagulation, 
chemistry, urinalysis) that worsen in  severity  from baseline and are deemed  clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_205518]. A  new laboratory abnormality resulting in study 
drug interruption, dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, intervention, or otherwise having an 
impact  on the subject  should be reported as an AE, unless it is part of a  clinical diagnosis already 
reported as an AE.  
All laboratory values outside the normal range are to be evaluated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Repeat Testing  
Repeat testing of any clinically significant laboratory test will be  performed  until the value 
returns to within the normal range, returns to the baseline level, or  clinically stabilize s.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidance to provide general 
considerations to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of study participants, maintaining 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and minimizing risks to trial integrity d uring the 
coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) public health emergency. It is recognized that the 
COVID- [ADDRESS_245110] or 
adhering to protocol -mandated visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing. Protocol modifications 
may be required, and there may be unavoidable protocol deviations due to COVID -19 illness 
and/or COVID -19 public health control measures. EmbarkNeuro, or its affiliated clinical 
research organizations ( CROs ), representatives, and clinical sites may need to make decisions 
regarding continuing study recruitment, continuing use of the investigational product for subjects 
already participating in the study, and the need to change subject monitoring during the study. 
EmbarkNeuro  acknowledges that it is critical that study subjects  are kept informed of changes to 
the study and monitoring plans that could impact them. EmbarkNeuro , following consultation 
with clinical investigators and Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ), may determine that the 
protection of a subject’s  safety, welfare, and rights is best served by [CONTACT_205519] a subject  in the 
study as per the protocol or  by [CONTACT_205520]. In addition, home health services may be utilized in this study per FDA guidance to enable subjects  to remain on study and have testing performed 
per the protocol. It is generally the practice of EmbarkNeuro  to implement protocol changes only 
after review and approval by [CONTACT_1201], and in some cases, by [CONTACT_1622]. EmbarkNeuro or its 
affiliated CROs and clinical investigators will engage with IRBs as ea rly as possible when urgent 
or emergent changes to the protocol or informed consent are anticipated as a result of COVID- 19. Such changes to the protocol or investigational plan to minimize or eliminate 
immediate hazards or to protect the life and well- being of research subjects  (e.g., to limit 
exposure to COVID -19) may be implemented without IRB approval or before filing an 
amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND)  application , but will be reported afterwards. 
These considerations are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID -19. 
8.4. Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Safety 
Reporting  
8.4.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
AE Definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product  and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  
treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a treatment , whether or not related to the treatment. 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -501  ANC501D0005  
03 March 2023 Version 6.0  Confidential  Page 49 of 63 [IP_ADDRESS]. Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Laboratory test results outside the normal range (hematology, coagulation, clinical 
chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, vital signs measurements, 
questionnaires), including any that worsen in severity  from baseline, which are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and  scientific judgement of the Investigator. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition resulting in an increase 
in severity . 
• Condition detected or diagnosed that is new in onset or increased in severity from the 
baseline condition. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention-intervention interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an AE, but it may result in an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Defin ition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_85834]’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the patient’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). The condition tha t leads 
to the procedure is the AE. 
• Pre-planned medical or surgical procedures, or pre-planned treatments or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205487]. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at  the start of the study that do not worsen in severity . 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -501  ANC501D0005  
03 March 2023 Version 6.0  Confidential  Page 50 of 63 8.4.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death 
2. Is life -threatening  
• The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypot hetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205488], the event 
is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205489]/or study- related treatment or proced ure 
that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.  
4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions, either reported or per clinical judgment. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (if exposure to product just before conception or during pregnancy resulted in a n adverse outcome in the child)  
6. Other situations (Important medical events):  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediate ly life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205490]. These events should usually be considered serious (e.g., invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
• Is any other important medical event that based upon appropriate medical judgment may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above (e.g., may not result in death, be life threate ning, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).

ANC -501  ANC501D0005  
03 March 2023 Version 6.0  Confidential  Page 51 of 63 8.4.3. Time Period for Collecti ng AE and SAE Information 
All AEs will be recorded from study drug administration on Day 1  until Day 112 (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] regarding laboratory- associated AE assessments).  
Serious adverse events that occur subsequent to the signing of the informed consent (i.e., during 
the Screening Period ) as a result of study pa rticipation will be recorded, as well as all SAEs  
occurring from study drug administration on Day 1 until Day 112. If the Investigator bec omes 
aware of an SAE that is possibly  related to the investigational drug treatment at any time after 
the final follow -up visit, the Sponsor should be notified immediately (i.e., within 24 hours). 
Report the SAE using the method described below. 
8.4.4. Recording of Adverse Events and/or Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Terms of Reported Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded  in the elect ronic case report form (e CRF ), including start and stop 
dates, severity/grade, study drug relationship, and event outcome. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible,  the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) should be documented as the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Detection of  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will record  all observed and reported AEs. In addition, each subject  will be  
questioned with regard to AEs , but not occurrence of specific AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Adverse Events  
Severity of AEs will be graded as:  
• Mild: event may be noticeable to the subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does not require intervention 
• Moderate: event may be of sufficient severity to make the subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influenced; int ervention may be needed 
• Severe: event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; 
subject may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually 
needed  
If the severity of an AE changes more than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be listed. If the severity changes over a number of days, these mini- events or changes 
should be recorded separately (i.e., having distinct onset dates). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causal Relationship with Study Treatment  
Assessment of Causality 
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study drug and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE . A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that 
there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Investigators 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -[ADDRESS_245111]’s medical/disease history, the specific 
circumstances of the event, and potential alternative causes to determine if an AE is 
considered related to the study drug: 
o Definitely : The event has a plausible time relationship to drug intake, cannot be 
 explained by [CONTACT_205521], or has a definitive  pharmacologic relationship to the study drug. 
o Probably: The event has a reasonable time relationship to drug intake, and is  unlikely to be attributed to the disease under study or other drugs. 
o Possibly: The event has a reasonable time relationship to drug intake, and could also  be attributed to the disease under study or other drugs. 
o Not related:  The event has a time relationship to drug intake that makes a relationship 
 impossible, or is clearly attributable to the disease under study, to other  drugs, or to other factors or events. 
• The Investigator will consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) in the assessment and  will 
use clinical judgment in the determination.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that the event has 
been reviewed and an assessment of causality  provided. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor or designee. However, it is very important that the I nvestigator always assessment causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data.  The Investigator may change causality determination 
in light of follow-up information, and  send an SAE follow-up report with the updated 
causality assessment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Adverse event s should be followed until the AE has resolved, returned to baseline, or stabilized; 
withdrawal of consent; or death. 
8.4.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
The Sponsor or designee must be notified using an SAE R eport form within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of an SAE . This timeframe is also applicable to follow -up 
information for previous reported SAEs. 
The Investigator is obligated to obtain supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as 
medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_165567]/or 
causality of the event as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, ra diographic imaging, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
The SAE  Report form and redacted medical records should be submitted to 
[EMAIL_4027]  or
 via fax to ([PHONE_4410]. 
Follow-up information will be reported in the same method as above. 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -[ADDRESS_245112] be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period as noted in Section  8.4.3. 
8.4.7. Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female subjects or in female partners of male subjects (after 
appropriate consent for use of medical information has been obtained) will be reported to the Sponsor or designee at the email noted in Section  8.4.5 within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness, using a Pregnancy Report form. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such. 
The subject/pregnant female partner  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject/pregnant female partner  
and the neonate, and forward to the Sponsor or designee. 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue 
study drug. 
8.4.8. Overdose  
Refer to Section  6.[ADDRESS_245113] in this study. Slit lamp imaging  of the lenses of both 
eyes will be taken at Screening, Day 56, follow-up Day 70 and follow-up Day 112 and sent to a 
central reader for assessment using the LOCS III. Additional s lit lamp imaging may be 
performed during the treatment period and sent to a central reader for assessment using the LOCS III as per the investigator’s discretion. 
 LOCS III scale changes from baseline of ≥0.5 (Nuclear Opalescence), ≥0.5 (Cortical). ≥ 0.5 
(Posterior Subcapsular) and any changes considered to be clinically significant (e.g., incidence of 
cataract) are considered adverse events and events of special interest.  Any changes considered to 
be clinically significant  will be immediately reported to the Sponsor and/or designee within [ADDRESS_245114]. 
8.5. Ph
 armacokinetics  
The serum concentrations and calculated PK parameters of ANC -501 will be assessed based on 
blood samples collected from subjects during the study. Collection time points for the assessment 
of PK  are detailed in the Schedule of Events ( Section  1.3). Additional details regarding sample 
collection timing will be included in a separate Laboratory Manual.

10.1. Protocol Compliance /Deviations 
The Investigator agree s to conduct the study in compliance with the protocol and all  
amendments . Any protocol deviation(s) should be recorded in the source documents along with 
a clear description of the deviation(s) and cause. 
10.2. Study Termination  
Premature termination  of this study may occur  because of a regulatory authority  decision,  change 
in opi[INVESTIGATOR_85755] ( IRB), issues with study drug, or at the discretion of 
the Sponsor. In addition, the Sponsor retains the right to suspend or discontinue ANC -[ADDRESS_245117] all subjects  to arrange final study visit(s) and procedures, as directed by 
[CONTACT_1034]. 
10.3. Case Report Forms  
An eCRF is required f or each enrolled subject. For screen failure subjects, a minimal set of data 
will be collected as noted in Section  5.4. Data entered into the eCRF must be consistent with the 
source documents. 
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all data entered 
in the eCRF and any other data collection forms, and will be electronically signed by [CONTACT_205523] e CRF are accurate. 
10.4. Source Documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the integrity 
of the data collected. Source documents (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], patient hard- copy/electronic files, 
clinical/office charts, pharmacy dispensing records, X- rays) are filed at the Investigator’s site.  
Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator may need to request 
previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical 
records must be available.  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into 
the eCRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study

correspondence, original signed ICFs, source documents, the eCRFs, SAE/Pregnancy Report forms, drug storage/accountability/disposition records, and correspondence (e.g., letters , email, 
meeting minutes, telephone call records) with the Sponsor or designee. R ecords should be 
retained by [CONTACT_13177] a period of [ADDRESS_245119] marketing application approval (or if not approved, for 2 yea rs following the discontinuation of the investigational use) , 
according to the ICH guidelines, local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the Investigator becomes unable to retain study records for any reaso n (e.g., retirement, 
relocation), the y must be transferred to the Sponsor or to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor  
(e.g., another investigator, another institution, or independent third party) . 
10.7. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor or designee  will conduct periodic visits  or audits  during or after the study to ensure 
that the protocol and GCP are being followed. The monitors may review the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug storage/ accountability /disposition  recor ds, source documents , and 
regulatory documentation. The Investigator and institution will permit direct access to the 
physical spaces, records, and source documents to perform this verification to the Sponsor  or 
designee  monitors/auditors , IRB member s, and  appropriate regulatory authority inspectors . 
The Investigator must  immediately notify the Sponsor  or its designee  of any regulatory 
inspection notification , will cooperate with the Sponsor or designee  to prepare the study site 
for the inspection, will be present during the inspection along with relevant study staff, will 
allow the Sponsor or designee  to be present during the inspection, and will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_205492]. 
10.8. Financial Disc losure  
Investigators and sub- investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
EmbarkNeuro   Clinical Study Protocol  
ANC -[ADDRESS_245120] of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance wit h legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the 
general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research 
Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), 
ICH GCP Guideline s, and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and  
2008). 
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH GCP, 
and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  
11.2. Written Informed Consent  
An informed cons ent form (ICF) meeting the requirements of 21 CFR §50, local regulations, 
ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements (where applicable), must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1034], approved by [CONTACT_112392], and available for inspection. 
The Investigator or authorized  representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject  
and answer all questions regarding the study. Subjects  must be informed that their participation 
is voluntary, and if they choose to participate, will be required to sign the approved ICF . The 
medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before any 
study procedures were performed, along with the date written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF . The original signed 
ICF will be retained in the Investigator’s records, with a copy provided to the subject.  
Subjects  must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF during their participation in 
the study. 
11.3. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, Investigator ’s Brochure  (IB) , and other relevant 
documents ( e.g., advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by [CONTACT_737], and reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_30593]. 
Protocols and any substantial amendments to the protocol will require health authority approval 
prior to initiation e xcept for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
subjects. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazar d to study subjects . 
The Investigator will provide written summaries of the status of the study and any other significant safety findings to the IRB annually or more frequently in accordance with its 
requirements, policies, and procedures. At the end of the study, the Investigator will notify the 
IRB of the conclusion of the study and its outcome.

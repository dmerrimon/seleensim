Outreach Intervention to Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services
Study Design randomized intervention trial
Primary Objective Aim 1: To enlist community partners as citizen 
scientists to: identify and recruit Georgia residents with a personal/family history of ovarian cancer, generate content, and collaborate on a scalable message-based outreach intervention to reach ovarian cancer survivors and close relatives (i.e., first- and second-degree relatives) to consider genetic service options. Aim 2: In a two-arm randomized intervention trial (RCT), to compare a message-based outreach intervention to standard outreach for effects on: survivor reach, relative reach, and uptake of appropriate cancer genetic services (i.e., genetic counseling and testing for survivors, online genetic risk assessment for relatives) among survivors of ovarian cancer identified via a state cancer registry. We hypothesize that the message-based approach will result in greater reach and uptake of genetic services than standard outreach.Aim 3: To conduct a process evaluation consistent with the RE-AIM framework alongside the RCT to measure: reactions, dose delivered/received, fidelity, acceptability, barriers/facilitators, and alignment with ethical principles.

3.0 Background*
The majority of women at greatest risk for ovarian cancer due to hereditary factors are unlikely to know about their elevated risk and prevention opportunities. This significant gap in outreach means that most at-risk women will receive a late diagnosis of ovarian cancer with a dramatic negative effect on survival.1 Traceback approaches that leverage state-wide cancer registries’ ongoing surveillance activities offer a potentially low cost platform for outreach to ovarian cancer survivors and their close relatives. 
Approximately 15-20% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_473569].2 As such, it is now routine in specialty cancer care settings to offer genetic counseling and testing to all patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer.3,4 To promote cascade testing, patients identified with deleterious mutations are generally sent notification letters, and informational materials for specific relatives recommending that relatives seek genetic counseling. The sensitivity of a survivor’s mutation status supports the prevailing notion that only the survivor should directly contact [CONTACT_473585]. The few rigorous evaluations of these approaches consistently show limited reach both to survivors and their relatives particularly for rural residents, relatives with low income, and racial minorities.5-[ADDRESS_606810] reach of prevention 
programs (e.g., reaching tobacco users to offer cessation programs). However, health professionals have yet to apply much of the three-decades of evidence gained by [CONTACT_473586]. Research shows that multi-component, low cost health communication interventions including foot-in-the-door techniques,8 tailored/targeted communications,9 website support,10,11 and short messages12 expand reach of prevention messages. Moreover, guidance from 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Testing a Low Cost Population- and Theory-Based Outreach Intervention to 
Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services.
Page 7 of 55 VERSION:  Version  5, 10/03/2022.
theory is critically important to effective cancer communications as fatalistic 
beliefs about prevention and survival are common.13-[ADDRESS_606811] anticipate the potential for motivated processing of ovarian cancer risk information—denial, counter-arguing or avoidance— that can undermine engagement among those who are reached by [CONTACT_473587]. Theory-based interventions offer strategies to counter these responses and suggest that interventionists must develop specific messages in collaboration with affected communities.16-[ADDRESS_606812] assessed close relatives’ preferences regarding direct contact, especially in the circumstances where the patient’s mutation status is unknown. Citizen science methods offer a low cost and feasible platform for gaining community wisdom and creativity related to the ethical challenges of population outreach. 
With the availability of life-saving prevention options, we need novel approaches 
to identify, engage and inform ovarian cancer survivors and their close relatives about their risk. State cancer registries are a viable platform to use low cost outreach approaches to contact [CONTACT_473588], offer genetic counseling and testing as well as options for contact[CONTACT_473589].1,19,20 
4.0 Study Endpoints*
4.[ADDRESS_606813] outcomes: 1) Survivor reach: the proportion of the eligible 
survivors identified and contact[CONTACT_473590], 2) Close relative reach: the proportion of close relatives enumerated by [CONTACT_473591], and 3) Uptake of cancer genetic services: the proportion of untested survivors who complete telegenetic counseling and the proportion of relatives enumerated who complete B-RSTTM screening and subsequently access genetic counseling. We will evaluate secondary outcomes: In the MBI arm, we will track survivor’ and relatives’ patterns of website usage including: duration of time on the website, number of return visits, pages viewed, and the proportion of survivors who select different relative contact [CONTACT_329006].
5.0 Study Intervention / Design 
We propose a multi-component, low cost, message-based communication outreach intervention to engage ovarian cancer survivors and their at-risk relatives in considering cancer genetic services. The intervention includes foot-in-the-door techniques, tailored/targeted print, website support, and short messages to expand reach of prevention messages. An outreach website with content for both survivors and close relatives will be the hub channel in the communication intervention wheel. In turn, we will encourage access to the website using other communication channels as

Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services.
Page 8 of 55 VERSION:  Version  5, 10/03/2022.
spokes in the wheel including: 1) Initial print-based contact [CONTACT_473592], 2) additional briefer reminder postcards and short text message cues (SMS), 3) additional short text message cues sent directly to close relatives (with contact [CONTACT_473593]).  
6.0 Procedures Involved*
6.1 Describe study procedures.
Study Overview:  We propose two phases of study activities. Phase 1 (Aim 1) comprises 12 
months of collaboration with survivor/family working groups to develop: targeted letters, choice 
options for relative outreach, and content for an interactive website, and short cueing messages that engage ovarian cancer survivors and their at-risk relatives in considering genetic risk 
assessment. All of these study materials will be submitted as an IRB amendment prior to 
fielding.  Phase 2 (Aims 2-3 – Years 2-4), is an RCT that compares the message-based intervention 
(MBI) with current standard outreach. We will evaluate the following outcomes: survivor reach, 
at-risk relative reach, and uptake of appropriate cancer genetic services and conduct a process evaluation based on the RE-AIM framework that includes survivors and relatives (Aim 3). 
A. Aim 1: Develop a scalable message-based outreach intervention.A.1. Overarching Approach: We base our community partnerships on the combined principles 
and methods of community-based participatory research and citizen science.
21 We propose to 
bring the issue of increasing reach to the community of ovarian cancer survivors and families and engage their collaboration to develop appealing messages to expand the reach of genetic services to survivors and close relatives. Community members with relevant experience will work with us as citizen scientists using their experiences and skills to help develop messages.
21 We will hone 
ovarian cancer survivor/family partners’ skills as citizen scientists by [CONTACT_473594], relational autonomy and distributive justice (see below). The overarching objective is to co-create content that has the greatest potential to engage survivors/relatives to thoughtfully consider the tradeoffs of genetic service uptake. [CONTACT_473663], [CONTACT_473664] and Peachtree Solutions have considerable experience working with community advisory boards (CABs) and end users. Dr. McBride has conducted qualitative research to develop genetic risk messages in a variety of settings in the U.S. and abroad.
22-24
A.2. Study Population and Procedures:  Development of the MBI will involve three iterations and 
the following stakeholders: 1) community members who have a personal and/or family history of ovarian cancer; 2) communication and bioethics experts (Drs. McBride, Shepperd, Guan, Pentz, Emory’s Visual Medical Education team); and 3) cancer genetics content experts (Drs. Guan, Bellcross, Meisel). Georgia CORE’s CABs will help us identify 35-40 community members via s n o w b a l l  s a m p l i n g  t o  p a r t i c i p a t e  i n  w o r k i n g  g r o u p s  ( s e e  l e t t e r s  o f  s u p p o r t ) .  W e  w i l l  s h a r e  eligibility criteria with Georgia CORE (e.g. ovarian cancer survivor/family, access to the internet and being available for in-person or online group discussions). [CONTACT_473664] (Co-I) will oversee these activities with the assistance of an ethics fellow and a research assistant. In assembling the working groups, study staff will conduct additional eligibility screening (e.g., prior experience with cancer genetic services, family size) to increase the diversity of community members for 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Testing a Low Cost Population- and Theory-Based Outreach Intervention to 
Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services.
Page 9 of 55 VERSION:  Version  5, 10/03/2022.
working group activities. We will subdivide the community members based on their expertise 
and preference into 3 working groups consistent with a citizen science philosophy. Each group will contain 5-10 survivors and/or close relatives who will work on specific tasks and intervention-related products. Participants will receive $500 for attending 2-3 90-minute in-person meetings and some additional outside “homework”. For each in-person working group session, we will prepare an interactive didactic module with lay explanations of theory-based concepts related to the working group’s task. The remainder of the session will focus on a specific task (e.g., plans to interview other family members to solicit example experiences, preference for being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]). We will give working groups ongoing updates as the study progresses and share the study results in a final discussion group half-day meeting described in Aim 3.
A.3. Working Group Procedures:  [CONTACT_473665] who has experience working with community groups 
and evaluating websites that link those with inherited disease to genetic services will oversee working group activities.
25 In iteration 1 , one community working group will recommend 
approaches for framing the “large ask” and choice sets for relative contact [CONTACT_329006]. A second and third working group will assist in collecting survivor-family stories using photonovela or other strategies. In iteration 2 , content experts in communication, genetics and ethics will assemble 
working group content and develop initial formats for the website and print materials. Communication and bioethics experts will review materials for alignment with communication frameworks and ethical principles. Next, Peachtree Solutions (see letter of support), our web-development partner, will work with Emory’s Visual Medical Education team to draft the website and print materials. In iteration [ADDRESS_606814] the usability testing. The investigative team and consultants will make revisions based on each round of panel input. We will use the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) and Comprehensibility (CAM) scale to evaluate the readability and comprehensibility of the website with the aim to develop a website that users’ rate as “superior”, indicating it is easy to use and understand, low in cognitive demand, attention-getting, and motivating.
27  
Prior to fielding the trial, we will submit the developed study materials as part of IRB 
amendment.
B. Aim 2: Conduct a two-arm randomized intervention trial (N~2,918).  
B.1. Study Design:  We will compare the message-based intervention (MBI) developed in Aim [ADDRESS_606815] in Years 2 and 3. The MBI comprises a combination of novel intervention components that depart sufficiently from prior research to warrant a comparison arm (with access to the MBI website when the trial period is completed).
28 Figure 2 
displays the flow of the intervention. 
B.2. Study Population: Study activities will take place in Georgia (GA), where about 615 women 
are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and about 395 die from the disease each year.29 We propose 
a population-wide recruitment approach and will use Georgia Cancer Registry (GCR) to retrospectively identify, screen, and enroll all living ovarian cancer patients in GA, diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2017. GCR contains information on demographic characteristics, condition at time of diagnosis (e.g., stage, histologic types, and other clinical and 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Testing a Low Cost Population- and Theory-Based Outreach Intervention to 
Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services.

demographic variables), and treatment history of all cancer patients in GA.29 Since 2001, the 
database excludes borderline (low malignant potential) neoplasms. We will consider women in GCR for study participation if they meet four criteria: 1) diagnosed with ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal cancers; 2) lived in GA at the time of diagnosis; 3) are not deceased per the registry’s records; and 4) have a mailing address. Our review of registry files as of May 2019 revealed: of the 8,[ADDRESS_606816] 10.5 million residents; 1.8 million (~17%)
30 residents live in rural areas.31 The state enjoys 
substantial racial-ethnic diversity: 32% of the state is Black or African American alone (4th largest African American population in the U.S.), 9.6% is Hispanic or Latino and 4.2% is Asian alone, 15% of the population lives in poverty, and 15% lack health insurance.
30
The efficient recruitment of survivors presents logistical challenges particularly given the high mortality rate of ovarian cancer. We made the deliberate decision to reach out to ovarian cancer survivors diagnosed back to 2005 based on: 1) our message-based communication traceback approach that targets ovarian cancer survivors with short- and long-term survivorship to include diagnoses that predated changes in testing guidelines
32; 2) survivors diagnosed more than a 
decade ago are underrepresented in the majority of case identification trials with self-selected samples in specialty clinical settings; 3) we expect rates of recruitment and enrollment to decline as we trace back; however, we will potentially maximize the total reach and learn about the intervention efficacy across a range of survivor periods; and 4) the cost advantage of using the state-wide cancer registry to identify all of the locatable survivors in GA counterbalances

recruitment drawbacks. [CONTACT_473663] has used similar location and outreach strategies in 
collaboration with GCR to promote mammography and achieved 63% participation rates.[ADDRESS_606817] and ovarian cancer survivors into clinical trials for preventive cancer activities; they contact[CONTACT_473595]-diagnosis, with most reporting response rates between 30-40%.
34-42 
B.3. Randomization: We will randomly assign cancer survivors (N=2,918) in a 1:1 ratio to either 
the MBI arm (n=1,459) or the waitlist standard outreach arm (n=1,459). Given our access to the entire population of ovarian cancer survivors in GA and characteristics of their cancer and treatment, we will use a covariate adaptive randomization procedure.
43,[ADDRESS_606818] are related to reach from the cancer registry data. Examples are year of diagnosis and age at diagnosis. Registry staff will randomize identified survivors to arm using sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes.
B.4. GCR Recruitment Procedures: The proposed recruitment procedures comply with GCR’s 
current standards. We adapted them from strategies that were effective in other studies using cancer registry for recruitment
34,39,42,47,48 that will allow for sustaining and disseminating the 
intervention beyond the study. We will classify survivors who log in to the study website as “reached.” Recruitment will rely on multiple communications aimed to encourage survivors to log in to the study website with the number of contacts largely identical for both arms (Figure 4).
B.4.1. First contact [CONTACT_31711] (MBI arm only): We will mail survivors in the MBI arm a one-page 
infographic (See “U01 MBI infographic draft”)  that includes a postage-paid return envelope to 
return their responses to three questions (See “U01 MBI three questions draft”) . Responses will 
help us better understand information needs of families affected by [CONTACT_473596]. Participants may answer the questions online by [CONTACT_2329] a QR code, or write their responses on the enclosed document and return it to GCR. Responses will be anonymous and will not be linked to any personal identifiable information. We will not report participants’ responses for research purposes and their responses will be reported on an aggregate level (e.g., number of envelopes returned). 
B.4.2. First mail-out:  This mailing will be sent approximately 7-[ADDRESS_606819] letter, we will mail to survivors in both arms $5 cash as a token of appreciation for their attention, and a recruitment packet based on their arm assignment: targeted print material in the MBI arm versus standard study invitation letter in the standard outreach arm. GCR staff will mail recruitment materials in batches of about [ADDRESS_606820] the toll-free registry telephone number with questions or concerns. Throughout recruitment, we will perform monthly checks to avoid

initiating contact [CONTACT_4490] a recently deceased woman. To reduce unnecessary contact [CONTACT_473597], the intervention coordinator will provide GCR with the IDs of survivors who have logged in to the study website on a biweekly basis. 
B.4.3. Telephone contacts:  Studies show that interpersonal communications, such as a personal 
phone call, can increase clinical trial accrual when combined with informational handouts.
48-[ADDRESS_606821] survivors by [CONTACT_473598]. We will call survivors every 2-3 days for up to 9 attempts, after which we will categorize them as inaccessible. The phone call aims to: 1) check on receipt of the recruitment packet; 2) remind survivors to log in to the study website; and 3) answer questions regarding the study.  This schedule is the standard for GCR outreach.
B.4.4. Second mail-outs:  Survivors who do not log in to the study website within [ADDRESS_606822] phone call attempt will receive a second mail-out containing the full recruitment packet.
 
B.5. Message Based Intervention (MBI) Arm: In collaboration with the working groups we will 
develop messages  to increase perceived relevance (e.g., photonovela stories), and prompt 
website access (e.g., SMS reminders of passwords). Messages will be included in: a website hub, initial print-based contact [CONTACT_473599], reminder postcards and short text message cues (SMS) for survivors and close relatives (when contact [CONTACT_473600]). We will work with Emory’s Visual Medical Education team

of certified medical illustrators to design illustrations for these products to increase the 
accessibility of complex medical concepts. 
B.5.1. Survivor components:  We will send the initial full recruitment packet to identified survivors 
randomized to the MBI arm. The packet will contain theory-based targeted messages developed in Aim 1, and a cover letter that explains how we identified the woman, and provide her with a unique login to access the website that we can track and link the survivor to the cancer registry. Figure 3 displays the intervention flow. 
B.5.1.a. Website:  The study website developed in Aim 1 
will be a centralized information delivery portal that contains: graphical depi[INVESTIGATOR_473570], short videos on hereditary cancer risk, photonovelas, structured interactive Q&A choices highlighting pros and cons of seeking genetic services from the perspectives of survivors, and resources for patient navigation programs near them. On entering the website, survivors will see an explanation of the study and the opportunity to continue or to decline. The online consent form ends with the "I agree" checkbox so the participant can decide whether they still want to participate after reading the listed conditions. Dr. McBride successfully used a similar approach with 6,400 enrollees in a managed care organization.
54 Fully 32% of those who received mailed 
invitations with log-in information visited the website.55 
Results showed high levels of information recall and accurate interpretations of the limits of the genetic susceptibility testing for common diseases suggesting this platform enabled informed consent.
56 The website 
will ask survivors who log-in to review informed consent information, click the “I agree” button if they want to proceed, and on a separate webpage to complete the requested “small ask”  task to enumerate their 1
st and 
2nd-degree relatives (henceforth “close relatives”) by 
[CONTACT_473601]. Once completed, the survivor will view options for how close relatives might be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (we will present 3-4 options that represent graduated involvement of study staff). We will pair each option with personal stories to illustrate pros and cons of the choices. The website will then prompt survivors to complete the “large ask”  task, which entails selecting an option (e.g., close relatives contact[CONTACT_473602], share contact [CONTACT_473603], study team contact [CONTACT_473604], refuse contact, etc.). Survivors who select options that involve the study team reaching out on the survivor’s behalf will be prompted to provide contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., mailing address, email, phone number) for relatives. Relatives specified for study contact [CONTACT_473605] (via email, mail or text) personal login information linked to the survivor; provide survivors

who opt to contact [CONTACT_473606]-in information for each of the 
relatives they list. Relatives that survivors refuse contact [CONTACT_473607]. 
B.5.1.b. Short messages:  Survivors who provide mobile phone numbers will receive two SMS 
thanking them for accessing the website, and encouraging them to revisit the website to review information and contact [CONTACT_473608]. We will time these cues to occur at 3-week intervals over a 6-week time period (two SMS). Additionally, reviews of SMS studies suggest including a substantial pre-testing phase that allows target audiences to provide input on message content as we propose to do in Aim 1.
B.5.1.c. Genetic service options:  We will offer free pre-test telegenetic counseling to all survivors 
who log in to the website, regardless of whether they complete the tasks. Two recent trials showed that similar approaches are non-inferior to face-to-face counseling.
57,58 Survivors can opt 
for phone and/or video counseling via Emory HIPPA approved Zoom links. They can schedule a session (~60 min) on the study website by [CONTACT_473609]/time. We will ask survivors to review an online genetic counseling consent form and complete a brief intake survey (e.g., prior genetic testing result). Survivors may invite a support person or other family members to participate in the session. Scheduling a telegenetic counseling session indicate that participants agree to receive services provided by [CONTACT_473610] a genetic counselor intern at Emory University. Genetic counseling interns (supervised by [CONTACT_6283]. Guan and Bellcross) will proactively contact [CONTACT_473611]. Interns will be blinded to participant’s/relatives study-arm assignment. All interns will have comprehensive training in cancer genetics and use of telemedicine. The intern will be trained in best practices: review personal and family medical history, discuss appropriate genetic tests (e.g., minimum BRCA  and Lynch syndrome, other genes based on survivors’ family 
history), and discuss the risks/benefits/limitations of recommended tests. Interns also will receive training in how to refer survivors to informational and support resources, including any local patient navigator programs to assist the participant with additional medical care needs. Participants will receive a copy of their pedigree, a medical referral letter summarizing key aspects of the counseling session and recommendations for genetic testing. We will recommend that participants share these letters with their primary care provider (PCP) as follow-up. If participant’s prefer, the intern can work with the PCP to arrange genetic testing. We will also offer post-test telegenetic counseling at no cost to all participants. Medicare's covers BRCA1 /2 
genetic testing for people with personal history of ovarian cancer. In addition, the Genetic Testing Fund established by [CONTACT_473612] ([CONTACT_473664], President and Co-I) provides access to genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer for uninsured Georgians.

which is endorsed by [CONTACT_473613]1/2  mutation and identifying women for referral to genetic 
counseling. This screener assesses personal and family history (1

cancer, bilateral breast cancer, ovarian cancer and male breast cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. The intervention website will include a separate portal dedicated to the B-RST
TM 3.[ADDRESS_606824] or 2nd degree relatives of ovarian cancer survivors will screen positive on 
B-RSTTM, completing the screener will raise participant awareness of the factors that contribute 
to hereditary risk of ovarian cancer and will reinforce the salience of seeking genetic counseling. We will recommend genetic counseling for all close relatives because of their heightened risk for carrying a BRCA1/[ADDRESS_606825], and only offer genetic testing to close relatives with a confirmed pathogenic variant ala cascade testing. However, we will offer genetic testing to relatives regardless of survivor’s testing status.
B.6. Standard Outreach Arm B.6.1. Survivor components:  GCR will mail survivors a standard letter and log-in information. 
Survivors will have access to a condensed version of the website that includes information on: 
genetic risk and genetic counseling, patient navigators in their locale, and the importance of conveying information to close relatives. Survivors will be provided with [ADDRESS_606826] additional relative letters/logins for any relatives that they would like to involve on the website or the GCR.
B.6.2. Close relative components:  The standard family letter shared by [CONTACT_473614] B-RST

All survivors and relatives in the standard arm will have access to the telegenetic counseling 
services described above. After completion of intervention trial, all survivors in the standard 
outreach arm regardless of their study participation will have access to the MBI sections of the 
website. 
6.[ADDRESS_606827] the research-related risk to be minimal: the probability & magnitude of 
harm/discomfort anticipated in the research is no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations/tests.
There are no anticipated physical risks of participating in this study. However, 
participants may experience psychological or emotional distress from participating in the study, particularly activities related to the way their family interacts or communicates about ovarian cancer and genetic risks. Survivors may worry about their family members’ emotional distress. Participants whose motivations for study

enrollment include histories of ovarian cancer in either themselves or their family 
members may find it upsetting to re-visit their personal experiences. 
There is a small potential risk of outreach to family members of a recently deceased 
woman. In GCR’s past experiences, this event does indeed happen on occasion but the typi[INVESTIGATOR_473571] a family member contacts GCR to inform about the passing of their family member. No adverse event has been reported thus far (e.g., distress, confusion). The proposed research activities present the same outreach risk (which is minimal) as routine contact [CONTACT_473615].
Other potential risks to participation include the possibility of a breach of confidentiality 
or data privacy in which the study participant’s involvement in genetic counseling, comments or survey information may become known by [CONTACT_473616]. 
In order to attenuate the likelihood and impact of these potential risks:Throughout recruitment, GCR will perform monthly checks to minimize the risk of 
initiating contact [CONTACT_4490] a recently deceased woman. If such contact [CONTACT_110534], GCR’s standard protocol is that the registry is the single point of contact [CONTACT_473617]. The GCR’s primary goal is to ensure that trained registry staff respond to such calls and work to reduce possible distress and address questions and concerns per their standard protocols.
Participants will be informed that their responses will be described in aggregate and 
they can skip any questions they do not wish to answer, or withdraw from the study at any time. Additionally, all of those who log in to the study website (restricted or expanded) will be provided with a 24-hour call in line (hosted by [CONTACT_473618]) to request contact [CONTACT_473619]. Jointly, our research team includes [ADDRESS_606828]-certified genetic counselors (Guan, Bellcross), an oncologist (Meisel) and a bioethicist (Pentz) with expertise in areas that may raise concerns for participants.  We can arrange call backs to participants who register concerns related to their participation in the study.
Participants who receive tele-genetic counseling will have the opportunity to have their 
questions/concerns related to genetic screening/testing addressed by [CONTACT_473620]. All of the genetic counselor interns will have to complete at least one cancer rotation at the time of the study and they will receive clinical oversight by [CONTACT_473621]. Bellcross, Guan, and Meisel. Each of these genetic counseling professionals have extensive experience in cancer genetics. During the online discussions (Aim 3), they will also be available to answer questions related to cancer care and genetic counseling via online written responses.

Aim 1:  User testing procedures will include structured interviews to assess website content and 
messaging feedback, and the ratings of the website using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) and Comprehensibility (CAM) scale, facilitated by [CONTACT_473622] (the developer of the website).
Aim 2:  Primary data sources include: 1) GCR will record all survivor contacts (i.e., mailings, calls, 
messages left, call-backs), 2) website use reported by [CONTACT_473623] a monthly basis (i.e., website login and user-patterns data), 3) genetic counseling interns’ electronic case logbook of appointment scheduling and completion, 4) post-intervention online survey.
Aim 3: Data sources are online survey data and participants’ comments on the online discussion 
forums collected from the study website.  
The project is currently in the process of being considered for funding by [CONTACT_12134]. NIH requires 
provisional IRB approval for any project to receive funding. At this time there are no documents that are ready for IRB review. We state this throughout the protocol, that all documents will be submitted prior to interacting with study participants. We are asking that we obtain approval in concept for the project, provisional on review of specific materials if the grant is funded. We used the same approach for our Deliberative Democracy R21 (IRB00114524) that was funded in December, 2019.
6.[ADDRESS_606830] outcomes:  1) Survivor reach: the proportion of the eligible survivors identified and 
contact[CONTACT_473590], 2) Close relative reach:  the proportion of close 
relatives enumerated by [CONTACT_473591], and 3) Uptake of cancer genetic 
services: the proportion of untested survivors who complete telegenetic counseling and the 
proportion of relatives enumerated who complete B-RSTTM screening and subsequently access 
genetic counseling. We will evaluate secondary outcomes: In the MBI arm, we will track survivor’ and relatives’ patterns of website usage including: duration of time on the website, number of return visits, pages viewed, and the proportion of survivors who select different relative contact [CONTACT_329006]. We can also link survivor and relative patterns of use to evaluate “family” patterns of use. We will assess the proportion of survivors and relatives who self-report in the post-intervention online survey (described below) having completed genetic testing, but we will not have sufficient power to consider uptake of genetic testing as a primary outcome.
Primary data sources include: 1) GCR will record all survivor contacts (i.e., mailings, calls, 
messages left, call-backs), 2) website use reported by [CONTACT_473623] a monthly basis (i.e., website login and user-patterns data), and 3) genetic counseling interns’ electronic case

logbook of appointment scheduling and completion. We will limit website data collection to 
information regarding survivor’s prior genetic counseling/testing, enumeration of relatives, and contact [CONTACT_473624]’ approval to contact. We will limit data collected from relatives on the website to telephone number, home address, email addresses, and to prior experiences with genetic counseling/testing. We decided against a formal survey prior to or during the intervention to minimize participant burden and to enable a cleaner evaluation of the feasibility of using the proposed intervention to maximize survivor/relative reach. 
Post-intervention online survey: We 
will recruit survivors and relatives who logged on to the website, regardless of their level of participation. We will post a study invitation letter and a one-time 20-minute survey on the study website and send the letter to survivors and relatives with contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., mailing address, email, or mobile phone number) about 4 weeks after the intervention phase. Based on our sample size scenarios in Table 3 we estimate recruiting 120 survivors (15% 
response rate) and 66 relatives (15% response rate) to complete the online survey. We will compensate participants with $[ADDRESS_606831]
TM results following a mammogram screening visit; 35% 
agreed to complete an online survey with a $25 incentive.63 We will include measures of (Table 
2): Ability to process health information (“How confident are you filling out medical forms by 
[CONTACT_202699]?”) This item correlates strongly with longer health literacy assessments142; We will 
assess central processing in several domains: a 7-item breast/ovarian cancer genetic knowledge 
scale143, recall of the B-RSTTM result (correct/incorrect), accuracy of perceived likelihood of 
carrying a BRCA1/2  mutation, and accuracy of perceived absolute risk of ovarian cancer (“how 
likely is that you will develop ovarian cancer in your lifetime?”).63-65 We  will assess defensive 
processing with a 9-item information acceptance scale in which relatives respond to statements 
such as, “The information I received about my risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer seems accurate” (scores range from 0-45, a higher score indicates a high acceptance)
63. Cancer 
fear is based on 3-items (e.g., “of all the diseases, I am most afraid of cancer.”)66 We will assess 
comparative risk perception with a single item “compared to the average woman your age, would you say that you are less likely/as likely/more likely to develop ovarian cancer.” Prevention efficacy: We will assess ovarian cancer fatalism with two items (e.g., “If a woman is 
meant to get ovarian cancer, she will get it no matter what she does?”).66 Other measures: 
cancer genetic testing (yes/no), extent of family discussions about ovarian cancer, and relevant demographics.

Process Data Collection and Measures: To measure reach (coverage and participation rates) and 
dosage (intervention delivered and received), we will electronically track the number of 
mailings/phone calls to each participant, website usage pattern, request for genetic counseling, 
and the completion of genetic counseling and testing. Fidelity: For quality control purposes, Drs. 
Guan and Bellcross will evaluate audio-recordings of ~70 sessions (10% of the estimated total) to 
assess whether the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_473572]: personal/family medical history, 
inheritance, appropriate genetic tests, and the risks/benefits/limitations of recommended tests. 
A sum score of 80 (out of 100) will demonstrate good quality of counseling. 
All survey instruments used in the study will be developed in the 12-month planning stage. 
Prior to fielding the study, these instruments and related scripts will be submitted as an IRB 
amendment.

13.0 Recruitment Methods
Aim 1 (community working groups):  We will collaborate with local community organizations and 
use snowball sampling approaches to recruit35-[ADDRESS_606839] : speak English, have a personal and/or family history of ovarian cancer, be [ADDRESS_606840] additional eligibility screening (e.g., prior experience with cancer genetic services, family size) to increase the diversity of community members for working group activities. Georgia CORE Community Advisory Boards (CAB), the Cancer Patient Navigators of Georgia, and the Survivorship Advisory Board have extensive experiences working with cancer survivors across Georgia and will assist in recruitment for Aim 1 (See letters of support). [CONTACT_473666] (Co-I) will oversee these activities with a research assistant and an ethics fellow. Two community consultants nominated by [CONTACT_18854]. Paris will work with local organizations to recruit working group participants. Additionally, we will approach organizations where members are more likely to have undergone genetic counseling/testing and include male members to increase diversity on these characteristics. Participants will receive $500 for attending 2 to3 90-minute in-person meetings 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Testing a Low Cost Population- and Theory-Based Outreach Intervention to

and some additional outside “homework”. Recruitment of community members will take 
approximately 3 months at the beginning of Year 1.
Aim 2 (message-based intervention (MBI) and waitlist standard outreach approaches): Ovarian 
cancer survivors in the Georgia Cancer Registry (GCR) database who meet the following criteria 
will be considered for study participation: 1) diagnosed with ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal 
cancers; 2) lived in Georgia at the time of diagnosis; 3) currently are alive per the registry’s records; and 4) have a mailing address. The proposed recruitment procedures comply with GCR’s current standards and are adapted from strategies that were effective in other studies using cancer registry for recruitment.
1-5 We will classify survivors who log in to the study website as 
recruited. Recruitment will rely on multiple communications aimed to encourage survivors to log in to the study website; the number of contacts will be largely identical for both arms: first mail-out (full packet plus $10 incentive), telephone contact [CONTACT_18904] a trained GCR staff, second mail-out (postcard reminder), and third mail-out (full packet). Our review of registry files as of May 2019 showed that: of the 8,760 women with a diagnosis of ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal cancer (excluding those who were deceased or lost to follow as of 2017), we will have addresses for about 2,[ADDRESS_606841] without financial compensation, 63% agreed to participate.
6 A conservative assumption of 
reaching (i.e., log in to the study website) 45% in the MBI arm versus 10% in the standard outreach arm, we need to recruit [ADDRESS_606842] be: [ADDRESS_606843]- or second-degree relative of the survivor, able to read Engl ish, and not be incarcerated or institutionalized. 
We estimate that 801 cancer survivors will log in to the website and 75% of them (N=601) will enumerate a median of 2 at-risk relatives. We assume the number of at-risk relatives enumerated will not differ between intervention arms. Furthermore, we estimate that 40% of relatives referred by [CONTACT_473625] 20% in the standard outreach arm. We expect that about 438 relatives will participate in the study. Recruitment of survivors and relatives for the intervention will occur in Year 2 and 3. 
Aim 2 & 3 (post-intervention online survey):  We will recruit survivors and relatives who logged 
on to the website, regardless of their level of participation. We will post a study invitation letter and a one-time 20-minute survey on the study website and send the letter to survivors and relatives with contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., mailing address, email, or mobile phone number) about 4 weeks after the intervention phase. Based on our sample size scenarios we estimate recruiting 120 survivors (15% response rate) and 66 relatives (15% response rate) to complete the online survey. We will compensate participants with $[ADDRESS_606844]
TM results following a 
mammogram screening visit; 35% agreed to complete an online survey with a $25 incentive.7 
Recruitment of survivors and relatives for the online survey will take approximately 3 months at the beginning of Year 4.
Aim 3 (mail survey to survivors who did not login to the study website): GCR will send a brief 
survey to survivors in both study arms who have never accessed the website after GCR completes recruitment efforts. Based on our prior recruitment data, about 1,[ADDRESS_606845] staged selection

of 650 non-responders over the 8-month recruitment period (Jan – Aug 2023): (1) reach out to 
all participants with a confirmed phone number (GCR have talked to participants during trial recruitment or their voicemail states their name); 2) reach out to all participants with a confirmed mailing address (GCR confirmed the mailing address through at least two resources (GCR database, ACCUR or voter registration database); and 3) reach out to participants whose ovarian cancer diagnosis is within five years. We aim to recruit 375 survivors for this survey. The proposed recruitment procedures comply with GCR’s current standards. Recruitment will rely on two rounds of communications aimed to encourage non-responders in both study arms to complete the survey (Figure 4). 
The first mail-out packet will include a survey cover letter (See “non-responder survey cover 
letter”), $10 cash, a postage-paid return envelope to return completed survey, and a 10-min survey (See “Non-responder survey draft”) that asks about participant recall of receiving study materials, perceived importance and relevance of learning ovarian cancer risks, privacy concerns about health website, and trust in university health research. Participants may answer the questions online by [CONTACT_2329] a QR code or write their responses on the enclosed document and return it to GCR.
Two weeks after mailing each packet, GCR will contact [CONTACT_473626]. We will call survivors every 2-3 days for up to 5 attempts, after which we will categorize them as inaccessible. The phone call aims to: 1) check on receipt of the survey packet; 2) offer survey completion by [CONTACT_648]; 3) remind survivors to complete the survey by [CONTACT_473627]; and 4) answer questions regarding the study. This schedule is the standard for GCR outreach.
Aim 3 (online discussion forum):  We propose to purposefully sample survivors (~25) and 
relatives (~25) randomized to the MBI arm to participate. We will conduct cluster analysis based on 2/3rds of the recruited sample to assess patterns of website use and identify sub-groups of users. We will use multinomial regression analysis to understand sociodemographic differences

in cluster members and use the clusters as strata for the recruitment into the online discussion 
forum. These analyses will allow us to identify “user profiles” and stratify sampling to increase representation of various user patterns based on GCR contact [CONTACT_473628], website usage (high/low), and uptake of genetic counseling/testing (yes/no). We will send invitations and identify a back-up individual from the waiting list, should the original invitee decline. Participants will receive information about how to participate in the online discussion forum via email/mail/phone/website postings. Recruitment of survivors and relatives for the online discussion forum will take approximately 3 months at the beginning of Year 4.
All survey instruments used in the study will be developed in the 12-month planning stage. 
Prior to fielding the study, these instruments and related scripts will be submitted as an IRB 
amendment.
14.0 Withdrawal of Participants*
Participants will be informed that they can choose not to participate in the study. They can skip any questions they do not wish to answer, or withdraw from the study at any time.
15.0 Risks to Participants*
We expect the research-related risk to be minimal: the probability & magnitude of harm/discomfort anticipated in the research is no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations/tests.
There are no anticipated physical risks of participating in this study. However, 
participants may experience psychological or emotional distress from participating in the study, particularly activities related to the way their family interacts or communicates about ovarian cancer and genetic risks. Survivors may worry about their family members’ emotional distress. Participants whose motivations for study enrollment include histories of ovarian cancer in either themselves or their family members may find it upsetting to re-visit their personal experiences. 
There is a small potential risk of outreach to family members of a recently deceased 
woman. In GCR’s past experiences, this event does indeed happen on occasion but the typi[INVESTIGATOR_473571] a family member contacts GCR to inform about the passing of their family member. No adverse event has been reported thus far (e.g., distress, confusion). The proposed research activities present the same outreach risk (which is minimal) as routine contact [CONTACT_473615].
Other potential risks to participation include the possibility of a breach of confidentiality 
or data privacy in which the study participant’s involvement in genetic counseling, comments or survey information may become known by [CONTACT_473616]. 
In order to attenuate the likelihood and impact of these potential risks:Throughout recruitment, GCR will perform monthly checks to minimize the risk of 
initiating contact [CONTACT_4490] a recently deceased woman. If such contact [CONTACT_110534], GCR’s standard protocol is that the registry is the single point of contact [CONTACT_473629]:   Testing a Low Cost Population- and Theory-Based Outreach Intervention to

outreach. The GCR’s primary goal is to ensure that trained registry staff respond to such 
calls and work to reduce possible distress and address questions and concerns per their standard protocols.
Participants will be informed that their responses will be described in aggregate and 
they can skip any questions they do not wish to answer, or withdraw from the study at any time. Additionally, all of those who log in to the study website (restricted or expanded) will be provided with a 24-hour call in line (hosted by [CONTACT_473618]) to request contact [CONTACT_473619]. Jointly, our research team includes [ADDRESS_606846]-certified genetic counselors (Guan, Bellcross), an oncologist (Meisel) and a bioethicist (Pentz) with expertise in areas that may raise concerns for participants.  We can arrange call backs to participants who register concerns related to their participation in the study.
Participants who receive tele-genetic counseling will have the opportunity to have their 
questions/concerns related to genetic screening/testing addressed by [CONTACT_473620]. All of the genetic counselor interns will have to complete at least one cancer rotation at the time of the study and they will receive clinical oversight by [CONTACT_473621]. Bellcross, Guan, and Meisel. Each of these genetic counseling professionals have extensive experience in cancer genetics. During the online discussions (Aim 3), they will also be available to answer questions related to cancer care and genetic counseling via online written responses.
More detail about data security and participant confidentiality are described below in 
the Data Management and Monitoring and Confidentiality sections of this protocol.
16.0 Potential Benefits to Participants*
Participants may or may not benefit directly by [CONTACT_96428]. Through reviewing the print- and website-based communication materials and undergoing genetic counseling, participants may develop a broader knowledge base, competence and confidence to interpret and analyze genetic risk information related to hereditary cancers. If participants choose to undergo genetic testing in the future and are found to be a mutation carrier of hereditary cancer syndromes, the information will be useful for their personal health care management and for their family members’ health as well. 
As any risks of participating are anticipated to be minimal, it is believed that the knowledge 
gained from participants’ responses will provide societal benefits that outweigh any risks to the participants.
Results of this study could inform the adaptation of similar traceback programs for other 
heritable cancers and in other states to increase the likelihood of fair distribution of precision medicine advances.
17.0 Data Analysis, Management* and Confidentiality
Power analysis for RCT: Our study population is equal to (and thus limited by) the population of ovarian cancer survivors in Georgia. A recent study using GCR to recruit breast cancer survivors in Georgia used registry standard mailing and phone contact [CONTACT_473630], which yielded 63% rate of agreeing to participate (Lipscomb, under review). With a conservative

assumption of reaching (i.e., login to the study website) 45% in the MBI arm versus 10% in the 
standard outreach arm, we aim to recruit [ADDRESS_606847] very good power ( β>95%) to detect an intervention effect for each primary outcome. Even 
if we unexpectedly are less successful in recruiting survivors in the MBI arm, we are still powered to detect a significant intervention effect for 20% reach in the MBI arm with a total sample size of 436. Power analyses for the two primary outcomes for close relatives were conducted assuming a design effect (DEFF) of 1.3 expecting moderate clustering in the outcome. Even with DEFF=2, we are adequately powered to detect an intervention impact in relatives for reach and uptake of B-RSTTM. 
Data analysis for primary RCT outcomes:  We will conduct all analyses in SAS 9.4. Because our 
sample is identical with the study population, there will be no missing data for the main outcome. We will code people who do not engage in primary study outcomes (e.g., visiting website) as ‘0’, and all others as ‘1’. Among participants interacting with the website, we will calculate dose of web use as the number of sessions and time spent on the website as indicators of central processing. For the main trial outcomes, we will first examine distributions (frequencies and means/standard deviations) for all relevant variables. To analyze survivor outcomes , we will use 
logistic regression to analyze arm assignment as a predictor of: 1) reach and 2) uptake of genetic counseling yielding an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the intervention effect. For close relatives outcomes : 1) reach, 2) uptake of B-RST
TM, and 3) uptake of genetic counseling, we 
will conduct a logistic multilevel analysis accounting for clustering of close relatives in cancer survivors (i.e. close relatives are level-1 who are nested in level-2). Given the binary nature of the outcomes, we will assess dispersion and adjust for over- or under-dispersion in our analyses. Subsequently, we will conduct moderator analyses to see for whom the intervention worked best. These analyses will entail expanding the described logistic regression/logistic mixed models to include direct effects of a proposed moderator (e.g. age at diagnosis) and an interaction effect between the moderator and arm assignment. Although the main outcomes will have no missing data, our covariates might have missing data. We will assess patterns of missingness and use appropriate methods (i.e. full-information maximum likelihood estimation or multiple imputations) to account for missing data.
Data analysis for post-intervention online survey:  To evaluate factors suggested by [CONTACT_473631], we will conduct quantitative

Engage Ovarian Cancer Survivors and their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Services.
Page 27 of 55 VERSION:  Version  5, 10/03/2022.
analyses of survey data to characterize participants’ processing and demographics. We will apply 
linear or logistic regression to compare differences on knowledge, comprehension, between the intervention and standard outreach arms. For example, in these analyses we will evaluate whether participants in the MBI arm show higher cancer genetic knowledge than relatives in the standard outreach arm. Overall, we will adjust these analyses for health literacy and age. 
User Pattern Analysis: To assess patterns of website use and identify sub-groups of users, we will 
use traditional web tool user data (e.g. time of access after invite to use, frequency of use) and programmatic user data (e.g. types of viewed content, types of completed tasks). These analyses will be conducted approximately 2/[ADDRESS_606848] adequate numbers for characterizing user patterns. We will identify the sub-groups through descriptive analysis and if meaningful using cluster analysis.
70 Subsequently, we will use multinomial 
regression analysis to understand sociodemographic differences in cluster members and use the clusters as strata for the recruitment into the online discussion forum described above.
Process Outcome Measures:  Implementation reach, dosage, and fidelity is based on proportions 
and means/standard deviations for relevant quantitative variables (e.g., website access, number 
of visits/length, counseling session evaluation scores). Outreach approach’s acceptability, 
barriers, facilitators, and perceived alignment with ethical principles will be based on descriptive 
analyses of quantitative  survey responses (mail and online – e.g., the proportion of participants 
who vote “yes or no” and rate outreach as protecting autonomy and respecting family relationship (relational autonomy). For qualitative  responses on the online discussion forum, we 
will conduct qualitative content analysis using MaxQDA. We will identify distinct themes and 
categories related to each discussion topic, such as acceptability, and alternative contact [CONTACT_473632]. Two study team members (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pentz) will independently code five responses per discussion topic to ensure agreement of coding. Using a final codebook, a bioethics fellow and graduate assistants will conduct coding. We will systematically review all responses for the most commonly occurring themes and will identify representative quotes. The recorded counseling sessions (~70) will also be qualitatively coded to compare 4 measures by [CONTACT_30157]: 1) session length in minutes, 2) verbal dominance (ratio of counselor to participant statements), 3) patient activation (number of patient medical, psychosocial, and lifestyle statements and questions), and 4) nonverbal affect assessed by a 6-point scale
71,72 (low to high) reflecting both positive (interest, warmth, engagement, empathy, 
respectfulness and interaction) and negative affect (dominance and hurried for the genetic counselor, anxiety and distress for the patient).
As described in detail in section 19.0, confidentiality safeguards are in place during the 
following activities: recruitment, informed consent process, participation in study website, survey and online forum, data transportation, data analysis, and study finding reporting. Only the study ID number will be attached to data. In terms of reporting of study results, only basic sociodemographic identifiers (e.g., age, income, education) will be reported in aggregate.

19.[ADDRESS_606849] the Privacy Interests of Participants and 
Confidentiality of Participants’ identifiable data
To protect participants’ privacy, the community working groups will take place in private settings (e.g., conference rooms). Participants in the telegenetic counseling sessions will be asked to schedule a time when they can speak privately. The online survey and discussion forum will be hosted by [CONTACT_473633]. We will advise participants to use a pseudonym to maintain their anonymity. Participants can share their responses to the research team only, or make the responses available for other participants to view. 
Based on existing best practices for security and privacy in health information technology, we 
have employed the technologies and features needed to ensure privacy and security of personal information. These features address identity and access management, secure storage, secure messaging, encryption, and other security technologies and approaches. The GCR logistical survivor contact [CONTACT_473634]-outs and phone calls (i.e., messages left, call-backs) will be managed in accordance with HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164. All other data (i.e., website login and user-pattern data, telegenetic counseling logbook, online survey and discussion forums) will be collected via HIPAA compliant online platforms developed and managed by [CONTACT_473622]. All of the data will then be downloaded to Emory password protected, research network drives.
Peachtree solutions has three levels of safeguards built into their business approach:  
administrative, technical and physical to insure the security and privacy of sensitive data.  Administrative safeguards include annual risk assessments of the hosting environment and coding practices. Employees are trained annually on the proper handling of sensitive client data and secure coding techniques. Policies and procedures are reviewed on an annual basis and reviewed by [CONTACT_473635] a regular basis as a normal course of business.  All employees are background checked at the time of hire.  Technical safeguards include quarterly external vulnerability scanning, and access controls (e.g., unique user identification; emergency access procedures, automatic logoff, authentification, and encryption/decryption). Physical safeguards include contingency procedures for facility access in support of data restoration under the disaster recovery and emergency operations plan.  All data is stored in an ISO [ADDRESS_606850] confidentiality of the completed data will be maintained. A unique random identification 
number will be generated and assigned to each participants. These identification numbers will be used for all data analysis and kept separately from identifying information and accessible only by [CONTACT_3476]. Identifying information collected for participant recruitment (patient contact

protocols. Encryption will be used for all data in transit between the web browser and the server, all identifiable data at rest in the database, and all backups of the data. Access to decrypted identifiable data will be limited to a need-to-know basis for study team members. Any data collected for research will have identifiable data removed from the data set. All administrative accounts will have their own unique login (no shared logins). All data will be secured in password-protected computer files and reported at the group or aggregate level. Names will not be identified in any reports resulting from the research, and no individual information will be released to anyone outside of the project. Study personnel will be required to have IRB authorization which requires ongoing credentialing regarding procedures to maintain confidentiality. Research staff will also sign statements of confidentiality. Only necessary study personnel will have access to any of these files. Identifying information (phone numbers) will be deleted from all files at the end of the study period.Names will not be identified in any reports resulting from the research, and no individual information will be released to anyone outside of the project.

All consent materials used in the study will be developed in the 12-month planning stage. 
Prior to fielding the study, these materials will be submitted as an IRB amendment.
Aim 1 (community working groups):  The study team will collaborate with Community Advisory 
Boards (CAB) to identify 35-[ADDRESS_606852] referred individuals and complete a brief screener to determine eligibility for the working group, discuss the details of the working groups, explain that participation is voluntary, safety of privacy and confidentiality of protected health information, and confirm availability. Study research assistants will provide those who agree with a printed consent form and discuss any questions. Verbal consent will be obtained from participants. Those who participate in the working groups will receive $500 for attending 2-3 90-minute in-person meetings and some additional outside “homework”. 
Aim 2 (message-based intervention and waitlist standard outreach approaches):  The GCR will 
identify eligible cancer survivors and provide them with website access information. Upon entry to the study website, we will provide survivors with an explanation of the study and the opportunity to continue or to decline. The online consent form ends with the "I agree" checkbox so the participant can decide whether they still want to participate after reading the listed conditions. Those who agree to participate and include their mobile phone number will receive cueing SMS reminders from the study team. Survivors who select choice options that involve the study team doing outreach on the survivor’s behalf will receive an additional prompt to provide consent and contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., mailing address, email, phone number) of first and second degree relatives. Relatives, contact[CONTACT_473638] a unique website login that is linked to the survivor and enables access to a consent form on the study website that describes the study procedures, potential benefit and risks, privacy and confidentiality of protected health information. Same as survivors, relatives who click the “I agree” button on the informed consent webpage would indicate consent. Relatives in the MBI arm who log in to the website and are willing to provide a mobile phone number also will receive cueing SMS reminders from the study team. All relatives who consent to participate will be directed to complete B-RST
TM 
and the same tele-genetic counseling services. 
All survivors and relatives who log in to the website, regardless of whether they complete the 
tasks, will have access to the same pre-test telegenetic counseling. Survivors can opt for phone and/or video counseling via Emory HIPPA approved Zoom links. Participants will be asked to review online a genetic counseling consent form. The consent form will include information about the procedures of genetic counseling, potential benefits and risks, privacy and confidentiality of protected health information, and contact [CONTACT_473639]. Verbal consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_473640]. 
Aim 2 & 3 (post-intervention online survey): We will recruit survivors and relatives who log on 
to the study website regardless of their level of participation. We will post a study invitation letter and a one-time 20-minute survey on the study website and send the letter to survivors

and relatives with contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., mailing address, email, or mobile phone number) 
about 4 weeks after the intervention phase. The invitation letter will contain information about how to access the one-time online 20-minute survey. After participants click the “I agree” checkbox at the end of the online consent form, they will be directed to the online survey link. 
Aim 3 (mail survey to survivors who did not login to the study website): GCR will mail 
survivors a mail-out packet, which will include a survey cover letter (See “non-responder survey cover letter”), $10 cash, a postage-paid return envelope to return completed survey, and a 10-min survey (See “Non-responder survey draft”). Participants will be asked to review the cover letter that explains study procedures, voluntary nature of participation, and actions to protect their confidentiality. Participants may answer the questions online by [CONTACT_2329] a QR code or write their responses on the enclosed document and return it to GCR.
Aim 3 (online discussion forum):  We propose to purposefully sample survivors (~25) and 
relatives (~25) randomized to the MBI arm to participate. We will send invitations and identify a back-up individual from the waiting list, should the original invitee decline. Participants will receive information about how to participate in the online discussion forum via email/mail/phone/website postings. Participants will be asked to review the informed consent posted on the discussion forum. If they agree to participate, they will click the “I agree” button and be directed to the discussion forum. 
Aim 3 (re-engagement of working groups): After data analysis is complete (late Year 4), we will 
reengage community working groups from Aim [ADDRESS_606853] additional feedback. Participants will receive $50 for this meeting. Verbal consent will be obtained from participants.

Emory University is the ideal setting for the proposed study, as several key resources are 
uniquely poised to support the research outlined in this study. Below we provide an overview of the setting and several key resources and how they will contribute to, facilitate, or support the study .
Emory Rollins School of Public Health
The Rollins School of Public (RSPH) Health has six academic departments: Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Environmental Health, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], Health Policy and Management, and Global Health, and hosts over [ADDRESS_606854] research in areas such as developi[INVESTIGATOR_473573]. RSPH also draws strength from several unique local resources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, located next door) and the Carter Center. RSPH has a large and comprehensive research portfolio (over $90,000,000 in FY2015), with faculty receiving funding from a wide range of federal and non-federal sources. The Office of Research is available to facilitate faculty research, help identify funding opportunities, enhance the quality of applications for extramural research support, stimulate inter-departmental research, and provide resources and support for faculty research programs. RSPH faculty members provide a rich resource for consultation on analytic, medical, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_473574].
In 2010, RSPH more than doubled its physical size with the opening of the 190,000 square foot 
Claudia Nance Rollins building. The nine-story building was designed to achieve Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The GCR building, which opened in 1994, underwent a major renovation in 2010 to upgrade classrooms, computer rooms, and technology. The two buildings combined encompass 330,000 square feet total, providing ample office space to house study investigators and staff.
Behavioral Sciences and Health Education Department
The mission of the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education (BSHE) is to better 
the health of all people by [CONTACT_473641]'s leaders in how to change behavior and social conditions that influence health. BSHE offers a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree and a PhD. The MPH degree is geared toward students with an interest in multi-level behavior change interventions, social determinants of health and community engagement to enhance dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. BSHE’s PhD program is offered through Laney Graduate School, and trains students to identify, analyze, and intervene in today's most pressing health issues. 
Major areas of faculty expertise are: (1) the social determinants of health; (2) behavioral risk 
factor trajectories; (3) health education and behavioral interventions; and (4) implementation science.  Our research is funded by [CONTACT_473642] (e.g. NCI, NIEHS, NIAAA, NIDA, NIMH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Administration, Association of Schools of Public Health, and private foundations such as the American Legacy Foundation and Robert Wood

Network Environment
Rollins’ network consists of Fast Ethernet hardware running TCP/IP. Ten Gigabit Ethernet 
provides high-speed transmission to the Rollins campus buildings and all other buildings across campus. Ethernet provides high-speed (100 Mbps) access to most desktop computers and peripheral devices. The network terminates at over 2,[ADDRESS_606858] an extensive wireless network providing “N” class connections and speeds that cover all of our buildings and the nearby [CONTACT_473644]. This network has guest services as well as secure services for our faculty and staff.
Our voice communications are connected into a Unified Communications system that provides 
phones through VOIP and are integrated with our email systems for VMail access. All of the secured services inside our firewalls including network storage and other services can be access through the Emory VPN.
Desktop Computers
Currently, the analytical computers are at least a I7 CPU configuration with 8GB of RAM

Information Security
The Rollins School of Public Health information technology environment is a HIPAA-covered 
entity and complies with HIPAA and Emory information security and privacy policies and practices. In compliance with these policies and practices, Rollins aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publications (800 series) for identifying, assessing, and managing information security risk within a technology environment.
Drawing on federal and industry best practices, Rollins has implemented a series of multi-
layered security controls to protect the integrity, reliability, and confidentiality of data. A sample of the key security controls includes:
•An annual risk assessment of all Rollins information technology assets with their level of 
risk, potential impact, probability, and controls evaluated based on NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.
•Rollins and Emory networks are protected by [CONTACT_473645]. 
Rules on these devices are set to deny all traffic by [CONTACT_473646] "allows" are written as exceptions. These devices are updated as appropriate through Emory University's change management process and evaluated to ensure they provide the appropriate level of protection based on the sensitivity level of the data.
•Servers are housed within a secured network operating center (NOC). The NOC has 
environmental controls (fire, water, temperature), is accessible only through a two-factor authorization system (key card and passcode), and is accessible only by [CONTACT_473647]. In the event of a power outage, the NOC devices will draw UPS power from a backup generator.
•All servers are configured based on Rollins and Emory University best practices. Only 
authorized, trained system administrators have administrative privileges on the servers. System administrators monitor security mailing lists and sites and patch/update systems based on priority of the patch. All servers are periodically scanned for vulnerabilities and any identified vulnerabilities are assessed and managed.
•All information technology personnel go through background checks before gaining 
access to administrative privileges. At the point of termination with Emory, all information technology personnel's administrative privileges are removed.
•Protected health information (PHI) data and the services that manage them are stored 
on a separate network and server infrastructure with limited access and additional security controls.
•Data is backed up daily. Backups are stored in a tiered structure for disaster recovery 
purposes and include local, off-site, and out-of-state storage. Data stored off-site is encrypted to prevent compromise and can only be retrieved by [CONTACT_4144].
•Data written to any Rollins file servers is checked with server-based anti-virus software. 
Access to data is verified with a local single point of contact [CONTACT_473648]. Principal investigators are required to review access control lists each year to ensure continued accuracy.
•All Rollins desktops are configured based on best practices in the industry as well as 
those outlined in NIST SP 800-69 Guidance for Securing Microsoft Windows XP Systems for IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration Checklist. All Windows machines have

anti-virus software installed with updated virus signatures as well as the latest Microsoft 
XP Professional updates. Desktops require authentication from the Emory Active Directory to gain access to network services.
•Security policies are created and reviewed through the Woodruff Health Sciences Center 
HIPAA committee, the Emory University Technology Infrastructure and Policy committee, and local policies through the Rollins Information Technology Advisory committee.
Conference rooms
The Claudia Nance Rollins Building and Grace Crum Rollins Building have conference rooms that 
allow for the easy hookup of laptops and other computers to be displayed on a large LCD or a projected screen. Each conference room has access to the CATV systems as well. Audio conferencing is built into the room where no external sound units are required to hold a conference call. Each conference room has connectivity abilities for high-end video conferencing systems that are wheeled in on a cart. The cart provides a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473575]. The audio and video integrated in the room are also available for any PC hooked up to the systems so audio can be captured in the room and then used for PC-based video conferencing systems such as Skype.
Data protection and backup
We do full back ups of the HPC and servers once a week with incremental back ups on other 
nights. These back ups are kept for [ADDRESS_606860] snapshots taken nightly, which are kept for 30 days.
Email/Vmail
We use a central IT services resource using Microsoft Office365 for our email. Our email is 
considered sensitive, so we have policies in place that control automated routing of email and we use a central spam engine to control propagation of virus and spam attacks. Our phone voice mail system is integrated with our email, so voice mails automatically produce email audio files upon receipt.
Office
Secretarial and computer support (including fax, e-mail, Internet, color printing, scanning and 
photocopying) are available to all Public Health faculty. 
Other
Six campus libraries are available for use, including the Woodruff Library for Advanced Studies, 
and the Health Sciences Center Library. The university library system has access to thousands of journals and periodicals as well as, reference services which include computerized database searching.

Georgia Cancer Registry, Emory University
All of the necessary facilities and resources needed for this project are present at Emory University and are listed and described below.  The project requires office space for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27235]; supported desktop and server computing; and networking for all personnel.   This combination of needed facilities and resources was successfully used for our other very similar studies.  The specific facilities and resources of the Georgia Cancer Registry are described below.
We propose a population-wide recruitment approach and will use Georgia Cancer Registry 
(GCR) to retrospectively identify, screen, and enroll all living ovarian cancer patients in GA, diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2017. GCR contains information on demographic characteristics, condition at time of diagnosis (e.g., stage, histologic types, and other clinical and demographic variables), and treatment history of all cancer patients in GA.118 Since 2001, the database excludes borderline (low malignant potential) neoplasms. We will consider women in GCR for study participation if they meet four criteria: 1) diagnosed with ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal cancers; 2) lived in GA at the time of diagnosis; 3) are not deceased per the registry’s records; and 4) have a mailing address. Our review of registry files as of May 2019 revealed: of the 8,[ADDRESS_606862] 10.5 million residents; 1.8 million (~17%)119 residents live in rural areas.120 The state enjoys substantial racial-ethnic diversity: 32% of the state is Black or African American alone (4th largest African American population in the U.S.), 9.6% is Hispanic or Latino and 4.2% is Asian alone, 15% of the population lives in poverty, and 15% lack health insurance.119

Georgia CORE: Center for Oncology Research & Education georgiacore.org
[CONTACT_473666] is President of the Georgia CORE, a public-private partnership that connects 
cancer care providers, leaders, organizations, and advocates. Led by a Board of Directors of experts from cancer centers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473580], collaboration orchestrated by [CONTACT_473657], survivors, and caregivers.
In fact, connection and collaboration are at the core of everything we do . Georgia CORE builds 
and nurtures collaboration among people, organizations and institutions dedicated to improving cancer care in Georgia. Our statewide network is dedicated to generating creative, personalized resources. Because we are the only statewide organization working with such a vast array of groups, we are able to leverage public and private funding to provide greater impact and generate improved results.
One advantage of our collaborative efforts is being able to gather nearly all of Georgia’s 
resources and information related to cancer care in one place. In 2012, Georgia CORE created GeorgiaCancerInfo.org to catalog details on oncologists, clinical trials and treatment centers throughout the state, including resources and support services for survivors and caregivers, and best practices in survivorship care for oncology professionals.
As a result of the width, breadth and depth of our collaboration, Georgia CORE increases access 
to innovative cancer resources and research  to improve quality of care for patients and quality 
of life for survivors. Our work ensures equitable distribution of programs and research to Georgia’s minority, rural and underserved populations across the state. 
We also raise awareness about survivorship issues, and educate and engage survivors to help 
them achieve their best possible quality of life. At the heart of these efforts is the Cancer Survivorship Connection, within GeorgiaCancerInfo.org, where an online library of resources and interactive tools provide support to survivors and anyone involved with their care.
Through partnerships with oncologists, researchers, nurses, educators, navigators and 
survivors, Georgia CORE leads impactful programs and clinical trials  Funding from the National 
Cancer Institute, Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, Georgia Department of Public Health, Georgia Department of Community Health, Georgia Society of Clinical Oncology and others provides services, support, education and care in every corner of the state. Since the creation of our research network and statewide promotion of clinical trials, Georgia CORE has contributed to a seven-fold increase in the number of clinical trials in Georgia.

Cancer Patient Navigators of Georgia
Georgia is one of the first states in the country to form a statewide multi-disciplinary 
organization for Cancer Patient Navigators. This organization was formed in [ADDRESS_606873] people who guide individuals and their families throughout the cancer care continuum. Cancer Patient Navigators of Georgia (CPNG) is comprised of individuals who serve people with all types of cancer, at all stages, in all types of settings, with a diversity of education and training, but one shared mission. The mission of CPNG is to connect, educate and share best practices among patient navigators in Georgia, as well as to successfully reduce barriers and increase access to services specifically related to cancer.
www.GACancerPatientNavigators.org  has a “members only” section where cancer patient 
navigators across the state can share information and resources and join special interest groups 
within CPNG. Co-sponsored by [CONTACT_473660] (GASCO), CPNG has more than 275 members, including nurses, social workers and lay navigators.
In 2011, Tom and Karen Chapman contributed a $250,000 gift to expand patient navigation 
efforts in Georgia. To date, the gift has funded Georgia’s 1st Statewide Integrative Oncology Conference, a Lay Navigation Train-the-Trainer pi[INVESTIGATOR_29426], a Lay Navigation Training Module, and a research grant for navigation.

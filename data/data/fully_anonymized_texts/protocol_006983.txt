Product(s):
Arm A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (N3I1) IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses then 
flat dose nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks 
Arm B: nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg (N1I3) IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses then flat 
dose nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks.
Study Phase:   IIIb/ IV
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with N3I1 will show a reduced rate of drug-related Grade [ADDRESS_1048972] similar efficacy in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma.
Objectives : 
The primary  objective is to compare the incidence of drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg to nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive 
subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Key secondary  objectives include:
To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), as determined by [CONTACT_431], of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 1mg/kg combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive subjects 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma .
To evaluate progr ession free survi val (PFS) of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg and 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma.
To assess overall survival (OS)
To assess Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) using the European Organi sation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC QLQ -C30). 
Study Design :
This is a Phase IIIb/IV, randomized, double blinded, study of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
1mg/kg vs nivolumab 1 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_246695] 3 mg/kg in adult subjects with p reviously untreated, 
unresectable or metastatic m elanoma .

Known BRAF V600 mutation status as determined by [CONTACT_765307] 
V600 mutation testing per local institutional standards during the Screening Period, the results of which must be 
reported within 3 months of randomization. All BRAF statuses (BRAF wild -typeor BRAF 600 mutation positive)
are eligible .
Key Exclusion Criteria :
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases areeligible if these have 
been treated and there is no evidence of progression viamagnetic resonance imaging (MRI , except where 
contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) for at least [ADDRESS_1048977] also be no requirement for high doses of systemic
corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks 
prior to study drug administration.
Ocular melanoma

Solution for Injection100 mg (10 mg/mL) 10 mL per vial
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 200 mg (5 mg/mL) 40 mL per vial
Study Assessments : 
Adverse events will be collected to determine the incidence of drug -related adverse events between the two cohorts.
Subjects will be observed for tumor response ( ORRand P FS).
Subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_20420]  (CT) o r magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning Week 12 
(1 week) from randomization and continuing every 8weeks (1week )for the first 12 months andthen every 
12weeks (2week s) until disease progression.
Subjects will be followed for O verall survival (OS) after disease progression or after drug -discontinuation.
Patient reported outcomes will be collected using the EQ- 5D and EORTC QLQ -30
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: Approximately 346 subjects will be randomized to the 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio in order to target 
340 treated subjects (170 per arm). Given a two-sided alpha of 0.05, this number of treated subjects provides 80%

power to show a statistically significant difference in the rate of drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs between the two 
treatment arms, assuming a rate of 40% in Arm A and a rate of 55% in Arm B.
Endpoints: The primary  endpoint is the incidence of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AEs. 
The secondary endpoints of the study are investigator determined OR R, PFS, OS, and HRQoL.
Analyses:   For the primary analy sis, we will report the drug-related Grade 3 -5 AE rate by [CONTACT_2939], the 
difference in rates between arms, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Two -sided CMH test, stratified by 
[CONTACT_4002]-L1 expression and M stage at screening, will be performed to compare the rate of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AE rate 
between the two treatment arms.
ORRs and corresponding 95% exact Confidence Interval ( CI)s will be calculated using the Clopper Pearson method 
for each of the treatment arms. BOR will be tabulated for each treatment group. The 2 treatment arms will be compared 
using a two-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 expression and M stage at screening. 
Associated odds ratios and 95% CIs for Arm A relative to Arm B will be calculated , and a p -value will be pre sented 
for descriptive purposes . An estimate of the difference in ORRs and corresponding 95% CI will be calculated using 
CMH methodology.
PFS curves for each t reatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit method. Median PFS and 
corresponding two-sided, 95% confidence intervals will be computed. Descriptive Hazard Ratio and corresponding 
two sided 95% CIs for Arm A relative to Arm B will be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, with 
treatment group as a single covariate stratified by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression and M Stage at screening. PFS rates at 6 months 
with 95% CIs will be estimated using KM methodology. 
OS will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier methodology. Median values, along with two-sided 95% 
CIs will be calculated. EORTC QLQ -C30 scale data will be summarized by [CONTACT_765308].

(18 years) subjects with previously  untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Subjects 
must have unresectable or metastati c Stage III orstage IV melanoma, as per the AJCC staging 
system, and must not have received prior systemic therapy  for the treatm ent of unresectable or 
metastati c melano ma. 
Subjects will be rando mized 1:1 and stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 status and AJCC M stage as described 
below :
PD-L1 expression level
PD-L1 5% tumor cell surface expressio n (in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor 
cells) vs 
PD-L1 < 5% tum or cell surface expressi on (in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor

It is expected that 460 subjects will need to be enrolled in order to randomize 346, assuming a 
screen failure rate of 25%.
This study  will consist of 3phases: screening, treatment, and fo llow-up.
3.1.1 Screening Phase
Begins by [CONTACT_52225]’s init ial eligibi lity and si gning of the ICF.
Subject is enro lled using the I RT
Tumor tissue obtained in the metastatic setting or from  an unresectable site of disease must be 
provi ded for bi omarker analyses.  In order to be rando mized, a subject must have quant ifiable 
PD-L1 expressio n (5% or <5% tumor cell membrane staining) or be classified as PD-L1 
indeterminate . If an insufficient amount of tumor tissue fro m an unresectable or metastati c site 
is available prior to the start of the screening phase, subjects must consent to the acquisit ion of 
additional tumor tissue for perform ance of bio marker analyses .Previously

In the nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_765283], nivolumab is to be administered first.
Subjects shoul d receive nivolumab at a dose of 3mg/kg (Arm  A) or 1mg/kg (Arm  B) as a 
30-minute IV infusio n, on Day [ADDRESS_1049017] be prompt ly followed by a saline flush to clear the line o fnivolumab 
before starting the next infusio n.
Revised Protocol No: 04

occured.
Subjects should receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 1mg/kg (Arm  A) or at a dose of 3mg/kg (Arm B) 
as a 30-minute IV infusio n, on Day 1 of each treatm ent cycle every 3weeks (within 3calendar 
days of scheduled date)for [ADDRESS_1049019]. 
The ri sk/benefit profile for nivo lumab has primarily been invest igated using a [ADDRESS_1049020] 
been administered safely at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over these treatment durations. Overall, 
infusio n react ions including high-grade hypersensit ivity reacti ons have been uncomm on across 
multiple clinical studi es, and all have been managed b y following the safet y algori thms. Infusi on 
durati on of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not 
expected to present any safet y concerns compared with the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivo lumab 
dose infused over the 60-minute duration.  Similarly, shortened infusion durat ion of 30 minutes

study , hypersensit ivity/infusio n react ions were listed as 3.2% for the combination and 2.2% for 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  No Grade3 or Grade4 hypersensit ivity/infusio n reacti ons were observed in either 
the combination or single agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_765285] .25  
Subjects shoul d be carefully  monitored for infusion reacti ons during nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_551201]. If an acute infusio n reacti on is noted, subjects shoul d be managed according to 
Secti on4.4.
The pharmacy manual includes detailed instructions for study  medicat ion preparation .  
Dosing calculat ions should be based on the body  weight assessed at screening . It is not necessar y 
to re-calculate subsequent doses if the subject weight is wit hin 10% of the weight used to calculate 
the previous dose. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. 
During Part 1, subjects may be dosed no less than 19days between doses. If dosing is delayed,

For the subjects who continue study therapy beyo nd progression, further progression is defined as 
an addit ional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum o f 5 mm abso lute increase from t ime 
of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the 
diameters of new measurable lesio ns compared to the time of initial PD. Treatment with study 
medicat ion shoul d be di scontinued perm anent ly upon documentation of further progression.
New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progress ion may 
beco me measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely  due to 
inclusio n of new lesions which beco me measurable, these new lesio ns must demonstrate an
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standard s and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s (mild reacti on; infusio n interruption not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recom mended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1049037] 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy  or infusi on interrupti on but responds 
prom ptly to symptom atic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal antiinflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):
Stop the study  drug infusio n, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and treat the subject wi th 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetam inophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until  resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no furthe r complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the ori ginal  infusi on rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further study 
medicat ion will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following pr ophylactic prem edicat ions are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l [ADDRESS_1049038] 30 minutes before nivo lumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_765293]. If

4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
The sponsor, subjects, investigator, and site staff will be blinded to th e study  drug administered 
during Part 1 (Combinat ion Portion) of the study . Each invest igative site must assign an unblinded 
pharmacist/designee, and an unblinded site monitor will be assigned by [CONTACT_765320] r unblinded study documentation.
During Part 2 (monotherapy  portion), [ADDRESS_1049041]’s treatm ent assigned arm during Part [ADDRESS_1049042]'s management, the blind for that subject may be broke n by [CONTACT_3170]. The 
subject’s safet y takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatm ent 
assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an indiv idual subject's treatm ent, the invest igator shoul d determine
that the unblinded informat ion is necessary, ie, that it will alter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the 
investigat ional product , theproblem may be properly  managed by [CONTACT_82745] . It is highly  desirable that the decision to unblind treatm ent assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Moni tor, but the investigator al ways has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblin d. The Principal Invest igator should only call in for emergency unblinding 
AFTER the decisio n to di scont inue the subject has been made .
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through IRT. For 
inform ation on how to unblind form emergency, please consult the IRT manual.
In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact [CONTACT_765321] .
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes shoul d be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor .
Designated staff of Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Devel opment may be unblinded prior to 
database lock to facilitate the bioanalyt ical analysis of pharmacokinetic samples and 
immunogenicit y. A bioanaly tical scientist in the Bioanaly tical Sciences departm ent of 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development (or a designee in the external central bioanalyt ical 
laboratory ) will be unblinded to the randomized treatm ent assignments in order to minimize 
unnecessary  bioanaly tical analysis o f samples .

At baseline, a medical history  will be obtained to capture relevant underlying condi tions. The 
baseline examinat ions shoul d include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate ( HR)andtemperature should be performed within [ADDRESS_1049058] dose through the 
study  treatm ent peri od (see Table 5.1 -1).
Baseline local laboratory  assessments shoul d be done within 14 days prior to th e randomizatio n

Free T4, Free T3, a nd Hep B and C testing (HBV sAg and HCV RNA or Ab) (see Table 5.1 -1). 
Pregnancy testing for WOCBP (done locally) must be per formed within 24 hours prior to theinitial 
administration of study drug at baseline and then every 3 weeks during Part 1, every 4weeks 
during Part 2, and at the safet y follow up visit s (Foll ow up visi ts 1 and 2).
Subjects will be evaluated for safet y if they have received any study  drug. Toxicit y assessments
will be continuous during the treatm ent phase. During the safet y follow-up phase (Table 5.1-4),
toxicity assessments shoul d be done in person. Once subjects reach the survival  follow-up phase, 
either in-person visits or documented telephone calls to assess the subject’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory  values will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE versio n 4.0.

pulmo nary assessment at screening ). If there are any new or worsening clinically  significant 
changes since the last exam, report changes on the appropriate non-seriousor serious adverse event  
page.
During Part 1, on- study  local laboratory  assessments should be done wit hin 72 hours prior to each 
dose and include: CBC w/different ial, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), 
BUN or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, LDH, glucose, amylase, lipase, TSH with

[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesio ns must be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_1049063]/MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461]  (lesio ns which cannot be accurately measured
with calipers shoul d be recorded as nonmeasurable)
[ADDRESS_1049064] x-ray.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered patho logically  enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be [ADDRESS_1049065] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow up, only the short axis willbe measured 
and fo llowed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable L esions 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly  non-measurable lesio ns.
Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial  effusio n, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung,

[IP_ADDRESS] Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone Lesions
Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed lyt ic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue co mponents, that 
can be evaluated by  [CONTACT_198277] y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
Cystic Lesions
Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts shoul dnot be considered 
as malignant lesio ns (neit her measurable nor non -measurable) since they are by [CONTACT_154020], simple 
cysts.
“Cystic lesio ns”thought to represent cyst ic metastases can be considered as measurable lesio ns, if 
they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y described above. However, if noncyst ic lesio ns are 
present in the same subject, these are preferred for select ion as target lesio ns.
Non-measurable Lesions
Tumor lesio ns situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to locoreg ional 
therapy , are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesio n.
5.4.3 Specifications for Method of Measurement
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline eva luations should be 
perform ed as close as possible to the treatm ent start and never more than 28 days before the 
beginning of treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique shoul d be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be done rather than clinical examinat ion unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  [CONTACT_461] .
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI Scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumpt ion that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1049066] slice thickness greater th an 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesio n shou ld be twice the slice thickness.

[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X -Ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest x-ray, particularly when progressi on is an important endpoint
since CT is more sensit ive than x -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesio nson 
chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by[CONTACT_14238].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical L esions
Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and [ADDRESS_1049067] ive and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound
Ultrasound is not useful in the assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_251634] , confi rmation 
by [CONTACT_462] i s advised. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is not advised .
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Markers
Tumor markers such as, but not limited to, LDH may be used for clinical management, but will 
not be included in the assessment of BOR.
5.4.4 Baseline Documentation of "Target” and “Non -Target Lesions”
[IP_ADDRESS] Target L esions 
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum o f five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline.
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calcul ated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum , then as noted bel ow, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tum or regression in
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
Previously  treated CNS metastases are not considered measurable lesions for purposes of 
RECIST 1.1 determined response.

[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of
15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis o f thesenodes will contribute to the baseline sum.
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non -pathol ogical and should not be recorded 
or fo llowed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesio ns should be fo llowed as “present ”, “absent ”, or in rare cases “unequivocal  progressi on”. 
In addit ion, it is possible to record mult iple non -target lesio ns invo lving the same organ as a single 
item on the case report form (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes ”or “multiple liver 
metastases ”).  
5.4.5 Tumor E valuation
Evaluat ion of Target Lesions
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Parti al Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum o f diameters of target lesio ns, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study ). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate anabsolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).
Stable Disease (SD) :Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Target L esions that Become “Too Small to Measure”
All lesio ns (nodal  and non-nodal ) recorded at baselin e shoul d have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radio logist is able 
to provi de an actual  measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target Lesions that Split or Co alesce on Treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be
added together to calculate the target lesio n sum.
As lesio ns coalesce, a plane between them maybe maintained that would aid in obtaining maxi mal 
diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesio ns have truly coalesced such that the y 
Revised Protocol No: 04
Date: 20-Feb-[ADDRESS_1049068] di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluati on of Non -target Lesions
While so me non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
shoul d be assessed only qualitat ively at the time points specified in the protocol.
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesio n(s) above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression of exist ing non-target l esions (Note: the appearance of one or m ore 
new lesio ns is also considered progression).
[IP_ADDRESS] Unequivocal Progression in Non -target Disease
To achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substant ial worsening in non-target disea se such that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall  tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discontinuati on 
of therapy .
A mo dest ‘increase’ in the size o f one or more non -target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status.
[IP_ADDRESS] New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesio ns denotes disease progressi on. The finding of a new lesion 
shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new”
bone lesio ns may be simply healing or flare of preexist ing lesio ns. This is particularly  important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis o f a 
liver l esion may be reported on a CT scan reported as a “new”cysticlesio n, which it is not.
A lesio n ident ified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will ind icate di sease progressi on. An example of this is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered whic h 
reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she di d not have brain imaging at baseline.

[IP_ADDRESS] Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time po int, the subject is not evaluable 
(NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesio n measurements are made at an assessment, the 
case is also consi dered NE at that time point, unl ess a convincing argum ent can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) woul d not have changed the assigned time- point 
response.
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmation of Scan 
Verificat ion of Response: As per RECIST 1.1, confirmat ion of response is required for trials wit h 
response as a primary  endpoint but is no longer requi red in rando mized studi es since the control 
arm serves as appropriate means of inter pretati on of data. Hence, confirmat ion is NOT required.27
Verificat ion of Progressi on: Progressi on of  disease shoul d be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered not to have 
progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Best Overall Response
The BOR is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is defined as the best response 
design ation, as determined by [CONTACT_3170], recorded between the date ofrandomization and 
the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST1.[ADDRESS_1049069]’s best overall 
response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also 
take into consideration the appear ance of new lesio ns.

5.6.1 Tumor Tissue Specimen 
Pre-treatm ent tum or tissue specimens in the form of a paraffin embedded bl ock or a minimum of
10 unstained slides will be submitted for central PD -L1 immunohistochemistry  (IHC) assessment
prior to randomizat ion. These biopsy samples shoul d be excisio nal, incisio nal, punch or core
needle. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_765300]. PD -L1 stained tissue sect ions will be assessed by a patho logist and scored as
PD-L1 expressio n 5% or PD -L1 expressio n <5% based on the frequency o f tumor cell  surface 
PD-L1 staining among a minimum of ahundred (100) evaluable tumor cells. Where membrane 
staining is obscured by [CONTACT_765325] c ontent, but the tumor tissue sample 
contain the minimum number of evaluable tumor cells, samples will be deem ed PD-L1 
indeterminate.
Tumor sam ples will be stained for PD -L1 by  [CONTACT_765326] a pathologist for tumor and immune cell membrane expressio n of PD -L1. These tumor samples 
may also be assessed for the expression o f other immune or melano ma related genes, RNAs and/or 
proteins, as well as, the presence of immune cell populat ions using a variet y of methodol ogies 
inclusive of, but not limited to IHC, qRT-PCR, genet ic mutation detection ,fluorescent in-situ 
hybridizat ion (FISH) and exo me sequencing. Various m olecular markers with potential predict ive

of measuring tum or PD -L1 expressio n may also be assessed.
Tumor tissue samples may also be collected upon progression . This sample may be used for the 
assessment of markers implicated in resistance to immunotherapeutic agents, including but not 
limited to other T cell checkpo int receptors and ligands (eg, Lag-3, Tim-3) and intratumoral

inform ation from other nivo lumab or i pi[INVESTIGATOR_229]. 
5.6.4 Whole Blood for SNP Assessment
Who le blood samples for exploratory  pharm acogenet ic assessment will be collected from all
subjects and put in frozen storage. Genomic DNA will be extracted and subsequent ly assessed for 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genet ic var iations in genes that may predispose 
subjects to nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_765303] (unless restri cted by [CONTACT_306022].) Such genes include, but are not limited to PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 andCTLA -4.

associ ations with clinically -relevant biomarkers ident ified by [CONTACT_765327].
5.6.5 Myeloid -Derived Suppressor cells
Myel oid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an immune cell populat ion capable of suppressing 
T cell activation and proliferat ion. Low pre-treatment MDSC levels in peripheral blood may be 
associ ated with better overall survival in melano ma patients treated with the immunotherapeutic 
agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].28MDSCs will be measured at baseline and on-treatm ent to assess 
pharmacodynamic changes or associ ations with outcome (see Secti on5.6.3 for addit ional details 
on the blood sample co llection schedule).

commo nly used QoL instrument in advanced melano ma c linical studies. It is a 30 -item instrument  
that has gained wide acceptance in onco logy clinical  studies. The EORTC QLQ -C30 comprises 
6functional scales (physical functioning, cogni tive funct ioning, emotional functioning, social 
funct ioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom  scales (fatigue, pain, 
nausea/vo miting, dyspnea, insomnia, appeti te loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial 
difficult ies). Except for the overall  health status and gl obal quali ty of life items, responses for all 
items are 4-point categori cal scales ranging fro m 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very  much). The overall healt h 
status/qualit y of life responses are 7- point Likert scales.
General health status will be measured using the EQ -5D. The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument 
for use as a m easure of self -reported heal th status. The EQ -5D comprises 5 dimensio ns (mobilit y, 
self-care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort and anxiet y) and a visual analog rating scale (VAS). 
The utilit y data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and commo nly used in cost 
effect iveness analysis.
The EQ -5D will be administered along wit h the EORTC QLQ -C30 during on -study  phases (Part s
1and 2) as outlined in Sect ion5.1, to all subjects. 
Healthcare resource utilizat ion data (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], non-protocol  specified medical visits, 
diagnosti cs, etc) will be collected for all randomized subjects. The resource utilizat ion capture is 
specific to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765304]-protocol  specified visits related to study 
therapy . Resource utilization questi ons will be collected on-study  phases (Part s 1and 2) as outlined 
in Section 5.1, to all subjects.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject ad ministered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnorm allaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence t o suggest a causal relat ionship.
Revised Protocol No: 04
Date: 20-Feb-[ADDRESS_1049075]. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorit ies and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475030] (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.7for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_186770], these events mustbe handled as SAEs.(See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is consider ed related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SA E (see Secti on 6.1.1 for reporting details ).

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures .All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within
[ADDRESS_1049076] be 
collected that relate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether relat ed or not rel ated to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_1049077] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Con tactInformat ion list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi red method f or reporti ng.  In the event the el ectroni c system  is unavailable for transmissio n, 
Revised Protocol No: 04

If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are requi red. (Not e: Follow -up 
SAE reports mustinclude the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resol ution or stabilization.
A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse React ion) is a subset of SAEs and will be 
reported to the appropriate regulatory  authori ties and invest igators following local and global 
guidelines and requirements.

Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or d iscont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
6.3 Immune -mediated Adverse Events
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
whic h were exacerbated by [CONTACT_186756] y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the subject’s case report form.

6.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potenti al DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ngdetails).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as:

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
Approximately  346 subjects will be rando mized to the 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 rati o in order to 
target 340 treated subjects (170 per arm ). Given a two -sided alpha of 0.05, this number of treated 
subjects provides 80% power to show a statistically significant difference in the rate of 
drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs between the two treatm ent arms, assuming a rate of 40% in Arm A 
and a rate of 55% in Arm B.
We assume that treatm ent with N3I1 (Arm  A) will resul t in a 15% reducti on in the rate of 
drug-related Grade 3 -5 events when compared to treatm ent with N1I3 (Arm  B). The difference 
of 15% is clinically  meaningful  and assumes a 40% event rate in Arm  A and a 55% event rate in 
Arm B. The assumpti on of  55% in Arm B is based on observed rates of drug -related Grade 3 - 5 
AEs in the combinat ion arm of studies CA209069 and CA209067, which enrolled the same patient  
popul ation as the current study  (previ ously untreated metastati c melano ma). The assumed 
reducti on to 40% in Arm A corresponds to the same rate ratio (0.727) that was observed in Cohort 
2a relative to Cohort 2 in S tudy CA209004.

Table 8.1 -1shows the precisi on that the sample size of 170 treated subjects per arm  will provide 
for estimat ing adverse event rates (primary  endpoint) or objective response rates (secondary 
endpo int), under different assumed observed rates. 
For example, if exactly 68 of 170 treated subjects (40%) experience a drug- related Grade 3 -5 AE 
in Arm A and 94 of 170 treated subjects (55.3%) experience a drug -related Grade [ADDRESS_1049085] 95% CI for the rate of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AEs will be (32.6%, 47.8%) for 
Arm A and (47.5%, 62.9%) for Arm B. 
Furtherm ore, if exact ly 102 of 170 treated subjects (60%) experience an object ive response in a 
treatm ent arm , then the exact 95% CI f or the ORR in that treatm ent arm  will be (52.2%, 67.4%). 
If the observed ORR is exact ly the same in each arm and equal to 60%, then the 95% CI for the 
difference in ORR between arm s will  be (-10.4%, 10.4%), and the 95% CI for the odds rati o will 
be (0.65, 1.54).

1.0 Study Summary  
Title:  Effect of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Background : Sepsis is one of the most common causes of acute  illness and death in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Early, e mpi[INVESTIGATOR_132327] -spectrum antibiotics are a mainstay of sepsis treatment . Two classes of antibiotic s 
with activity against Pseudomonas , anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti -pseudomonal penicillins,  
are commonly used for acutely ill adults with sepsis in current practice. Recent observational studies, 
however, have raised concern that anti-pseudomonal penicillin s may cause  renal toxicity. Anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins, by [CONTACT_2163], ma y be associated with a risk of neurotoxicity.  Rigorous , 
prospective d ata regarding the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of these two classes of medications 
among acutely ill patients are lacking. We propose a randomized trial comparing the impact of  anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins  and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  on renal outcomes of  acutely ill patients.  
Primary Aim:  
- To compare the effect  of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus  anti-pseudomonal penicillins on the 
incidence of acute kidney  injury among  acutely ill patients  
Primary Hypothesis:  
- Among acutely  ill patients with sepsis, use of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins  will decrease the 
incidence of acute kidney  injury  (AKI) , compared to anti-pseudomonal penicillins . 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age ≥ 18 years old  
2. Located in a participating emergency department or  medical  intensive care  unit  
3. Less than 12 hours  from presentation to study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
4. Treating clinician initiat ing an order for  an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal 
penicillin   
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Known receipt of > [ADDRESS_996027] known prior resistant infections or suspected sepsis with an associated 
central nervous system infection   
Consent:  
- Given that both anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  are routinely used 
in usual care , the lack of established risk or benefit with either treatment group , the impracticability of 
obtaining informed consent prior to initiating antibiotics for acutely ill patient s, a waiver of informed 
consent will be reques ted. 
Randomization : 
- Using a  best-practices advisor embedded within the electronic health record, patients meeting all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to receive an anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin ( treating clinicians’ choice of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729379] ) or anti-
pseudomonal penicillin . 
Study Interventions:  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
- Anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin  group : patients assigned  to the anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin 
group will receive the treating clinicians’ choice of  either cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729380] .   
- Anti-pseudomonal penicillin  group : patients assigned  to the anti-pseudomonal penicillin  group will 
receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam  or ticarcillin -clavulanate .  
- For patients in both groups, treating clinicians will determine the dose and duration of the assigned 
antibiotic class.  An EHR -based advisor will alert treating clinicians of group assignment and collect 
data regarding any adverse events and the reason fo r modification or discontinuation of antibiotics  in 
the 7 days after randomization  
Primary Efficacy Outcome:  
- The primary outcome will be the highest stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) between enrollment and 
14 days after enrollment .  Stage of AKI will be defined by [CONTACT_195917]: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI creatinine criteria .  Death will be classified as worse than the highest stage 
of AKI .  The outcome will be defined using the following [ADDRESS_996028] value (0 = alive without having experienced AKI) to the highest value (4 = died).  
o 0 = No AKI  
o 1 = Stage 1 AKI  (Creatinine increase by 1.5 -1.9 times baseline OR increase by >= 0.3  
mg/dL ) 
o 2 = Stage 2 AKI  (Creatinine increase by 2.0 -2.9 times baseline)  
o 3 = Stage 3 AKI  (Creatinine increase by >= 3.0 times baseline OR increase to >= 4.0 mg/dL 
OR New RRT)  
o 4 = Death  
 
Exploratory Outcome s: 
- Exploratory Renal Outcomes : acute kidney injury of stage [ADDRESS_996029] creatinine level, the final creatinine 
level , and dialysis depende nce at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . 
- Exploratory N eurologic Outcomes: Glasgow Coma Scale  score during the 14 days after enroll ment , 
neurologic component of SOFA score , Coma and Delirium Free Days in 14 days  after enrollment  
- Exploratory Clinical Outcomes: ICU -free days, ventilator -free days, vasopressor -free days , 
interaction between patients admitted to the ICU vs ward  
 
Sample Size  Considerations:  
- Using data obtained from 820 patients during the creation and testing of the enrollment advisor , we 
measured the distribution of outcomes expected among patients in the anti -pseudomonal penicillin 
group.  W e calculated that enro lling 2,050 patients would provide 80% power  at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996030] -spectrum antibiotics,  for patients with presumed sepsis  in the emergency 
department  and intensive care unit2,4. Since the specific organism caus ing an infection is rarely known at 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
clinical presentation, empi[INVESTIGATOR_132327] -spectrum antibiotics are commonly prescribed5. For patients at risk 
for resistant organisms, the most common regimens include vancomycin (to cover gram -positive 
organisms including methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus  aureus) and an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin 
or anti-pseudomonal penicillin  (to cover gram -negative organisms includ ing Pseudomonas ).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_996031] 
this approach given the lack of randomized trials comparing the relative efficacy and safety of the two 
agents as well as observational data suggesting th at cephalosporins may be associated with neuro -
toxicity7–9. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_996032] spectrum coverage at many 
centers, and p iperacillin -tazobactam, specifically, has the added benefit of treating  anaerobic organisms.   
Conversely, penicillins do not cover meningitis due to poor central nervous system penetration.   
 
2.3 Acute Kidney Injury during Critical Illness  
Acute Kidney In jury (AKI) i s a common complication of ICU admission. AKI is associated with a six to 
eight fold increase in mortality in ICU populations , 10,[ADDRESS_996033] common cause 
of AKI and accounts for 40 -50% of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU)14,15. As the primary treatment for 
the underlying cause of sepsis, antibiotics are a critical treatment for acutely  ill patients, but antibiotics 
may cause renal injury, and renally -cleared antibiotics may reach supratherapeutic levels in the setting of 
AKI.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_996034] examined a potential association between the concurrent administration of vancomycin and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam and the development of AKI, compared with vancomycin alone18–21. These data, 
however, are likely to be confounded by [CONTACT_729442][INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam causes more AKI than other anti -pseudomonal antibiotics  have been inconclusive .18,22 –30.  
Studies that limited their analyses to the first 72 hours of treatment (when antibiotic choices are empi[INVESTIGATOR_729381]), have not shown any  association between pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam and kidney injury31.

Based on this preliminary, observational data, however, some institutions  have elected to change their 
preferred broad spectrum anti biotic regimens from one including  an anti-pseudomonal  to one including an 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_996035] toxicities that may be relevant for acutely  ill patients. Because 
the relationship between antibiotic choice ( anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins  or anti-pseudomonal 
penicillins ) and clinically relevant outcomes, such as AKI, are unknown, clinical trial data is urgently 
needed.  Rigorous high -quality evidence that anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins, compared to anti -
pseudomonal penicillins, decreases, increases or has no impact on the risk of AKI would have the 
potential to change the care received by [CONTACT_729443].  
 
To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a prospective, randomized trial of acutely ill adults  
undergoing initiation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_729382], comparing anti -pseudomonal 
cephalosporins vs anti-pseudomonal  penicillins  with regard to renal outcomes.   
3.[ADDRESS_996036]  of an  anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin , compared to an anti -pseudomonal 
penicillin , on the incidence of acute kidney injury among acutely ill patients, a randomized trial is needed.  
Study Aims:  
- Primary:  
o To compare the effect of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus anti-pseudomonal 
penicillins  on the incidence of acute kidney injury among a cutely ill patients  
- Secondary:  
o To compare the effect of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins vs anti-pseudomonal penicillins  
on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ICU length of stay, and ventilator days  
Study Hypotheses  
- Primary  Hypothesis : 
o The use of anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins, compared to the use of anti-pseudomonal 
penicillins , will decrease the incidence of acute  kidney injury  among acutely  ill adults

treating provider.  Data will be collected prospectively from the medical record to determine the effect of 
the assigned interventions on procedural, physiologic, and clinical outcomes.  
 
5.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age ≥ 18 years old  
2. Located in a participating emergency department or medical intensive care unit  
3. Less than 12 hours from presentation to study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
4. Treating clinician initiating an order for an anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal 
penicillin   
5.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Known receipt of > [ADDRESS_996038] known prior resistant infections or suspected sepsis with an associated 
central nervous system infection   
6.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
6.1 Study Site s: 
Emergency Department  and Medical Intensive Care Unit  at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
6.2 Study Population:   
All adults with sepsis located in a participating unit for whom the treating clinician orders either  an anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti-pseudomonal penicillin within 12 hours  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729383]. All eligible patients will be included and there will be no 
selection based on  gender, race, weight or other clinical factors.  
 
6.3 Enrollment:  
At the time that  a treating clinician in a participating emergency department or medical intensive care unit 
initiates an o rder for  an anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin  for a patient who 
meets all inclusion criteria, an advisor within the electronic health record (details in section 7) will prompt 
treating clinicians to record whether the patient me ets any exclusion criteria.  Patients not meeting any 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized .  For patients who are determined to be ineligible , the 
advisor will track the number and reasons for exclusion.  The time of randomization will be def ined as 
“time zero” on “study day 0.”

Figure 6: Enrollment Schema  – When a treating clinician orders an anti -pseudomonal 
cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin , tools within the electronic health record (details in 
section 7) will evaluate if the patient meets inclusion criteria ( order placed within 12 hours  of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135291] , age ≥ 18, and located in a participating unit ), and the presence of 
documented allergy to penicillin or cephalosporins (an exclusion criteria).  If the patient has not 
been previously enrolled  in the trial during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], appears to meet all inclusion  
criteria , does not have a  documented a llergy to penicillin or cephalosporins , an ordering advisor 
will prompt the clinician to determine whether the patient meets any exclusion criteria. If the 

Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
treating clinician confirms that the patient does meet an exclusion criterion, the patient will be 
enrolled and randomized.  The ordering advisor will track all exclusions.  
 
6.4 Consent:  
Anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  are routinely used in the care of 
acutely ill patients with sepsis in the emergency department and intensive care units at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center.  Currently, choice of empi[INVESTIGATOR_447962] -negative coverage is based primarily on 
provider preference as there are no large randomized trials  or evidence -based guideline s to support the 
choice of one empi[INVESTIGATOR_105481] -pseudomonal therapy for sepsis over another.  The concept of a randomized 
trial comparing anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus anti-pseudomonal penicillins  has been discussed 
with the leader s of emergency department and intensive care units and representation from the infectious 
disease s and nephrology  program s who agree that clinical equipoise exist s regarding the choice of empi[INVESTIGATOR_729384]-pseudomonal therapy for acutely ill adults with sepsis . 
 
Because the interventions studied (1) are used as a part of routine care, (2) are interventions the patient 
would be exposed to even if not participating in the study, (3) have no prior high-quality data to suggest 
the superiority of one approach over the oth er, and (4) are equivalent options from the perspective of the 
treating provider  (otherwise the patient is excluded) , we feel the study presents minimal risk . 
 
In addition to the minimal risk posed by [CONTACT_1758], obtaining informed consent prior to particip ation 
would not be feasible or practicable.  Sepsis is a medical emergency.  E ach hour of delay in the initiation 
of antibiotics  for acutely  ill patients with  sepsis increase s mortality  by [CONTACT_2902]  7%.  For patients presenting 
with sepsis to the participating units, the average time between initiation of an order for an anti -
pseudomonal antibiotic and its administration to the patient is 28 minutes.  Obtaining prospective written 
informed consent during this interval is impracticable and risks del aying antibiotic administration.  
Moreover , acutely ill patients  with sepsis  are commonly delirious or unconscious , and a legally authorized 
representative (LAR) is not consistently  present at the time of initiation of antibiotics.   Because the trial 
deter mines choice of the initial anti -pseudomonal antibiotic, but defers decisions regarding subsequent 
doses of antibiotics (e.g., duration of therapy, escalation, de -escalation) to treating clinicians, the primary 
study procedure will be completed within [ADDRESS_996039] a waiver of informed consent.  
 
6.5 Randomization :  
A series of study group assignments will be generated by [CONTACT_729444] a 1:1 ratio of 
intervention to control .  Study group assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and treatment 
team until after the study team has confirmed that the patient does not meet any exclusion criteria and the 
patient has been enrolled.   Following randomization , treating clinici ans will be notified via the ordering 
advisor.

7.[ADDRESS_996040] (EHR)  Based Screening for Eligible Patients  
For the duration of the study, when a provider initiates an order for the administration of an intravenous 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin  or anti-pseudomonal penicillin , a software application in  the EHR will 
assess if the patient is eligible for the study. The application will assess that the patient meets all the 
inclusion criteria (located in study unit, age ≥ 18, in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_701840] 12 hours , and has not been 
previously enrolled during the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  and none of the exclusion criteria  (current documented 
allergy to cephalosporin  or penicillin class a ntibiotics , more than one prior administration of study 
antibiotic s during the last 7 days ). If the above criteria are met, an order advisor  (Figure 7) will : 1) Inform 
the provider of the study, 2) solicit the presence of contraindications to either study drug, 3) (if patient 
meets all eligibility criteria)  enroll and randomize the patient.  If there are contraindications which were 
not established electronica lly, the advisor will ask the provider to select the reason.  
 
 
Figure 7: Order advisor informing providers of the study and soliciting other exclusion criteria  
 
7.2 Antibiotic Ordering after Randomization  
Once the participant is enrolled and randomized, the ordering advisor will guide the provide r to the order 
one of the assigned study antibiotic s. Dose, frequency, and duration  will be at the discretion of treating 
clinicians  and not affected by [CONTACT_729445].  
 
7.3 EHR -Based Tool to Capture Data on Antibiotic Modification and Adverse Events   
In the 7 days after enrollment, if a clinician attempts the discontinue the study -related antibiotic order , an 
EHR-based advisor will remind  the clinician of the treatment arm  and if the treating clinician chooses to 
discontinue the antibiotic from the assigned group,  the clinician  will be asked for the rationale:  
- Antibiotic tailoring (escalation or de -escalation) based on microbiologic data  
- Undocumented or newly apparent allergy  to either penicillin s or cephalosporins

- Treating clinicians feel that either anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti-pseudomonal penicillins 
are superior in the optimal treatment of the patient (provide reason why)  
- Other (provide r input rationale )

data for monit or for adverse events occurring in the seven days after randomization .  The advisor will not 
impede the ability to change classes of antibiotic and will be used primarily for safety monitoring .  
 
7. 5 Blinding:  
It would be impractical to pursue blinding f or the study. The medicines involved in this study are given at 
different doses with varying volumes of IV infusion . They are also given on different schedules varying 
as widely as 4 times a day to once daily. Furthermore , these dosing variations are impacted by [CONTACT_712085] . Given the nature of the study intervention, patients, clinicians, and investigators will not be 
blinded to group assignment.   
 
8.0 Data Collection:  
 
8.1 In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77176]:  
Primary Efficacy Outcome: Acute Kidney Injury  Score  between randomization and day 14 . The acute 
kidney injury score is an ordinal outcome containing the stages of AKI as defined by [CONTACT_729447] , new renal replacement therapy (RRT),  and death:  
 
0 = No AKI  
1 = Stage 1 AKI (Creatinine increase by 1.5 -1.9 times baseline OR increase by >= 0.3  mg/dL ) 
2 = Stage 2 AKI (Creatinine increase by 2.0 -2.9 times baseline)  
3 = Stage 3 AKI (Creatinine increase by >= 3.0 times baseline OR increase to >= 4.0 mg/dL  OR 
New RRT ) 
4 = Death  
 
Death is defined as in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729385], censored at 14 days. 
New RRT is defined as receipt of RRT at any point between ICU admission and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
censored at 14 days.  Baseline creatinine level will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a previously described 
hierarchical approach in which creatinine values obtained d uring the year before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729386] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729387] . When no pre -enrollment 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
measurements are available , the baseline creatinine level is estimated with a previously described thre e-
variable formula32,33. It is important to note that those patients with End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
would only be eligible to meet the “Death” component of the primary outcome.  
 
Justification for the Primary Efficacy Outcome  
This outcome is 1) validated for electronic assess ment, 2) uses outcome  thresholds for  renal dysfunction  
defined by [CONTACT_729448], 3) incorporat es patient -centered outcomes (new RRT 
and death) that would be missed by a purely laboratory -based outcome , and 4) uses a hierarchal approach 
to analysis that counts rare but important patient -centered outcomes (new RRT, death) as worse than 
purely laboratory -based measures (stage 2 AKI) .  
 
Exploratory  Outcomes :  
- Exploratory Renal Outcomes: acute kidney injury of stage [ADDRESS_996042] creatinine level, and the final creatinine level before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
- Exploratory Neurologic Outcomes: Glasgow Coma Scale  (GCS) score during the 28 days after 
enrollment, neurologic component of SOFA score , Coma and Delirium Free Days in 28 days after 
enrollment  
- Exploratory Clinical Outcomes: ICU -free days, ventilator -free days, vasopressor -free days , 28-day 
mortality , 14-day mortality , interaction between outcomes of patients admitte d to the ICU vs wards  
 
8.2 Baseline  data:  
Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, race, APACHE II score, active medical problems at the 
time of admission, active comorbidities, comorbidities  and medications  known to increase risk of kidney 
or neurologic injury at enrollment  (receipt of IV contrast in the previous  24 hours, receipt of ACE 
inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker in the previous 24 hours ), mean arterial pressure and 
vasopressor use prior to antibiotic receipt, analgesia and sedation use prior to antibiotic receipt  (propofol, 
dexme detomidine, fentan yl, hydromorphone, ketamine) , pH, PaO2, PaCO2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, 
oxygen saturation, temperature, lactic acid, elements of a basic metabolic panel (Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN, 
Creatinine, Glucose), magnesium, elements of a complete blood count (white blood cell count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets), Confusion Assessment Method – ICU ( CAM -ICU), Richmond 
Agitation Sedation Score ( RASS ), mechanical ventilation status and variables related to ventilation 
(FiO2, PEEP, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume), on  renal replacement therapy prior to receipt o f antibiotics ,

9.[ADDRESS_996043] spectrum antibiotics are required for the 
treatment of sepsis, there are currently no establishe d risks or benefits to using  anti-pseudomonal 
cephalosporins or anti-pseudomonal penicillins  as empi[INVESTIGATOR_729390] .  At this time, there is 
no reason to believe that participation in this study would expose patients to greater medical risks or 
benefits than those experienced by [CONTACT_729449] y ill patients requiring antibiotics as a part of routine care.  The 
greater benefit of the study would be to society in the form of improved understanding of safe and

A potential risk to patients participating in this study involves the collection of protected h ealth 
information (PHI).  In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum amount of PHI necessary for study 
conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) 
only accessible by [CONTACT_473].   After publication, a de -identified database will be generated to 
protect participant privacy.

10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Sample size considerations  
Using data captured during the development and testing of the enrollment advisor (trial intervention) from 
[ADDRESS_996044] been eligible for ACORN , we estimated the distribution of the primary 
outcome in the anti -pseudomonal penicillin group.  A total of 61.2% of patients did not experience AKI 
or death, 4.9% had Stage I AKI, 4. 3% had Stage II AKI, 8. 0% had Stage III AKI or new RRT, and 2 1.5% 
died within 30 days of ICU admission. We calculated that obtaining 80% power at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996045] an odds ratio of 0.65 for patients assigned to anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins would require a 
sample size of 2010. Assuming missing data for 40 patients, or < 5%, we plan to enroll 2050 patients.  
 
Sample size re -estimation  
At the planned interim analysis after 10 25 patients, or roughly half of the intended enrollment, the DSMB 
will evaluate the distribution of the primary outcome in the anti -pseudomonal penicillin group. If required 
by [CONTACT_729450] -pseudomonal penici llin group, the DSMB 
may recommend that the investigators increase the total sample size of the trial to maintain 80% power 
and an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996046] an odds ratio of 0.65.  
 
Statistical Analysis : 
Analysis principles  
- Primary analysis will be conducted on an intention -to-treat basis (patients with protocol violations are 
analyzed per the assigned treatment arm).  
- All hypothesis tests will be two sided, with an α of 0.[ADDRESS_996047] based on baseline variables will be performed 
irrespective of treatment efficacy.  
 
Trial profile :  
We will present a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram to detail the movement of pat ients 
through the study. This diagram will include total number of patients meeting inclusion criteria, number 
excluded and reason for exclusion, number enrolled and randomized in the study, number followed, and 
number analyzed.  
 
Baseline Characteristics :  
To assess randomization success, we will summarize in Table 1 the distribution of baseline variables 
across the study arms. Categorical variables will be reported as frequencies and percentages and 
continuous variables as either means with SDs or medians with interquartile ranges. Variables reported 
will include Demographics (age, gender, race, BMI, co -morbidities); Indication for antibiotics; Severity 
of Illness (APACHE II score); Acute Kidney Injury at enrollment; Delirium at enrollment  
 
Primary Efficacy  Outcome Analysis : 
We will compare the primary outcome, the AKI ordinal outcome, between patients randomized to the 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins versus anti -pseudomonal penicillins groups. It is important to note that 
those patients with End -Stage Renal  Disease (ESRD) would only be eligible to meet the “Death” 
component of the primary outcome.  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
 
The main analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary outcome between the anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin and anti -pseudomonal penicillin group s. To do this, we will use an 
unadjusted, proportional odds model with group assignment (anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin, anti -
pseudomonal penicillin) as the independent variable.  For the purposes of declaring a statistically 
significant difference between  groups in the primary endpoint, we will consider a two -sided P value of 
0.05 as significant.  
 
Secondary Analyses of the Primary Outcome  
To account for potential confounders, we will develop an adjusted proportional odds regression model 
with the AKI ordinal outcome score (primary outcome) as the dependent variable and independent 
covariate of groups assignment, and relevant confounders (age, baseline creatinine, gender, mechanical 
ventilation at enrollment, receipt of inotropes at enrollment, AKI at e nrollment, presence of CKD, 
admission location).  
 
Secondary Analyses : 
Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes  
We will conduct an intention -to-treat comparison of all secondary and exploratory outcomes between 
patients randomized to anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins and patients randomized to anti -pseudomonal 
penicillins. Continuous outcomes will be compared with the Mann -Whitney U test and categorical 
variables with the chi -square test or Fischer’s exact test, as appropriate.  
 
Heterogeny of Treatment E ffect 
We will examine the effect of group assignment on the primary outcome relative to a set of pre -specified 
baseline variables.  These variables will be prespecified as part of a formal statistical analysis plan 
completed and made public prior to the co mpletion of enrollment.  A formal test of interaction will be 
used to evaluate for effect modification.  
 
Presentation of Statistics  
Continuous variables will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range 
or bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals as appropriate.  Categorical variables will be given as number 
and percentage.  All between -group comparisons with continuous variables will be performed using 
Mann -Whitney U tests; categorical variables will be compared with chi -squar e testing or Fisher’s exact 
test as appropriate.  
 
Interim Analysis  
We will plan for the DSMB to conduct a single interim analysis for efficacy and safety at the anticipated 
halfway point of the trial, after enrollment of 1025 patients.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729392] P value for the difference between groups in the primary outcome is 0.001 or less.  Use of the 
conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be performed using an 
unchanged level of sig nificance (P = 0.05).  Given the minimal risk nature of the study and current use of 
both interventions as a part of usual care, there will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126670].  At the interim 
analysis, the DSMB will also monitor the distribution of the A KI ordinal outcome within the anti -
pseudomonal penicillin group and may propose to increase the planned sample size to maintain the pre -
planned power to detect an odds ratio of 0.65.

11.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problem s 
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. All medications used in this trial are 
approved by [CONTACT_729451]. This protocol further ensures safety o f its participants through:  
a) Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse events  
from the study antibiotics ; 
b) Systematic collection of safety outcomes relevant to the use of anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins 
and an ti-pseudomonal penicillins in this setting;  
c) Structured monitoring , assessment, recording, and reporting of adverse events.  
 
11.1 Adverse  Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  Any adverse event 
occurring during the research will be classified acco rding to the following characteristics:  
 
● Seriousness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if it:  
o Results in death;  
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death);  
o Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979];  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
o Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
● Unexpectedness – An adverse event will be considered “unexpected” if the nature, severity, or 
frequency is neither consistent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adve rse events associated with the procedures involved 
in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol; nor  
o The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of t he 
subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile 
for the adverse event.  
 
● Relatedness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention or 
study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows (1) a reasonable, temporal sequence from a 
study procedure AND (2) cannot be explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_310664] (3) evaluation of the patient’s clinica l state 
indicates to the investigator that the experience is definitely related to study procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the above 
criteria for “Definitely Related”.  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse e vent occurred while the patient was on the study but 
can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or 
other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_274437].  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in any of the above categories.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_996048].  As described an EHR -based advisor will 
continuously monitor for discontinuation of study drug and require that clinicians identify reason for 
discontinuation.  Every time a study drug is discontinued, investigators will be notified in real -time 
using an automated lists within the EHR.  Investigators will investigate and adjudicate potential adverse  
as close as feasible to 24 hours after initial report by [CONTACT_274408].  Investigators will assess any 
potential adverse events for whether the adverse event meets the criteria for recording and reporting 
outlined below.  
 
11.3 Recording and Reporting  Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
● Adverse events that are Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
● Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Relat ed, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported.  Adverse events that 
the investigator assesses to meet the above criteria for recording and reporting will  be entered into the 
adverse event electronic case report form in the trial database.  The investigator will record a 
preliminary assessment of each characteristic for the adverse event, including seriousness, 
unexpectedness, and relatedness.  For any adve rse event that is serious AND unexpected , and 
definitely related, probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship, the investigator will report 
the adverse event  to the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours  of the investigator becoming aware of 
the adverse event.  For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the investigator will 
report the adverse event  to the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the  adverse event.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_729393], including seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness.   
 
For adverse events that meet the above criteria for recording and re porting, the coordinating center will 
notify the DSMB, the IRB, and the sponsor in accordance with the following reporting plan:  
Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
Fatal or life -threatening (and therefore serious), 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibility related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to the DSMB, IRB, and sponsor 
within 7 days after notification of the 
event.  
Serious but non -fatal and non -life-threatening, 
unexpected, and definite ly related, probably or 
possibly related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to DSMB, IRB, and sponsor within 
15 days of notification of the event.  
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting.  Report to DSMB in regularly schedu led 
DSMB safety reports.  
The investigator will distribute the written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of reported adverse 
events to the IRB in accordance with NIH guidelines: ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -
files/not99 -107.html ). 
 
11.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of critically ill patients at high risk for death and other adverse outcomes due to their 
underlying critical illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be 
systematically collected and anal yzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or site investigators believe the event is Definitely Related  or Probably or Pos sibly Related  to 
the study intervention or study procedures.  This approach – considering death and organ dysfunction as 
clinical outcomes rather than adverse events and systemically collecting these clinical outcomes for 
analysis – is common in ICU trials . This approach ensures comprehensive data on death and organ 
dysfunction for all patients, rather than relying on sporadic adverse event reporting to identify these 
important events.  The following events are examples of study -specific clinical outcomes t hat would not 
be recorded and reported as adverse events unless treating clinicians or site investigators believe the 
event was Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to the study intervention or study 
procedures:  
● Death (all deaths occurring pr ior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days will be recorded);  
● Organ dysfunction  
o Circulatory failure, including hypotension, cardiac arrest or shock with or without 
receipt of vasopressors;  
o Acute renal failure  
o Delirium or coma  
● Duration of mechanical ventilation;  
● Duration of ICU admission;  
● Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393758]: A study -specific clinical outcome may also qualify as a reportable adverse event.  For example, 
anaphylaxis that the investigator considers Definitely Related to an anti -pseudomonal penicillin  would 
be both recorded as a study -specific clinical outcome and reported as a Serious and Definitely Related 
Adverse Event.  
  
11.[ADDRESS_996049] also report to the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_729394] (“Unanticipated Problems”), regardless of severity, associated with study procedures 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
within 24 hours  of the investigator becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. An Unanticipated 
Problem is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
● Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the r esearch procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
● Definitely Related or Probably or Possibly Related to participatio n in the research (as defined 
above in the section on characteristics of adverse events); AND  
● Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Upon becoming aware of any event that may represent an Unanticipated Problem, the investigator will 
assess whether the event represents an Unanticipated Problem by [CONTACT_68409].  
If the investigator determines  that the event represents an Unanticipated Problem, the investigator will 
record the Unanticipated Problem in the Unanticipated Problem electronic case report form in the trial 
database.  The investigators will obtain information about the Unanticipated P roblem  and report the 
Unanticipated Problem to the DSMB, IRB, and sponsor within 15 days of becoming aware of the 
Unanticipated Problem.  
 
12.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
At no time during the course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient identities be revealed 
in any manner. The minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities will be collected. As 
quickly as feasible, all data collected will be uploaded into a password -protected computerized database 
maintained wit hin a secure, web -based application for building and managing online databases 
(REDCap), or stored on secure servers with user -level access control. All patients will be assigned a 
unique study number for use in the computerized database. At the time of pu blication all identifiers will 
be removed.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_996050] (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of patients in the trial. They will regularly monitor 
data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make recommendations to 
the steering committee and sponsor wi th respect to:  
- Participant safety and risk/benefit ratio of study procedures and interventions  
- Protocol amendments (with specific attention to study population, intervention, and study procedures)  
- Adherence to the protocol requirements  
- Completeness, quali ty, and planned analysis of data  
- Ancillary study burden on participants and main study  
- Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early attainment of study 
objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate performance  
Study Protocol

The DSMB will consist of members with expertise in critical care  medicine , infectious disease, 
biostatistics, and clinical trials. Appointment of all members is contingent upon the absence of any 
conflicts of interest. All the members of the DSMB are voting members. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_729395]. The DSMB will develop a charter and review the protocol and patient notification forms during 
its first m eeting. Subsequent DSMB meetings will be scheduled in accordance with the DSMB Charter 
with the assistance of the Principal Investigator. The DSMB will have the ability to recommend that the 
trial end, be modified, or continued unchanged.

1.0 Study Summary  
Title:  Effect of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Background : Sepsis is one of the most common causes of acute  illness and death in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Early, e mpi[INVESTIGATOR_132327] -spectrum antibiotics are a mainstay of sepsis treatment . Two classes of antibiotic s 
with activity against Pseudomonas , anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti -pseudomonal penicillins,  
are commonly used for acutely ill adults with sepsis in current practice. Recent observational studies, 
however, have raised concern that anti-pseudomonal penicillin s may cause  renal toxicity. Anti-
pseudomon al cephalosporins, by [CONTACT_2163], may be associated with a risk of neurotoxicity.  Rigorous , 
prospective d ata regarding the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of these two classes of medications 
among acutely ill patients are lacking. We propose a rand omized trial comparing the impact of anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins  and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  on renal outcomes of  acutely ill patients.  
Primary Aim:  
- To compare the effect  of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus  anti-pseudomonal penicillins on the 
incidence of acute kidney  injury among  acutely ill patients  
Primary Hypothesis:  
- Among acutely  ill patients with sepsis, use of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins  will decrease the 
incidence of acute kidney  injury  (AKI) , com pared to anti-pseudomonal penicillins . 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age ≥ 18 years old  
2. Located in a participating emergency department or  medical  intensive care  unit  
3. Less than 12 hours  from presentation to study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
4. Treating clinician initiat ing an order for  an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal 
penicillin   
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Known receipt of > [ADDRESS_996059] 7 days  
2. Current d ocumented allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
3. Known to be a prisoner  
4. Treating clinicians feel that either an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin  
is required or contraindicated for  the optimal treatment of the patient , including for more directed 
antibiotic therapy against known prior resistant infections or suspected sepsis with an associated 
central nervous system infection   
Consent:  
- Given that both anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  are routinely used 
in usual care , the lack of established risk or benefit with either treatment group , the impracticability of 
obtaining informed consent prior to initiating antibiotics for acutely ill patient s, a waiver of informed 
consent will be reques ted. 
Randomization : 
- Using a  best-practices advisor embedded within the electronic health record, patients meeting all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to receive an anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin ( treating clinicians’ choice of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729379] ) or anti-
pseudomonal penicillin . 
Study Interventions:  
- Anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin  group : patients assigned  to the anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin 
group will receive the treating clinicians’ choice of either cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729380] .   
- Anti-pseudomonal penicillin  group : patients assigned  to the anti-pseudomonal penicillin  group will 
receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobacta m or ticarcillin -clavulanate .  
- For patients in both groups, treating clinicians will determine the dose and duration of the assigned 
antibiotic class.  An EHR -based advisor will alert treating clinicians of group assignment and collect 
data regarding any adverse events and the reason fo r modification or discontinuation of antibiotics  in 
the 7 days after randomization  
Primary Efficacy Outcome:  
- The primary outcome will be the highest stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) between enrollment and 
14 days after enrollment .  Stage of AKI will be defined by [CONTACT_195917]: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI creatinine criteria .  Death will be classified as worse than the highest stage 
of AKI .  The outcome will be defined using the following [ADDRESS_996060] value (0 = alive without having experienced AKI) to the highest value (4 = died).  
o 0 = No AKI  
o 1 = Stage 1 AKI  (Creatinine increase by 1.5 -1.9 times baseline OR increase by >= 0.3  
mg/dL ) 
o 2 = Stage 2 AKI  (Creatinine increase by 2.0 -2.9 times ba seline)  
o 3 = Stage 3 AKI  (Creatinine increase by >= 3.0 times baseline OR increase to >= 4.0 mg/dL 
OR New RRT)  
o 4 = Death  
Secondary Outcomes:  
- Secondary Renal Outcome : Major Adverse Kidney Events within 14 days (MAKE14): Composite 
outcome of death within 14 days, new renal replacement therapy within 14 days, or stage 2 or higher 
AKI at day 14.  
- Secondary Neurologic Outcome :  The number of days alive and free of coma and delirium in the 14 
days after enrollment (Delirium  and Coma -Free Days to day 14).

tazobactam, tigecycline, amikacin, tobramycin,  gentamicin  
 
Sample Size  Considerations:  
- Our original sample size was calculated from 820 patients during the creation and testing of the 
enrollment advisor , where we measured the distribution of outcomes expected among patients in the 
anti-pseudomonal penicillin group.  W e calculated that enrolling 2,050 patients would provide 80% 
power  at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996062] stage of AKI of 0.65. 
 
Near the midpoint of the trial, we determined that about 75% of our patie nts received concurrent 
vancomycin, a key  subgroup of interest. We increased the sample size to 2,500 patients to estimate 
the enrollment of the original sample size (2,050) in the subgroup of patients receiving concurrent 
vancomycin.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_996063] common regimens include vancomycin (to cover gram -positive 
organisms including methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus  aureus) and an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin 
or anti-pseudomonal penicillin  (to cover gram -negative organisms includ ing Pseudomonas ).

penicillins as the preferred agent for empi [INVESTIGATOR_729404]-cephalosporins are associated with a lower incidence of AKI6.  However, others have argued against 
this approach given the lack of randomized trials comparing the relative efficacy and safety of the two 
agents as well as observational data suggesting th at cephalosporins may be associated with neuro -
toxicity7–9. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_996065] spectrum coverage at many 
centers, and p iperacillin -tazobactam, specifically, has the added benefit of treating  anaerobic organisms.   
Conversely, penicillins do not cover meningitis due to poor central nervous system penetration.   
 
2.3 Acute Kidney Injury during Critical Illness  
Acute Kidney In jury (AKI) i s a common complication of ICU admission. AKI is associated with a six to 
eight fold increase in mortality in ICU populations , 10,[ADDRESS_996066] common cause 
of AKI and accounts for 40 -50% of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU)14,15. As the primary treatment for 
the underlying cause of sepsis, antibiotics are a critical treatment for acutely  ill patients, but antibiotics 
may cause renal injury, and renally -cleared antibiotics may reach supratherapeutic levels in the setting of 
AKI.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_996067] examined a potential association between the concurrent administration of vancomycin and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam and the development of AKI, compared with vancomycin alone18–21. These data, 
however, are likely to be confounded by [CONTACT_729442][INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam causes more AKI than other anti -pseudomonal antibiotics  have been inconclusive .18,22 –30.  
Studies that limited their analyses to the first 72 hours of treatment (when antibiotic choices are empi[INVESTIGATOR_729381]), have not shown any  association between pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam and kidney injury31.   
 
Based on this preliminary, observational data, however, some institutions  have elected to change their 
preferred broad spectrum anti biotic regimens from one including  an anti-pseudomonal  to one including an 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_996068] toxicities that may be relevant for acutely  ill patients. Because 
the relationship between antibiotic choice ( anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins  or anti-pseudomonal 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
penicillins ) and clinically relevant outcomes, such as AKI, are unknown, clinical trial data is urgently 
needed.  Rigorous high -quality evidence that anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins, compared to anti -
pseudomonal penicillins, decreases, increases or has no impact on the risk of AKI would have the 
potential to change the care received by [CONTACT_729443].  
 
To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a prospective, randomized trial of acutely ill adults  
undergoing initiation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_729382], comparing anti -pseudomonal 
cephalosporins vs anti-pseudomonal  penicillins  with regard to renal outcomes.   
3.[ADDRESS_996069]  of an  anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin , compared to an anti -pseudomonal 
penicillin , on the incidence of acute kidney injury among acutely ill patients, a randomized trial is needed.  
Study Aims:  
- Primary:  
o To compare the effect of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus anti-pseudomonal 
penicillins  on the incidence of acute kidney injury among a cutely ill patients  
- Secondary:  
o To compare the effect of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins vs anti-pseudomonal penicillins  
on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ICU length of stay, and ventilator days  
Study Hypotheses  
- Primary  Hypothesis : 
o The use of anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins, compared to the use of anti-pseudomonal 
penicillins , will decrease the incidence of acute  kidney injury  among acutely  ill adults   
 
4.[ADDRESS_996070] (details in section 7). All other decisions regarding treatment will remain at the discretion of the 
treating provider.  Data will be collected prospectively from the medical record to determine the effect of 
the assigned interventions on procedural, physiologic, and clinical outcomes.

6.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
6.1 Study Site s: 
Emergency Department  and Medical Intensive Care Unit  at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
6.2 Study Population:   
All adults with sepsis located in a participating unit for whom the treating clinician orders either  an anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti-pseudomonal penicillin within 12 hours  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729383]. All eligible patients will be included and there will be no 
selection based on  gender, race, weight or other clinical factors.  
 
6.3 Enrollment:  
At the time that  a treating clinician in a participating emergency department or medical intensive care unit 
initiates an o rder for  an anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin  for a patient who 
meets all inclusion criteria, an advisor within the electronic health record (details in section 7) will prompt 
treating clinicians to record whether the patient me ets any exclusion criteria.  Patients not meeting any 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized .  For patients who are determined to be ineligible , the 
advisor will track the number and reasons for exclusion.  The time of randomization will be def ined as 
“time zero” on “study day 0.”

Figure 6: Enrollment Schema  – When a treating clinician orders an anti -pseudomonal 
cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin , tools within the electronic health record (details in 
section 7) will evaluate if the patient meets inclusion criteria ( order placed within 12 hours  of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135291] , age ≥ 18, and located in a participating unit ), and the presence of 
documented allergy to penicillin or cephalosporins (an exclusion criteria).  If the patient has not 
been previously enrolled  in the trial during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], appears to meet all inclusion  
criteria , does not have a  documented a llergy to penicillin or cephalosporins , an ordering advisor 
will prompt the clinician to determine whether the patient meets any exclusion criteria. If the 

Study Protocol

Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
treating clinician confirms that the patient does meet an exclusion criterion, the patient will be 
enrolled and randomized.  The ordering advisor will track all exclusions.  
 
6.4 Consent:  
Anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin s and anti-pseudomonal penicillins  are routinely used in the care of 
acutely ill patients with sepsis in the emergency department and intensive care units at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center.  Currently, choice of empi[INVESTIGATOR_447962] -negative coverage is based primarily on 
provider preference as there are no large randomized trials  or evidence -based guideline s to support the 
choice of one empi[INVESTIGATOR_105481] -pseudomonal therapy for sepsis over another.  The concept of a randomized 
trial comparing anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin s versus anti-pseudomonal penicillins  has been discussed 
with the leader s of emergency department and intensive care units and representation from the infectious 
disease s and nephrology  program s who agree that clinical equipoise exist s regarding the choice of empi[INVESTIGATOR_729384]-pseudomonal therapy for acutely ill adults with sepsis . 
 
Because the interventions studied (1) are used as a part of routine care, (2) are interventions the patient 
would be exposed to even if not participating in the study, (3) have no prior high-quality data to suggest 
the superiority of one approach over the oth er, and (4) are equivalent options from the perspective of the 
treating provider  (otherwise the patient is excluded) , we feel the study presents minimal risk . 
 
In addition to the minimal risk posed by [CONTACT_1758], obtaining informed consent prior to particip ation 
would not be feasible or practicable.  Sepsis is a medical emergency.  E ach hour of delay in the initiation 
of antibiotics  for acutely  ill patients with  sepsis increase s mortality  by [CONTACT_2902]  7%.  For patients presenting 
with sepsis to the participating units, the average time between initiation of an order for an anti -
pseudomonal antibiotic and its administration to the patient is 28 minutes.  Obtaining prospective written 
informed consent during this interval is impracticable and risks del aying antibiotic administration.  
Moreover , acutely ill patients  with sepsis  are commonly delirious or unconscious , and a legally authorized 
representative (LAR) is not consistently  present at the time of initiation of antibiotics.   Because the trial 
deter mines choice of the initial anti -pseudomonal antibiotic, but defers decisions regarding subsequent 
doses of antibiotics (e.g., duration of therapy, escalation, de -escalation) to treating clinicians, the primary 
study procedure will be completed within [ADDRESS_996072] a waiver of informed consent.  
 
6.5 Randomization :  
A series of study group assignments will be generated by [CONTACT_729444] a 1:1 ratio of 
intervention to control .  Study group assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and treatment 
team until after the study team has confirmed that the patient does not meet any exclusion criteria and the 
patient has been enrolled.   Following randomization , treating clinici ans will be notified via the ordering 
advisor.

7.[ADDRESS_996073] (EHR)  Based Screening for Eligible Patients  
For the duration of the study, when a provider initiates an order for the administration of an intravenous 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin  or anti-pseudomonal penicillin , a software application in  the EHR will 
assess if the patient is eligible for the study. The application will assess that the patient meets all the 
inclusion criteria (located in study unit, age ≥ 18, in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_701840] 12 hours , and has not been 
previously enrolled during the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  and none of the exclusion criteria  (current documented 
allergy to cephalosporin  or penicillin class a ntibiotics , more than one prior administration of study 
antibiotic s during the last 7 days ). If the above criteria are met, an order advisor  (Figure 7) will : 1) Inform 
the provider of the study, 2) solicit the presence of contraindications to either study drug, 3) (if patient 
meets all eligibility criteria)  enroll and randomize the patient.  If there are contraindications which were 
not established electronica lly, the advisor will ask the provider to select the reason.  
 
 
Figure 7: Order advisor informing providers of the study and soliciting other exclusion criteria  
 
7.2 Antibiotic Ordering after Randomization  
Once the participant is enrolled and randomized, the ordering advisor will guide the provide r to the order 
one of the assigned study antibiotic s. Dose, frequency, and duration  will be at the discretion of treating 
clinicians  and not affected by [CONTACT_729445].  
 
7.3 EHR -Based Tool to Capture Data  on Antibiotic Modification and Adverse Events   
In the 7 days after enrollment, if a clinician attempts the discontinue the study -related antibiotic order , an 
EHR-based advisor will remind  the clinician of the treatment arm  and if the treating clinician chooses to 
discontinue the antibiotic from the assigned group,  the clinician  will be asked for the rationale:  
- Antibiotic tailoring (escalation or de -escalation) based on microbiologic data  
- Undocumented or newly apparent allergy  to either penicillin s or cephalosporins

impede the ability to change classes of antibiotic and will be used primarily for safety monitoring .  
 
7. 5 Blinding:  
It would be impractical to pursue blinding for the study. The medicine s involved in this study are given at 
different doses with varying volumes of IV infusion . They are also given on different schedules varying 
as widely as 4 times a day to once daily. Furthermore , these dosing variations are impacted by [CONTACT_712085] . Given the nature of the study intervention, patients, clinicians, and investigators will not be 
blinded to group assignment.   
 
8.0 Data Collection:  
 
8.1 In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77176]:  
Primary Efficacy Outcome: Acute Kidney Injury  Score  between randomization and day 14 . The acute 
kidney injury score is an ordinal outcome containing the stages of AKI as defined by [CONTACT_729447] , new renal replacement therapy (RRT),  and death:  
 
0 = No AKI  
1 = Stage 1 AKI (Creatinine increase by 1.5 -1.9 times baseline OR increase by >= 0.3  mg/dL ) 
2 = Stage 2 AKI (Creatinine increase by 2.0 -2.9 times baseline)  
3 = Stage 3 AKI (Creatinine increase by >= 3.0 times baseline OR increase to >= 4.0 mg/dL  OR 
New RRT ) 
4 = Death  
 
“Baseline” creatinine values are defined as the lowest prior creatinine values from three different 
timepoints: the pre -illness creatinine value, the peri -enrollment creatinine value, and the lowest prior on-
study creatinine value . Death is defined as in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729405], censored at 14 days. New RRT is defined as receipt of RRT at any point between ICU 
admission and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], censored at 14 days.   
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
 
Pre-illness  creatinine level will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a previously described hierarchical approach in 
which creatinine values obtained during the year before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729406] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729407] . When no pre -enrollment measurements are 
available , the pre-illness creatinine level is estimated with a previously described three -variable 
formula32,33. It is important to n ote that those patients with End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) would only 
be eligible to meet the “Death” component of the primary outcome.  
Patients’ peri -enrollment creatinine will be defined hierarchically using the creatinine value closest to 
enrollment in : (first) the 24 hours prior to enrollment, if available, and (second) the six hours after 
enrollment (if no value is available prior to enrollment).  Prevalent AKI, or AKI that is present on 
admission and unrelated to the study intervention, will be defin ed by [CONTACT_729453] -enrollment 
creatinine to the pre -illness creatinine.  
On-study creatinine will be defined as any creatinine value occurring after both the time of enrollment 
and the time of the peri -enrollment creatinine value. On -study creatinine  values will be used to identify 
incident AKI and calculate the stage of AKI for the primary outcome.   
 
Justification for the Primary Efficacy Outcome  
This outcome is 1) validated for electronic assessment, 2) uses outcome  thresholds for  renal dysfunction  
defined by [CONTACT_729448], 3) incorporat es patient -centered outcomes (new RRT 
and death) that would be missed by a purely laboratory -based outcome , and 4) uses a hierarchal approach 
to analysis that counts rare bu t important patient -centered outcomes (new RRT, death) as worse than 
purely laboratory -based measures (stage 2 AKI) .  
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
- Secondary Renal Outcome : Major Adverse Kidney Events within  14 days (MAKE14): Composite 
outcome of death  within 14 days , new renal replacement therapy  within 14 days , or stage 2 or higher 
AKI at day 14 . 
- Secondary Neurologic Outcome :  The number of days alive and free of coma and delirium in the 14 
days after enrollment ( Delirium  and Coma -Free Days to day 14).  
 
Exploratory  Outcomes :  
- Exploratory Renal Outcomes: Major Adverse Kidney Events within 28 days (MAKE28), highest 
stage of AKI or death between randomization and day 7, stage [ADDRESS_996075] creatinine level  with 28 
days after enrollment , the final creatinine level  before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124023] 28 days, and ongoing 
receipt of renal replacement therapy at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days, nephrology consultation .

Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
cephalosporins or anti-pseudomonal penicillins  as empi[INVESTIGATOR_729390] .  At this time, there is 
no reason to believe that participation in this study would expose patients to greater medical risks or 
benefits than those experienced by [CONTACT_729449] y ill patients requiring antibiotics as a part of rout ine care.  The 
greater benefit of the study would be to society in the form of improved understanding of safe and 
effective empi[INVESTIGATOR_729391] y ill patients  with sepsis . 
 
A potential risk to patients participating in this study involve s the collection of protected health 
information (PHI).  In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum amount of PHI necessary for study 
conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) 
only a ccessible by [CONTACT_473].  After publication, a de -identified database will be generated to 
protect participant privacy.  
 
10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Sample size considerations  
Using data captured during the development and testing of the enrollment advisor (trial intervention) from 
[ADDRESS_996078] been eligible for ACORN , we estimated the distribution of the primary 
outcome in the anti -pseudomonal penicillin group.  A total of 61.2% of patients did not experience AKI 
or death, 4.9% had Stage I AKI, 4. 3% had Stage II AKI, 8. 0% had Stage III AKI or new RRT, and 2 1.5% 
died within 30 days of ICU admission. We calculated that obtaining 80% power at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996079] an odds ratio of 0.65 for patients assigned to anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins would require a 
sample size of 2010. Assuming missing data for 40 patients, or < 5%, we plan ned to enroll 2050 patients.  
 
Sample size re -estimation  
At the planned interim analysis after  1025 patients, or roughly half of the intended enrollment, the DSMB 
will evaluate the distribution of the primary outcome in the anti -pseudomonal penicillin group. If required 
by [CONTACT_729450] -pseudomonal pen icillin group, the DSMB 
may recommend that the investigators increase the total sample size of the trial to maintain 80% power 
and an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_996080] an odds ratio of 0.65.  
 
Near the midpoint of the trial, we determined that about 75% of the total population received concurrent 
vancomycin, a n important subgroup  of interest. We increased the sample size from the original 2,050 
patients to 2,500 patients to estimate the original sample size in the subgroup of the receipt of concurrent 
vancomycin. Give n our faster than expected enrollment, the trial is estimated to complete at the originally 
proposed endpoint. This would provide 92% power to detect and OR of 0.75 at an alpha of 0.05 in the 
primary analysis cohort. This was presented to the DSMB at the i nterim analysis who agreed with the 
sample size increase.  
 
Statistical Analysis : 
Analysis principles  
- Primary analysis will be conducted on an intention -to-treat basis (patients with protocol violations are 
analyzed per the assigned treatment arm).  
- All hypothesis tests will be two sided, with an α of 0.05 unless otherwise specified.  
- All analyses will be unadjusted unless otherwise specified.  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
- Pre-specified analyses of heterogeny of treatment effect based on baseline variables will be performed 
irrespectiv e of treatment efficacy.  
 
Trial profile :  
We will present a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram to detail the movement of patients 
through the study. This diagram will include total number of patients meeting inclusion criteria, number 
exclu ded and reason for exclusion, number enrolled and randomized in the study, number followed, and 
number analyzed.  
 
Baseline Characteristics :  
To assess randomization success, we will summarize in Table 1 the distribution of baseline variables 
across the stu dy arms. Categorical variables will be reported as frequencies and percentages and 
continuous variables as either means with SDs or medians with interquartile ranges. Variables reported 
will include Demographics (age, gender, race, BMI, co -morbidities); In dication for antibiotics; Severity 
of Illness (APACHE II score); Acute Kidney Injury at enrollment; Delirium at enrollment  
 
Primary Efficacy Outcome Analysis : 
We will compare the primary outcome, the AKI ordinal outcome, between patients randomized to the 
anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins versus anti -pseudomonal penicillins groups. It is important to note that 
those patients with End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) would only be eligible to meet the “Death” 
component of the primary outcome.  
 
The main analysis will  be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary outcome between the anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin and anti -pseudomonal penicillin groups  who received at least one dose of a 
study drug . To do this, we will use an unadjusted, proportional odds model wit h group assignment (anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin, anti -pseudomonal penicillin) as the independent variable.  For the purposes 
of declaring a statistically significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, we will consider 
a two -sided P value  of 0.05 as significant.  
 
Secondary Analyses of the Primary Outcome  
To account for potential confounders, we will develop an adjusted proportional odds regression model 
with the AKI ordinal outcome score (primary outcome) as the dependent variable and inde pendent 
covariate of groups assignment, and relevant confounders (age, peri-enrollment creatinine, sex, 
mechanical ventilation prior to  enrollment, receipt of inotropes prior to  enrollment, receipt of RRT prior 
to enrollment, SOFA score, presumed source of  infection , enrollment location).  
 
Secondary Analyses : 
Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes  
We will conduct an intention -to-treat comparison of all secondary and exploratory outcomes between 
patients randomized to anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins and patients randomized to anti -pseudomonal 
penicillins. Continuous outcomes will be compared with the Mann -Whitney U test and categorical 
variables with the chi -square test or Fischer’s exact test, as appropriate.  
 
Heterogeny of Treatment Effect  
We will examine the effect of group assignment on the primary outcome relative to a set of pre -specified 
baseline variables.  These variables will be prespecified as part of a formal statistical analysis plan 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
completed and made public prior to the completi on of enrollment.  A formal test of interaction will be 
used to evaluate for effect modification.  
 
Presentation of Statistics  
Continuous variables will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range 
or bootstrapped 95% confid ence intervals as appropriate.  Categorical variables will be given as number 
and percentage.  All between -group comparisons with continuous variables will be performed using 
Mann -Whitney U tests; categorical variables will be compared with chi -square test ing or Fisher’s exact 
test as appropriate.  
 
Interim Analysis  
We will plan for the DSMB to conduct a single interim analysis for efficacy and safety at the anticipated 
halfway point of the trial, after enrollment of 1025 patients.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729408] P value for the difference between groups in the primary outcome is 0.001 or less.  Use of the 
conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be performed using an 
unchanged level of significa nce (P = 0.05).  Given the minimal risk nature of the study and current use of 
both interventions as a part of usual care, there will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126670].  At the interim 
analysis, the DSMB will also monitor the distribution of the AKI ord inal outcome within the anti -
pseudomonal penicillin group and may propose to increase the planned sample size to maintain the pre -
planned power to detect an odds ratio of 0.65.  
 
11.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problem s 
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. All medications used in this trial are 
approved by [CONTACT_729451]. This protocol further ensures safety of its par ticipants through:  
a) Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse events  
from the study antibiotics ; 
b) Systematic collection of safety outcomes relevant to the use of anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins 
and anti -pseudo monal penicillins in this setting;  
c) Structured monitoring , assessment, recording, and reporting of adverse events.  
 
11.1 Adverse  Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  Any adverse event 
occurring during the research will be classified according to the following  characteristics:  
 
● Seriousness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if it:  
o Results in death;  
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death);  
o Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
o Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize  the patient’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
● Unexpectedness – An adverse event will be considered “unexpected” if the nature, severity, or 
frequency is neither consi stent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved 
in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol; nor  
o The expected natural progression of an y underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile 
for the adverse event.  
 
● Relatedness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention  or 
study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows (1) a reasonable, temporal sequence from a 
study procedure AND (2) cannot be explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state or other ther api[INVESTIGATOR_310664] (3) evaluation of the patient’s clinical state 
indicates to the investigator that the experience is definitely related to study procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the above 
criteria for “Definit ely Related”.  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse event occurred while the patient was on the study but 
can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or 
other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is  definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_274437].  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in any of the above categories.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_996081].  As described an EHR -based advisor will 
continuously monitor fo r discontinuation of study drug and require that clinicians identify reason for 
discontinuation.  Every time a study drug is discontinued, investigators will be notified in real -time 
using an automated lists within the EHR.  Investigators will investigate and adjudicate potential adverse  
as close as feasible to 24 hours after initial report by [CONTACT_274408].  Investigators will assess any 
potential adverse events for whether the adverse event meets the criteria for recording and reporting 
outlined be low. 
 
11.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
● Adverse events that are Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
● Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported.  Adverse events that 
the investigator assesses to m eet the above criteria for recording and reporting will be entered into the 
adverse event electronic case report form in the trial database.  The investigator will record a 
preliminary assessment of each characteristic for the adverse event, including seri ousness, 
unexpectedness, and relatedness.  For any adverse event that is serious AND unexpected , and 
definitely related, probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship, the investigator will report 
the adverse event  to the principal investigato r within 24 hours  of the investigator becoming aware of 
the adverse event.  For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the investigator will 
report the adverse event  to the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the adverse event.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_729393], including seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness.   
 
For adverse events that me et the above criteria for recording and reporting, the coordinating center will 
notify the DSMB, the IRB, and the sponsor in accordance with the following reporting plan:  
Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
Fatal or life -threatening (and  therefore serious), 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibility related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to the DSMB, IRB, and sponsor 
within 7 days after notification of the 
event.  
Serious but non -fatal and non-life-threatening, 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibly related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to DSMB, IRB, and sponsor within 
15 days of notification of the event.  
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and  reporting.  Report to DSMB in regularly scheduled 
DSMB safety reports.  
The investigator will distribute the written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of reported adverse 
events to the IRB in accordance with NIH guidelines: ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -
files/not99 -107.html ). 
 
11.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of critically ill patients at high risk for death and other adverse outcomes due to their 
underlying critical illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be 
systematically collected and anal yzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or site investigators believe the event is Definitely Related  or Probably or Pos sibly Related  to 
the study intervention or study procedures.  This approach – considering death and organ dysfunction as 
clinical outcomes rather than adverse events and systemically collecting these clinical outcomes for 
analysis – is common in ICU trials . This approach ensures comprehensive data on death and organ 
dysfunction for all patients, rather than relying on sporadic adverse event reporting to identify these 
important events.  The following events are examples of study -specific clinical outcomes t hat would not 
be recorded and reported as adverse events unless treating clinicians or site investigators believe the 
event was Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to the study intervention or study 
procedures:  
Study Protocol  
Full Study Title: Effe ct of Antibiotic Choice On ReNal Outcomes (ACORN)  
Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
● Death (all deaths occurring pr ior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days will be recorded);  
● Organ dysfunction  
o Circulatory failure, including hypotension, cardiac arrest or shock with or without 
receipt of vasopressors;  
o Acute renal failure  
o Delirium or coma  
● Duration of mechanical ventilation;  
● Duration of ICU admission;  
● Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393758]: A study -specific clinical outcome may also qualify as a reportable adverse event.  For example, 
anaphylaxis that the investigator considers Definitely Related to an anti -pseudomonal penicillin  would 
be both recorded as a study -specific clinical outcome and reported as a Serious and Definitely Related 
Adverse Event.  
  
11.[ADDRESS_996082] also report to the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_729394] (“Unanticipated Problems”), regardless of severity, associated with study procedures 
within 24 hours  of the investigator becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. An Unanticipated 
Problem is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
● Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the r esearch procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
● Definitely Related or Probably or Possibly Related to participatio n in the research (as defined 
above in the section on characteristics of adverse events); AND  
● Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Upon becoming aware of any event that may represent an Unanticipated Problem, the investigator will 
assess whether the event represents an Unanticipated Problem by [CONTACT_68409].  
If the investigator determines  that the event represents an Unanticipated Problem, the investigator will 
record the Unanticipated Problem in the Unanticipated Problem electronic case report form in the trial 
database.  The investigators will obtain information about the Unanticipated P roblem  and report the 
Unanticipated Problem to the DSMB, IRB, and sponsor within 15 days of becoming aware of the 
Unanticipated Problem.  
 
12.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
At no time during the course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient identities be revealed 
in any manner. The minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities will be collected. As 
quickly as feasible, all data collected will be uploaded into a password -protected computerized database 
maintained wit hin a secure, web -based application for building and managing online databases 
(REDCap), or stored on secure servers with user -level access control. All patients will be assigned a 
unique study number for use in the computerized database. At the time of pu blication all identifiers will 
be removed.

Primary Investigator: Edward Qian, MD  
13.[ADDRESS_996083] (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of patients in the trial. They will regularly monitor 
data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make recommendations to 
the steering committee and sponsor wi th respect to:  
- Participant safety and risk/benefit ratio of study procedures and interventions  
- Protocol amendments (with specific attention to study population, intervention, and study procedures)  
- Adherence to the protocol requirements  
- Completeness, quali ty, and planned analysis of data  
- Ancillary study burden on participants and main study  
- Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early attainment of study 
objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate performance  
The DSMB will consist of members with expertise in critical care  medicine , infectious disease, 
biostatistics, and clinical trials. Appointment of all members is contingent upon the absence of any 
conflicts of interest. All the members of the DSMB are voting members. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_729395]. The DSMB will develop a charter and review the protocol and patient notification forms during 
its first m eeting. Subsequent DSMB meetings will be scheduled in accordance with the DSMB Charter 
with the assistance of the Principal Investigator. The DSMB will have the ability to recommend that the 
trial end, be modified, or continued unchanged.

Version: [ADDRESS_996090]:  
Introduction : Antibiotics are time -critical in the management of sepsis. When infectious 
organism s are unknown, patients are treated with  empi[INVESTIGATOR_729409] -negative organisms , such as  anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins and 
penicillins . However, i n observational studies some anti -pseudomonal cephalosporins 
(e.g. cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]) is asso ciated with neurologic dysfunction while the most common  anti-
pseudomonal penicillin ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam ) is associated with acute kidney injury. 
No randomized control trials have compared these regimens. This manuscript describes 
the protocol and analysis plan for a trial designed to compare  the effects of  anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti -pseudomonal penicillins  among acutely ill 
patients receiving empi[INVESTIGATOR_729410] s.  
 
Methods and Analysis:  
The Antibiotic Choice On ReNal outcomes (ACORN) trial is a prospective, single -center, 
non-blinded randomized trial being conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center . 
The trial will enroll 2,500 acutely ill adults receiving gram -negative coverage for 
treatment of infection . Eligible p atients are randomized 1:[ADDRESS_996091] stage of acute kidney 
injury and death occurring between enrollment and 14 days after enrollment. This will be 
compared between patients randomized to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729411] -
tazobactam using an unadjusted proportional odds regr ession model . The secondary 
outcome s are Major Adverse Kidney Events through day 14  and number of days alive 
and free of delirium  and coma  in 14 days after enrollment . Enrollment began on 
November 10 , 2021 and is expected to be completed in December 2022. 
 
Ethics and Dissemination:  
The trial was approved by [CONTACT_729455] a waiver of informed consent . Results will be submitted in a peer -reviewed 
journal and presented at scientific conferences.  
 
 4 Trial Registration:  
This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) on October 26, [ADDRESS_996092] patient on November 10 , 2021. 
  
 5 Strengths and Limitations:  
 
● This ongoing pragmatic trial will compare  the effects of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729412] -
tazobactam  on acute kidney injury  and death among  acutely ill adults receiving 
gram -negative antibiotic therapy in the Emergency Department or Intensive Care 
Unit.  
● Strengths: Broad eligibility criteria,  inclusion of a range of indications for antibiotic 
therapy, and use of the electronic health record to screen for eligible patients  and 
facilitate delivery of the assigned intervention will increase the external validity of 
the findings  
● Limitations: After concealed randomization, p atients, clinicians, and investigators  
are unblinded to study group assignment.  Because urine output is not 
systematically available across all care , the outcome of AKI is based on 
creatinine measurements . 
  
 6 Introduction:  
 Antib iotics are necessary for management of patients with sepsis1 but can cause 
unintended adve rse effects on organ function2. Since specific organism s causing 
infection is often un known, empi[INVESTIGATOR_132327] -spectrum antibiotics are commonly 
prescribed . For patients at risk for resistant organisms, common regimens include  gram -
positive coverage ( i.e. vancomycin) and gram -negative coverage with an anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin or penicillin , predominantly  cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413] -
tazobactam1. 
 Because the medications are considered to have comparable anti -pseudomonal 
activity, discussion surrounding choice has focused on adverse effects.  Some 
observational studies have reported an association between receipt of pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam and acute kidney injury  (AKI)3,4, particularly among patients receiving 
vancomycin5–7.  Other studies have shown no relationship between pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam and AKI8,9. AKI is common during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]10, and t here are many 
potential contributors including isotonic fluids11,12, med ication s, and acute illnesses like 
sepsis13,14.  
Similarly, a n association betwee n cephalosporins  and neurotoxicity  manifesting 
as delirium and coma  has been observed .15–17  Delirium , acute brain dysfunction 
characterized by [CONTACT_729456] , inattention, altered consciousness, and 
disorganized thinking ,18 is also a common complication of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] . In Intensive 
Care Unit ( ICU) population s, delirium is predictive of mortality, prolonged length of stay, 
and long -term cognitive impairment19,20. The incidence of cephalosporin -induced 
neurotoxicity is unknown but has been reported to  increase in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]21.  
A randomized controlled trial would overcome limitations of observational data, 
but none are known to exist22.  Rigorous , high-quality evidence assessing risk of AKI 
and neurotoxicity after exposure to anti-pseudomonal antibiotics would have potential to 
change care received by [CONTACT_729457] . To address the lack of 
available evidence, w e are conduct ing a prospective, ran domized trial comparing anti-
pseudomonal cephalosporins and anti-pseudomonal penicillins among acutely ill adults 
in the Emergency Department ( ED) or ICU.  
 
 7 Methods and Analysis : 
This manuscript was written in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]) guidelines ( Table  1, Supplement 
1)23. The Learning Healthcare System (LHS) Platform at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center conducts research studies using a unique model that leverages pragmatic, 
randomized, controlled clinical trials embedded within usual care24. The LHS Platform is 
composed of stakeholders from across the enterprise and supports projects in both the 
pediatric and adult inpa tient and outpatient settings  (Supplement 2) . LHS Platform 
studies focus on comparative effectiveness, implementation science, and programmatic 
evaluation approaches25,26. 
 
Study Design  
The Antibiotic Choice On ReNal outcomes (ACORN) trial  is a pragmatic, single -
center, unblinded, parallel -group, randomized trial comparing anti-pseudomonal 
cephalosporins to anti -pseudomonal penicillins among acutely ill adults receiving gram -
negative antibiotics in the ED  and ICU. At this center, the predominant anti -
pseudomonal cephalosporin is cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729414] -pseudomonal 
penicillin is pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam. The primary outcome is highest stage of AKI or 
death in [ADDRESS_996093] at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center  and register ed prior to initiation of enrollment 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) monitor s 
the progress and safety of the trial.

 9 Study Population  
Inclusion criteria : 
1. Age ≥ 18 years old  
2. Located in a participating ED or ICU 
3. Less than 12 hours between presentation to study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
4. Treating clinician initiating an order for  an anti -pseudomonal cephalosporin or 
anti-pseudomonal penicillin  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Known receipt of > [ADDRESS_996094] known prior 
resistant infections or suspected sepsis with an associated central nervous 
system infection  
 
Screening and Enrollment  
When a treating clinician in a participating ED or ICU initiates an order for 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729415] -tazobactam for a patient who meets all inclusion criteria, a 
clinical decision support (CDS) tool  will 1) inform the provider of the study, 2) query the 
provider regarding  the presence of any exclusion criteria , and if none are present , 3) 
enroll and randomize the patient. For patients who meet an exclusion criterion, the 
reason is recorded  (Fig. 1).  
 
Analysis  population  
The primary goal is the exploration of uncommon safety effects, there fore t he 
population for primary analysis will include all patients who were randomized and 
received  at least one dose of either study drug in the 168 hours ( 7 days ) after 
 10 randomization. A sensitivity analys is will include all patients randomized, including those 
who never received either  cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729416]/tazobactam.  
 
Randomization and Treatment Allocation  
Study group assignments are generated by [CONTACT_729444] a 1:1 
ratio of intervention to control.  Study group assignment will remain concealed until the 
team has confirmed the patient does not meet any exclusion criteria and the patient has 
been enrolled. The CDS tool w ill advise the clinician of group assignment following  
randomization . 
 
Study Interventions  
For patients assigned to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048], the CDS tool  will guide providers to 
intravenous cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]. For patients assigned to pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam,  the CDS tool 
will gui de providers to intravenous pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam. The CDS tool will display a 
standardized table of dose by [CONTACT_269397] , but decisions regarding d ose, 
frequency, and duration will be the treating clinician ’s discretion .  
In the 168 hours ( 7 days ) following enrollment, a ny new order for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729417] -tazobactam will open a CDS tool, which display s group assignment  and 
allow s clinician s to (re)order the assigned antibiotic or provide a reason for order ing the 
non-assigned an tibiotic. Similarly, if the assigned antibiotic  is discontinued , the CDS tool  
will solicit a rationale  for discontinuation , including  antibiotic tailoring , newly apparent 
allergy to either cephalosporins  or penicillins , or clinician preference.   
The CDS tool influences only the choice of the initial anti -pseudomonal antibiotic.  
Treating clinicians determine concurrent administration of other antibiotics (e.g., 
vancomycin, metronidazole), duration of therapy, escalation, de -escalation, approach to 
source c ontrol, and use of culture and laboratory data to modify antibiotic therapy.  
 
Data Collection  
 Trial personnel will monitor for adverse events daily and will record  the following 
data elements at the time of enrollment by [CONTACT_729458]  
(Supplement 3 and 4) : 
 11 - Presence of s epsis , defined by [CONTACT_729454] -3 criteria27 
- Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266653]  
- Receipt of renal rep lacement therapy (RRT)  prior to enrollment  
- Presumed source of infection organized into groups based on previously 
published data28 
 
All other data will be obtained using electronic exports from the health record. The 
following variables are collected:  
1. Collected at baseline : Age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, race, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score, active medical problems at 
the time of admission, active comorbidities, comorbidities and medications known 
to increase risk of kidney or neurologic injury at enroll ment, mean arterial 
pressure and vasopressor use prior to antibiotic receipt, analgesia and sedation 
use prior to antibiotic receipt, admission to ICU vs ward  
2. Collected from randomization to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]: Mean arterial pressure and 
vasopressor use, p H, PaO2, PaCO2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, oxygen 
saturation, temperature, lactic acid, elements of a basic metabolic panel, 
magnesium, elements of a complete blood count, antibiotic receipt, all 
microbiologic culture data, Confusion Assessment Method f or the ICU ( CAM -
ICU), Richmond Agitation Sedation Score ( RASS ), Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ), 
mechanical ventilation status and variables related to ventilation, nephrology 
consultation, receipt of new RRT, indications for new RRT among patients who 
received new RRT , medications known to increase risk of kidney injury, 
medications known to increase risk of neurologic injury, admitting team, date of 
admission, days spent in the ICU, days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], date of intubation (s) 
and extubation (s), date of discharge,  and date of death . 
 
Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome will be a combination of  the highest stage of AKI and death 
between randomization and day 14.  The stage s of AKI are defined using creatinine 
 12 measurements and the  “Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO )”29 
criteria .  The score will range from 0 (best value) to 4 (worst value):  
0 = No AKI  
1 = Stage 1 AKI (Creatinine increase d by 1.5 -1.9 times bas eline OR increase by 
>= 0.3 mg/dL)  
2 = Stage 2 AKI (Creatinine increase d by 2.0 -2.9 times baseline)  
3 = Stage 3 AKI (Creatinine increase d by >= 3.0 times baseline OR increase to 
>= 4.0 mg/dL OR New RRT)  
4 = Death  
 
“Baseline ” creatinine values are defined as the lowest  prior creatinine values 
from three different timepoints : the pre -illness creatinine value, the peri -enrollment 
creatinine value, and the lowest prior on -study creatinine value as defined below.  Death 
is defined a s mortality from any cause occurring prior to  or on  the end of study day 14, 
censored at  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  RRT is defined as receipt of RRT at any point between 
randomization and the end of study day 14, censored at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patients 
who are receiving RRT prior to enro llment can only experience values of 0 (patient did 
not die) or 4 (patient die d) because they are ineligible to experience changes in 
creatinine or new receipt of RRT that define levels 1  through 3 .  
Patients’ pre -illness creatinine will be defined as t he lowest serum creatinine 
between 12 months  and 24 h ours prior to enrollment . For patients for whom a value i s 
unavailable, a pre -illness creatinine value will be estimated using a previously -described 
three -variable formula  [creatinine = 0.74 − 0.2 (if female) + 0.08 (if African American) + 
0.003 × age (in  years)]30. There are no validated estimations of creatinine without race 
but we will evaluate the effect of social constructs by [CONTACT_729459] a sensitivity analysis.  
Patients’ p eri-enrollment creatinine will be defined hierarchically using the 
creatinine value closest to enrollment in : (first) the 24 hours prior to enrollment, if 
available, and (second ) the six hours after enrollment (if no value is available prior to 
enrollment) .  Prevalent AKI, or AKI that is present on admission and unrelated to the 
 13 study intervention, will be defined by [CONTACT_729460] -enrollment creatinine to the 
pre-illness creatinine .  
On-study creatinine will be defined as any creatinine value occurring after both 
the time of enrollment and the time of the peri -enrollment creatinine value . On-study 
creatinine values will be used to identify  incident AKI  and calculate the stage of AKI for 
the primary outcome.    
The primary outcome will be calculated as follows:  
• Patients who survive without new RRT and do not experience an on -study 
creatinin e value that is at least 0.3 mg/dL higher than the peri -enrollment 
value or any preceding on -study value,  and whose on -study creatin ine is 
never more  than 1.[ADDRESS_996095] experienced incident AKI and 
will receive a value of 0  for the primary outcome.  
• Among patients who survive and experience AKI (have  on-study 
creatinine value that is at 1.[ADDRESS_996096] 0.3 mg/dL higher than the 
peri-enrollment value or any prece ding on -study value ), the score for the 
primary outcome will be determined by [CONTACT_729461] : 
a. A value of [ADDRESS_996097] prior on -
study creatinine value  (baseline  creatinine ); 
b. A value of [ADDRESS_996098] prior on -study creatinine value  (baseline creatinine ); 
and 
c. A value of [ADDRESS_996099] prior on -
 14 study creatinine value  (baseline creatinine ), with a maximum 
creatinine above 4 mg/d L, or receive new RRT  
• Patients who die will receive a value of [ADDRESS_996100] likely to be affected by [CONTACT_729462] 168 ho urs (7 days).  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
We have prespecified two secondary outcomes. Major Adverse Kidney Events 
within  14 days (MAKE14) , is the c omposite outcome of death within 14 days, new RRT 
within 14 days, or stage 2 or higher AKI at day 14 , according to KDIGO creatinine 
criteria . The second  is number of days alive and free of delirium and coma  in the 14 
days after enrollment (Delirium  and Coma -Free Days to day 14).  Delirium is defined as 
a positive assessment on the CAM -ICU31 and c oma is defined as a RASS  of -4 or -532 
at any point during that study day . 
 
Exploratory Outcomes  
- Exploratory Renal Outcomes  
o Major Adverse Kidney Events within  28 days (MAKE28)  
o Highest stage of AKI or death  between randomization and day [ADDRESS_996101] GCS  score during the 7 days,  14 days , and 28 days after 
enrollment  
o Delirium  and Coma -Free Days in the 28 days after enrollment  
- Exploratory Clinical Outcomes  
o ICU-free, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free, Ventilator -free, and Vasopressor -free days  in the 
28 days after enrollment  
o 14-day mortality  
o 28-day mortality  
o Disposition of patients admitted from the ED (ward vs ICU)  
o Escalation of antibiotics defined  by [CONTACT_729452],  
meropenem -vaborbactam,  imipenem, imipen em-relebactam, cefiderocol, 
ceftazidime -avibactam, ceftolozane -tazobactam,  tigecycline, amikacin, 
tobramycin, gentam icin. 
Definition of Supportive Therapy -Free days is available in  Supplement section 5.  
 
DSMB  and Interim Analysis  
A DSMB composed of experts in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and 
biostatistics has overseen the design of the trial and is monitoring its conduct  
(Supplement 6). The DSMB conduct ed a single interim analysis , prepared by [CONTACT_142452], at the anticipated halfway point of the trial after enrollment of 1025 
patients . The meeting was held on July 14, 2022 , and the DSMB recommended 
continuing the trial to completion without a lteration .  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729418]  p-value for the difference between groups in the primary outcome 
of 0.001 or less.  Given current use of both interventions as a part of usual care, there 
was no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126670].  Use of a conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary  for 
efficacy  will allow the final analysis to be performed using an unchanged level of 
significance (P = 0.05).  The DSMB retains the authority to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729419], request additional data or interim analyses, or request modifications of 
study protocol to protect patient safety.  
 
 16 Sample Size Estimation  
As specified in the initial  trial protocol, at the time of the single, planned interim 
analysis the DSMB oversaw a re -estimation of the planned sample size.  Because [1] 
concurrent receipt  of vancomycin has been hypothesized to be in the proposed 
mechanistic pathway between receipt  of an anti -pseudomonal penicillin and AKI and [2] 
approximately 75% of patients in the trial concurrently receive vancomycin, the sample 
size was increased by 25 % from 2,0 50 to 2,500  patients . The increase in sample size 
ensure s the number of patients receiving concurrent vancomycin will be approximately 
2,050, consistent with the original sample size estimation.  Assuming a two -sided alpha 
of 0.05 and a distribut ion of the primary outcome with approximately 70% of patients 
experiencing no AKI, 10% of patients experiencing stage I AKI, 7% of patients 
experiencing stage II AKI, 7% of patients experiencing stage III AKI, and 6% of patients 
experiencing death, we calc ulated that enrollment of a total of 2,500 patients would 
provide 92% statistical power to detect an odds ratio of 0.75 in the primary analysis.  
 
Statistical Analysis Principles  
Analyses will be conducted following reproducible research principles using R (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)33. Continuous variables will be 
reported as mean ± SD or median and IQR; categorical varia bles will be reported as 
frequencies and proportions. As a randomized controlled trial, there will be no 
comparison of baseline characteristics. A two -sided p -value of < 0.05 will be used to 
indicate statistical significance; with just one primary outcome,  no adjustment for 
multiplicity will be made. Two secondary outcomes are specified, one safety outcome 
for each treatment regimen . Since hypothesized safety concerns are independent, we 
will not adjust our secondary outcomes for multiplicity. For all other  outcomes, emphasis 
will be placed on magnitude of differences between groups rather than statistical 
significance.  
 
Main Analysis of the Primary Outcome  
The main  analysis will be an unadjusted, intention -to-treat comparison of the 
primary outcome between patients randomized to receive anti-pseudomonal 
 [ADDRESS_996102] one dose of a 
study drug using a proportional odds regression model . The unadjusted common odds 
ratio (cOR) with confidence int ervals will be the primary treatment effect.  If departures 
from the proportionality assumption are observed, then a partially proportional odds 
model will be constructed . 
 
Secondary Analyses of the Primary Outcome  
Multivariable modeling to account for covariates  
To account for participants ’ baseline status , we will include covariates in the 
proportional odds regression model . The following prespecified baseline covariates  will 
be considered : age; sex; peri-enrollment  creatinine ; receipt of RRT prior to enrollment; 
receipt of vasopressors; receipt of mechanical ventilation; SOFA score; presumed 
source of infection; enrollment location (ED vs ICU) .  Source of infection will be 
categorized as:  lung, intra -abdominal (perforated viscus, ischemic bowel, 
cholecystitis/cholangitis, peritonitis/abscess/small bowel obstruction, Clostridium difficile  
colitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pancreatitis, enterocolitis/diverticulitis, other 
intra-abdominal infections), urinary (pyelonephritis, obstructive urinary tract infection), 
skin and soft tissue (cellulitis/abscess/necrotizing fasciitis/decubitus ulcer, surgical site 
infection), other (bone/joint , primary blood stream infection, intravascular ca theter, 
disseminated infection, central nervous system infection, endocarditis, other), and 
unknown.  
 
Effect Modification  
We will test the interaction between the treatment effect of  anti-pseudomonal 
cephalosporins vs anti-pseudomonal penicillins and baseline variables expected to 
modify effects  of treatments on the outcome s. The effect modifiers will be tested one by 
[CONTACT_729463] . 
Because this stud y is not formally designed or powered to test for interaction, a less 
conservative two-sided p value for the interaction term will be used, with values less 
than 0.10 considered suggestive of potential interaction and values less than 0.05 
considered concl usive evidence . The following variables will be consid ered: 
 18 1. Location at randomization  (ED vs ICU)  
2. Presence of sepsis  (meeting Sepsis -3 criteria) at randomization  
3. Receipt of vancomycin (defined as an order for vancomycin in the 12 hours 
before or 6 hours after randomization)  
4. Source of infection  
5. AKI at randomization  
6. CKD at randomization  
7. Neutropenia at randomization  
8. Admitting team (medicine vs surgical)  
 
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Outcome  
To assess robustness of findings, the main analysis of the primary outcome will 
be repeated in several alternative  population s. First, we will include all  patients who 
were identified by [CONTACT_729464] , regardless of receipt of any 
doses of anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti -pseudomonal pen icillins . Second , 
many patients are initiated on antibiotics in the acute setting , which are stopped as a 
more likely cause for their illness becomes known  (e.g. pulmonary embolism) . We will 
repeat the main analysis restricted to the subset o f patients that received more than  2 
days (48 hours) of anti-pseudomonal therapy . Third, because race is a social construct , 
we will repeat the main analysis with those whose pre-illness creatinine was estimated 
by [CONTACT_729465] a factor.  Fourth, to avoid uncertainty around the 
calculations of pre-illness creatinine, we will repeat the main analysis excluding patients 
with calculated pre-illness creatinine values . Because group assignment might influence 
recovery from prevalent AKI in a way that could affect calculations of the primary 
outcome, we will recalculate the primary outcome as a repeated measure assessed 
daily from randomization to day [ADDRESS_996103] or 
Fischer’s exac t test as appropriate  and results will be expressed as a difference in 
proportions or odds ratios, each with 95% confidence intervals .  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
In the case that a patient is enrolled, never receives RRT, and is discharged alive 
without ha ving a creatinine value measured following enrollment, the patient will be 
assumed to have no AKI. When data are missing for secondary or exploratory 
outcomes, complete -case analysis, excluding cases where data for the analyzed 
outcome are missing , will be performed . There will be no imputation of missing data for 
these outcomes . In adjusted analyses, missing data for covariates will be imputed using 
multiple imputations.  
 
Trial status  
The ACORN  trial is currently enrolling and started enrollment on  November  10, 
[ADDRESS_996104] patients receiving empi[INVESTIGATOR_447962] -negative antibiotics in routine clinical care 
receive either anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti -pseudomonal penici llins. Any 
benefits or risks of these two approaches are experienced by [CONTACT_729466], outside the context of research. As a requirement for 
enrollment in the ACORN trial, the patient’s treating clinician mus t have made the 
decision to order  either anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins or anti -pseudomonal 
penicillins as part of routine clinical care and affirmed  that either would be a safe  and 
reasonable  approach for the patient (otherwise the patient is excluded). Therefore, 
making the decision between the two approaches randomly through  study group 
assignment rather than by a provider who thinks either approach is safe  and reasonable  
for the patient was proposed  to pose no more than minimal incremental  risk. 
Obtaining informed consent for participation in the study would be impracticable. 
Receipt of antibiotics in sepsis  is time sensitive . Each hour delay in antibiotics in 
patients with sepsis is associated with an increase in mortalit y34. Attempting to o btain 
prospective written informed consent from patients presenting to the ED or ICU during 
the interval  between the placement of an order for empi[INVESTIGATOR_729420] .  Moreover, acutely ill patients with 
sepsis are commonly delirious or unconscious, and a legally authorized representative 
is not consistently present at the t ime of initiation of antibiotics.  Because the trial 
determines only the choice of the initial anti -pseudomonal antibiotic and defers 
decisions regarding subsequent doses of antibiotics (e.g., duration of therapy, 
escalation, de -escalation) to treating clinicians, enrollment, tr ial group assignment, and 
the primary study procedure (administration of the assigned antibiotic) common ly occur s 
within 1 hour of meeting eligibility criteria.   
Because the study was expected to pose minimal risk and prospective informed 
consent was considered  to be impracticable, a waiver of informed consent was 
requested and granted from the Vanderbilt Un iversity Medical Center IRB.   
 21 Protocol Changes  
ClinicalTrials.Gov will be updated with any amendments to the protocol as per 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_184959]  (Supplement 7).  
 
Dissemination Plan  
Trial results will be submitted to a peer -reviewed journal for consideration of 
publication and will be presented at one or more scientific conferences.  Data will be 
made available following publication (Supplement 8).

ABSTRACT
Introduction  Antibiotics are time-  critical in the 
management of sepsis. 
When infectious organisms 
are unknown, patients are treated with empi[INVESTIGATOR_729428]-  negative 
organisms, such as antipseudomonal cephalosporins
 
and penicillins. However, in observational studies, some antipseudomonal cephalosporins (eg, cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]) are associated with neurologic dysfunction while the most common antipseudomonal penicillin (pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]–tazobactam) is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). No randomised control trials have compared these regimens. This manuscript describes the protocol and analysis plan for a trial designed to compare the effects of antipseudomonal cephalosporins and antipseudomonal penicillins among acutely ill patients receiving empi[INVESTIGATOR_126342].Methods and analysis
 The Antibiotic Choice On 
ReNal outcomes trial is a prospective, single-  centre, 
non-  blinded randomised trial being conducted 
at V
anderbilt University Medical Center. The trial 
will enrol 2500 acutely ill adults receiving gram-  
negative coverage for treatment of infection.
 Eligible 
patients are randomised 1:1 to receive cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413]–tazobactam on first order entry of a broad-
 spectrum antibiotic covering gram-  negative 
organisms. 
The primary outcome is the highest stage 
of AKI and death occurring between enrolment and 14 days after enrolment. This will be compared between patients randomised to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729429]–tazobactam using an unadjusted proportional odds regression model. The secondary outcomes are major adverse kidney events through day [ADDRESS_996112] (IRB#210591) with a waiver of informed consent. Results will be submitted to a peer-
 reviewed 
journal and presented at scientific conferences.Trial registration number

Antibiotics are necessary for the management of patients with sepsis,

antibiotics are commonly prescribed. For patients at risk for resistant 
organisms, 
common regimens include gram-  positive 
coverage (ie, vancomycin) and gram-  negative 
coverage with an antipseudomonal cephalo-sporin or penicillin, predominantly cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413]–tazobactam.

In the absence of evidence that efficacy differs between 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729433]–tazobactam, discussion 
surrounding the choice between the two has focused on adverse effects. Some observational studies have reported an association between receipt of pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]–tazobactam and acute kidney injury (AKI),

patients receiving vancomycin.10–[ADDRESS_996116]

13 14 Adverse kidney events are common during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],15 and there are many potential contribu-
tors including isotonic fluids,16 17 medications and acute 
illnesses such as sepsis.18 19
Similarly, an association between cephalosporins and 
neurotoxicity manifesting as delirium and coma has been observed.

To address the lack of available evidence, we are conducting a prospective, randomised trial comparing antipseudo-monal cephalosporins and antipseudomonal penicillins among acutely ill adults in the emergency department (ED) or ICU.

Patient and public involvement
Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. Patient and community representatives partici-pated in the steering committee for the LHS in which the trial was conducted.
Study population
Inclusion criteria1.
 Age≥18 years old.
2. Located in a participating ED or ICU.
3. Less than 12 hours between presentation to study hos-pi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
4.
 Treating clinician initiating an order for an antipseudo-monal cephalosporin or antipseudomonal penicillin.
Exclusion criteria1.
 Known receipt of >[ADDRESS_996120] known prior resistant infections or sus-
pected sepsis with an associated central nervous system infection.
Screening and enrolmentWhen a treating clinician in a participating ED or ICU initiates an order for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413]–tazo-bactam for a patient who meets all inclusion criteria, a clinical decision support (CDS) tool will (1) inform the provider of the study, (2) query the provider regarding the presence of any exclusion criteria, and if none is present, (3) enrol and randomise the patient. For patients who meet an exclusion criterion, the reason is recorded (figure
 1).
Analysis populationThe primary goal is the exploration of uncommon safety 
effects, therefore the population for primar
y analysis will 
include all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of either study drug in the 168 hours (7 days) after randomisation. A sensitivity analysis will include all patients randomised, including those who never received either cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413]/tazobactam.

Study interventions
For patients assigned to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048], the CDS tool will guide providers to intravenous cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]. For patients assigned to pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]–tazobactam, the CDS tool will guide providers to intravenous pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]–tazobactam. The CDS tool will display a standardised table of dose by [CONTACT_269397], but decisions regarding dose, frequency and duration will be the treating clinician’s discretion.
In the 168 hours (7
 days) following enrolment, any 
new 
order for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_729413]–tazobactam will open a CDS tool, which displays group assignment and allows clinicians to (re)order the assigned antibiotic or provide a reason for ordering the non-
 assigned antibiotic. Simi-
larly, if the assigned antibiotic is discontinued, the CDS tool will 
solicit a rationale for discontinuation, including 
antibiotic tailoring, newly apparent allergy to either ceph-alosporins or penicillins, or clinician preference.
The CDS tool influences only the choice of the initial 
antipseudomonal antibiotic. Treating clinicians to deter -
mine concurrent administration of other antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, metronidazole), duration of therapy, escala-tion, de-
 escalation, approach to source control and use of

Data collection
Trial personnel will monitor for adverse events daily and will record the following 
data elements at the time of 
enrolment by [CONTACT_729458] (online supplemental files 3 and 4):
 ►Presence of sepsis, defined by [CONTACT_729454]-  3 criteria.32
 ►Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266653].
 ►Receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT) prior to enrolment.
 ►Presumed source of infection organised into groups based on previously published data.
[ADDRESS_996123]. The following variables are collected:1.
 Collected at baseline: age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, race, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, active medical problems at the time of admission, active comorbidities, comorbidities and medications known to increase risk of kidney or neuro-logic injury at enrolment, mean arterial pressure and vasopressor 
use prior to antibiotic receipt, analgesia 
and sedation use prior to antibiotic receipt, admission to ICU versus ward.
2.
 Collected from randomisation to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]: mean arterial pressure and vasopressor use, pH, PaO
2, 
PaCO2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, oxygen saturation, 
temperature, lactic acid, elements of a basic metabol-ic panel, magnesium, elements of a complete blood count, antibiotic receipt, all microbiologic culture data, Clostridium difficile testing results, Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-
 ICU), Richmond Agitation 
Sedation Score (RASS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), mechanical ventilation status and 
variables related to ventilation, nephrology consultation, receipt of new 
RRT, indications for new RRT among patients who re-ceived new RRT, medications known to increase risk of kidney injury, medications known to increase risk of neurologic injury, admitting team, date of admission, days spent in the ICU, days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], date of intubation(s) and extubation(s), date of discharge and date of death.
Primary outcomeThe primary outcome will be a combination of the highest stage of AKI and death between randomisation and day 14. The stages of AKI are defined using creati-nine measurements and the ‘Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)’
34 criteria. The score will 
range from 0 (best value) to 4 (worst value):
0=No AKI.1=Stage 1 AKI (creatinine increased by 1.5–1.9 times 
baseline or increase by ≥0.3
 mg/dL).
2=Stage 2 AKI (creatinine increased by 2.0–2.9 times 
baseline).
3=Stage 3 AKI (creatinine increased by ≥3.0 times base
-
line or increase to ≥4.0  mg/dL or new RRT).
4=Death.‘Baseline’ creatinine values are defined as the lowest 
prior creatinine values from three different timepoints: the preillness creatinine 
value, the perienrolment creati-
nine value and the lowest prior on-  study creatinine value 
as defined below. 
Death is defined as mortality from any 
cause occurring prior to or on the end of study day 14, censored at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. RRT is defined as receipt of RRT at any point between randomisation and the end of study day 14, censored at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patients who are receiving RRT prior to enrolment can only expe-rience values of 0 (patient did not die) or 4 (patient died) because they are ineligible to experience changes in creatinine or new receipt of RRT that define levels 1 through 3.
Patients’ preillness creatinine will be defined as the 
lowest serum creatinine between 12 months and 24 hours prior to enrolment. For patients for whom a value is unavailable, a preillness creatinine value will be estimated using a previously described three-
 variable formula 
(creatinine=0.74–0.2 (if female)+0.08 (if African Ameri-can)[PHONE_15146]×age (in years)).
[ADDRESS_996124] of social constructs by [CONTACT_729472] a sensitivity analysis.
Patients’ perienrolment creatinine will be defined hier -
archically using the creatinine value closest to enrolment in: (first) the 24 hours prior to enrolment, if available, and (second) the 6
 hours after enrolment (if 
no value is 
available prior to enrolment). The prevalent AKI, or AKI that is present on admission and unrelated to the study intervention, will be defined by [CONTACT_729473]-ment creatinine to the preillness creatinine.
On-
 study creatinine will be defined as any creatinine 
value occurring after both the time of enrolment and  on July 6, [ADDRESS_996125]. Protected by [CONTACT_650262]. http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066995 on 10 March 2023. Downloaded from

the time of the perienrolment creatinine value. On-  study 
creatinine values will be used to identify incident AKI and 
calculate the stage of AKI for the primary outcome.
The primary outcome will be calculated as follows:
 ►Patients who survive without new RRT and do not experience an on-
 study creatinine value that is at 
least 0.3  mg/dL higher than the perienrolment value 
or any preceding on-  study value, and whose on-  study 
creatinine is never more than 1.[ADDRESS_996126] experienced incident AKI and will receive a value of 0 for the primary outcome.
 ►Among patients who survive and experience AKI (have on-
 study creatinine value that is at 1.[ADDRESS_996127] 0.3  mg/dL higher than the perienrolment 
value or any preceding on-  study value), the score for 
the primary outcome will be determined by [CONTACT_729474]:a.
 A value of [ADDRESS_996128] prior on-
 study 
creatinine value (baseline creatinine).
b. A value of [ADDRESS_996129] prior on-  study creatinine value (baseline 
creatinine).
c. A value of [ADDRESS_996130] prior on-
 study 
creatinine value (baseline creatinine), with a maximum creatinine above 4 mg/dL, or receive new RRT.
 ►Patients who die will receive a value of 4.
The mechanisms and extent of AKI with antibiotic 
exposure are not well understood. The primary outcome window of [ADDRESS_996131] likely to be affected by [CONTACT_729462] 168 hours (7 days).
Secondary outcomes
We have prespecified two secondary outcomes. Major adverse kidney events within 14 days (MAKE14) is the composite outcome of death within 14 days, new RRT within 14 days or stage 2 or higher AKI at day 14, according to KDIGO creatinine criteria. The second is number of days alive and free of delirium and coma in the 14 days after enrolment (delirium and coma-
 free days 
to day 14). Delirium is defined as a positive assessment on the CAM-
 ICU36 and coma is defined as an RASS of −4 or 
−537 at any point during that study day.
Exploratory outcomes
 ►Exploratory renal outcomes. –Major adverse kidney events within 28 days 
(MAKE28).
 –Highest stage of AKI or death between randomisa-tion and day 7.
 –Stage 2 or higher AKI as defined in the KDIGO cri-teria for creatinine level within 14 days and 28 days after enrolment.
 –New receipt of RRT within 14 days and 28 days after enrolment.
 –Days alive and free of RRT during 14 days and 28 days after enrolment.
 –Highest creatinine level within 28 days after enrolment.
 –Change from preillness creatinine to the highest creatinine level within 28 days after enrolment.
 –Final creatinine level before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124023] 28 days.

DSMB and interim analysis
A DSMB composed of experts in critical care medicine, infectious disease and biostatistics has overseen the design of the trial and is monitoring its conduct (online supplemental file 6). The DSMB conducted a single interim analysis, prepared by [CONTACT_15282], at the anticipated halfway point of the trial after enrol-ment of 1025 patients. The meeting was held on 14 July 2022, and the DSMB 
recommended continuing the trial 
to completion without alteration. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729435] p value for the difference between groups in the primary outcome of 0.001 or less. Given current use of both interventions as a part of usual care, there was no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126670]. The use of a conservative Haybittle-
 Peto boundary for effi-
cacy will allow the final analysis to be performed using an unchanged level of significance (p=0.05). The DSMB retains the authority to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729436] 6, [ADDRESS_996132].

any point, request additional data or interim analyses, 
or request modifications of the study protocol to protect patient safety.
Sample size estimation
As specified in the initial trial protocol, at the time of the single, planned interim analysis the DSMB oversaw a re-
 es-
timation of the planned sample size. Because (1) concur -
rent receipt of vancomycin has been hypothesised to be in the proposed mechanistic pathway between receipt of an antipseudomonal penicillin and AKI and (2) approx-imately 75% of patients in the trial concurrently receive vancomycin, the sample size was increased by 25% from 2050 to 2500 patients. The increase in sample size ensures the 
number of patients receiving concurrent vancomycin 
will be approximately 2050, consistent with the orig-inal sample size estimation. Assuming a two-
 sided alpha 
of 0.05 and a distribution of the primary outcome with approximately 70% of patients experiencing no AKI, 10% of patients experiencing stage 1 AKI, 7% of patients expe-riencing stage 2 AKI, 7% of patients experiencing stage 3 AKI and 6% of patients experiencing death, we calcu-lated 
that enrolment of a total of 2500 patients would 
provide 92% statistical power to detect an OR of 0.75 in the primary analysis.
Statistical analysis principles
Analyses will be conducted following reproducible research principles using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
38 Continuous variables will 
be reported as mean±SD  or median and IQR; categorical 
variables will be reported as frequencies and proportions. As a randomised controlled trial, there will be no compar -
ison of baseline characteristics. A two-
 sided p value of 
<0.05  will be used to indicate statistical significance; with 
just one primary outcome, no adjustment for multiplicity will be made. Two secondary outcomes are specified, one safety outcome for each treatment regimen. Since hypothesised 
safety concerns are independent, we will 
not adjust our secondary outcomes for multiplicity. For all other outcomes, emphasis will be placed on the magni-tude of differences between groups rather than statistical significance.
Main analysis of the primary outcome
The main analysis will be an unadjusted, intention-
 to- treat 
comparison of the primar
y outcome between patients 
randomised to receive antipseudomonal cephalosporins versus antipseudomonal penicillins who received at least one dose of a study drug using a proportional odds regres-sion model. The unadjusted common OR with CIs will be the primary treatment effect. If departures from the proportionality assumption are observed, then a partially proportional odds model will be constructed.
Secondary analyses of the primary outcome
Multivariable modelling to account for covariatesTo account for participants’ baseline status, we will include covariates in the proportional odds regression model. The following prespecified baseline covariates 
will be considered: age; sex; perienrolment creatinine; receipt of RRT prior to enrolment; receipt of vasopres-sors; receipt of mechanical ventilation; SOFA Score; presumed source of infection; enrolment location (ED vs ICU). Source of infection will be categorised as: lung, intra-
 abdominal (perforated viscus, ischaemic bowel, 
cholecystitis/cholangitis, peritonitis/abscess/small bowel obstruction, Clostridium dif
ficile colitis, spontaneous bacte-
rial peritonitis, pancreatitis, enterocolitis/diverticulitis, other intra-
 abdominal infections), urinary (pyelone-
phritis, obstructive urinary tract infection), skin and soft tissue (cellulitis/abscess/necrotizing 
fasciitis/decubitus 
ulcer, surgical site infection), other (bone/joint, primary blood stream infection, intravascular catheter, dissemi-nated infection, central nervous system infection, endo-carditis, other) and unknown.
Effect modification
We will test the interaction between the treatment effect of antipseudomonal cephalosporins versus antipseu-domonal penicillins and baseline variables expected to modify the effects of treatments on the outcomes. The effect modifiers will be tested one by [CONTACT_729463]. Because this study is not formally designed or powered to test for interaction, a less conservative two-
 
sided p value for the interaction term will be used, with values less than 0.10 considered suggestive of potential interaction and values less than 0.05 considered conclu-sive evidence. The following variables will be considered:1.
 Location at randomisation (ED vs ICU).
2. Presence of sepsis (meeting Sepsis-  3 criteria) at rando-
misation.
3. Receipt of vancomycin (defined as an order for vanco-mycin in the 12 hours before or 6
 hours after rando-
misation).
4. Source of infection.
5. AKI at randomisation.
6. CKD at randomisation.
7. Neutropenia at randomisation.
8. Admitting team (medicine vs surgical).
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcomeTo assess robustness of 
findings, the main analysis of the 
primary outcome will be repeated in several alternative popu-lations. First, we will include all patients who were identified by [CONTACT_729476], regardless of receipt of any doses of antipseudomonal cephalosporins or antipseudomonal penicillins. Second, many patients are initi-ated on antibiotics in the acute setting, which are stopped as a more likely cause for their illness becomes known (eg, pulmo-nary embolism). We will repeat the main analysis restricted to the subset of patients that received more than 2
 days (48 
hours) of antipseudomonal 
therapy. Third, because race is 
a social construct, we will repeat the main analysis with those whose preillness creatinine was estimated by [CONTACT_729465] a factor. Fourth, to avoid uncertainty around  on July 6, [ADDRESS_996133]. Protected by [CONTACT_650262]. http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066995 on 10 March 2023.

the calculations of preillness creatinine, we will repeat the 
main analysis excluding patients with calculated preillness creatinine values. Because group assignment might influ-ence recovery from prevalent AKI in a way that could affect calculations of the primary outcome, we will recalculate the primary outcome as a repeated measure assessed daily from randomisation to day [ADDRESS_996134] or Fischer’s exact test as 
appropriate and results will be expressed as a difference in proportions or ORs, each with 95% CIs.
Handling of missing data
In the case that a patient is enrolled, never receives RRT and is discharged alive without having a creatinine value measured following enrolment, the patient will be assumed to have no AKI. When data are missing for secondary or exploratory outcomes, complete-
 case anal-
ysis, excluding cases where data for the analysed outcome are missing, will be performed. There will be no impu-tation of missing 
data for these outcomes. In adjusted 
analyses, missing data for covariates will be imputed using multiple imputations.

cephalosporins or antipseudomonal penicillins as part of routine clinical care and affirmed that either would be a safe and reasonable approach for the patient (otherwise the patient is excluded). Therefore, making the decision between the two approaches randomly through study group assignment rather than by a provider who thinks either approach is safe and reasonable for the patient was proposed to pose no more than minimal incremental risk.
Obtaining informed consent for participation in the study 
would be impracticable. Receipt of antibiotics in sepsis is time sensitive. Each hour delay in antibiotics in patients with sepsis is associated with an increase in mortality.
39 Attempting to 
obtain prospective written informed consent from patients presenting to the ED or ICU during the interval between the placement of an order for empi[INVESTIGATOR_729437]. Moreover, acutely ill patients with sepsis are commonly delirious or unconscious, and a legally authorised representative is not consistently present at the time of initiation of antibiotics. Because the trial determines only the choice of the initial antipseudomonal antibiotic and defers decisions regarding subsequent doses of antibiotics (eg, duration of therapy, esca-lation, de-
 escalation) to treating clinicians, enrolment, trial 
group assignment and the primary study procedure (admin-istration 
of the assigned antibiotic) commonly occurs within 
1 hour of meeting eligibility criteria.
Because the study was expected to pose minimal risk and 
prospective informed consent was considered to be imprac-ticable, a waiver of informed consent was requested and granted from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center IRB.
Protocol changes
ClinicalTrials.Gov will be updated with any amendments to the protocol as per SPI[INVESTIGATOR_184959] (online supplemental file 7).
Dissemination plan
Trial results will be submitted to a peer-
 reviewed journal for 
consideration of publication and will be presented at one or more scientific conferences. Data will be made available following publication (online supplemental file 8).
CONCLUSION
T
o allow for a clearer and more objective interpretation 
of trial results, this description delineates the ACORN trial methods and analysis prior to the conclusion of enrolment.

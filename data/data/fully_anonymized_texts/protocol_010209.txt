7 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
There are numerous transdermal  drug delivery systems (TDDS) that are currently 
available in the [LOCATION_002], the first of which was approved by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) in 1979  [1]. TDDS are very attractive, convenient and easy to use 
systems and are available in vari ous forms i ncluding patches (matrix or reservoir), 
sprays, gels, and ointments. Drug release from these TDDS varies significantly and is 
dependent on a number of factors including system design, physicochemical properties 
of the drug, excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], occlusion, sweat, sk in condition, skin type and temperature. 
Investigating the influence of these factors on drug release from reference and generic 
products that are often available in different forms is important to ensure that generic 
products are not less safe than the re ference product. In this proposal we will focus on 
inves tigating the influence of heat on drug release from reference and generic products 
that are available in matrix systems. Systemic absorption of drugs is dependent on 
cutaneous blood flow. Application of, or exposure to heat, allows gradual increase in 
cutaneous blood flow and  an increase in the absorption rate .  Indeed, exposure to heat 
has been demonstrated to increase drug release from TDDS , which led to increased 
serum concentrations of  numerous dru gs (e.g., fentanyl  and nicotine ) and raised a 
number of safety concerns  [2-8]. As a result , almost all TDDS that are currently available 
have warnings against heat exposure. The issue is, if a reference product has a warning 
against applying heat, the generic product wil l have the same warning regardless of the 
dissimilarity that may exist between them (i.e., differences in inactive ingredients or type 
of TDDS) , and it is possible that release rate and absorption rate of the same drug 
differs from different TDDS in response to heat.  
2.[ADDRESS_597684] in vivo studies to compare the influence of 
heat on fentanyl drug release from FDA approved TDDS products (reference e.g. 
Duragesic®, versus generic products  e.g. Apotex and Mylan tra nsdermal patches ) that 
have different inactive ingredients . While there is data in the literature for heat effect on 
different active pharmaceutical ingredients (API’s), specifically reference listed drugs 
(RLD), from exposure to heating blankets, sauna, h ot showers, exercising, there is no 
head to head comparisons for heat effect on RLD v ersus  generic drugs. This study will 
help support policy development for characterization of heat effects for future generic 
applications. Furthermore, if in -vitro in -vivo correlation (IVIVC) can be established, then 
in vitro studies can be used for generic applications in the future, which would mitigate 
The Effect of Heat on Fentanyl Release from  Fentanyl Patches in Healthy Adults  Version 8.[ADDRESS_597685] variability available in terms of generic transdermal systems with 
different formulations that are approved and already on the market. This study will 
provide data that could potentially help us determine if one formulation/adhe sive is more 
prone to heat effect/changes in delivery compared to another. Furthermore by 
[CONTACT_466078] . To mitigate the potential risk of a higher absorption of fentanyl through 
the skin, the lowest strength patch is being used in this study (25 µg/hr) .

The Effect of Heat on Fentanyl Release from  Fentanyl Patches in Healthy Adults  Version 8.[ADDRESS_597686] is to determine serum  fentanyl  levels after 
using reference (Duragesic®, matrix type patch, Janssen Pharmaceutics ) and generic 
fentanyl (Apotex  and Mylan)  transdermal patches with and without standardized heat  
application in healthy adult volunteers . 
 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
The main outcome measure of the study is the measurement of maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax); time of maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of fentanyl  and 
area under the curve (AUC) attained with and without heating in each of the three  
fentanyl patches (reference and generic).

10 4   STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open -label, non-placebo controlled pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment study . The 
study will consist of  six-procedure  days  (10 subjects) with at least two week s between 
procedure  days . The half -life of fentanyl  is approximately 24 hours. Hence, 7 days  (i.e. 5 half -
lives) will be sufficient for >95% of fentanyl  to be eliminated from the body. Each of the 1 0 
subjects will be enrolled  to complete all six procedure  days  (Procedure  Days 1 to 6). The study 
is open label and not blinded, because PK assessment is not subject to participant and/or 
observer bias. After each procedure  session  (procedure day)  is comple ted, the available safety 
data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_202421] (ISM) to determine whether or not to 
proceed to the next procedure  day. 
 
The six procedure s days  are as follows:  
 
Procedure  Day 1:  An Apotex  (fentanyl) patch will be applied without heat  for 11 hours, then a 
theratherm ® heating pad will be applied over it (see details in Manual of Procedures) and set to  
induce a skin temp erature  of 42.0 ± 2°C for 1 hour then removed, and the patch will be kept on 
for another 7 hours (patch wil l be applied for a total of 19 hours), then it will be removed . Each 
subject will receive a naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg oral tablet 1 2 ± 1 hour and shortly prior to 
patch application a nd then every 12 ± 1 hour for 8 additional doses , then one dose every  24 ± 2 
hours for two  more doses . A total of twelve  50 mg oral doses of naltrexone will be administered . 
 
Procedure  Day 2:  An Apotex  (fentanyl) patch will be applied without heat for 18 hours, then a  
theratherm ® heating pad will be applied over it and set to  induce a skin temp erature  of 42.0 ± 
2°C for 1 hour, then the patch and the heating pad will both be removed (patch will be applied 
for a total of 19 hours). Each subject will receive a naltrexone hydrochlorid e 50 mg oral tablet 1 2 
± 1 hour and shortly  prior to patch application and then every 12 ± 1 hour for 8 additional doses , 
then one dose every 24  ± 2 hours for two more doses . A total of twelve  50 mg oral doses of 
naltrexone will be administered.  
 
Procedure  Day 3:  A Duragesic® patch will be applied without heat for 1 1 hours, then a 
theratherm ® heating pad will be applied over it and set to  induce  a skin temp erature  of 42.0 ±

CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypotheses  
Due to differen ces in inactive ingredients between reference and generic fentanyl  
transdermal patches the release rate of fentanyl  may differ from these patches upon 
exposure to heat. As a result, in this study the influence of standardized heat 
application (two heat per iods) on the pharmacokinetics ( PK) parameters of fentanyl  
will be studied after using Duragesic® (reference) , Apotex  (fentanyl)  (generic) , and 
Mylan  (fentanyl ) (generic) transdermal patches.  
 
The primary analysis will be to determine whether heat differentially impacts fentanyl  
serum  concentrations among  Duragesic® (reference) , Apotex  (fentanyl), and Mylan  
(fentanyl)  transdermal patches.  We will test the null hypothesis (H 0) that the 
coefficien t for the patch -by-heat interaction equals zero, adjusting for time.  
7.2 Pharmacokinetics (PK) Analyses  
Fentanyl concentrations will be measur ed in serum  samples collected from each subject 
from the opposite arm to which the fentanyl  system will be applied. Blood samples 
(approximately 5 mL) will be collected during each procedure  day, 15 min before patch 
application and then at 1:00, 10:00, 10:55, 11:05, 11:15, 11:25, 11:35, 11:45, 12:00, 
13:00, 14:00, 16:00, 17:00, 17:55, 18:05, 18: 15, 18:25, 18:35, 18:45, 19:00 20:00, 21:00 
and  22:[ADDRESS_597699] -patch application. The fentanyl PK parameters to be estimated using 
non-compartmental analysis (NCA) after each system application  are: maximum serum  
concentration (Cmax) at different time inte rvals; 0 -11, 0-19, 0 -22, 11-12, 12-18, 18-19 
and 19-22 hr; apparent elimination rate constant (k); apparent half -life (t1/2), calculated 
as 0.693/k; AUC of the serum  concentration –time at different time intervals; 0-11, 0-19, 
0-22, 1 1-12, 12 -18, 18-19 and 19-22 hr determined by [CONTACT_39441]; 
and AUC value extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), calculated as the sum of AUC 22 and the 
area extrapolated to infinity: AUCinf = AUC 22 + C 22/k where C [ADDRESS_597700] 
quantifiable concentration. All NCA analyses will be conducted using Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® 6.3 (Pharsight, a Certara Company, CA).

21 7.3 Final Analysis Plan  
The main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of heat application on the 
PK parameters of fentanyl  after using reference and generic patch products. The primary 
PK parameters to be compared are 1) Cmax, before and after heat application and 2) 
AUC  before and after heat application  consistent with similar PK studies  [4, 5, 7, 8, 16-
22]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by [CONTACT_447] -hoc Bonferroni test will be used for 
comparing the differences in the means of the PK parameters and significant differences 
will be declared at p<0.05. T he statistical comparisons will be conducted as follow:  
 
Three pair -wise comparisons between the patches ( Apotex  v Mylan; Apotex  v 
Duragesic®; and Mylan v Duragesic®) will be performed using the results of a three -way 
repeated -measures  ANOVA. The model will include time, type of patch (e.g., Apotex  or 
Mylan), application of heat (yes or no), and interaction between patch and application of 
heat. The time term comprises multiple indicator variables for maximum model flexibility 
to perfor m the comparison at different time points specified above. We will test the null 
hypothesis that the coefficient for the patch -by-heat interaction equals zero, adjusting for 
time.  
 
If fentanyl concentrations are found to be non -normally distributed, then w e will examine 
Box-Cox transformations (e.g., log, square -root, etc.) that can achieve normality. If no 
transformation can achieve normality, then we will use permutation tests to compute 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477] p -values, and we will use the bootstrap to compute standar d errors and 
confidence intervals that account for within -person correlation.  
 
A secondary analysis will assess the effects of heat and time on fentanyl within a patch. 
Specifically, the ANOVA will also include interaction terms of time with patch and hea t, 
and a three -way interaction between time, heat, and patch. Inclusion of the three -way 
term allows the effects of heat on fentanyl to differ by [CONTACT_462674]. Testing the time -by-heat 
interaction, separately for each patch, using the same procedure outlined abov e 
produces estimates of intra -procedure effects.

Protocol Title:  
F18 NaF PET/CT and  WB/axial MRI  for the Detection of  Metastases in Patients with  Biochemical 
Recurrence of Prostate Cancer  (PC)  
 
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
Using newer scan techniques to screen for recurrence in prostate cancer patients who have rising PSA 
after prostatectomy  
Study Phase:  
Phase II  
Participating Sites:  
City of Hope Cancer Center  
Rationale for this Study:  
Current imaging modalities have low sensitivity to detect recurrence in patients who have rising PSA 
after prostatectomy as evidenced by a high percentage of patients who fail to respond to salvage local 
therapy. While not routinely used, MRI is part of the NCCN guidelines for evalu ating disease in this 
patient population, and F -18 NaF PET/CT is FDA approved for the detection of bone metastasis, the 
most common site of distant recurrence. As a result, we will implement the routine use of these new 
imaging modalities in addition to th e historically used imaging tests in a prospective cohort to 
document the added benefit.  We hypothesize that combination of  WB/axial MRI and F-18 NaF 
PET/CT  will   localize the site of recurrence in significant proportion of these patients.  
 
Objectives:  
Primary Ob jective : To determine the proportion  of patients with biochemically -recurrent PC in 
whom imaging with WB/axial MRI and F -18 NaF PET/CT results in detection of metastatic disease 
not visualized on CT scan and bone scan.  
Secondary Objectives:  
To estimate the percent of eligible patients with negative, indeterminate and positive CT 
scan/bone scan and targeted X -rays if done.  
To determine the proportion of patients with biochemically recurrent PC in whom recurrence in 
the prostate bed can be visu alized using  WB/axial  MRI in the absence of detection using  CT scan.  
To correlate the presence of metastatic disease detected using  WB/axial MRI and/or F -18 NaF 
PET/CT with the predicted 6 -year probability of progression -free survival based on the Memoria l 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center salvage RT PC nomogra m, and with PSA levels at baseline.  
To compare the role of axial MRI of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_436606]/axial MRI with respect to their ability to 
identify sites of disease. Similarly, to evaluate the relative contribu tion of F -18 NaF PET and 
MRI.

Version:  03   Patients with t wo PSA  values   ≥0.2 ng/mL at least [ADDRESS_553059].  The results of the scans will be 
classified as: 1) consistent with visible recurrence, 2) indeterminate 3) negative.  
Patients who were classified as having negative bone scan  and CT scan (estimated ≥90% of patients) 
will undergo MRI (axial MRI and WB MRI ) and F -18 NaF PET/CT . The outcome of these studies 
will be reported as 1) consistent with visible recurrence, 2) indeterminate 3) negative.  In cases of  
findings consistent wi th visible recurrence or indeterminate a  biopsy of the lesion of interest will be 
recommended  if feasible . Any enrolled patient without a positive biopsy will be followed and their 
treatment (at discretion of treating physician), PSA values and outcome wil l be recorded to evaluate 
the scan result specificity and sensitivity in relation to additional information provided with follow -
up  (e.g. if patients undergo Salvage Radiation Therapy, PSA response will be recorded which will 
have significant implication in the interpretation of radiologic findings (see 10).Subsequently all 
patients without biopsy proven metastasis will undergo follow up imaging studies  (the type of 
imaging to be recommended by [CONTACT_271486]))   within 4 -6 months to reassess any abnormalitie s in the 
context of time, ongoing therapy or no therapy.

2.0 Background 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development 
Background  
Each year, approximately 32,[ADDRESS_553067] a recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) 
after radical prostatectomy.[ADDRESS_553068] of these patients the only manifestation of recurrent disease is an 
increasing level of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood detected through routine monitoring 
after surgery. A PSA level of ≥0.2 ng/mL is considered the threshold for biochemical recurrence.[ADDRESS_553069] not previously received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) can potentially be 
cured by [CONTACT_436617]. However, this treatment approach is complicated by [CONTACT_436618].3, 4 Therefore accurate localization of recurrent disease has 
significant therapeutic implications.  
Currently, there is no consensus regarding the use of specific imaging techniques in patients with 
biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCCN) guidelines 
suggest obtaining “+/- CT scan, +/- bone scan, +/- Ultrasound, +/- MRI” indicating lack of any 
m
eaningful guidelines.  In addition, in 2011, the FDA approved F-18 NaF PET/CT for the detection of 
bone metastases for Medicare beneficiaries through the Coverage with Evidence Development/National 
oncologic PET Registry program (NOPR) adding to the available options with limited guidelines. 
Currently at City of Hope, patients who present with a PSA level of ≥0.2 ng/mL after radical 
prostatectomy typi[INVESTIGATOR_436608] (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, bone scan 
(BS), targeted X-rays (TXR), and occasionally Prostascint scanning, with the primary goal of excluding 
the presence of metastatic disease. However, these imaging modalities often fail to detect metastatic 
disease, especially early in the course of PC recurrence when the cancer burden is low.[ADDRESS_553070] in the detection of metastases in patients with biochemically-recurrent PC is 
low, especially when PSA levels are <10 ng/mL.6The detection of metastatic bone cancer with BS is low 
because it detects bone deposits from osteoblasts, not directly from cancer cells;7 BS is positive in <1% of 
patients who present with biochemically-recurrent PC and a PSA level of <10 ng/mL.5 Prostascint 
scanning has significant limitations because it only recognizes the intracellular domain of prostate 
specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and, likely due to the low detection rate, Prostascint scans do not 
correlate with the efficacy of salvage RT in PC.8  As a result, the reported long-term success rate of 
salvage RT ( in patients with negative CT scan and bone scan) ranges from 10-50%. This suggests that 
the majority of patients (50-90%) with biochemically-recurrent PC have occult metastases that are not 
visualized by [CONTACT_436619],9, 10,11. It is therefore clinically very important to improve the 
ac
curacy of radiologic assessment of patients with biochemically recurrent PC. This may have significant 
importance in the appropriate selection of patients for local salvage therapy or systemic treatments. Our

Version:  03   strategy involves the application of the two more recent imaging techniques (each either part of the 
NCCN guidelines or FDA approved) that have demonstrated the potential to better detect distant 
metastatic disease in patients with high risk prostate cancer.  As the previous studies did not restrict the 
population to biochemically recurrent prostate cancer only, additional studies in this specific and more 
uniform patient population are needed to help refine and provide more meaningful imaging guidelines, 
motivating this prospective imaging study.  Specifically, these imaging tests are often not routinely 
covered by [CONTACT_436620][INVESTIGATOR_436609]/approval, and we hope that 
this study will help convince the community that these newer tests are justified in this specific patient 
population. 
MRI 
MRI can detect bone metastases in cancer patients. It’s superiority over bone scan has been repeatedly 
demonstrated 12, 13, 14, 15.  As a result, some have called MRI a “gold standard” for detection and 
confirmation of bone metastases (14, 15, 16), although due to availability, inconvenience and cost, many 
centers have not adopted its routine use.    
Classically, the terms sensitivity and specificity are used in evaluating diagnostic tests.  However, it is 
infeasible to know if microscopic metastatic disease was missed when the scans are negative, and as a 
result the human studies comparing  MRI to bone scan and targeted X-rays use a measure of “sensitivity” 
(based on “best valuable comparator (BVC)”) that only conveys that the MRI is superior to bone scan and 
targeted X-rays.  In a study by [CONTACT_436621]. (17)  [ADDRESS_553071] metastatic disease by [CONTACT_436622], all 41were positive on MRI, suggesting that MRI did not 
miss any lesions identified by [CONTACT_436623].  More importantly, 7 of the 23 (30%) of patients who would 
have been considered negative with bone scan and targeted X-rays were determined to have metastatic 
disease on MRI, and considered positive by [CONTACT_436622].  Combined, this demonstrates that MRI has high 
specificity (no false positive calls), did not miss any positive findings on bone scan and X-ray, and was 
able to visualize evidence of metastatic disease in 30% of the patients deemed negative on bone scan and 
X-ray.  As a result, there is a general consensus about the superiority of MRI techniques over bone scan in 
the detection of bone metastases, although the high sensitivity quoted in the literature is known to not 
relate to the more classic definition of sensitivity (e.g. sensitivity to detect a known lesion of a certain 
size) and the quoted specificities also need further evaluation  
Whole-body MRI (WB MRI) has a number of distinct advantages over other imaging techniques, 
i
ncluding the ability to simultaneously assess bone and soft tissue, high soft tissue contrast, no ionizing 
RT, and a versatile ability to measure both anatomic and functional tissue properties based on different 
tissue contrast modes. WB MRI has been shown to be feasible for detecting metastasis in cancer 
patients.18, [ADDRESS_553072] imaging techniques.17 Diffusion Weighted Imaging MRI (DWI-MRI) is 
anot
her specialized MRI imaging technique that has been applied as a WB scan to detect abnormal tissue 
cellularity in cancer patients.20 WB DWI-MRI outperformed BS in detecting bone metastases in a study 
of 100 patients with high-risk PC (56 of these patients had biochemical recurrence following local 
therapy). Specifically, WB DWI-MRI detected bone metastases in 5 of 44 (11%) of patients in whom BS 
was negative.[ADDRESS_553073] (F-18 NaF PET/CT)  
Page 11 of 30 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]  Version Date:   04/08/2016 
Version:  03   F-18 NaF PET/CT is a molecular imaging technique FDA approved for detection of bone metastasis in 
PC patients. Fluoride tracer uptake is a biomarker for bone metabolism. PET/CT has higher resolution, 
contrast, and sensitivity than traditional bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
imaging and greater specificity than BS.22 CT alone may be unable to identify small metastatic lesions 
<3m
m. The functional contrast provided by [CONTACT_436624].  
In the series of 44 high-risk prostate cancer patients Even-Sapir et al. 23 reported that 21patients were 
negative on the F-18 NaF PET/CT, and all of these patients had no clinical or imaging evidence of 
metastatic spread for at least the 6-month follow-up period.  In addition, [ADDRESS_553074] metastatic disease based on definitive PET/CT, biopsy, imaging and follow-up.  20 of the 23 were 
determined to be positive based on PET/CT and [ADDRESS_553075] and bone scan was 16.2%.24  
T
he complementary strengths of MRI and PET/CT imaging suggest an advantage to combining these 
scans for staging patients. Previous research has explored the suitability of combining WB/axial MRI 
with PET/CT in cancer patients,25 and the advantage of a multiparametric approach towards detecting 
m
etastatic spread in PC patients has been suggested.26  
 
However, no group has evaluated F-18 NaF PET/CT plus WB/axial MRI in patients with biochemically 
recurrent prostate cancer (or prostate cancer in general), nor have they evaluated it in the context of 
patients with negative CT scan, BS and targeted X-rays.  In view of the poor performance of currently 
utilized imaging techniques coupled with data supporting both F-18 PET/CT and MRI, along with NCCN 
guidelines for the use of MRI and FDA approval of F-18 NaF PET/CT for evaluating bone lesions, we 
propose a novel  diagnostic  approach: adding WB/axial MRI and F-18 NaF PET/CT to standard imaging 
(CT scan and BS) for patients negative on CT scan and BS to better detect and characterize metastatic and 
recurrent disease in biochemically-recurrent PC patients. If successful, our study has the potential to 
change the paradigm of disease management for patients with biochemically recurrent PC by: 1) 
identifying a clinically significant proportion of patients with distant metastasis and excluding them from 
salvage RT, thus sparing them the morbidity and cost of an unnecessary treatment; and 2) enriching for 
patients who have the highest likelihood of benefitting from salvage RT, thus better justifying RT-
associated morbidity and the substantial cost of treatment. 
Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that combination of WB/axial MRI and F-18 NaF PET/CT will detect metastatic disease 
in a significant proportion of patients (>5%) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer who have a 
negative bone scan, CT scan and targeted X-rays.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_553076], abdomen and pelvis. Targeted X-rays (TXR) will be obtained in case of 
equivocal findings if suggested by [CONTACT_172922]. Patients who have CT scan and or bone scan that are 
i
nterpreted as positive or indeterminate will be managed in a standard way at the discretion of the treating 
physician. That will frequently include additional imaging modalities and therapy as appropriate , Patients 
with CT scan and bone scan that are interpreted as negative (estimated ≥ 90 %) will undergo WB/axial

period, although up to 8 weeks will be allowed. 
One of the possible outcomes will be assigned to WB/axial MRI scan, and F18 NaF PET/CT scan: 1) 
consistent with visible recurrence   2) indeterminate 3) negative. In cases when the combination of  
WB/axial MRI  and 18-F NaF PET/CT scan are interpreted as consistent with recurrence or indeterminate   
biopsy of the lesion of interest will be recommended if feasible (The presence of histologically proven 
metastasis will be considered the “gold standard” for the confirmation of metastasis, while recognizing 
that such confirmation will be rarely achieved.).Fifty six patients will be evaluated over [ADDRESS_553077] (IRB) approved consent

study. A non-contrast scan will be initially acquired over the liver and the kidneys. [ADDRESS_553086] agent (Bracco, Princeton, NJ) adjusted for weight will be injected intravenously. After 
a 40-second delay, a chest scan will be acquired. Following a cumulative 75-second delay, an abdominal 
scan will be acquired from the diaphragm to the pelvic crest. [ADDRESS_553087] to reach the bladder before a final pelvic scan is acquired. Each scan will be acquired in a 
single breath hold with the following parameters: 120 kV, pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025] = 1.375, mA selected based on patient 
weight, and reconstruction using filtered back projection (FBP) with matrix size = 512 x 512 with two 
di

respectively. 
 
Bone Scan (BS)  
A protocol routinely used at City of Hope for a BS will be used in this study based on a dual-head GE 
Infinia Imaging System ( GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI). 18 m Ci Tc-99 m m ethylene 
diphosphonate (MDP) will be injected intravenously. The patient will be asked to void all fluids prior to 
image acquisition. 2.[ADDRESS_553088]-injection, the patient will be scanned in the anterior to posterior 
direction with a single WB pass. Spot images will be taken of the lateral skull, anterior/ posterior chest 
and pelvis, and any other areas requested by [CONTACT_102649]. Total imaging time will be 40-60 
minutes. Data will be acquired for a total of 1000 k counts for the torso and 500 k for the extremities and 
will be reconstructed on a 256 x 256 matrix. 
WB/axial MRI  
All MR images will be acquired on a 3T MRI System (Magnetom Verio Model, Siemens Healthcare, 
Erlangan, [LOCATION_013]). The MR exam will consist of three types of images; T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and 
DWI. The sequence parameters for each of these scans are shown below (Table 2). DWI-MRI will consist 
of an echo planar imaging sequence with diffusion-sensitizing gradients in x, y, and z planes that will be 
applied before and after 180
  pulses. Diffusion will be measured in orthogonal planes and averaged in 
or
der to avoid directional bias since it is expected that tumors will show anisotropic movement of water. 
Images will be acquired for two b-values (50, 800) reflecting a range of sensitivity for the pulse sequence 
to changes in diffusion.

Version:  03   7.3 Definitions 
Adverse Event - An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical experience or change of an 
e
xisting condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be 
related to the protocol intervention.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as an y expected or 
unexpected adverse event  that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 Life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); 
 Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Secondary Malignancy, or 
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Unanticipated problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience or outcome that m eets all 
three  of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB 
approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. R elated or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_36923], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND

be mild (itching, rash) or severe (difficulty breathing or sudden shock).  Death resulting from an allergic 
reaction is rare.  Most reactions can be controlled by [CONTACT_436626].  Participants should inform their doctor if they have allergies of any kind (such as hay 
fever, iodine allergy, eczema , hives, or food allergies).  The contrast material used during a CT scan can 
also cause water loss or damage to the kidneys that may lead to kidney failure.  This is of particular 
concern if there is underlying poor kidney function, dehydration, or diabetes .  Participants will be exposed 
to a limited and medically acceptable dose of radiation during the procedure.  There is always a slight risk 
from being exposed to any radiation, including low levels of X-rays used for a CT scan.  Participants may 
also experience discomfort related to lying still in an enclosed space for a prolonged period of time.

8.3 PET/CT 
The tracer used in the PET/CT scan is radioactive but short lived and poses little to no risk.  Participants 
may experience claustrophobia from being inside the PET/CT scan or experience mild discomfort from 
lying on the PET scanner table.  A sedative such as Diazepam or lorazepam may be prescribed if 
participant is unable to relax, lie still, or for those who experience claustrophobia.  There can be side 
effects from diazepam or lorazepam. The more common side effects are: 
 Drowsiness which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 Dizziness which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 Dry mouth which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 Diarrhea which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 Upset stomach which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 Blurred vision which is temporary and may require additional medication 
 
Participants may experience pain and tenderness, bruising or a skin reaction at the injection site when 
given the study drug injection that will be administered through an intravenous (IV) catheter.  As with any 
IV placement, there is a risk of infection at the site but the careful and clean procedure used for placing 
the IV almost completely removes this risk.   
8.4 MRI 
Risks include possible anxiety and claustrophobia related to being placed in the large body scanner; 
temporary discomfort related to having to lie still during the procedure; and possible pain, infection and 
bleeding related to venipuncture if contrast dye is used.  Because MRI works through a powerful 
magnetic field, it cannot be done if participants have a pacemaker, intracranial aneurysm clips or other 
metal implants (for example, types of implants used in eye surgery or orthopedic [bone] surgery), 
artificial limbs and other medical devices that contain iron.  Also, there is a risk that metal objects coming 
near
 the magnet may become dangerous as they are pulled toward the magnet.  The magnetic field will 
stop a watch that is within several yards of the magnet.  Severe injury or death can occur when subjects 
with implanted neurological stimulators undergo MRI scans.  Participants should discuss any metal 
devices in their body with the study staff.  In addition, when having an MRI scan, iron pi[INVESTIGATOR_436611]/or swelling around 
the eye.  For subjects that need an MRI scan and have reduced kidney function there is a chance of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," a condition characterized by [CONTACT_436628], stiffening of the joints and possible reduction in the ability to move around. This condition is 
associated with the MRI contrast agent gadolinium and occurs mostly in subjects with severe kidney 
disease.  The risk to subjects with mild kidney problems is anticipated to be small . Participants will be 
ques
tioned and examined, if necessary, to confirm that they may undergo MRI scanning without 
addi
tional risk.  An x-ray may be performed to rule out the presence of a suspected foreign body before 
the MRI. 
8.5   Biopsy 
Biopsy will be recommended in selected patients (Table1)  
Risks of biopsy will depend on the site of biopsy and patient’s underlying medical conditions like 
potential coagulopathy. Risks include: Pain and discomfort, bleeding at the biopsy site, tenderness at the 
biopsy site, scarring at the biopsy site, rarely, an infection at the biopsy site.

10.1   V er
ification of Scan Results 
10.1.1 Biopsy of Suspected Metastases 
Biopsy of metastatic sites of prostate cancer patients is feasible.27 Bone biopsies of patients with 
k
nown, advanced metastatic prostate cancer are performed with increasing frequency with yield 
exceeding 50 % (personal communications, [CONTACT_436632] , University of Michigan)   We 
estimate that in our population of patients  biopsies will  be accomplished in approximately 25% 
of  cases of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_436612] . Based on our personal experience and personal communications we anticipate 
extremely high willingness of patients to undergo biopsy of suspected lesions.  
The presence of histologically proven metastasis will be considered the “gold standard” for the 
confirmation of metastasis.   However since majority of patients will not be able to undergo 
bi
opsies we will utilize two additional strategies to confirm the interpretation of imaging studies. 
10.2.PSA Response To Salvage Radiation Therapy 
The majority of our population of patients (unless biopsy proven metastases are discovered) will 
be offered salvage radiation therapy to the prostate bed. The concept of this therapy is that all the 
recurrent cancer cells may be located in the radiation field around prostate bed. Therefore the 
expected result of salvage RT is PSA level becoming undetectable (<0.04 ng/dL) within 6-8 
w
eeks following completion of therapy.  
 
Possible scenarios: 
a) The undetectable PSA level following salvage RT would be a very strong indicator that any 
visible abnormalities outside of the radiation field are false positives. If those lesions were “real” 
metastases (even extremely small) they would be expected to produce detectable amounts of 
PSA.  
 
b) If PSA does not become undetectable (< 0.04 ng/dL) in patients with completely normal scans 
that would be considered false negative. 
 
c) In patients who have abnormalities visible on the scans and inwhom salvage RT to prostate bed 
does not result in undetectable PSA level, then it is highly likely that the visible lesions are indeed 
true positives (likely sources of persistent PSA elevation).  This scenario is the most difficult to 
interpret, because it is possible (but in my opi[INVESTIGATOR_436613]) that the source of PSA is 
related to invisible metastases and identified lesions are benign.

Version:  03    
10.2   Follow-up scans 
Evolution of lesions over the period of time provides invaluable help in the verification of original 
interpretation of the scans even in the absence of biopsy. Therefore all the patients will undergo follow up 
scans (the type advised by [CONTACT_271486]) 4-6 months after registration to the protocol. These scans will be 
interpreted in the context of ongoing therapy (i.e. hormonal therapy) or observation. Several possible 
scenarios will allow us to interpret and verify the findings on the original scans.  
a) The persistence, growth, increase in numbers and intensity of enhancement of lesions in patients on 
observation would strongly favor the interpretation of a true positive finding.  
b) Complete stability over time or resolution of lesions without ongoing therapy would strongly favor 
false positive interpretation.  
c) Evolution of lesions (regression, radiologic signs of healing in the context of ongoing hormonal 
therapy (and lack of any history of trauma) would strongly support the interpretation of true positive scans 
d) Complete stability of lesions despi[INVESTIGATOR_436614]/axial MRI and F-18 
NaF PET/CT we will be able to provide the most robust assessment of sensitivity and specificity of these 
i
maging modalities in the literature that may prove to be quite useful in the management of patients with 
biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

and On-Study Forms. 
11.4   Protocol Deviations 
             11.4.1 Deviation Policy 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation 
Policy” located at 
http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Documents/Institutional%20Deviation%20Policy.pdf . 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity 
require prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.  In addition, if 
contractually obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.  IRB pre-approved SSE 
protocol modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The 
submission of a deviation report is not required. 
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can 
also extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease 
progression.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_91597].  Examples include, 
but are not limited to:  a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) alteration in

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]  Version Date:   04/08/2016 
Version:  03   treatment schedule due to non-availability of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory 
test results which are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that do not affect 
participant safety.  These instances are considered to be deviations from the protocol.  A 
deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB within five days. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_553103] to 
report to the IRB following review. 
             11.4.3   Resolving Disputes 
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a 
protocol deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key 
point, the IDS should rely on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177380]. 
In situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the 
persons involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_91598] (or designee) to arrive at resolution. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_553104] more than 90% of the patients enrolling in this study will be negative for metastatic disease 
based on CT, bone scan and targeted X-rays if ordered.   
Primary Endpoint/Sample size justification: 
With [ADDRESS_553105] 
undocumented metastatic disease.  The use of WB/axial MRI and 18-F NaF PET will be considered 
worthwhile if more than 8% of these patients (8% rate) are determined to be positive for metastatic 
disease based on the newer scan technologies.    Assuming [ADDRESS_553106] 4 patients, there is less than a 5% 
chance of declaring a discouraging 3% rate to be promising (type I error), and greater than 86% power for 
declaring a true 15%  rate to be a success.  The actual power should be higher as it is expected number of 
patients negative on standard scans is approximately [ADDRESS_553107] scans and positive on the newer scans can be estimated with a 95% CI half-width of less than 
15%. Final determination of success will include an evaluation of the follow-up scans and treatment 
results (when applicable) to fully evaluate the role of the newer scans. 
Accrual: 
56patients will be accrued over 24 months for an accrual rate between 2-3 patients a month. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints in the context of this study are exploratory: 
1. To e stimate the percent of eligible patients with negative, indeterminate and positive CT 
scan/bone scan and targeted X-rays if done. With 56 patients, the percent positive for 
meta
static disease can be estimated with a 95% CI half-width of less than 13%.

13.2   Recruitment of Subjects 
Patients for the study with will be recruited from patients undergoing therapy for metastatic castration 
resistant prostate cancer at the City of Hope Cancer Center    
13.3   Advertisements  
Advertisements to include print, media (radio, television, billboards), telephone scripts, lay summary to 
be posted on City of Hope’s public Clinical Trials On-LineSM website, etc., will be reviewed and 
appr
oved by [CONTACT_177449].  
13.4   Study location and Performance Sites 
This study will be performed at City of Hope 
13.5   Confidentiality  
This research will be conducted in compliance with federal and state of [LOCATION_004] requirements relating 
to protected health information (PHI).  The study will record individual results of imaging studies and this 
will be linked to the subject’s identity using a coded study number.  The principal investigator, co-
investigators, and radiology technicians will have access to this information, but all information will be 
treated confidentially.  No identifiers will be used in any subsequent publication of these results.

Version:  [ADDRESS_553111] of care scans 
(CT scan, bone scan and if needed targeted X-Rays) and if needed biopsy of suspected lesions will 
be the responsibility of the research participant and/or the insurance carrier.  The research 
participant will be responsible for all copayments, deductibles, and other costs of treatment and 
diagnostic procedures as set forth by [CONTACT_91642].  The research participant and/or the 
insurance carrier will be billed for the costs of treatment and diagnostic procedures in the same 
way as if the research participant were not in a research study.  Newer imaging studies ( W B/axial  
MRI, F-18 NaF PET/CT ) will be covered by a study budget.   Neither the research participant nor the 
i
nsurance carrier will be responsible for these procedures related to this study. 
 
In the event of physical injury to a research participant, resulting from the newer scan procedures, 
appropriate medical treatment will be available at the City of Hope to the injured research 
participant, however, financial compensation will not be available.   The research participant will not 
be paid for taking part in this study. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_553112]’s bill of rights and the 
HIPAA research authorization form.  Research subjects will be informed that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason without prejudice, including as applicable, their current or future 
care or employment at City of Hope or any relationship they have with City of Hope.  Research subjects 
will be afforded sufficient time to consider whether or not to participate in the research. 
Should sufficient doubt be raised regarding the adequacy of comprehension, further clarifications will be 
made and the questionnaire repeated until a satisfactory result is obtained.  Prospective research subjects 
who cannot adequately comprehend the fundamental aspects of the research study with a reasonable 
amount of discussion, education and proctoring will be ineligible for enrollment.  For those subjects who 
do comprehend the fundamental aspects of the study, consent will be obtained and documented, followed 
by [CONTACT_177451].  The research team will review the results of eligibility testing and determine if the 
subject is a candidate for study enrollment.

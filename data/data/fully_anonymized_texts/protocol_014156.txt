Biomarkers of the inflammatory state , such as C -reactive protein ( CRP), interleukin -1 (IL -1), and 
interleukin -6 (IL -6), are elevated in maintenance hemodialysis  patients and are also robust predictors of 
cardiovascular disease and mortality in this patient population6,7,8.  In addition to its predictive ability, 
inflammation has been implicated in  the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  and 
protein -energy wasting.  There is ample evidence showing that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory 
process and pro -inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in its development9.  There are also  data 
supporting an intimate link between systemic inflammation and vascular calcification, an other 
important component of cardiovascular disease in end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) 10.  Pro-inflammatory 
cytokines also cause anorexia and skeletal muscle breakdown, lead ing to protein -energy wasting, a 
condition with significant morbidity and mortality risk in ESRD11.  Elevations in IL -[ADDRESS_103423] 
been associated with increased symptom burden and reduced  quality of life in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD)12.  Taken together, the available data in dicate a causal relationship between inflammation and 
morbidity  in ESRD patients rendering inflammation a critically important target to improve outcomes in 
this high risk patient population  (Figure 1) .

IL-1 plays a key role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.  Elevated levels of IL -1 result 
in secretion of chemokines  and other cytokines (eg, IL -6)13, increased levels of CRP14, increased 
expression of adhesion molecules, activation of endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation, 
macrophage activation, and increased vascular permeability.   IL-1 stimulates release of endothelin -115, a 
potent  vasoconstrictor, and also stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase, which increases the 
formation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species which leads to oxidative stress and 
endoth elial dysfunction16.  IL-1 is also implicated in the proposed link between  vascu lar calcification and 
systemic inflammation.  TNF-α induce s mineralization of calcifying vascular cells in vitro , and co -culture 
of these cells with monocyte⁄macrophages accelerate s mineralization17.  IL-[ADDRESS_103425] 
(IL1ra), in  patients with ESRD  receiving maintenance hemodialysis, through a [ADDRESS_103426]  
In comparison with  other specific anti- cytokine agents , there is more precedence for the use of IL -1ra as 
anti-cytokine therapy.  In addition to significant amelioration of the systemic inflammatory response in 
multiple chronic diseas e states such as rheumatologic  diseases and diabetes mellitus, short -term 
inhibition of IL -1 with the IL -1ra anakinra has been shown to reduce circulating markers of oxidative 
stress and improve  brachial artery flow -mediated dilation (an indicator of endothelial function)  in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis24.  There are also intriguing preliminary data for IL-[ADDRESS_103427].   In a placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_93465] -1 inhibition in 22 maintenance 
hemodialysis patients, 14  of whom completed the trial, the active treatment group had a 53% reduction

levels compared with a 20% increase in the placebo arm ( P = 0.03) 25.  In a subgroup of these patients 
who underwent metabolic studies using stable isotopes, anakinra resulted in a significant decrease in 
skeletal muscle breakdown compared to placebo  (Hung et al, ASN abstract presentat ion 2014).  These 
improvements were associated with an increase in serum adiponectin concentrations , suggesting 
significant metabolic and nutritional benefit in response to IL1 -ra administration in maintenance 
hemodialysis patients.  
 
In addition to studies  in ESRD patients , IL-1 antagonism has been studie d in non-dialysis dependent 
chronic kidney disease.  A recently completed  two-site pi[INVESTIGATOR_93466], an  interleukin -1 (IL -1) trap,  for 12 weeks in 42 patients with stage 3 -4 chronic kidney disease .  
This study found significant improvements in markers of inflammation (hsCRP, IL -6) and vascular health 
(brachial artery flow -mediated dilation) in the active drug group compared with  the placebo  group .  The 
medication was  very well tolerated without any significant side -effects. (Novak et al and Hung et al ASN 
2015,  Oral Presentation, Late -Breaking Clinical Trials session ). 
1.[ADDRESS_103428] labe l 
Anakinra (Kineret®)  is a therapeutic agent that blocks the effects of IL -1α and IL -1β by [CONTACT_93486] -1 type I receptor (IL -1RI).  Anakinra is a recombinant, non -glycosylated form of 
the naturally occurring human  interleukin -[ADDRESS_103429] (IL -1Ra).  It differs from native human 
IL-1Ra in that it has the addition of a single methionine residue at the amino terminus.  Anakinra is 
produced using recombinant technology in an E . coli bacterial expression system .  Anakinra is supplied 
commercially in single use 1 ml prefilled glass syringes as a sterile, clear, colorless -to-white, preservative 
free solution .  Each 1 ml prefilled glass syringe contains: 0.67 ml (100 mg) of anakinra in a solution (pH  
6.5) containin g sodium citrate (1.29 mg), sodium chloride (5.48 mg), disodium EDTA (0.12 mg) and 
polysorbate 80 (0.70 mg) in Water for Injection, USP.   
 
1.4.2 Intravenous a dministration of anakinra  
Anakinra has FDA marketing approval for subcutaneous administration but was initially developed for 
intravenous administration for patients with sepsis , and can be  administered intravenously .  The 
formulation used  for intravenous administration is identical to that used for subcutaneous 
administration , and, with the exception of in jection site reactions that can occur with subcutaneous  but 
not with intravenous  administration, the adverse event profiles do not differ based on administration 
route .  The ACTION trial will use intravenous administration of anakinra at a dose of 100 mg three times 
per week administered over 1 minute at the end of hemodialysis sessions.  The rationale for using 
intravenous rather than subcutaneous administration is as follows:   
 
1) Intrav enous administration eliminates a) the risk of injection site reactions, the most common 
adverse event with anakinra , and b) the risk of injection -associated pain .  Because these events are 
HDNT ACTION Trial   4 
Version  1.3, May 8, 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL

through the use of intravenous administration is relevant not only for participants receiving active drug 
but also for those randomized to placebo .  Injection site reactions are often mild but can result in 
abscess formation and  can necessitate discon tinuation of study drug.  Injection -associated pain is 
anticipated to be a deterrent to study participation.  Thus, the use of intravenous rather than 
subcutaneous administration of a nakinra for the ACTION trial is expected  to decrease risk of important 
adverse events, increase enrollment rates, and increase participant retention.  
 
2) Because anakinra can be administered through the hemodialysis extracorporeal blood circuit during 
regularly scheduled hemodialysis sessions, intravenous administration of anak inra does not require 
placement of venous access and should be  highly feasible in the research  setting and , if found to be 
beneficial,  in the clinical setting.   
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_103430] label, in mild renal impairment (creat inine clearance 50 -80 ml/min) and moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 30 -49 ml/min), the mean plasma clearance was reduced by 16% and 
50%, respectively.  For  patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) 
and end -stage renal disease, t he mean plasma clearance was decreased by 70% and 75% , respectively .  
The recommended dose of anakinra for patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis is 100 mg 
subcutaneous every other day  (from FDA product label) .   
 The pharmacokinetics  of anakinra wit h intravenous administration have  been studied in individuals  with 
normal kidney function and  various degrees of renal impairment
26.  Among individuals receiving 
maintenance hemodialysis, the mean plasma clearance of an akinra was 18.2 ± 3.2 ml/min compared 
with  137± 21 ml/min in individuals with normal kidney function .  The mean half- life of anakinra 
administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg was 7.15 hours in hemodialysis patients compared with 
2.64 hours in those with normal kidney function.  The plasma concentrations of anakinra at 24, 48, and 
72 hours after drug administration were similar with intravenous and subcutaneous administration.  
 
1.4.4 Dose Rationale for ACTION Trial  
The recommended dose of anakinra for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 100 mg per day 
administered subcutaneously.  The rec ommended dose of anakinra for Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic 
Syndromes  ( CAPS ) is 1 -2 mg/kg daily with a maximum dose of 8 mg/kg.  For patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min ) or ESRD , it is recommended that the pres cribed 
dose be administered every other day.  In the previous published trial of anakinra in hemodialysis  
patients , the dosing schedule was [ADDRESS_103431] that for patients receiving hemodialysis, the same dosing schedule can be used for intravenous 
and subcutaneous administration of anakinra26.  
1.5 Clinical Efficacy Evaluations of  Anakinra 
Anakinra was approved by [CONTACT_93488] 2002, and for (CAPS) in 2013.  At the time of regulatory approval t he efficacy of anakinra for 
rheumatoid art hritis had been evaluated in  three randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled  clinical 
trials  that enrolled a total of 1392 patients.  In two of these studies, anakinra was administered in 
combination with other disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs other than TNF blocking agents27,28, and 
in one study anakinra was used as monotherapy29.  Efficacy was evaluated using the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria (ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70).   Patients receiving active treatment 
were more likely to achieve an ACR20 or higher magnitude of response than patients treated with 
placebo.  Most of the responses occurred within 12 weeks.  An additional fourth randomized, placebo -
controlled trial in 1414 patients with rheumatoid arthritis was conducted to assess safety30.  In this trial, 
patients received a variety of c oncurrent medications, other than TNF blocking agents, including 
methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydrochloroquine, gold, penicillamine, leflunomide, and azathioprine, and 
the trial enrolled patients predisposed to infection based on comorbid conditions.   
The FDA approval of anakinra for Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndromes was based on a long -term, 
open label, uncontrolled study of 43 patients of 0.7 to 46 years of age with Neonatal- Onset Multisystem 
Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).  Treatment was administere d for up to [ADDRESS_103432] populations : 
1. Serious infections ( 2%) vs. placebo (<1%).  In studies of rheumatoid arthritis the incidence of serious 
infections over 6 months was 2%  in anakinra- treated patients and 1% in placebo -treated patients. 
Most of the infections were bacterial and included cellulitis, pneumonia an d bone and joint 
infections. Opportunistic infections from fungal, mycobacterial and bacterial pathogens have 
occurred in clinical studies and post -marketing experience.    
2. Neutropenia, particularly when used in combination with TNF blocking agents  (8%) vs  placebo (2%).  
3. Injection -site reactions with subcutaneous administration  are the most common adverse events . 
These  are generally mild, typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] 14 -28 days, and are characterized by [CONTACT_93489], ecchymosis, 
inflammation, and pain. In some studies, 71% of  the subjects treated with anakinra experienced an 
injection -site reaction , compared to  28% of individuals receiving saline placebo.  Injection site 
reactions are not a risk with intravenous administration as will be used in the ACTION study.  
HDNT ACTION Trial   [ADDRESS_103433] included headache (12% vs. 9%), 
nausea (8% vs. 6%), diarrhea (7% vs. 5%), sinusitis (7% vs. 6%), influenza- like symptoms (6% vs. 5%), 
and abdominal pain (5% vs. 4%).  
5. Hypersensitivity reactions including ana phylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported 
with anakinra.

  Version 1.0 of the protocol used a CRP threshold of > 3 mg/L with the stipulation that the threshold 
could be decreased to ≥2.0 mg/L if needed to facilitate enrollment.  In accordance with that stipulation, 
Version 1.3 of the protocol incorporates the new threshold of ≥2.0 mg/L.  In addition to enhancing 
enro llment, using the lower threshold will increase the generalizability of the findings, both in terms of 
safety and efficacy .

5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Anakinra will be  supplied  in pre -filled syringes  as a sterile, clear, colorless -to-white, preservative free 
solution.  Each syringe  will contain 100 mg in 0.67 ml solution (pH 6.5) containing disodium EDTA (0.12 
mg), sodium chloride (5.48 mg), sodium citrate (1.29 mg), and polysorbate 80 (0.70 mg) in Water for 
Injection, USP.  There will be no modification to the  formulation of the manufacturer -supplied anakinra.  
Saline (0.9%) will be used as the placebo.  The study drug will be refrigerated  at 2 ° C – 8 °C and will be 
kept away fro m light.    
5.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Study drug (100 mg ) will be administered  via a medication port in the extracorporeal dialysis blood 
circuit three times per week during the last [ADDRESS_103441] s.  Documentation includes study drug receipt, 
storage, dispensing, and final disposition.   
5.2.2 Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of study agent shipped, study agent consumed, and study agent remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the study agent 
reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investiga ted, resolved, and 
documented before  the return or destruction of unused study agent.  Study agent destroyed on site will 
be documented in the study files.  
5.3 Concomitant Therapy  
Information about m edication use will be collected at baseline and throughout th e course of the study.  
Appropriate sources for obtaining this information inclu de the participant, the medical/dialysis unit 
record, and treating clinicians.   
[ADDRESS_103442] Screening Visit ( Day –30 to Day –14) 
Patients  who appear  eligible based on pre -screening will be approached in person to determine interest 
in participation  and confirm eligibility.  S tudy personnel will discuss the study goals and procedures with 
the potential participant in detail.  If the patient agrees  to participat e in the study, study pers onnel will 
review and assess understanding of the entire informed consent form before  obtaining written informed 
consent from the participant.  The consenting process will be performed  by a qualified investigator or 
study site designee.  Informed consent w ill be obtained and documented before any study procedures 
are performed.  
The screening activities  may take place over a single  visit or multiple  visits.   
Screening Activities  
• Obtain informed consent  
• Collect baseline data including demographics, medical history, and medication use  
• Obtain blood for hsCRP (local Clinical Center laboratory and central laboratory), and CBC with 
differential (local laboratory).  The hsCRP result from the local laboratory will be used for 
eligibility determination and a batched  measurement made by [CONTACT_93493] a 
stored sample will be used for determining the pre -treatment hsCRP value used in efficacy 
assessments.  The blood obtained  for the central laboratory measurement will be processed, 
aliquoted and stored at - 80 °C for future batched shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  If blood is obtained on a dialysis day, 
blood should be drawn before dialysis.

6.4.6 Management of Active Suicidal Intent  
This trial is not specifically enrolling individuals who are at high risk for suicide. However, it is possible 
that suicidal ideation will be evident from responses to the Beck Depression In ventory -II (BDI- II) which is 
one of several patient reported outcome instruments used in this study. Partic ipants will be considered 
HDNT ACTION Trial   [ADDRESS_103450] active suicidal intent if the answer to Question 9 of the BDI -II is either “I would  like to kill 
myself” or “I would  kill myself if I had the chance”.  
 
The personnel  at the central PRO administration center (CATI Center)  administering the BDI -II will have 
emergency telephone numbers for 3 members of the research team at each Clinical Center. If a 
participant indicates active suicidal intent by [CONTACT_93498] “I would like to kill myself” or “I would kill 
myself if I had the chance” to question [ADDRESS_103451] the research team at the participant’s Clinical Center  to inform 
them of the participant’ s possible suicidal intent .  A designated member of the Clinical Center research 
team will immedia tely contact [CONTACT_93499] , including 
arrangement for emergency care and/or referral to mental health specialists as needed .    
 The CATI team member will also notify  the DCC electronically using the participant’s study ID.  
 
If a participant indicates active suicidal intent requiring follow up by [CONTACT_54775], t he 
administration of the remaining ACTION  questionnaires will be deferred until a later dat e after the  
management of suicid al intent protocol has been completed.   
 
6.[ADDRESS_103452] study design parameters to  ensure 80% power 
to detect pre-specified effect sizes  utilizing intermediate outco mes.  However,  for this early phase pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], the  primary focus is directed at assessing safety and feasibility, with no attempt to create critical 
test result regions for standard hypothesis testing.  
From preliminary studies, we assumed estimated mean CRP at baseline to be 9.5 ± 4 mg/L and log-
transformed mean CRP at bas eline to be 2.14 ± 0.55 log(mg/L)  25.  Assum ing a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_103453] -treat ment CRP in the placebo group , and a 10% dropout  rate of study participants by  [CONTACT_93500], a sample size of 80 (40 patients  for the placebo arm and 40 patients for the ac tive

between treatment arms in the change from baseline to 24-week  endpoint in log -transformed CRP .  
7.2 Randomization and Stratification  
A stratified randomization procedure, blocking on two strata (diabetes or no diabetes)  within Clinical 
Centers will be implemented within a web -based randomization module deployed centrally within the 
DCC.  Within each of these strata, participants will be randomly allocated to anakinra or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_103454] at the relevant 
Clinical Center , until the completion of treatment and data collection on all particip ants.  At the end of a 
treatment, the participant and the treating physician will be asked to guess the assigned treatment 
group, and provide the basis for their judgments for analysis later, to determine whether the blinding 
has been broken.  However, exc ept in the case of emergency unmasking, the treatment codes will not 
be identified until the DSMB has approved unblinding in preparation for the public dissemination of results.  
7.3 Analysis Populations and Missing Data  
The analysis populations are defined as follows:  
• All-randomized  / intention -to-treat (ITT)  population
:  Any participant randomized into the study, 
regardless of whether study drug was received.  
• As-treated population :  The as -treated population is the same as the ITT population (i.e., a ny 
participant randomized into the study regardless of  whether  study drug was  received ).  However 
for the as- treated analysis, patients in the active drug group who did not receive at least one 
dose of study drug will be classified into the placebo arm.  
• All-treated population :  Any participant randomized into the study who  received at least one 
dose of study drug.  
• Per-protocol population :  Any participant who was appropriately randomized, and received the 
protocol -dictated study drug exposure (≥75% of prescrib ed doses) and endpoint assessments 
through 24  ± 2 weeks.    
An intent -to-treat analysis, in which all available data on all randomized participants are included, will be 
used for the primary comparison of treatments.  All attempts will be made to keep missing data to a 
minimum, and participants who withdraw from treatment will be encouraged to continue on study in 
order to provide complete follow -up information.  Thus, irrespective of withdrawal from treatment, all 
participants should continue to be followed  with all scheduled outcome evaluations until the end of the 
study.  However, it is expected that up to 1 0% of the randomized participants may withdraw prior to the 
final assessment of response at 24  weeks .  These participants will be included in the denom inator for 
evaluation of the response rates defined for the primary endpoint.  
The characteristics at the time of randomization for those participants without complete

Version  1.3, May 8, 2018

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  follow -up will be examined; however, there will be limited statistical power to detect any but major 
differences between these participants and those with complete follow -up.  In addition, in order to 
assess the potential biases introduced by [CONTACT_93501], a comparison 
of withdrawal rates and/or time to withdrawal will be included as an ancillary analysis to the primary 
endpoint comparison.  
Secondary analyses will examine the as -treated, per -protocol , and all- treated  populations .  Because 
dose -related efficacy and safety are primary questions of interest in this study, the ITT analysis will be 
supplemented with an analysis of the as -treated population.  Although ITT approaches provide the least -
biased analysis of treatment efficacy and safety, as -treated analyses provide important complementary 
information on  b iological effectiveness of therapy (e.g. theoretical efficacy if drug were tolerated by [CONTACT_93502]) and on the effects of actual doses used that are  not captured by [CONTACT_93503] a randomized therapy that may not have been used by [CONTACT_93504]32.  For 
this reason, as -treated approaches provide important complementary information to ITT analyses and 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_93469]32.   
7.[ADDRESS_103455] descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics and study outcome 
measures at each follow -up visit, both overall, and within each treatment group.  Examination of 
baseline characteristics will include estimates of the distribution of age, race, and other demographic 
characteristics,  lab measures  and study center .  Summary statistics such as means, medians, and 
inter quartile ranges will be produced for all measured variables.  Frequencies and percent ages will be 
computed for all categorical and ordinal variables.  Graphical methods including quantile -quantile plots 
and boxplots will be used to examine distributions, identify potential influential points, and guide in the 
choice of transformations, if warranted.  The balance of baseline measures across the three treatment 
groups will be compared using appropriate 2 -sample tests, including Mann -Whitney tests and Fisher’s 
exact tests.  
For the analyses of the primary efficacy outcome, m ean (± standard devi ation) or median (interquartile 
ranges) of baseline and each of subsequent measurements in the primary endpoin t, log -transformed  
CRP, will be presented.  Change in log -transformed CRP at 24 weeks will be assessed and reported 
quantitatively, and descriptiv e statistics for absolute and % change will be provided. Linear mixed effects 
regression models with adjustment for  stratification factors and baseline covariates will be used for 
assessment of treatment effects  on repeated measurements of CRP .  Model assu mptions regarding 
HDNT ACTION Trial   [ADDRESS_103456] techniques.  With repeated 
measurements of CRP, the area under the time- log-transformed CRP curve33 can be estimated from the 
linear mixed effects models and used to compare an aggregate efficacy between treatment and placebo 
arms  over the 24 -week period of the study.  
For the safety endpoint s, tables with percent incidence and incidence rate (for both adverse events and 
infections which can occur more than once throughout the course of study) will be prepared.  
Differences in incidence and incidence rate  between arms  will be assessed using generalized linear 
mixed effects models (logistic and/or Poisson regression) adjusting for stratification factors and baseline 
covariates.  
The primary analysis will examine the intention to treat population.  All analyses will be repeated in the 
as-treated, all- treated an d per -protocol popu lations (see Section 7. 3).  Secondary endpoint analyses will 
be presented using analogous techniques.  P<0.05 will be considered significant in all analyses.  
7.4.2 Secondary Analyses  
A number of secondary analyses will be conducted to evaluate  the secondary efficacy outcomes.  
Secondary efficacy outcomes  include  change in markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (including 
pro- and anti -inflammatory cytokine, serum albumin, F2 -isoprostane/isofuran  levels , etc.), in circulating 
markers of cardiac disease risk, in nutritional and metabolic markers, and in patient reported outcomes (including indicators of fatigue, depression, symptoms, muscle strength, and quality of life) between 
baseline and 24 weeks .  For markers measured repeatedly, (gener alized) linear mixed effects models will 
be used to assess the effect of treatment.  Analy tical approaches  for these secondary outcomes will be 
similar to that used for the primary outcome.  Distribution of the secondary outcome parameters will be 
examined  and appropriate transformation will be applied .  For this early phase study, analyses of the 
secondary efficacy outcomes will be viewed as exploratory, and correction for multiple comparisons will 
not be performed.

8.1 Definitions  
Definitio ns are per the January 2007 Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems 
Involving Risks to Participants  or Others and Adverse Events, Office on Human Research Protection 
(OHRP) Guidance. http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html  
8.1.1 Adver se Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study participant, 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam ination  or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with t he participant’s involvement in the research, whether 
or not considered related to the participant ’s participation in the research.  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse  event  (SAE ) is any AE that is:  
• fatal or results in death  
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• an important medical event*  
*Important medical events  are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are c learly of 
major clinical significance.  
8.1.3 Unanticipated Problem  Involving Risk to Participants  or Others  
An Unanticipated Problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following 
criteria:  
• it is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures that 
are described in the IRB- approved research protocol and informed consent document  and the 
characteristics of the participant  population being studied;  
• it is related or possibly related to participa tion in the research; possibl y related means that there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459] , and  
• it suggests that the research places participants  or others at  a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

reports.  Adverse event reports, DSMB reports and reports for statis tical analysis will be developed and 
produced on an appropriate schedule.  
9.2 Data  Security  
The DMS will be designed to prevent unauthorized access to study  data and to prevent data loss due to 
equipment failure or catastrophic events. The procedures to do so  encompass user account 
management, user privilege assignment, data loss prevention (database backup), and DMS change 
management.  User access will be controlled by [CONTACT_93511].  
Study data collected at the Clinical Ce nters will be entered into Oracle Clinical.  This DMS  uses a secure 
connection between the client browser at the Clinical Center and the web server at the DCC.  Data 
transmitted over this connection is authenticated by [CONTACT_93512].  
Where applicable , electronic files containing data from hand held devices  and central laboratories  will 
be transferred to the DCC using secure File Transfer Protocol ( FTP) technology.  The DCC team will 
maintain a secure FTP server.  The files transmitted using this method will be encrypted during the 
exchange.

in coordination with NIDDK ([CONTACT_93540], as point of contact). Whenever possible, [CONTACT_93541] ert Star, 
Director of the Division of Kidney, Urology and Hematology of NIDDK will also attend meetings.   
BOARD PROCESS  
 
The DSMB will meet a minimum of once a year at the call of the Chair, with advance approval of the 
NIDDK Program Director.  An NIDDK representative will be present at every meeting.  
 
Meetings shall be closed to the public because discussions may address confidential patient data. Meetings are attended, when appropriate, by [CONTACT_458] (s) of the DCC  and members of 
his/her  staff, and by [CONTACT_93523], as needed .  Meetings may be convened as conference 
calls/webinars as well as in person. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_93524]. The DSMB 
Chairperson should contact [CONTACT_93525].  
 
MEETING FORMAT  
 An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of open, closed and executive sessions. This format may be modi fied as needed. A brief closed and/or an executive session will usually be held before the 
open session.  
 
Open Session: 
 The members of the DSMB, the NIDDK staff, the steering committee, including the study biostatistician 
will attend the open session.  Issues discussed will include the conduct and progress of the study, 
including patient recruitment, data quality, general adherence and toxicity issues, compliance with 
protocol, and any other logistical matters that may affect either the conduct or outcom e of the study.  
Protocol amendments may also be presented in this session.  
 
Closed Session:  
 The closed session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], representatives from the NIDDK, or its appointees, and the study biostatistician. The discussion at the closed session is completely 
confidential.  
 
Analyses of blinded
 outcome data are reviewed by [CONTACT_93527], including baseline 
characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes, adverse events, adherence and dropouts, and examination of any relevant subgroups. However, the DSMB may request unmasking of the data for either safety or efficacy concerns.   
 
Executive Session:  
 The executive session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], and the NIDDK Staff, or its appointees.  
 
The DSMB will discuss information presented to it during the closed and open session s and decide 
whether to recommend continuation or termination, protocol modification or other changes to the 
HDNT ACTION Trial   [ADDRESS_103485] of the study in the Executive Session.  The DSMB can become unblinded if trends develop either 
for benefit or harm to the participants.  
 Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, a full vote of the DSMB will be 
required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote will rule and a minority report should be appended.  
Reasons for early termination may include:  
• Serious adverse effects in the entire intervention group or in a dominating subgroup;  
• Greater than expected beneficial effects;  
• A statistically significant difference by [CONTACT_93528];  
• Logistical or data quality problems so severe that correction is not feasible.  
 
Final Open Session (optional): 
 
The final session may be attended by [CONTACT_93526], steering committee members, the study biostatistician or other study members, and the NIDDK staff.  
 The Chairperson of the DSMB or the NIDDK Staff shall report on the recommendations of the DSMB regarding study continuation and concerns regarding the conduct of the study.  Requests regarding data presentation for subsequent meetings will be made.  Scheduling of the next DSMB meeting may be 
discussed.  
 
REPORTS  
 Interim Reports : Interim reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_36909], located at the 
University of Pennsylvania.  The reports will be distributed to the DSMB and the NIDDK Program Director at least [ADDRESS_103486] of two 
parts:  
 Part 1 ( Open Session Report ) provides information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status.  This report is generally shared with all 
investigators involved with the clinical trial.  The reports contained in this section may include:  
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_43380]  
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Act ual Enrollment by [CONTACT_93529]  
o Overall Subject Status by [CONTACT_93529], including: Subjects Screened, Enrolled, Active, Completed 
and Terminated  
o Demographic and Key Baseline Characteristics by [CONTACT_26374]  
o Treatment Duration for Subjects who Discontinue Therapy  
o Adverse Events/Ser ious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_93530] 2 ( Closed Session Report ) may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, including 
serious adverse events or termination.  Data will be presented by [CONTACT_93531]; however, 
the DSMB may re quest that the treatment groups be unmasked  to ensure that there are no untoward 
treatment effects. This report should not be viewed by [CONTACT_93532].

Version  1.3, May 8, 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  Reports from the DSMB:  A formal report cont aining the recommendations for continuation or 
modifications of the study, prepared by [CONTACT_93533], will be 
sent to the Chair of the Steering Committee and the DCC PI. This report will also contain any recommendatio ns of the NIDDK in reference to the DSMB recommendations.  It is the responsibility of 
the DCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_93484].  
 
Each report should include  a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This 
recommendation should be made by [CONTACT_7558]. A termination recommendation may be made 
by [CONTACT_93534]. The NIDDK is responsible for notifying the Chair of the Steer ing Committee of a decision to terminate the study. In the event of a split vote in favor of 
continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report should not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data,  or any other confidential data.  
 Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis, (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety data should 
be communicated to all DSMB members and the NIDDK Program Director. Any concerns noted by [CONTACT_93535] t he attention of the NIDDK Program Director.  
 Access to Interim Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as small a group 
as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to randomize patients  and helps protect the study 
from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and other 
participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality .

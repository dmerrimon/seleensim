 Section 8.1.3 Precautions an d Risks with Eribulin 
For a complete discussion of risk information including precautions and 
adverse reactions for Eribulin, pleas e refer to the current Eribulin 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥25%) reported in patients 
receiving eribulin were neutropenia,  anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, 
peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation.  The most common 
serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving eribulin were 
febrile neutropenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%).  The most common 
adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of eribulin was peripheral 
neuropathy (5%). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
If patients develop severe neutropenia lasting longer than five days or 
neutropenia with a fever, their next dose of erlibulin should be delayed 
and reduced.  Severe neutropenia (ANC <500/mm3) lasting more than 
one week occurred in 12% (62/503) of patients in the recently completed 
Phase 3 trial, leading to discontinuation in <1% of patients.  Patients 
with ALT or AST >3 × ULN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia than patients with normal 
aminotransferase levels.  Patients with bilirubin >1.5 × ULN also had a 
higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.  
Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose; increase the 
frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 
cytopenias.  Delay administration of eribulin and reduce subsequent 
doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting longer than five days. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy 
In the Phase 3 trial with eribulin , Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy 
occurred in 8% (40/503) of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% (2/503) of 
patients.  Peripheral neuropathy was the most common toxicity leading 
to discontinuation of erlibulin (5% of patients; 24/503).  Neuropathy 
lasting more than one year occurred in 5% (26/503) of patients.  Twenty-
two percent (109/503) of patients developed a new or worsening 
neuropathy that had not recovered within a median follow-up duration of 
269 days (range 25 to 662 days).  Monitor patients closely for signs of 
peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy.  Withhold erlibulin in patients 
who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to 
Grade 2 or less.

 [IP_ADDRESS] QTc Interval Prolongation 
In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT 
prolongation was observed on Day 8, independent of eribulin 
concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1.  
Electrocardiogram monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in 
patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to 
prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, 
(Appendix E) and electrolyte abnormalities.  Correct hypokalemia or 
hypomagnesemia prior to initiating eribulin and monitor these 
electrolytes periodically during therapy.  Avoid eribulin in patients with 
congenital long QT syndrome. 
Appendix C Schedule of Assessments 
Footnote g: 
Complete staging work-up to confirm localized disease should include 
computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen/pelvis (abdomen/pelvis preferred; abdomen accepted), a CT scan of the head or 
MRI of the brain (if symptomatic), and either a positron emission 
tomography (PET) scan or a bone scan.  (Note:  a PET/CT is acceptable 
for baseline imaging in lieu of CT examinations or bone scan) .
  Negative 
scans performed prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy, or at any 
subsequent time, are acceptable and do not need to be repeated. 
Footnote l: After completion of eribulin treatment, patients will be followed every 3 
months during years 1 and 2, every 6 months during years 3-5, and annually 
thereafter for toxicity and disease progresson  survival. 
Footnote m: 
CBC, including 3 part differential and platelets and CMP plus magnesium 
may be done up to 72 hours prior to treatment.  After disease progression is 
documented, patients will be followed every 3 months until they initiate new 
treatment.

 Assess the toxicity of eribulin in this patient population. 
Trial Design: This is a nonrandomized, open-label trial that w ill evaluate [ADDRESS_293293] neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen.  There will be three cohorts of patients based on tumor type: triple-
negative (A), hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative (B), and HER2-positive (C).  
Patients who are HER2-positive will receive tras tuzumab as part of neoadjuvant treatment 
and concurrently with postoperative eribulin treatment. 
Trial Population: The trial population will consist of consenting female patients who do not achieve pCR (i.e., 
have residual invasive disease in breast or lymph node tissue) after treatment with a standard 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen and surgery. 
Number of 
Patients: One-hundred forty-eight patients will be enrolled in this trial (54 in Cohort A, 42 in Cohort B, 
and 52 in Cohort C). 
Drug Supply The pharmaceutical company, Ei sai, will provide er ibulin (HALAVEN™) for this trial.

positive, 60%.  Treatment capable of providing relative improvement in these results by 40% in 
the triple-negative cohort, 15% in the horm one-receptor-positive/HER2-negative cohort, or 
25% in the HER2-positive cohort would be worthy of further development.  For a one-sided test 
of hypothesis at alpha = 0.10 and power = 0.80, the required sample sizes are 49, [ADDRESS_293298] for potential non-evaluable patients, this preliminary study will 
treat 54, 42, and 52 patients, respectively, in th e three cohorts.  This will allow determination of 
a 2-year DFS within  95% confidence intervals fo r each subgroup, as follows: 
Cohort A  Triple-negative:  42.0% - 67.9% 
Cohort B  Hormone-receptor-po sitive (and HER2-negative)  cohort: 78.7% - 96.9%  
Cohort C  HER2-positive cohort: 61.0% - 84.5% 
Evaluation of safety among patients in each cohor t will also provide sufficient experience to 
determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regi men.  Safety data will be tabulated for patients 
who receive any amount of trial medication.  A dverse events (AEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_110377], preferred term, severity, and relation to treatment.  Worst toxicity grades per patient 
will be tabulated for selected AE and laborato ry measurements by [CONTACT_241561]

therapy have experienced better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).  
Unfortunately, the approximately 20% to 25% ra te of pathologic complete response reported 
with standard non trastuzumab containing regimens leaves the majority of  patients at increased 
risk of recurrence with inferior DFS and OS. 
In a review of neoadjuvant pa tients treated at MD Anderson, recurrence and death rates were 
higher in the first [ADDRESS_293314] cancer (TNBC) compared with non-TNBC 
(1).  In another study examining breast can cer subtypes and outcome to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, patients with basal-like and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2)-
positive /estrogen-receptor-(ER)-negative subtypes  with residual disease experienced more 
frequent early relapses and death.  While it was ea sier to achieve a pathologic complete response 
in patients with basal-like or HER2-positive /ER-negative subtypes, the patients who did not achieve a pCR had a relatively poor prognosis, with  most relapses occurring during the first 2 
years following surgery (2). 
Currently, there is little evidence to support the use of further ad juvant chemotherapy for patients 
who do not achieve pCR after treatment with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen.  Since 
residual disease reflects resistan ce to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pi[INVESTIGATOR_241540]-cross-resistant chemotherapy.  In a trial from MD Anderson, 110 patients who 
had received neoadjuvant VACP (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) and had residual disease were randomized to rece ive further treatment with VACP or vinblastine, 
methotrexate, and prednisone (VbMP) (3).  Resu lts demonstrated that adjuvant treatment was 
tolerable, with a suggestion of improved outco mes with VbMP (OS 65% versus 47%, p=0.06).  
Additional data from small pi[INVESTIGATOR_241541], as have pi[INVESTIGATOR_241542].  Treatments were generally well tolera ted and extended follow-up continues. 
1.2. Eribulin 
Eribulin mesylate (Halaven™) is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B (HalB), a natural product isolated from the marine sponge, Halichondria okadai  (4).  HalB is a large polyether macrolide 
that exerts potent anticancer effects in cell-ba sed and animal models of cancer (4, 5, 6).  The 
structurally simplified synthetic analog, eri bulin, encompasses the biologically active 
macrocyclic portion of HalB, and shows similar or  identical anticancer pr operties in preclinical 
models (7). 
Following discovery of the potent anticancer activity  of HalB in 1986 (4) it was tested in the US 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60-cell line scre en using known antimitotic agents and other 
anticancer drugs as comparators (5).  While antipr oliferative patterns of HalB in the NCI cell line 
screen were similar to those of  other antitubulin drugs, the biochemical mechanism of HalB's 
interaction with tubulin was di stinct (5, 8, 9).  HalB noncom petitively inhibited vinblastine 
binding to tubulin, enhanced bis-5,5'-[8-(N-phe nyl)-amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid] binding

Date of this Version:  20MAR2013, Amendment [ADDRESS_293315] on iodoacetamide alkylation of tubulin sulfhydryl groups; yet HalB 
did not stabilize or inhibit colchi cine binding to tubulin.  Therefor e, it was concluded that HalB’s 
tubulin-based mechanism is distin ct from all other known classes of  antitubulin agents (5, 8, 9). 
 Eribulin exerts its antiproliferative effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism.  Currently-
available data indicate that its mechanism of action is similar or identical to that of HalB (7, 8).  
Like HalB, eribulin was shown to be a poten t inhibitor of tubulin polymerization into 
microtubules as well as microtubule dynamics in v itro and in whole cells (7, 10).  Nonclinical 
data show that sub- to low-nmol/L levels of eribulin inhibit ca ncer cell proliferation via induction 
of irreversible cell cycle blocks at G2/M, disruption of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], and initiation of 
apoptosis (7, 11).  Human tumor xenograft studies in  mice (ovary, lung, breast, col on, melanoma, pancreatic, and 
fibrosarcoma) demonstrate tumor regressions, remissions, and an increased lifespan at dose 
levels below the maximum tolerated dose (7, 12).  In  vivo animal model data predict that eribulin 
will have greater efficacy than the taxanes and th at increased antitumor activity can be achieved 
with fewer adverse effects. In addition, the potential for common side effects and drug-drug 
interactions with eribulin are less than or equal to existing th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Currently, there is no 
evidence for taxol-like hypersensitivity with er ibulin.  Although eribu lin is a PgP drug efflux 
pump substrate (13), it retains full in vitro activ ity against cancer cells that are taxane-resistant 
due to β -tubulin mutations (14), suggesting that eribulin may show clinical effectiveness in 
subjects with refractory tumors th at are taxane re sistant based on β-tubulin mutations. 
 In summary, eribulin kills cancer cells via apoptosis secondary to inhibition of cellular 
microtubule dynamics, disruption of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_86854] e formation and induction of irreversible cell 
cycle arrest at G2/M. When tested in a vari ety of animal models of human cancer, these 
molecular- and cell-based anticancer  activities of eribulin result in significant antitumor effects 
including tumor growth inhibi tion, regressions, remissions and increased life span. Current 
nonclinical data predict anticancer efficacy greater than the taxanes, achieved with fewer adverse 
effects.  Eribulin was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food a nd Drug Administration (F DA) on [ADDRESS_293316] been conducted worldwide ([LOCATION_003], Europe, 
and Japan).  In addition, one Ph ase [ADDRESS_293317] cancer has been 
completed.  The pharmacokinetic profile of eribulin was estab lished in the early phase studies.  In general, 
the pharmakokinetics of eribulin are characteri zed by a rapid distributi on phase, with a prolonged 
elimination phase after intravenous infusion.  Th e disposition of E7389 fo llows linear kinetics

Eribulin’s safety and effectiveness were esta blished in the single Phase [ADDRESS_293318] two prior chemotherapy regimens for 
late-stage disease (15, 16).  Patients were ra ndomly assigned to receive treatment with either 
eribulin or a different single -agent therapy chosen by [CONTACT_85338] r oncologist in a 2:[ADDRESS_293319] common side effects reported by [CONTACT_241563]/

1.3. Rationale for the Trial 
Eribulin, a novel chemotherapeutic agent with efficacy in patients with refractory metastatic 
breast cancer, may be effective in the treatment of patients with locally advanced breast cancer 
who do not achieve pCR following neoadjuvant ther apy.  We propose to evaluate eribulin as 
adjuvant therapy in patients who do not ach ieve pCR following st andard neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.  Three cohorts of patients will be evaluated separately: tr iple-negative, hormone-
receptor-positive/HER2-negative, and HER2-positive.  Hormone-receptor-positive patients may 
be ER and /or PR positive. 
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
2.1. Primary objective 
The primary objective of this trial is to: 
 Assess the efficacy of eribulin when admini stered to patients who do not achieve pCR 
following standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (+/-trastuzumab).  The primary endpoint 
will be 2-year DFS rate. 
2.2. Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives of the trial are to: 
 Assess the feasibility of administering [ADDRESS_293320] 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary surgical therapy. 
 Assess the toxicity of  eribulin in this patient population. 
3. TRIAL POPULATION 
Patients must have baseline evaluations performe d prior to the first dose of trial drug and must 
meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241543]/her designee must 
review the results of all baseline  evaluations that assure that a ll inclusion and exclusion criteria 
have been satisfied prior to enrollment of that patient.

During the course of the trial, all female patients of childbearing potential  (the definitions of 
“women of childbearing potenti al” are listed in Appendix D)  must contact [CONTACT_241564] (a missed or late menstrual 
period should be reported to the treating I nvestigator). 
If an Investigator suspects that a patient may be  pregnant prior to administration of trial drugs, 
the trial drugs must be withheld until the resu lt of the pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a 
pregnancy is confirmed, the pati ent must not receive any trial drugs, and must be discontinued 
from the trial. 
If an Investigator suspects that a patient may be  pregnant after the patien t has been receiving trial 
drugs, the trial drugs must immediately be wit hheld until the result of the pregnancy test is 
confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the tria l drugs must be permanently stopped, the patient 
must be discontinued from the trial, and the I nvestigator must notify the SCRI Study Chair as 
soon as possible.  If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form 
should be completed and faxed to the SCRI Safe ty Department.  For more details regarding 
handling and reporting of pregnancies that occur during treatment, see Section 10.5.1.

All patients will receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days for 6 cycles via the 
intravenous (IV) route.  Patients with HER2- positive tumors will also receive trastuzumab 
6 mg/kg IV Day 1 every 21 days to complete a tota l of 1 year (52 weeks) of treatment from the 
start of neoadjuvant administrati on.  If the last dose of trastu zumab was given >28 days from 
trial treatment start, the lo ading dose should be 8 mg/kg. 
Patients will receive either eribul in alone (Cohorts A & B) or er ibulin + trastuzumab (Cohort C) 
based on their HER2 status and/or hormone-receptor status (Table 1).

5.2. Method of Treatment Assi gnment and Blinding 
This is a non-randomized trial in which patients  will be assigned to treatment based on their 
tumor type. 
 
This is an open-label trial a nd so blinding is not necessary. 
5.3. Concomitant Medications 
Patients will be instructed not to take any a dditional medications (i ncluding over-the-counter 
products) during the course of the trial without prior consultati on with the Investigator.  At each 
visit, the Investigator will as k the patient about any new medica tions he/she has taken after the 
start of the trial drug. 
Growth factor support:  Routine prophylactic use of colony- stimulating factor (CSF) is not 
recommended during this study.  Myeloid or granulocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF) may be used, according to standard guidelines (e.g., American Society of Clinical 
Oncology [ASCO] guidelines) or at  the discretion of the treating investigator, after discussion 
with the Study Chair.  Colony-stimulating agen ts must be held at least the day before 
chemotherapy, and initiated at least 1 day after chemotherapy is administered.  Use of colony-
stimulating agents should not substitute for protocol-mandated dose reductions due to neutropenia and/or neut ropenic fever (Section Error! Reference source not found. ).  Use of 
erythropoietin is allowed.  Use of stim ulators of thrombopoiesis is not allowed. 
Anti-emetics:  Prophylactic anti-emetic therapy s hould follow standard guidelines for 
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. 
Drugs that cause QTc prolongation:  Drugs that cause QTc prolongation are prohibited.  
Please see Appendix E for a list of prohibited drugs. 
The use of any herbal/natural products or other "folk remedies" should be discouraged, but use of 
those products, as well as the use of vitamins, nutritional supplements, and all other concomitant 
medications, is not cause for discontinua tion but must be r ecorded in the CRF. 
All medications (prescriptions or over-the-counter medications) continued at the start of the trial 
or started during the trial or up to [ADDRESS_293331] be 
documented. 
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
Treatment-related toxicities will be evaluated utilizing the NCI CTCAE v4.0 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov /ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE ).   If toxicity occurs, th e toxicity will be graded, and 
appropriate supportive care treatment will be admi nistered to decrease the signs and symptoms 
thereof.  Dose adjustments will be based on the organ system exhibiting the greatest degree of 
 
Trial Drug:  Eribulin, SCRI (Sponsor) C linical Trial Protocol Number: BRE 186 
Date of Original Protocol:  26MAY2011 
Date of this Version:  20MAR2013, Amendment [ADDRESS_293332] their dose(s) reduced. 
All dose reductions will be made from the planned dosages.  Patients who require dose 
reductions must be evaluated at least weekly unt il the toxicity stabiliz es or improves.  Once 
stable, patients can resume evaluations according to the protocol-specified visit schedule.  If 
toxicity remains unresolved for 3 weeks, the pati ent will discontinue treatment with that drug.  
Patients in Cohort C who discontinue chemothera py prior to completing 6 cycles can remain on 
study and continue to receive tr astuzumab.  Patients should be ev aluated weekly (at a minimum), 
if therapy is on hold. 
There is clinical evidence of  QTc prolongation with both eribu lin and trastuzumab.  During the 
treatment period, if an ECG indicates a QTc interval 500 msec, then two additional ECGs 
should be obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality.  The average QTc will be 
determined from the three ECG tracings by [CONTACT_241567], and will be used to determine continued eligibility.  If the av erage QTc is <500 msec, the patient  may continue therapy.  If the 
average QTc is ≥500 msec, the study treatment should be discontinued immediately.  The patient 
should be treated appropriately for QTc interv al prolongation, and monito red until resolution is 
documented by a repeat ECG, with QT c intervals returning to <[ADDRESS_293333] trastu zumab delayed or continue to 
receive trastuzumab on an every-3-week schedule ev en if administration of eribulin is delayed or 
withheld on Day 1 per the trea ting physician’s discretion. 
6.2.1. Recommended Dose Delays of Eribulin 
Assess for peripheral neuropathy and obtain comp lete blood cell counts prior to each dose. 
 Do not administer eribulin on Day 1 or Day 8 if any of the following are present: 
 ANC < 1,000/mm
3 
 Platelets < 75,000/mm3 
 Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities 
The Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 week. 
 If toxicities do not re solve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, omit the dose. 
 If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, administer eribulin at a 
reduced dose and initiate the next cycle no sooner than 2 weeks later. 
For ANC <1500/µL on Day 1, delay dose of Eribulin until ANC >1500/µL, then: 
 Initiate treatment with prophylactic gra nulocyte-CSFs, with no dose reductions.  
 If patient is already receivi ng granulocyte-CSF treatment, re duce dose by 1 dose level.

6.2.3. Interruption of Eribulin Infusion 
Clinical experience to date does not indicate adverse react ions to infusion with eribulin.  Patients 
who experience any serious infusion reaction during eribulin administration will have the 
infusion stopped.  Continuation of dosing will be  based on the severity and resolution of the 
event and will be at the discretion of the Invest igator.  Suspected infusion reactions should be 
reported as an adverse event.  All patients w ho experience such an event will be followed for 
safety.

Date of Original Protocol:  26MAY2011 
Date of this Version:  20MAR2013, Amendment [ADDRESS_293335] be made before enrolling 
patients with chronic lung disease into this clin ical trial.  Patients who experience a life-
threatening infusion reaction (eg, tachypnea, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypoxia) should be 
withdrawn from trastuzumab. 
Patients who experience severe or modera te infusion symptoms may be managed by: 
 Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241545] 
 Supportive care may include suppl emental oxygen, beta agonists, 
antihistamines, or corticosteroids.   Patients who experience mild or 
moderate infusion symptoms may be  treated with antipyretics and 
antihistamines. 
Patients who experience mild, moderate, or seve re infusion reactions on the first dose may be 
retreated with trastuzumab.  Premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics 
may be used before subse quent trastuzumab infusions. 
6.3.2. Trastuzumab Dosage Adjustments 
The dose of trastuzumab is 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks.   If the dosing of trastuzumab is interrupted 
for >28 days, however, the loading dose upon resumption should be 8 mg/kg.  There is no 
planned dose modification schedule for trastuzumab.  In case of any need of dose or schedule modification this should be discussed with the Sponsor. 
6.3.3. Criteria for Withholding a Dose of Trastuzumab 
Cardiac toxicities: 
Use of trastuzumab is contraindi cated in patients with a LVEF of less than 45% and those with 
symptomatic heart failure.  In an asymptomatic patient, if LVEF drops 10 percentage points from 
baseline (and to below 50% in patients with a normal baseline measurement) trastuzumab should 
be withheld and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within appr oximately 3 weeks.  If LVEF 
has not improved, or declined further, discont inuation of trastuzumab should be strongly 
considered, unless the benefits for the individual patient are d eemed to outweigh the risks. 
Non-Cardiac related toxicities: In any trastuzumab-related case of Grade 3/[ADDRESS_293336] ug should be withheld 
until resolution to Grade 1 toxicity. 
6.3.4. Trastuzumab Delayed- or Missed-Doses 
Trastuzumab should be given on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle.  Missed trastuzumab doses will not 
be made up.  Patients who miss more than 4 cons ecutive weeks of trastuzumab due to toxicity 
will be considered unable to tolerate trastuzu mab and will not be retreated with trastuzumab.

Page 35 of 68  If trastuzumab treatment cannot be continued du e to unresolved trastuzu mab-related toxicities, 
eribulin can be continued at the Investigator’s discretion. 
6.3.5. Criteria for Re-treatment with Trastuzumab 
Patients should be assessed for toxicity before each dose. 
Patients who develop a toxicity  that does not meet the crit eria for withholding a dose of 
trastuzumab should continue to receive trastuzumab and their symptoms should be treated.  
Trastuzumab-related toxicity will be considered resolved if it improves to a degree that allows 
for re-treatment with trastuzumab.

8.2. Trastuzumab 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a r ecombinant humanized IgG1 monoc lonal antibody that binds to 
domain four of the extracellula r segment of the HER2 receptor.  Cells treated with trastuzumab 
undergo arrest during the G1 phase of  the cell cycle so there is redu ced proliferation.  It has been 
suggested that trastuzumab indu ces some of its effect by [CONTACT_241569]2 leading to 
disruption of receptor dimerization and signa ling through the downstream PI3K cascade.  
P27Kip1 is then not phosphorylated and is able to enter the nucleus a nd inhibit cdk2 activity, 
causing cell cycle arrest.  Als o, trastuzumab suppresses angiog enesis by [CONTACT_241570]-angiogenic factors.  It is thought that a contribution 
to the unregulated growth observed in cancer coul d be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2 that 
results in the release of the extracellular domain.  Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2 
ectodomain cleavage in breast cance r cells.  In addition, trastuzu mab is a potent mediator of 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been 
shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2- overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer 
cells that do not over express HER2 (15). 
Trastuzumab will be administered IV at 6 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

Labeling 
Herceptin® is the brand name [CONTACT_241589]. 
Packaging and Formulation 
Trastuzumab is a sterile, white to pale yello w, preservative free lyophilized powder for IV 
administration.  Each vial of trastuzumab contai ns 400 mg of trastuzuma b, 9.9 mg of L histidine 
HCl, 6.4 mg of L histadine, 400 mg of α,α trehalose dihydrate, and 1.8 mg of polysorbate 20, 
USP.  Reconstitution with 20 mL of the supplied Bacteriostat ic Water for Injection USP, 
containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preser vative, yields 21 mL of a multidose solution 
containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at a pH of ~6. 
Supply 
Trastuzumab will be obtained from commercial sources. 
Storage 
From a microbiological point of view, the tr astuzumab infusion solution should be used 
immediately.  If diluted aseptically, it may be st ored for 24 hours when refrigerated at 2 to 8°C. 
8.2.2. Preparation and Administration 
Trastuzumab will be administered as an IV infusion in accordance with the Herceptin package 
insert. 
8.2.3. Precautions and Risks Associated with Trastuzumab 
For a complete discussion of risk informati on including precautions a nd adverse reactions for 
trastuzumab, please refer to th e Herceptin package insert a nd the Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cardiac Dysfunction 
Trastuzumab can cause left ventricular card iac dysfunction, arrhythm ias, cardiac failure, 
hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. 
Signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction were  observed in a number of women who received 
trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, most often anthracycline-based 
treatment.  Cardiac dysfunction was observed most frequently among patients who received 
trastuzumab plus anthracycline (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy (28%), 
compared with those who received anthracycline alone (7%), trastuzumab pl us paclitaxel (11%), 
paclitaxel alone (1%), or trastuzumab alone (7%) .  Severe disability or fatal outcome due to 
cardiac dysfunction was observed in ~1% of all patients. 
The nature of the observed cardiac dysfunction wa s similar to the syndrome of anthracycline-
induced cardiomyopathy.  The signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunctio n usually responded to 
treatment.  Complete and partial responses were observe d among patients with cardiac 
dysfunction.  The risk appears to be independent of tumor response to therapy.  Analysis of the 
clinical database for predictors  of cardiac dysfunction revealed  only advanced age and exposure

observed incidence of serious cardiac dysfunction was 3% (N=95) ( 18).  Since the occurrence of 
cardiac dysfunction in th e trastuzumab plus chemotherapy tr ial was an unexpected observation, 
no information is available regarding the mo st appropriate method for monitoring cardiac 
function in patients receiving trastuzumab.  Si gnificant advances in the understanding and 
treatment of congestive h eart failure have been made in the past several years, with many of the 
new drugs demonstrating the ability to nor malize cardiac function.  Patients who develop 
symptoms of congestive heart failure while on trastuzumab should be treated according to 
standard guidelines.  
Management of Cardiac Safety 
All patients must have an ECHO or MUGA s can at baseline, and on a regular schedule 
throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are strongly ur ged to schedule MUGA scans or 
ECHOs at the same radiology facility where the patient’s baseline was done, whenever possible.  
MUGA scans or ECHO are required at protocol-specified time poi nts and after any patient has 
any develops symptoms of congestive heart failure or discontinues protocol treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion Associated Symptoms 
During the first infusion with trastuzumab, a symp tom complex consisting of chills and/or fever 
is observed in approximately 40% of patients.  Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, 
vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, cough, dizziness , rash, and asthenia.  These symptoms are 
usually mild to moderate in severity, and occur infrequently with subsequent trastuzumab infusions.  These symptoms can be treated with an  analgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine or 
paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Infusion Associated Events 
Serious adverse reactions to trastuzumab in fusion including dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen satu ration and respi[INVESTIGATOR_241547].  In rare cas es (4 per 10,000), these events we re associated with a clinical 
course culminating in a fatal outcome.  Serious  reactions have been treated with supportive 
therapy such as oxygen, beta-agoni sts, corticosteroids and withdrawal of trastuzumab as 
indicated. [IP_ADDRESS]. Hematologic Toxicity and Neutropenic Infections 
In the clinical trials, an increased incidence of anemia was observed in patients receiving 
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone.  The 
majority of these anemia events were mild or moderate in intensity and reversible; none resulted in discontinuation of trastuzumab therapy. 
In the clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of moderate to severe neutropenia and of febrile 
neutropenia were higher in patients receiving tr astuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive

Date of Original Protocol:  26MAY2011 
Date of this Version:  20MAR2013, Amendment [ADDRESS_293348] been reported in patients 
receiving trastuzumab and myelosuppressive chem otherapy, although in contro lled clinical trials 
(pre- and post-marketing), the inci dence of septic deaths was not  significantly increased.  The 
pathophysiologic basis for exacerbat ion of neutropenia has not been  determined; the effect of 
trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of chemotherape utic agents has not be en fully evaluated.  
Secondary acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrom e has been reported in [ADDRESS_293349] cancer.  Theref ore, the contribution of trastu zumab to the etiology of acute 
leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in these cases is unclear. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pulmonary Toxicity 
Trastuzumab can cause fatal pulmonary toxici ty which includes dyspnea, interstitial 
pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, 
pulmonary insufficiency, and hypoxia, acute re spi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], and pulmonary 
fibrosis.  Events like these may result from infusion reactions. 8.3. Accountability of Investigational Products 
The Principal Investigator (or designee) is res ponsible for accountability of all used and unused 
trial drug supplies at the site.  The sites should destroy any unused  product at the end of the study 
(or expi[INVESTIGATOR_241548], if any, during the study), per the site's SOPs fo r doing so.  A certificate of 
destruction that includes a desc ription of the supplies, quanti ty destroyed, and method of 
destruction should be re turned to the Sponsor. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1. Trial Population 
The efficacy and safety analysis populations will c onsist of all patients who received at least one 
dose of protocol treatment. 9.2. Planned Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planned. 9.3. Final Analysis Plan 
Three cohorts of patients with residual diseas e following neoadjuvant th erapy (triple-negative 
[A], hormone-receptor-positive (ER and/or PR+) /HER2negative [B], and HER2-positive [C]) 
will be evaluated separately to obtain preliminary efficacy information.  With standard 
neoadjuvant therapy, the approxi mate 2-year DFS of patients who do not achieve pCR are as 
follows:  triple-negative, 40%; hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative, 80%; and HER2-positive, 60%.  Treatment capable of providing relative improvement in these results by 40% in

in the HER2-positive cohort would be worthy of fu rther development.  For a one-sided test of 
hypothesis at alpha = 0.10 a nd power = 0.80, the required sample sizes are 49, 38, and 47, 
respectively.  In order to adju st for potential non-evaluable pa tients, this preliminary study will 
treat 54, 42, and 52 patients, respectively, in the thr ee cohorts.  This will allow determination of a 
2-year DFS within 95% confidence inte rvals for each subgroup, as follows:  
Cohort A  Triple-negative:  42.0% - 67.9% 
Cohort B  Hormone-receptor-positive (a nd HER2-negative) cohort: 78.7% - 96.9% 
Cohort C  HER2-positive cohort: 61.0% - 84.5% Evaluation of safety among patients in each c ohort will also provide sufficient experience to 
determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regi men.  Safety data will be tabulated for patients 
who receive any amount of trial medication.  Ad verse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6764], 
preferred term, severity, and relation to treatment . Worst toxicity grades  per patient will be 
tabulated for selected adverse event and labor atory measurements by [CONTACT_241561]

10. SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSES 
10.1. Safety Analyses 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); m easurement of protocol specified hematology, 
clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; m easurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and 
other protocol-specified te sts that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the trial drug. 
10.2. Adverse Events 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241549] 1 day of initi al awareness.  It is 
the Sponsor’s responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable  local, national, or 
international regulatory body. 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible IRB according to 
the policies of the responsible IRB. 
 
Trial Drug:  Eribulin, SCRI (Sponsor) C linical Trial Protocol Number: BRE 186 
Date of Original Protocol:  26MAY2011 
Date of this Version:  20MAR2013, Amendment [ADDRESS_293350]. 
An undesirable medical condition can be sy mptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged  liver), or the abnormal results of  an investigation (e.g., laboratory 
findings). 
10.2.2. Recording of Adverse Events 
All AEs of any patient during the course of the trial will be reported in the case report form, and 
the Investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_241550] (i.e., whether the event is related or  unrelated to trial drug administration).  If the 
adverse event is serious, it should be reported imme diately (within 1 day of initial awareness) to 
the SCRI Safety Department. 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to the trial drugs, spanning from initiation of 
treatment until 30 calendar days after disconti nuation or completion of protocol-specific 
treatment as defined by [CONTACT_241571], are to be recorded in the CRF. 
10.2.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values and Vital Signs 
The reporting of abnormalities of vital signs as adverse events should be avoided.  Abnormalities 
of vital signs should not be reported unless any cr iterion for an SAE is fulfilled, the vital signs 
abnormalities cause the patient to discontinue trial tr eatment, or the Investigator insists that the 
abnormality should be reported as an adverse event (AE).  Any Grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormalities or any clinically significant Grade 1 or 2 hematology or biochemistry laboratory 
values should be recorded as an AE.  If an a bnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated 
with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or  symptom should be reported as an AE, and the 
associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered addi tional information that must be 
collected on the relevant CRF. 
10.2.4. Handling of Adverse Events 
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after discontinuation or 
completion of protocol-specific treatment (e .g., chemotherapy, radiation, oral medications, 
targeted therapy, and surgery).  All new AEs occu rring during this period must be reported and 
followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110503], these values are not likely to 
improve because of the underlying disease.  In this  case, the Investigators must record his or her 
reasoning for this decision in th e patient’s medical record and as  a comment on the CRF or EDC.  
After 30 days of completion of protocol-specifi c treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, 
or deaths assessed by [CONTACT_241572].

immediately life-threatening, requir es at least a 24-hour in-patie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76260], results in persistent  or significant disabili ty/incapacity, or is a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
The definition of SAE also includes any importa nt medical event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r expedited reporting is appropriate in other 
situations, such as important medical events th at may not be immediat ely life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be 
considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or convulsions th at do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abus e.  Progression of malignancy 
(including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_3019] e of appropriate method, should not be reported 
as a serious AE. 
Treatment within or admission to the following faciliti es is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although  if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):

Department. 
10.3.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting by [CONTACT_241573] “serio us” and “severe” AEs, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be consider ed an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which 
results in only a limited degree of disability ma y be considered only a mild stroke, but would be 
considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording 
AEs on the CRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form.

related to trial drug must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report Form within [ADDRESS_293355] 
knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_14209] (with an autopsy report, if 
available). Deaths occurring [ADDRESS_293356] trial treatment and not at tributed to trial treatment 
(e.g., disease progression) need not  be reported as SAEs, but simp ly captured on the appropriate 
CRF. The SAE report should be sent to the SCRI Safety  Department via fax or e-mail using the contact

Follow-up information for SAEs and information on non-serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to the SCRI Safety Department as  soon as it is available;  these reports should be 
submitted using the SCRI SAE Report Form. 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up info rmation to their responsible IRBs according to 
the policies of the responsible IRB.

the SCRI SAE Report Forms and AE CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
All AEs, including those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be reco rded on the AE CRF.  
Adverse events that meet the definition of an  SAE should additionally be reported following the 
procedures noted in Section 10.3.2. 
10.4.1. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs should be recorded individually in th e patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_241552], the AEs constitute components 
of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a si ngle diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the relevant form(s) (SCRI SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up info rmation is available.  If a diagnosis is 
determined subsequent to the reporting of th e constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms 
should be updated to re flect the diagnosis. 
10.4.2. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuous ly, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be record ed once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE 
CRF.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or  lessens in severity, it should be recorded on a 
separate SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF. 
A recurrent AE is one that o ccurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be  recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE 
CRF. 
10.4.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Any Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant Grade 1 or 2 hematology 
or biochemistry laboratory values  should be recorded as an AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value 
or vital sign is associated with  clinical signs and/or symptoms , the sign or symptom should be 
reported as an AE, and the associated laborat ory value or vital sign should be considered

is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the di agnosis needs to be r ecorded on the SAE Report 
Form or AE CRF. 
10.4.4. Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified  AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_171806] “Trial Discontinuation” 
CRF.  All other on-trial deaths, regardless of at tribution, will be reco rded on an SAE Report 
Form and expeditiously reported to  the SCRI Safety Department. 
When recording a SAE with an outcome of d eath, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be reco rded as the single medical concept on the SAE 
Report Form and AE page of the CRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be 
ascertained at the time of repor ting, record “Death NOS” on the CRF AE page.  During post-trial 
survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progr ession of disease will be recorded only on the 
“After Progressive Disease Follow-Up” CRF. 10.4.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolongation of preexisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241553].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241554] (refer to Section 10.3.1). 10.4.6. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
A pre-existing medical condition is on e that is present at the start of the trial.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical Hi story CRF.  A pre-existing medical condition 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if th e frequency, severity, or ch aracter of the condition 
worsens during the trial.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF, 
it is important to convey the concept that th e pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215]. 10.4.7. Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth De fects/Congenital Anomalies 
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects,  and congenital anomalies are ev ents of special interest.

also be reported to the SCRI Safety Department. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always m eet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the pr eviously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previous ly completed, and will need to be updated to 
reflect the outcome of the pregnancy. 
10.5.2. Trial Drug Overdose 
Symptomatic and non-symptomatic overdose must be  reported in the CRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the trial treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a 
seriousness criterion, is to be re ported to the SCRI Safety Department within one day using the 
corresponding screens in the CRF, and following the same process described for SAE reporting 
(Section 10.3.2), if the overdose is symptomatic. 
An overdose is defined as a dose of eribulin or trastuzumab administered to a patient that is 
greater than the protocol-defined dose for the patient.  For information on how to manage an 
overdose, see the respective  Investigator Brochures.

The trial protocol, ICF, IB, available safety information, patient documents (e.g., trial diary), 
patient recruitment procedures (e .g., advertisements), information about payments (i.e., Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20971]) and compensation availabl e to the patients and documentation evidencing 
the Principal Investigator’s qualifications should be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and 
approval if required by [CONTACT_24550], prior to the trial start. 
The Sponsor and/or designee will follow all necessa ry regulations to ensure appropriate, initial, 
and ongoing, IRB trial review.  The Sponsor (as appropriate) must subm it and, where necessary, 
obtain approval from the IRB for all subsequent protocol amendmen ts and changes to the ICF.  
Investigators will be advised by [CONTACT_241575]-substantial and whether it requires submissi on for approval or notification 
only to an IRB. 11.2. Regulatory Approval 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Sponsor will ensure all le gal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regu latory bodies obtained, prior to trial initia tion. If required, the 
Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendment to the protocol and 
other relevant trial documents happen only after approval by [CONTACT_241576].

11.4. Informed Consent 
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a subject  voluntarily confirms hi s or her willingness to 
participate in a particular trial,  after having been informed of a ll aspects of the trial that are 
relevant to the subject's decision to participate.   Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a 
written, signed and dated informed consent form. 
The informed consent form (ICF) will be submitted  for approval to the IRB that is responsible 
for review and approval of the tria l.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements 
currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county authority or state regulations. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial,  each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial.  Once the essential in formation has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, and the Investigator is sure that th e individual candidate under stands the implications 
of participating in this trial, the candidate will be  asked to give consent to participate in the trial 
by [CONTACT_21006].  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the informed consent form, to include the patient’s signature, will be pr ovided by [CONTACT_241577].

drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regul atory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the Investigator additionally agrees  to keep records, including the identity of all 
participating patients (sufficient information to  link records e.g., CRFs an d medical records), all 
original, signed informed consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE Reporting forms, source 
documents, detailed records of treatment dispositi on, and related essential regulatory documents.  
The documents listed above must be retained by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator for as long as needed to comply 
with national and international regulations (genera lly [ADDRESS_293369] marketing approval).  The Sponsor will notify the Investigators/institutions when the tria l-related records are no longer required. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for a ny reason withdraws from the trial, both the Sponsor 
and/or its representative should be prospectively notified.  The tr ial records must be transferred 
to an acceptable designee, such as another Inves tigator, another institution, or to Sponsor.  The 
Investigator must obtain the Spons or’s written permission before disposing of any records, even 
if retention requirements have been met. 
12.4. Data Collection 
The trial CRF is the primary data collection in strument for the trial. CRFs will be completed 
using the English language and should be kept cu rrent to enable the monitor to review the 
patients’ status throughout the course of the trial. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only trial nu mber, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the CRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_75502] 
(e.g., laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to SCRI and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The Investigator will 
maintain a personal patient identification lis t (patient numbers with corresponding patient 
identifiers) to enable records to be identified a nd verified as authentic.  Patient data/information

a Physical examinations will include measurements of weight, v ital signs (resting heart rate, bl ood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oral temperature), and assessment of peripheral neuropathy.  
At the baseline visit, height will also be recorded. 
b CMP assessment includes the following laboratory tests:  gluc ose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, total 
protein, albumin, plus magnesium. 
c After the baseline visit, PT/INR and PTT will be checked fo r any patients (in all treatment arms) who are receiving warfarin. 
d A serum pregnancy test will be performed only for women of childbearing potential (see Section 3.3.1). 
e The physical examination, ECOG performance status, CBC, CMP, PT /INR and PTT, ECG, concomitant medication review, and pregnancy  test should be done ≤7 days prior to 
initiation of treatment.  Baseline laboratory assessments will be  allowed up to 7 days outside of the 7-day specified window, provided that critical laboratory assessments (CBC, CMP, 
pregnancy test, and PT/INR and PTT [f or patients receiving warfarin only])  are repeated on Cycle 1, Day 1 prior to study treatment. 
f ECHO or MUGA for patients in Cohort C only (eribulin plus trastuzumab) 
g Complete staging work-up to confirm localized disease should in clude computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen/pe lvis (abdomen/pelvis preferred; abdomen 
accepted), a CT scan of the head or MRI of the brain (if sympto matic), and either a positron emi ssion tomography (PET) scan or a bone scan.  (Note:  a PET/CT is acceptable for 
baseline imaging in lieu of CT examinations or bone scan).   Negative scans performed prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant  therapy, or at any subsequent time, are acceptable and do 
not need to be repeated. 
h For the Day 1 visits of each treatment cycle, a window for vari ations from the protocol-specified treatment of up to ± 7 days is allowed, provided that the laboratory value criteria for 
treatment and other protocol requirements are met. 
i ECGs are required at the Pre-Treatment visit and on Day 1 of each  cycle.  During the treatment period, if an ECG indicates a Q Tc interval 500 msec, then two additional ECGs should 
be obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality.  The average QTc will be determined from the three ECG tracings by [CONTACT_241567], and will be used to determine 
continued eligibility.  If the average QTc is <500 msec, the patient may continue therapy.  If the average QTc is ≥500 msec, the study treatment should be discontinued immediately.  
The patient should be treated appropriately for QTc prolongation, and monitored until resolution is documented by a repeat ECG,  with QTc intervals returning to <480 msec (see 
Section 7.7). 
j Post Cycle [ADDRESS_293374] dose of eribulin treatment due  to completion of the planned study treatment period, disease 
progression, or once a patient is discontinued due to unacceptable toxicity or decision to discontinue treatment by [CONTACT_241583].  If treatment is discontinued 
because of toxicity or any other reason(s) at a treatment visi t and no study treatment is administered, that visit may fulfill the End-of-Treatment Visit. 
l After completion of eribulin treatment, patients will be follow ed every 3 months during years 1 and 2, for toxicity and diseas e progression. 
m CBC, including 3 part differential and platelets and CMP plus magnesium may be done up to 72 hours prior to treatment.

Women Not of Childbearing Pote ntial are Defined as Follows: 
 Women who are permanently sterilized  (e.g., tubal occlus ion, hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) 
 Women who are >[ADDRESS_293375] 
a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) valu e >40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value 
<40pg/mL (140 pmol/L) 
 Women who are >[ADDRESS_293376] had 
documented evidence of menopause based on FSH >40 mIU/mL and estradiol 
<40 pg/mL prior to initiation of  hormone replacement therapy 
   
Acceptable Contraception Methods: 
Male patients with female partners of child-bear ing potential and women patients of childbearing 
potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier 
method, during their participation in the trial and for 3 months  (women) or 6 months (men) 
following discontinuation of the trial drugs.  Male patients must also refra in from donating sperm 
for 6 months following discont inuation of the trial drugs.

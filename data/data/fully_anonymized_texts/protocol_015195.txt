2.1 Specific Aims. 
 Specific Aim 1: Assess intervention effects on uptake and 
distress 
 Specific Aim 2: Identify mediators/moderators of 
intervention impact on uptake. 
 Specific Aim 3: Use trial data in an established CISNET 
model to extend the time horizon of the trial to estimate the 
lifetime costs, benefits, and harms of the intervention from 
different perspectives. 
2.2 Hypotheses/Research questions. 
 1a: Compared to UC, women in the PW arm will have higher 
rates of MRI and chemoprevention uptake at 12-months 
post-randomization. 
 1b: The intervention will not lead to increased distress 
compared with UC. 
 1c: Women in the PW arm will have higher rates of follow-
up with providers to discuss MRI/chemoprevention. 
 1d: Women in the PW arm will have higher rates of 
mammography maintenance. 
 2a: Consistent with PMT, higher uptake of risk management 
in the PW arm will be mediated by [CONTACT_537171] (greater awareness of personal risk, higher 
perceived breast cancer risk, severity and worry) and 
stronger copi[INVESTIGATOR_494295] (higher response efficacy, lower 
response cost for preventive services; higher self-efficacy).  
3.0 Background* 
 
Over 232,[ADDRESS_699554] cancer in 2014.1 Many of these women were 
unaware of disease risk factors, their personal risk, and available risk management strategies.2 
Along with better-known risk factors such as family history,3–[ADDRESS_699555] cancer risk factors.7–[ADDRESS_699556] tissue affects about 10% 
of women, with an additional third having heterogeneously dense breasts. Women in these 
categories have 3-6x the risk of breast cancer as compared to women with the least density. 
Although breast density is measured on routine screening mammograms, it has not typi[INVESTIGATOR_537169].12,[ADDRESS_699557] half of US states now require disclosure 
of density status following routine screening mammography14–[ADDRESS_699558] to inform patients 
about their risk.14,17  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density [ADDRESS_699559] 
imaging.18–[ADDRESS_699560] cancer risk reduction.24–26 Women could find this more tangible given the 
ability to measure changes.27 Beyond chemoprevention, recent guidelines recommend annual 
screening MRI + mammography for women with a lifetime breast cancer risk >20%.18,[ADDRESS_699561] study to evaluate a novel approach for density disclosure.  We seek to fill the clinical 
vacuum presented by [CONTACT_537172]. 
 
4.0 Study Endpoints* 
 
4.1 Primary Endpoint: 12 month interview and appointment and 
pharmacy data for endpoints of chemoprevention, screening and 
physician appointments. 
4.2 Secondary Endpoints:  12 month cancer-related distress, 
mammography maintenance, healthcare utilization 
4.3 Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints have not been established as this 
is a minimal risk study.  
 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent 
 
5.1 Phase 1: Refine interventional materials for web-based use 
Focus Group:  For the initial phase of translation, we propose to conduct one 2-
hour patient focus groups, with 8-12 women participating. The purpose of the focus 
group is to get input from a panel of patients to inform website development.  
 
Beta Testing: After the focus group has been completed, this feedback will be used 
to develop a functional beta version of the website. We will recruit [ADDRESS_699562] the intervention procedures, including providing feedback on 
navigating the intervention website. Beta testing intervention procedures include: 1. 
Baseline phone interview, 2. Intervention website navigation, and 3. Semi-
structured feedback interview and survey after 2 weeks of beta testing. 
 
5.2 Phase 2: Randomized Control Trial 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density 2 
 Page 6 of 25   Potentially eligible patients will 
be identified, recruited, and 
enrolled following a negative 
screening mammogram and 
review of a routine risk factor 
questionnaire administered at 
the time of the mammogram.  
 
At the conclusion of consent, a 
baseline survey (T1) will be 
administered. At the conclusion 
of the baseline interview, 
participants will be randomized 
in equal numbers to 
personalized web site (PW) or 
usual care (UC; ACS website) 
via computer-generated random 
numbers.  
 
Participants will be notified 
after randomization that they will receive instructions in approximately two weeks 
for them to log into the website. Women will receive login information that will take 
them to UC or PW. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_51095]-up interviews at 6-weeks 
(T2) and 12-months (T3). 
 
Control (UC) Arm:  Participants randomized to UC will receive a login that will 
allow them to access the UC portal and the American Cancer Society website. Our 
creation of a login portal to a public site will allow us to track who viewed the 
website, but will not allow for complete utilization data. Participants will be told that 
this website covers many topi[INVESTIGATOR_537170]. While the 
participants will be able to examine any part of the website, they will be asked to 
review the following sections: Medicines to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk, Breast 
Cancer Early Detection, and the Prevention Checklist for Women. Therefore, UC 
participants will have the opportunity to receive much of the same general 
information as PW participants. 
 
Intervention (PW) Arm:  To enter the intervention, participants will be provided 
with a URL and user name [CONTACT_4490] a temporary password (changed to a private password 
on sign-in). The first time a user signs in, she will see a welcome video with 
instructions and will be directed to complete the intervention in order, though she will 
be able to navigate at-will. Participants will see an always-present indicator that 
clearly shows progress. Returning participants will be provided a record and links to 
return. They will be able to use the intervention as often as they want. However, 
because we are aware many participants will not return multiple times, it will be 
designed to communicate key content quickly and to be effective with a single usage. 
Similar interventions we have designed took ~40 minutes to complete. Didactic

 Page 7 of 25   information in text, image, animation, and video formats will be incorporated 
throughout. Interactive elements will be incorporated throughout (quizzes, 
opportunities to enter open-ended comments, controllable animation, expansion of 
content for detailed topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]) and most pages will include audio narration of the content. 
Content and interface will be written and designed to be accessible by [CONTACT_537173]. A limited set of obvious navigation elements will 
ensure participants do not need to “learn” how to use the website. Clear written 
instructions will walk users through a linear trajectory, with more experienced users 
having access to menus for quicker and/or non-linear usage. Content will be large 
and cleanly laid out, with use of obvious titles, short sentences, and lists to allow for 
quick digestion of key information. 
 
Intervention translation will be guided by [CONTACT_537174] (IPDAS). IPDAS guidelines suggest that the intervention should 
provide: 1) factual information about the condition (breast cancer risk, risk 
management), including severity and likelihood of possible harms; 2) options for risk 
management; 3) explanation of risks/benefits of each option, 4) clarification of 
individual preferences about options (value clarification), and 5) guidance in using 
information to reach decisions. With the exception of values clarification, all 
components were included in our print intervention; all will be in our PW arm.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_699563]. O'Neill as the 
Principal Investigator (PI), with Kaiser Permanente Washington being the 
recruitment site. O’Neill will have ultimate responsibility for all aspects of this 
study. This is a decision support intervention for women at increased risk for breast 
cancer due to breast density and other risk factors to consider MRI and/or 
chemoprevention to manage their breast cancer risk. We will test the efficacy of this 
web intervention vs. usual care, comparing uptake of MRI and chemoprevention. 
All patients will be recruited at Kaiser Permanente Washington in Seattle.  Phase I 
will consist of conducting focus groups and beta and usability testing of 
intervention procedures. Phase II will conduct the randomized control trial to 
evaluate the efficacy of web-based breast cancer risk communication vs. usual care. 
 
6.2 Procedures  
Phase I: Formative Data Collection 
1. Focus Group:  For the initial phase of translation, we propose to conduct one 2-
hour patient focus groups, with 8 – 12 women participating. The purpose of the 
focus group is to get input from a panel of patients to inform website development. 
Women for the focus group will be recruited from Kaiser Permanente Washington 
in Seattle, WA. The Kaiser Permanente Washington programmer will identify 
patients using Kaiser Permanente Washington administrative data, who are age 40 – 
69, receive care in the greater Seattle area and have had a negative screening 
mammogram as part of their routine care within the past 6 months. From this pool 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density [ADDRESS_699564] approximately 2 
hours. The focus groups will be moderated by [CONTACT_537175] (Wernli) 
using a semi-structured guide. The group will be audio-recorded and a court 
reporter will be present to transcribe the discussion in real-time. The local Group 
Health Research Institute Investigator will also attend the focus group discussions. 
At least one assistant, and possibly two will attend the group to aid the Facilitator, 
completing informed consent, manage the audio recorder, manage refreshments, 
and distribution of remuneration. The Facilitator will answer any questions and the 
Facilitator or one of the assistants will complete an informed written consent with 
each participant before beginning the discussion. Participants will also be asked to 
complete a brief demographic questionnaire (attached). The study will provide 
receive free parking or transport and light refreshments (sandwiches, salads, 
cookies) for focus group participants. The Facilitator will give each participant $50 
renumeration at the end of the group as a thank you for participating. 
 
2. Usability testing : This Phase will consist of 10 women to visually demonstrate 
usability testing and initial response to content of the final beta version of the 
website. The Kaiser programmer will identify patients with Kaiser Permanente 
Washington administrative data using the following criteria: females aged 40-[ADDRESS_699565] 
cancer risk will be assessed using a risk factor questionnaire provided routinely in 
mammography visits. This scantron-based patient risk factor questionnaire is part of 
Kaiser’s obligation as a member in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium 
(BCSC). Based on this questionnaire, women with high 5-year (>1.66%) risk for 
breast cancer, and high breast density (heterogeneously or extremely dense), will be 
eligible for recruitment.  
 
From this pool, we will select a sample for outreach, oversampling to include 
diversity in race, ethnicity, and education level. Kaiser study staff will mail 
potential participants a letter that invites them to participate in the study. The letter 
will give a telephone number to call if the woman wants to participate or does not 
want to be contact[CONTACT_23322]. Kaiser study staff will follow-up with a telephone call 
to individuals who have not actively declined to confirm interest and eligibility and 
give more information about the study. The study staff will mail a confirmation 
letter to participants who are confirmed, along with a copy of the consent form to 
review prior to attending usability testing session. With the participant’s 
permission, study staff will also send a letter to her Kaiser primary care provider to 
alert them to the participant’s risk status and let them know that she may be 
following up.  
 
Usability testing will take place at Kaiser offices in Seattle WA and will last 
approximately 2 hours. Participants will complete a brief demographic survey 
before usability testing. During testing, participants will be asked to navigate 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density [ADDRESS_699566]. 
Participants will be asked to “think aloud” as they navigate the website, sharing 
their thought process as they work, so that Kaiser staff can gain better insight into 
the navigation process. They will be asked to note any feature or content that 
confuses them or leads to specific questions. Staff will respond in open-ended 
neutral ways (“What do you mean by [INVESTIGATOR_24565]? Tell me more about that.”) so as not to 
lead the participant. If problems are identified, potential solutions or adaptations 
will be discussed with the participant. Usability guide is attached. Staff also will 
observe body language and facial expressions as additional sources of information. 
The goal of these sessions is to ensure that the website is functioning properly and 
that navigation elements are properly aligned for the participants’ experience. 
Participants will receive $50 for their time. All in-person meetings will be audio 
recorded and reviewed to inform finalized intervention development for Phase II. 
We will complete testing and make changes to the intervention. 
 
3. Beta Testing:  After the focus group has been completed, this feedback will be 
used to develop a functional beta version of the website.  
 
We will recruit [ADDRESS_699567] the intervention procedures, including 
providing feedback on navigating the intervention website. Women will be 
recruited from the Kaiser Permanente Washington in Seattle, WA, using the same 
means as the usability testing.  
 
Kaiser study staff will mail eligible patients a letter inviting them to participate in 
the beta testing of intervention procedures. Beta testing intervention procedures 
include: 1. Baseline phone interview, 2. Intervention website navigation, and 3. 
Semi-structured feedback interview and survey after [ADDRESS_699568] ask questions about the study, call to consent and 
schedule their participation, and/or who do not want to be contact[CONTACT_23322]. The 
baseline phone interview will last about 30 minutes.  
 
Participants will be notified at the end of the baseline interview that they will 
receive a letter and if requested email with information in order for them to log into 
the intervention site. With the participant’s permission, study staff will also send a 
letter to her Kaiser primary care provider to alert them to the participant’s risk 
status and let them know that she may be following up. Before sending the 
letter/email to the participant, Kaiser study team staff members will organize the 
following data to be sent via secure data transfer for People Designs to tailor the 
intervention: 1. Participant study ID number, 2. Assigned username [CONTACT_537181], 3. BCSC 5 and 10 year risk estimates. The intervention will be designed 
to monitor utilization through website metrics (e.g., page views, feature utilization, 
time on site, repeat logins). All of these data points will be aggregated by [CONTACT_537176]’s database 
system and for future trial analytics. After a two-week beta testing period, 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density [ADDRESS_699569] about 30 minutes and 
be scheduled at participants’ convenience with Kaiser staff. Participants will receive 
$[ADDRESS_699570] interview, and $30 for the second interview, up to 
$[ADDRESS_699571] Trial:  Kaiser will recruit women as they receive a negative screening 
mammogram. Patients routinely complete a scantron patient risk factor 
questionnaire at the time of the mammogram as part of Kaiser’s membership in the 
BCSC. A Kaiser study programmer who works with the BCSC will use these risk 
factor data and density readings to identify eligible patients. Women will have 
either (a) an intermediate 5-year risk (>1.67%-2.49%) and extremely dense breasts 
or (b) a high 5-year risk (≥2.50%) and either heterogeneously dense or extremely 
dense breasts. Women must also have a valid email address. Patients will be 
recruited via an introductory letter from the study team. This letter will notify them 
of their density status and introduce them to the study. Kaiser Survey Research 
Program will use standardized methodology for proactive telephone contact, verbal 
consent and to conduct baseline interviews. At the conclusion of the baseline 
interview, participants will be randomized in equal numbers to personalized web 
site (PW) or usual care (UC; ACS website) via computer-generated random 
numbers. Participants will be notified at the end of the call that they will receive a 
letter from Group Health in approximately two weeks in order for them to log into 
the website. During this time, personalized risk information will be sent to People 
Designs via secure data transfer to tailor the intervention. Women will receive login 
information that will take them to UC or PW. Logins will be tracked and follow-up 
will be made as needed to prompt uptake. Consent will be done online after website 
login. Patients will have the option to print a copy of the consent for them to keep. 
For participants that don’t login to the website and give consent, they will be sent a 
paper consent form to sign and return. Patients that don’t complete consent will not 
be contact[CONTACT_387532] [ADDRESS_699572] model. Women 
will receive a $[ADDRESS_699573] completed and will continually maintain requirements for certification

will be conducted to discuss the course of the research and provide a forum for 
identifying and discussing any adverse events. A specific protocol will be in place 
to provide study participants experiencing distress with appropriate referrals for 
psychological counseling, whether or not this distress is connected with their 
research participation.

Focus Group:  The Kaiser Permanente Washington programmer will 
identify patients using Kaiser Permanente Washington 
administrative data, who are age 40 – 69, receive care in the greater 
Seattle area and have had a negative screening mammogram as part 
of their routine care within the past [ADDRESS_699583] a sample for outreach, oversampling to include diversity in 
race, ethnicity, and education level. Kaiser study staff will mail 
potential participants a letter that invites them to participate in a 2-
hour group discussion. The letter will give a telephone number to 
call if the person wants to participate or does not want to be 
contact[CONTACT_23322]. Kaiser study staff will follow-up with a telephone 
call to individuals who call to say they are interested to confirm 
eligibility and give more information about the study. The study staff 
will mail a confirmation letter to participants who are confirmed, 
along with a copy of the consent form to review prior to attending

Usability Testing:  The Kaiser programmer will identify patients 
with Kaiser Permanente Washington administrative data using the 
following criteria: females aged 40-[ADDRESS_699584] and eligibility and give 
more information about the study. The study staff will mail a 
confirmation letter to participants who are confirmed, along with a 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density 2 
 Page 15 of 25   copy of the consent form to review prior to attending usability 
testing session. 
Beta Testing:  Women will be recruited from the Kaiser Permanente 
Washington in Seattle, WA, using the same means as the usability 
testing.  
Kaiser study staff will mail eligible patients a letter inviting them to 
participate in the beta testing of intervention procedures. Beta testing 
intervention procedures include: 1. Baseline phone interview, 2. 
Intervention website navigation, and 3. Semi-structured feedback 
interview and survey after [ADDRESS_699585] ask questions about the study, call to 
consent and schedule their participation, and/or who do not want to 
be contact[CONTACT_23322]. 
RCT: Kaiser will recruit women as they receive a negative 
screening mammogram. Patients routinely complete a scantron 
patient risk factor questionnaire at the time of the mammogram as 
part of Kaiser’s membership in the BCSC. A Kaiser study 
programmer who works with the BCSC will use these risk factor 
data and density readings to identify eligible patients. Women will 
have either (a) an intermediate 5-year risk (>1.67%-2.49%) and 
extremely dense breasts or (b) a high 5-year risk (≥2.50%) and either 
heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts. Women must also 
have a valid email address. Patients will be recruited via an 
introductory letter from the study team. This letter will notify them 
of their density status and introduce them to the study. Kaiser Survey 
Research Program will use standardized methodology for proactive 
telephone contact [CONTACT_537177].

14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects* 
Participants will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time. 
We will track the number of eligible participants that withdraw from the study. 
Reasons participants may withdraw or dropout of the study include lack of time 
and not being interested in participating in research related to breast density and 
mammography.  
 
When a participant drops out, if she indicates that we cannot use the data 
collected thus far, then we will destroy it and not include it in analyses. If the

not use the existing data, then we will use the data already collected.

17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality 
 
17.1 Data Analysis Plan, including statistical procedures and power analysis 
Phase 1: Analysis of focus group data and most beta and usability testing will be 
done using qualitative methods and therefore is not subject to statistical 
considerations. Quantitative data in the beta and usability testing will use t-tests and 
Chi-square tests to examine differences, with a p-value of .05. 
 
Phase II: We will calculate descriptive statistics for all variables. We will assess the 
quality of the data and evaluate the extent of missing data. If needed, we will 
address missing data issues by [CONTACT_537178]203; we will 
generate 10 multiple imputed datasets, analyze each separately, and then combine 
results across the 10 datasets. All statistical analyses will be performed as intention-
to-treat (ITT) analyses. Given our use of administrative data to measure our primary 
outcomes, we will retain all women who consented and completed the baseline 
(N=1250). Assuming a 5% attrition rate from Group Health during the 12 
months,19 we will use 1188 participants for our primary analyses (594/arm). For 
patient reported outcomes, we anticipate 10% attrition at 6 weeks and 10% attrition 
at 12 months, leaving 506/arm at 12 months.18 We will evaluate the associations 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density 2 
 Page 17 of 25   between baseline variables, mediating variables assessed at 6 weeks, and 12 month 
outcomes. For categorical variables we will use Chi-Square tests or Fisher’s exact 
tests if needed, while for continuous variables we will use Student t-tests or 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Any variable that exhibits a p<.[ADDRESS_699591] will be subsequently controlled for in analyses. We will assess 
attrition rates and subgroup effects over the short- and longer-term. 
 
Power calculations assume a two tailed α=.05 and N=1188 at 12 months (594/arm) 
for primary utilization outcomes of chemoprevention and MRI; calculations for 
patient-reported outcomes will assume N=1012 at 12 months (506/arm). To 
account for clustering by [CONTACT_48368], we calculated effective sample sizes assuming 
an average cluster size of 11 patients/provider and intraclass correlation coefficient 
of 0.02. This reduces the sample size by a factor of 1.2, leaving effective sample 
sizes of 990 for utilization outcomes and 842 for patient-reported outcomes. We 
employ generalized estimation equations (GEE) methods with exchangeable 
working correlation structure to analyze clustered data.  
 
Assess intervention effects on uptake and distress. 1a: Compared to UC, women in 
the PW arm will have higher rates of MRI and chemoprevention uptake at 12-
months post-randomization. We will use logistic regression models with GEE to 
account for patients’ clustered binary outcomes within their providers. We will use 
2 separate logistic regression models for each binary outcome: chemoprevention 
and MRI uptake. These models will include intervention (PW vs. UC) as the main 
predictor, and baseline covariates as controlling variables. Given the effective 
sample size of 990, we provide a range of effect sizes that correspond to statistical 
power ranging from 80% to 99% in Table 5. UC rates are based on published uptake 
of chemoprevention20 and breast MRI.21 1b: The intervention will not lead to 
increased distress compared with UC. To demonstrate that the PW arm does not 
result in greater distress than UC, we will test for noninferiority by [CONTACT_2164] a 
one-sided 97.5% confidence limit for the adjusted (for baseline distress) mean 
difference between arms. Noninferiority will be demonstrated when the one-sided 
97.5% confidence limit does not cross the noninferiority limit of [ADDRESS_699592] 80% power to 
conclude non-inferiority assuming a SD of 15.[ADDRESS_699593] size of < 0.20.209 1c: Women in the PW arm will have higher rates of 
follow-up with providers to discuss MRI/chemoprevention. 1d: Women in the PW 
arm will have higher rates of mammography maintenance. We will use the 
approach in 1a for 1c and d.  
 
Identify mediators/moderators of intervention impact on uptake. 2a: Consistent 
with PMT, higher uptake of risk management in the PW arm will be mediated by 
[CONTACT_537179] (greater awareness of personal risk, higher 
perceived breast cancer risk, severity and worry) and stronger copi[INVESTIGATOR_494295] 
(higher response efficacy, lower response cost for preventive services; higher self-
efficacy). To increase power we will use the product of coefficients method to 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 ENGAGED2: ExperieNces with MammoGrAphy screeninG and brEast Density 2 
 Page 18 of 25   evaluate mediation effects. Using logistic regression models with GEE we will 
estimate the standardized coefficients relating each mediating variable (e.g. worry) 
to the chemoprevention and MRI uptake outcomes (β), and the standardized 
coefficients relating the intervention (PW vs. UC) to the mediating variables (α). 
These models will control for the baseline measurement of the mediator variable 
and also other baseline covariates. We will then calculate each mediated effect as 
the corresponding product of these coefficients (αβ) with its standard error and 95% 
confidence interval estimated as described by [CONTACT_38722]. Effect sizes of 0.14, 0.39 
and 0.59 for the coefficient parameters are considered “small”, “medium” and 
“large” respectively.[ADDRESS_699594] (coefficient 
product) of small size (with coefficient product parameters α = 0.14, β = 0.14) at 
>95% power for each mediator,210,[ADDRESS_699595] similar rates of risk management regardless of 
literacy/numeracy level. In contrast, we expect lower uptake of risk management 
options among UC participants with lower literacy/numeracy. However, even with 
our large sample, we are underpowered to detect this subtle moderation effect. 
Therefore, we will examine these relationships in exploratory subgroup analyses. 
We also will assess the robustness of outcomes across patient subgroups using 
additional, exploratory moderation analyses. Given our individual focus, we will 
examine adoption by [CONTACT_1962], but explore whether effects are moderated by [CONTACT_537180] (i.e., mammography facilities, primary care clinic home).  
 
 
17.2 Data Security  
Data collected in this study will be used exclusively for research purposes; it will 
be managed and stored according to our sites’ security standards for data that 
require the highest possible security to ensure there will be no inadvertent 
disclosure. Any computers storing or accessing data collected for the study will be 
required to comply with these standards. 
 
During the trial, all study data that will be collected from surveys or gathered from 
other sources will reside in a HIPAA-compliant study folder. During analysis, all 
data will be stored in Box. to the study folder is provided based on employee’s role, 
on a ‘need to know, least privilege’ basis. Georgetown Box is a secure (HIPAA/PHI 
approved) place to store study files.  
 
No identifying data will be stored on laptop computers or other mobile computing 
hardware. Computers used to access the data will be protected by a username [CONTACT_537182]’ complexity and change requirements to 
ensure a high degree of security, and they will be protected with anti-virus software

explain study procedures and benefits/risks. Women will have a few 
minutes to independently read and sign the consent form prior to the start 
of the focus group discussions. To allow time for them to fully consider 
their participation, they will be mailed a copy of the consent in advance so 
that they can review before attending. This will also minimize undue 
influence, as they can choose to not attend the group or to call study staff if 
they have questions prior to attending. 
Usability testing: Participants will complete an informed written consent

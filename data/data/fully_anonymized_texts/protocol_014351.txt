chromosomal translocation results in significant over -expression of this protein in B -cells.  
In contra st to other known oncogenes, Bcl -2 does not stimulate cellular proliferation, but 
rather inhibits programmed cell death by  [CONTACT_147548] a wide variety  of 
pro-apoptotic stimuli, including cy tokine withdrawal, irradiation, cy totoxic drugs, heat 
and deregulated oncogenes.1  The Bcl -2 family  of genes encodes a family  of closel y 
related proteins that possess either pro -apoptotic or anti -apoptotic activit y and sh are up to 
four Bcl -2 Homology  (BH) domains.2,3,4,5  The anti -apoptotic family  members Bcl -XL, 
Bcl-2, Bcl -w, Bcl -B, A1 and Mcl -1 are characterize d by [CONTACT_147549]1- 4.  The pro- apoptotic famil y members can be further subdivided into 
multidomain proteins (Bax, Bak) and the BH3 -only proteins (Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, Hrk, 
Bmf, Noxa, and Puma).  The interplay  between these three gr oups of proteins serves as 
the gateway  to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway .
The multidomain pro -apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are direct mediators of apoptosis 
and are absolutely required for the initiation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.6,7,8  
Anti-apoptotic Bcl -2 family  proteins (e.g., Bcl -2 and Bcl -
XL) inhibit cy tochrome 
Crelease b y blocking Bax/Bak activation.9The exact mechanism of action of Bcl -2 and 
Bcl-XLhas not been completely  elucidated, however it is known that it requires the ability  
to bind the pro- apoptotic Bcl -2 family  members and that the ratio of pro -apoptotic to anti -
apoptotic proteins is associated with cell survival.10

ABT -263 Activity and Pharmacokinetic Profile
ABT -263 (navitoclax) is a small molecule Bcl -2 family  protein inhibitor that binds with 
high affinity  (K i1 nM) to multiple anti -apoptotic Bcl -[ADDRESS_168781] 2007 -002143 -25

cytotoxicity  (EC 501 M) against human tumor cell lines derived from small cell lung 
carcinomas and l ymphoid malignancies.  ABT -[ADDRESS_168782] been performed on primary  patient derived chronic 
lymphocy tic leukemia (CLL) samples with ABT -737, a first generation Bcl -[ADDRESS_168783], concentration -dependent 
apoptosis in 47 of 50 patient -derived CLL specimens regardless of the presence of feeder 
cells.  These cells were highl y sensitive w ith EC 50values of < 0.25 M.  Forty -two of the 
47 lines had EC 50values of < 0.01 M.  ABT -263, which has similar potency  as 
ABT -737, would be expected to have similar efficacy .
The pharmacokinetic profile of ABT -263 was evaluated in multiple animal model s 
including:  CD -1 mouse, Sprague -Dawley  rat, beagle dog and cy nomolgus monkey .  The 
pharmacokinetic profile of ABT -263 is characterized by  [CONTACT_147550], with terminal half -lives in the ra nge of 
4.6 to 8.4 hours.  The oral bioavailability  of the compound is formulation dependent, with 
values of 30% to 50% obtained from protot ype solid dispersion and lipid -based 
formulations in dog.  In rat, [14C] ABT -263 is slowly  absorbed, with clearance o f the 
metabolites primarily in the bile.  Elimination of total radioactivity  is rapid, with 90% of 
the dose recovered within 24- hours post -dose.  Parent drug is the major component in 
systemic circulation.
Based on preclinical evidence, potential treatment -related side effects may  include drug 
interactions, ly mphopenia, testicular effects and thrombocy topenia.  At the expected 
biologicall y effective plasma concentration in humans of 6.5 g/mL (C max), ABT -263 is 
likely  to inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 by  
[CONTACT_7809] 50%.  Simulation of 350 mg q.d. dosing in humans describes an AUC of 
92g•hr/mL at stead y state, with a C maxof ~6.5 g/mL.  Under these conditions, platelet 
values in patients with normal platelet val ues (~300 K/ L) at baseline are expected to be 
~25 K/ L at stead y state.  At the lower end of the predicted efficacious range, an AUC of  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168784] 2007 -002143 -25

53 g•hr/mL (predicted 200 mg q.d. dosing in humans) is expected to be attainable while 
still maintaining platelet values above 50 K/ L at steady  state.

ABT -263 Toxicology
The safet y of ABT -263 has been evaluated in single -and repeat -dose (up to 6 and 
9months in durati on in rats and dogs, respectively), reproductive (male and female 
fertility  and embry o fetal development), safety pharmacology (cardiovascular, 
neurofunctional, and pulmonary), genetic (Ames, in vitro cytogenetics, and in vivo 
micronucleus), and special st udies (guinea pig sensitization; ly mphocy te 
immunophenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; and single -dose oral toxicity  in male rats).  The primary  effects of 
ABT -263 were on the hematopoietic sy stem (platelets and ly mphocy tes) and the male 
reproductive s ystem (germ cell depletion), and are believed to be based on inhibition of 
one or more members of the Bcl -2 family  of antiapoptotic proteins.  Other findings 
included ovarian atroph y (rats onl y), and generally minimal and reversible liver changes 
(single -cell hepatocellular necrosis, increased mitotic index, and hy pertrophy /hyperplasia 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_147496]) and single -cell necrosis in various tissues.  ABT- [ADDRESS_168786] male or female fertility  in rats or embry o-fetal 
development in rats and rabbits.  ABT- 263-related effects were observed on brain, testes, 
and circulating platelets in juvenile rats.  Effects on the brain (cerebellar h ypoplasia), 
which were not observed in adult rats, were the likely result of incomplete maturation of 
the blood
-brain -barrier at the time dosing was initiated in the rat pups (post natal Day  7).
ABT -263 caused increases in pulmonary  and peripheral vascular resistance and decreases 
in cardiac output in the dog following acute or multiple daily dosing.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_147497], there were no increases in blood pressure.  On Day 28 of 
the oral dosing stud y, these cardiovascular effects were associated with a mean C maxvalue 
of 16.6 g/mL, whereas no statistically  significant hemody namic changes we re associated 
with a mean C maxof 11.4 g/mL .13  Similar sy stemic exposures induced these effects in 
the acute cardiovascular study .
Chronic Lympho cytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia (CLL) is a monoclonal disorder characterized by  a 
progressive accumulation of functionall y incompetent lymphocytes.  It is the most  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168787] 2007 -002143 -25
13
common form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for nearl y 25% of 
all leukemias.[ADDRESS_168788] 4,700 individuals will die of the disease.17  The approximate 5 -year 
survival rate for patients with CLL is 73%.[ADDRESS_168789] line treatment 
options include al kylating agents, alky lator/anthracy cline combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147498].  Improvement in treatment response rates occurred 
with the switch from historical single -agent usage to combination therap y, such as 
fludarabine and cy clophosphamide, with some combinations y ielding overall response 
rates (ORR) in excess of 90%.  An alternative to combination therapy is sequential 
therap y.  The sequential regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 
induced ORR of 88 -95% with a high incidence of complete responses (53 -70%).20-22
In previousl y treated/relapsed patients, fludarabine is the most active single -agent, with 
ORR ranging from 50 -60%, and complete remission (CR) rates from 3 -13%.[ADDRESS_168790] 
demonstrated ORRs ranging from 21 -33%.  Progression- free survival rates ranged 
between [ADDRESS_168791] that 
the Bcl -2 family  protein inhibito r has single agent anti -tumor activity .
Based upon the preclinical profile of ABT -263, the role of Bcl -2 family  proteins in 
hematological malignancies, and the lack of an existing therap y that provides a survival 
benefit in relapsed or refractory CLL patie nts, clinical investigation of ABT -263 is 
warranted.
ABT -263 Clinical Data
Preliminary  aggregate clinical data from the 3 ongoing Phase 1 studies support that 
ABT -263 is tolerable at doses up to 250 mg in a 21/21 day  continuous dosing schedule, 
which achie ves exposures consistent with preclinical efficacy .  Anti -tumor activity  has 
been noted in study  subjects with CLL at doses [ADDRESS_168792] 2007 -002143 -25

dependent decrease in circulating platelets in animal models, thrombocytopenia appears to 
be a DLT for ABT -263 in humans.  The ongoing clinical studies with ABT -263 will 
continue to evaluate its safety profile, DLT, MTD, bioava ilability , pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy .
This study  will determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum -tolerated dose 
(MTD), and will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of 
ABT -263 in subjects with relapsed or refracto ry CLL.  ABT -263 will be administered 
orally  under two different dosing schedules (14/21 day  dosing schedule and 21/21 day  
continuous dosing schedule).  The following 14/[ADDRESS_168793] been completed to 
date:  10 mg, 110 mg, 200 mg, and 250 mg.  The f ollowing 21/[ADDRESS_168794] been 
completed to date:  125 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg and 300 mg.
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects receiving ABT -263may be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected.  
Management of these adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/risk.  However, based on the population and disease being 
studied, and the anticipation that COVI D-19 related risks are not expected to differ 
substantially  between study  subjects and the broader population of subjects receiving 
treatment for CLL ,no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is
expected.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology , metabolism, and pharmacology  can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure.14

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Descripti on
This is a Phase 1/2a study evaluating the safet y, PK, and preliminary efficacy of the orally 
administered Bcl -[ADDRESS_168796] portions.  The Phase 1 portion of the study  will 
evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safet y of ABT -263 administered under 
twodifferent dosing schedules (14/21 day  and 21/21 day ) in up to 40 subjects with 
relapsed or refractory  CLL following a dose escalation scheme in order to define the DLT 
and the MTD.  Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  eight research sites for the 
Phase 1 portion of the study .  A continual reassessment methodology will be employ ed 
during Phase 1 to ob tain a more precise estimate of the MTD and determine the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD). 
ABT -[ADDRESS_168797] relapsed following an y (but no more than 5) prior 
myelosuppres sive/chemotherap y treatment regimen(s) at the defined RPTD and dosing 
schedule to obtain additional safet y information and a preliminary assessment of efficacy 
as defined in Section 5.3.3 .  Subjects in the Phase 2a portion of the study will be enrolled 
at approximately  twelve research sites.
The Extension portion of the study  will continue to evaluate the safet y of ABT -263 
administered under two different dosing sch edules (14/21 day  and 21/21 day ) in 
approximately  13 subjects with relapsed or refractory  CLL.  Eligible subjects will be 
active subjects from the Phase 1 or Phase 2a portions of the study.

Continual Reassessment Method
The experimental design for the Phase 1 portion of the study  is an adaptation of a 
continual reassessment method (CRM), which is based on the concept of maximizing the 
number of subjects at the best current estimation of the MTD given the previous 
observations.28,[ADDRESS_168799] shown that compared to the conventional fixed 3+3 design, the CRM 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y requires fewer subjects to find the MTD, does not greatl y overshoot the MTD 
(that is, subjec ts are less likely  to be treated with dangerousl y high doses), and does not 
greatl y underestimate the MTD.  This design also minimizes the exposure of Phase 1 
subjects to lower, potentially inefficacious doses.
Escalation will continue to the estimated MTD .  The dose will be escalated by  [CONTACT_147551] 100 mg or a 40% increase from the current dose level, 
whichever is greater.  A minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.  
Additional eligible subjects may  be enrolled at the current dose level at the discretion of 
the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor.  If a cohort has enrolled more than 
3subjects, dose escalation decisions may be made following the completion of Cycle 1 
for subjects in the intended cohort size of three.  However, available data from all subjects 
receiving stud y drug will be used in dose escalation decisions.  Predicted efficacious 
concentrations of ABT -263 are expected to occur in the dose range of 200 mg to 350 mg 
based on preclinical studies.
Subsequent dose levels will be selected based on an estimate from a statistical anal ysis.  
The statistical anal ysis will be a logistic regression model for the dose -toxicity  
relationship (i.e., the relationship between dose and the probability of DLT) and will 
incorporate data from the M06 -814 study  in lymphoid malignancies (with inclusion of 
CLL subjects) for initial modeling.  The first step will be to fit the logistic regression  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168800] 2007 -002143 -25
19
model and obtain the estimate of the MTD.  Three subjects will be dosed at t his estimated 
MTD.  After all three subjects complete C ycle 1, a logistic regression model will be fitted 
using all of the data cumulatively  from this study , and an updated estimate of the MTD 
will be obtained.  Three more subjects will be dosed at the new estimated MTD, and the 
design will continue in this fashion, assigning subjects to the MTD as estimated from 
current results, until the estimated MTD changes by [CONTACT_21316] 10% or the predetermined 
sample size of 40 subjects is reached, whichever comes firs t.  Complete details on the 
CRM design for the Phase 1 portion of the study are provided in Section 8.1.1 .  The 
following flowchart depi[INVESTIGATOR_147500]: 
ABT -[ADDRESS_168801] cy cle and ongoing 
pharmacokinetic assessment may  also be considered in dose escalation decisions.  I f 
pharmacokinetic results indicate more than 25% of intersubject variability can be 
attributed to differences in bo dy weight or body  surface area (BSA), escalation will 
proceed with dosing normalized to body  weight or BSA; therefore subsequent dose levels 
will be determined using average subject BSA or average subject weight.
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_147501], the observed dose 
limiting toxicities are likely  to have resulted from a cumulative and continuous exposure 
to the study  drug, an alternative dosing schedule for ABT -[ADDRESS_168802] 2 cy cles (6 weeks).  Subsequently , subject assessments for safet y and clinical 
progression will be p erformed once every  cycle (every  3 weeks) or more frequently , as 
needed.

Phase 1 -14/21 Day Dosing
ABT -263 will be administered for 14 consecutive day s followed by  7 day s off drug to 
complete a 21- day cycle.  Subjects will be instructed to self -administer ABT -263 orall y 
once dail y (QD) within [ADDRESS_168804].
Figure 3. ABT -263 Dosing Schematic –Phase 1
Additionally , a continuous dosing regimen will be evaluated and compared to the 
14/21 cyclic dosing regimen.
Phase 1 –21/21 Day Continuous Dosing
Once either the MTD is defined or dosing in the 4thdose level is completed for the 
14/[ADDRESS_168805], a continuous dosing schedule will be 
assessed.  Dosing with ABT -263 under the continuous dosing schedule (21/21 day ) will 
begin at the dose estimated to provide exposure equivalent to the highest dosing level 
cleared (4thdose level) or the MTD from the 14/[ADDRESS_168806] dose level cleared or the MTD from the 14/21 day  dosing schedule is 375 mg, the 
continuous starting dose (defined C ycle 1 Day 1 dose) would be (375 14)/21 or 250 mg.  
A minimum of three subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.  The ABT -263 dose will be ABT -263 once daily dosing =[ADDRESS_168807] 2007 -002143 -25

escalated using a modified CRM as described previously  for the 14/21 day  regimen 
(Figure 2).
Prior to beginning the assigned 21/[ADDRESS_168808] that a lead -in period may  help reduce the depth of the 
initial platelet nadir and provide an additional margin of safet y.
Subjects will begin dosing at 100 mg on Lead- in Day  1 (LD1).  This is the dose level at 
which a mean maximal platelet drop of approximately  60% from baseline with recovery  
during [ADDRESS_168809] may  only  proceed from the lead -in period to the defined dose level for C ycle 1 
Day 1 and bey ond if platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3after Lead -in Day  7 and stable or 
increasing.  If the platelet count is < 50,000/mm3after Lead -in Day  7, the visit day  will be 
considered Lead- in Day  [ADDRESS_168810] will continue to receive the lead -in dose until 
the platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3.
When the platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3, the subject will receive the lead- in dose that 
day,and the next day  (defined as C ycle 1 Day 1) the subject will recei ve the defined dose 
for Cy cle 1 Day  1, provided the pre -dose platelet count that day  is ≥ 50,000/mm3and 
platelets are stable or increasing.  For example, if a subject's platelet count is 
≥50,000/mm3on Lead-in Day  9, the subject will take the lead -in dos e on Day  9.  The 
next day  will be considered Cy cle [ADDRESS_168811] will begin receiving the defined 
dose for C ycle 1 Day 1.  However, if the pre -dose platelet count is < 50,000/mm3or  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168812] dose escalation decisions wil l be based on the judgment of the 
investigator in coordination with the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor.  Once the MTD is 
declared and/or the RPTD determined, subjects who remain on study and continue to 
tolerate the drug may  escalate to the dose level determined to be the RPTD or the dose 
level below the RPTD.  Phase 1 subjects will be allowed to switch their current dosing 
schedule to the recommended Phase 2a schedule once it has been declared.  The RPTD 
will be defined b y observed DLTs and/or determination of MTD .
Subject assessments for safet y (ph ysical examination, vital signs, chemistry, hematology , 
urinaly sis, ECOG performance score and adverse event assessment) will be performed 
weekl y during the first cycle at the new escalated dose and then may resume to on ce every  
cycle.  All other procedures (platelet count, echocardiogram and ECG) will be performed 
according to the schedule of assessments as outlined in Table 1and Table 2for the 
subject's cumulative cy cle.
Transition From Phase 1 Portion to Phase 2a Portion
Once the MTD and/or the RPTD is declared on the 21/[ADDRESS_168813] discontinuation (Section 5.4).  Subjects who enter the Extension Study  
will continue taking ABT -[ADDRESS_168814] meet 
laboratory  criteria as stated in Section 5.2.5.
Phase 2a
In the Phase 2a portion of the study, 250 mg of ABT -263 will be administered under a 
21/[ADDRESS_168815] unless specified otherwise.
A 7-day lead -in dose titration period will be implemented.  Subjects will begin dosing at 
100 mg on Lead -in Day  1 (LD1).  A subject may  only  proceed from the lead -in period to 
250 mg on C ycle 1 Day 1 and beyond if platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3after Lead- in 
Day 7 and stable or increasing.  If the platelet count is < 50,000/mm3after Lead -in Day  7, 
the visit day  will be considered Lead -in Day  [ADDRESS_168816] will continue to receive the 
lead-in dose unti l the platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3.
When the platelet count is ≥ 50,000/mm3, the subject will receive the lead- in dose that 
day, and the next day  (defined as C ycle 1 Day 1) the subject will receive the defined dose 
for Cy cle 1 Day  1, provided the pre-dose platelet count that day  is ≥ 50,000/mm3and 
platelets are stable or increasing.  For example, if a subject's platelet count is 
≥50,000/mm3on Lead-in Day  9, the subject will take the lead -in dose on Day  9.  The 
next day  will be considered Cy cle [ADDRESS_168817] will begin receiving the defined 
dose for C ycle 1 Day 1.  However, if the pre -dose platelet count is < 50,000/mm3or 
platelets are decreasing, then the day  becomes Lead -in Day  [ADDRESS_168818] continues 
dosing at the lead- in dose.
If the platelet count is < 50,000/mm3after [ADDRESS_168819]'s dose for the duration of the study.  To change from the lead in dose  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168820] 2007 -002143 -25
27
to a higher dose (for subjects who continue receiving the lead in dose beyond the lead in 
period), a discussion between the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor is 
required.
For the purpose of subject assessments for safet y and clinical progression under a 
21/[ADDRESS_168821] two cycles (6 weeks) 
of ABT -263.  Subsequently , subject assessments for safety and clinical progression will 
be performed once every  cycle (every  3 weeks) of ABT -263.
If, during Phase 2a, dose -limiting toxicities are observed at a frequency higher than the 
definition of MTD (> 30%), the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147502] a new, lower 
recommended Phase [ADDRESS_168822] discontinuation (Section 5.4).

Concomitant medications of the following categories could potentially lead to adverse 
reaction(s).  It is important to assess whether potential study subjects are taking an y of the 
cautionary  medications.  If a potenti al stud y subject is taking an y of the medications in the 
categories described below, the investigator will assess and document the use of 
medications known or suspected to fall in the following medication categories.  A sample 
list of medications that fall into the cautionary categories mentioned below can be found 
in Appendix E.  It is not possible to produce a 100% exhaustive list of medications that 
fall into the categories, so if in question, please refer to the appropriate product label.  If 
the investigator determines that such a medication is medically necessary, the investigator 
will notify  the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor and discuss the investigator's use of these 
ABT -[ADDRESS_168859] 2007 -002143 -25
38
medications and the investigator's plans to medically  monitor the potential study  subject 
under consideration.
●CYP2C8 substrates such as glitazones and select statins (due to expected 
inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates).
●CYP2C9 substrates s uch as phen ytoin and tolbutamide (due to expected 
inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates).
●CYP3A inducers such as rifampin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (due to possible 
induction of the metabolism of ABT- 263).
If clinicall y indicated, anti -herpes and anti -PCP (Pneumocy stis carinii pneumonia) 
prophy laxis should be considered.  Although there is a potential for drug -drug 
interactions, there is likely to be limited potential clinical effects, therefore Bactrim 
(trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole) can be considered for PCP prophy laxis with close 
clinical monitoring.
A list of common medications in the excluded classifications described above is provided 
in Appendix E.  This is a partial list; all medications in these classifications are excluded.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
For subjects who continue in the Extension Study , the Final Visit, and 30 Day Safet y 
Follow -Up Visit procedures will be performed only  once upon completion of the 
Extension Study .
Study  visits may  be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic. This may  include changes 
such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit 
frequency  and timing of study  procedures, among others. Additional details are provided 
in the subsequent section. Every  effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects 
and site staff, while maintaining the integrit y of the study. If visits cannot be conducted 
onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, follow the updates 
below how to proceed.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protoco l Modifications
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, if it is not possible for all study  procedures to be 
performed as specified due to travel restrictions or other reasons, the following 
modifications are allowed:
●If permitted b y local regulations, the I RB/IEC a nd the subject, the subject 
visitsmay be conducted in the subject's home residence.
●Some study  visits and/or activities may  be performed by  [CONTACT_648]/virtually .  
These are indicated b y a hashtag (#) in the activity table ( Appendix G)
○During a virtual visit, activities that do not need to be performed are 
indicated b y a (#) in the activity table ( Appendix G).
● S tudy visits and/or activities may  be performed b y a local 
clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/laboratory. All procedures performed at local facilities must be 
performed b y appropriately  qualified personnel.
●Study  Visits and/or activities should be performed as scheduled whenever 
possible. If it is not possible to do so due to the pandemic, perform the activity  
at the earliest feasible opportunity . Laboratory  draws must be obtained within 
[ADDRESS_168908]'s legally 
acceptable representative before an y stud y-specific procedures are undertaken or before 
any prohibited medications are withheld from the su bject in order to participate in this 
study .  Informed consent is also required for the pharmacod ynamic (PD) and 
pharmacogenetic (PG) sampling portions of the study.  A separate informed consent will 
be required for subjects entering the Extension Study .  Details about how informed 
consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_168909] ance with local regulations.
Medical History
The following will be collected during the Screening Visit:
●Complete medical history, including documentation of an y clinicall y 
significant medical condition
●History  of tobacco and alcohol use
●Detailed oncology  history  including:
●Histology
●Date of cancer diagnosis
●Stage
●Any surgical procedures
●Treatments administered (including dates and t ype of modality)
At each visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and an y changes from 
baseline will be recorded on the adverse event CRF.  On C ycle 1 Day 1 (14/21 day dosing 
schedule), an y changes observed from the Screening assessments prior to dosing will be 
recorded in the subject's medical history.  During the lead -in period, any  changes from the  
ABT -[ADDRESS_168910]'s history on Lead -in 
Day 1 (21/21 day  dosing schedule).  All medication (prescription or over -the-counter, 
including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) will be recorded beginning with the 
Screening Vi sit and continuing until [ADDRESS_168911] dose of ABT -263.
Physical Examination
A phy sical examination (including weight) will be performed at Screening, Day  1 of 
Cycle 1, Day  1 of each subsequent cy cle (or within 72 hours prior), at the Final Vi sit and 
at the Safet y Follow -up Visit.  During the lead -in period (21/21 day  dosing schedule), a 
physical examination (including weight) will also be performed at Lead -in Day  1.  A 
symptom -directed ph ysical examination may  be performed weekl y through the 
first2cycles and when necessary .  Height will be measured onl y at Screening.  The 
physical examination performed at Screening will serve as the baseline ph ysical 
examination for clinical assessment.  For the Extension Study , a phy sical examination will 
beperformed at Day  1, every  4 cy cles (e.g., C ycle 4 Day  1, Cy cle 8 Day  1, etc.), Final 
Visit and at the Safet y Follow -up Visit.  Any  significant ph ysical examination findings 
after dosing will be recorded as adverse events.
Vital Signs
Body temperature (ora l or ty mpanic), blood pressure and pulse will be measured at 
Screening, Day  [ADDRESS_168912] 2 cycles, Day 1 of each subsequent 
cycle (or within 72 hours prior), at the Final Visit and at the Safet y Follow -up Visit.  
During the lead-i n period (21/21 day  dosing schedule), bod y temperature (oral), blood 
pressure and pulse will also be measured at Lead -in Day  1.  The vital signs measurements 
at Screening will serve as the baseline measurements for clinical assessment.  For the 
Extension S tudy, bod y temperature, blood pressure and pulse will be measured at Day 1, 
every  4 cy cles (e.g., Cy cle 4 Day  1, C ycle 8 Day 1, etc.), Final Visit and at the Safet y 
Follow -up Visit.
In Phase 1, blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured approximately [ADDRESS_168913] or caregiver as needed.
Platelet Count
The platelet count measu rement obtained on C ycle 1 Day  1 (pre -dose) will serve as the 
baseline for clinical assessment for the 14/21 day dosing schedule.  The platelet count 
measurement obtained on L ead-in Day  1 (pre -dose) will serve as the baseline for clinical 
assessment for th e 21/21 day  dosing schedule with lead -in period.
If platelet count on an y given day  is less than 50,000/mm3, additional platelet counts 
should be performed every day  or at the discretion of the investigator.
If a platelet transfusion is deemed necessary, a post-transfusion platelet count should be 
obtained within 10 to 60 minutes.
Platelet counts < 25,000/mm3should be confirmed the same day b y manual reading and a 
separate peripheral draw.  Additional platelet counts will be obtained from a subject if 
ABT -[ADDRESS_168914] laboratory work done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
or other facility . Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation. Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible. If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug 
administration may  be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all prior 
laboratory  results and confirms and discusses with the subject that there is no safet y 
concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current labs. 
The subject should be scheduled for laboratory  draws as soon as feasible within 14 day s 
from the scheduled visit.
The platelet count schedule of assessment may  be modified as information is obtained 
regarding the expected decrease in platelets in response to s tudy drug administration.  
This will be based upon discussion between the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical 
Monitor.
Platelet count assessments will be performed stat and assessed b y the investigator prior to 
study  drug administration as follows:
Phase 1 –14/21 Day Dosing Schedule:
Screening
Cycle 1:
●Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14 and 16 
●Platelet counts performed in Cy cle 1 can be obtained within 24 hours prior to 
the visit, except on Day s 1 and 14 when platelet counts are required at all of 
the pharmacok inetic sampling time points as indicated in Table 4and Table 5.
●As needed

5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
For the Phase 2a portion of the study , all efficacy  anal yses are exploratory  in nature.  The 
exploratory  efficacy  endpoints include tumor response (determined using NCI -WG 
Criteria), progression free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), overall 
survival (OS), duration of overall response and ECOG performance status.  Analys es of 
these endpoints are described in Section 8.1.3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] NCI-WG Criteria for Tumor Response
Only  subjects with active disease requiring treatment (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e investigator) 
will be enrolled in the study .  Response over the course of therapy  will be evaluated using 
the 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group Guidelines for Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia (NCI -WG) criteria30and the I nternational Workshop for Chronic Ly mphocy tic 
Leukemia (IWCLL) updated 2008 National Cancer Institute Working Group Guidelines 
(NCI -WG) for Chronic Ly mphocy tic Leukemia crite ria.[ADDRESS_168984] 2007 -002143 -25
82
[IP_ADDRESS].1 NCI-WG Criteria -1996
Methods of Measurement
Disease res ponse and progression will be assessed by  [CONTACT_147560], clinical 
examination, radiographic techniques when clinically  indicated (e.g., splenomegaly , 
lymphadenopathy ), and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]  (if needed to confirm active 
disease at baseline and to confirm a CR).
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closel y as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than four weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they  are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable l ymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is required.
The diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in each of the following sites 
should be measured:  cervical, axillary, supraclavicular, inguinal, and femoral.
CT is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.  MRI  
may be used if medically indicated (e.g., severe contrast alle rgy).  Conventional CT and 
MRI  should be performed with cuts of 7 mm or less in slice thickness contiguousl y.
For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions.  However, US is a possible alternative to clinical measurements of 
superficial palpable l ymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thy roid nodules.  US might 
also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually 
assessed b y clinical examination.

Cytology  and histology  can be used to differentiate between partial remission (PR) and 
complete remission (CR) in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate between 
residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor ty pes such as germ cell 
tumors).
Assessment o f response will be performed b y the investigator and documented on the 
appropriate CRF.

●Platelets > l00,000/ L or 50% improvement over baseline.
●Hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline without 
transfusions.
Progressive Disease (PD) requires at least one of the following :
1. ≥ 50% increase in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes on 
twoconsecutive determination s 2 weeks apart (at least one node must be ≥ 2 cm);

●Requirement for palliative radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy  
or biologics
●Death from disease progression
5.3.4 Safety  Variables
The following safet y evaluations will be performed during the stud y:  adverse event 
monitoring, vital signs, phy sical examination, platelet counts, ly mphocy te enumeration, 
ECG, echocardiogram, and laboratory assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT -263, including the maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max(peak time, T max), the terminal 
phase elimination rate constant ( ), terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2), the area under the 
plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) for the dose 
on C1D1 in Phase 1 will be determined using noncompartmental methods.  For C1D14 in 
Phase 1, values will be determined for C max, Tmaxand AUC from time 0 to 8 hours 
(AUC 0-
8).
5.3.[ADDRESS_169000]'s response to 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169001] for drug res ponse.
5.3.7 Pharmacody namic Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy  and response will be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between drug concentration and disease status.
Examination of the proteomic profiles of pati ents in the ABT- 263 clinical trials may  
reveal patterns of protein/peptide concentrations that may be further evaluated in future 
clinical studies to determine an y prognostic value and any correlation with clinical 
response.  Plasma samples will be analyze d for predictive or drug -responsive proteomic 
markers.  In addition circulating tumor -derived DNA or RNA may  be extracted from 
plasma and assessed for expression or methy lation and mutational status of genes relevant 
to either the disease status or ABT -263mechanism of action.
In the event that an y plasma or serum samples are unused, remaining samples will be 
banked for use in diagnostic test development efforts.  Measurement of relevant RNAs 
and proteins including the Bcl -2 famil y members in CLL cells in t he blood, pre -treatment, 
during therap y and at time of relapse, may be examined for putative stratification markers 
for correlation with efficacy.  Additional studies may  include determination of the 
Bcl-2/Bim ratio at the mitochondrial level, a highly pre dictive marker of sensitivity  to the 
Bcl-2 family  inhibitors.  For sites in Australia, additional studies may  include assay s to 
measure in vivo apoptosis and in vitro studies of patient CLL cell sensitivity to ABT -263.
Fluorescent In -situHybridization (FI SH) may  be conducted on CLL whole blood samples 
from patients participating in this study  to assess amplifications and translocations in the 
Bcl-[ADDRESS_169002] from the study at an y time if the investigator 
considers it necessary  for any  reason including:
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject's response to therapy is unsatisfactory, as evidenced b y 
progression of disease.
●The subject experiences toxicities that require more than a 3 -week dose 
interruption.
●The subject requires more than two dose reductions, in the abse nce of 
objective response to ABT -263.
●The subject requires radiotherap y, cancer -related surgery , or alternate 
anti-neoplastic agents during the stud y period.
●The subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding.
●The occurrence of an adverse event that precludes further investigational drug 
administration.
●Noncompliance with the protocol.
●The subject requires anti -coagulant or anti- platelet therapy  during the stud y 
period.
In addition, subjects in the Extension Study  may  also be discontinued for followi ng 
reasons:
●The Extension Study  has been ongoing for 11years since the transition of the 
last subject into the Extension Study .
●ABT -[ADDRESS_169003] 2007 -002143 -25
95
●[COMPANY_013] no longer pursues ABT -[ADDRESS_169004]
from the study  for a reason other than "planned per protocol," to ensure all acceptable 
mitigation steps have been explored.
All subjects will be included for anal ysis of safety data.  Subjects in the Phase 1 portion of 
the study  who withdraw from the stu dy will not be replaced unless they  are not evaluable.  
Evaluable subjects are defined as those subjects who:
● Experience a DLT
●Complete at least 80% of dosing in the first cycle (of either 14/21 or 21/21 day 
dosing schedule)
In the event that a subject wi thdraws or is discontinued from the stud y, reason(s) for the 
discontinuation from the study  will be recorded.  A phy sical examination, ECG, 
echocardiogram, vital signs measurement, laboratory  anal yses, performance status 
assessment, collection of unused st udy drug, an assessment of adverse events and tumor 
assessment (if needed) will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from 
the study .
A Safet y Follow -up Visit should be performed for all subjects approximately  [ADDRESS_169005] will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the 
adverse event(s) is achieved.  If the subject refuses a follow- up visit or the visit is not 
performed, t he reason should be noted in the subject's source documentation.

written notice is submitted at a reasonable time in advance of the intended termination.  
The following procedures for discontinuation will be followed:
●If the sponsor has decided to prematurel y discontinue the study , the sponsor 
will promptly  notify  in writing the investigator as well as regulatory  authorities 
of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The investigator must promptly  notify  the IRB/IEC and give detailed rea sons 
for the discontinuation.
●The investigator must promptly  notify  the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen, if applicable, b y other appropriate regimens.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Co ntrol Groups
Phase 1
For the Phase 1 portion of the study, the experimental design is an adaptation of the 
continual reassessment method (CRM).  The CRM is expected to locate the MTD 
efficientl y.  The MTD is defined as the dose at which 30% of subjects exp erience a DLT 
during the first cy cle.  The CRM attempts to estimate the target MTD from a continuum 
of doses, whereas a fixed design merel y selects a dose from a discrete set.  If the true 
target dose is not among the choices set out in advance b y fixed de signs, they  can onl y 
approximate it.  A CRM based design uses a statistical model for dose and toxicity  by 
[CONTACT_147570].  Simulations and 
literature have shown that compared to the conventional fixed 3 +3 design, the CRM 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y requires fewer subjects to find the MTD, does not greatl y overshoot the MTD 
(that is, subjects are not expected to be treated with dangerousl y high doses), and does not 
greatl y underestimate the MTD.
During Phase 1, this study will employ  a CRM design.32,33  Dosing with ABT- 263 will 
begin at 10 mg with a cohort of three subjects.  The study  drug dose will be escalated to 
the CRM estimated MTD, not to exceed an increase of more than 100 mg or 40% increase 
from the current dose level.  A minimum of three subjects will be treated per dose level to 
account for potential inter -subject variability .  The study  design will be based on the 
concept of entering every subject at the best current statistical estimation of the MTD 
given the previous observations.  The dose escalat ion strategy  will be based on a dose and 
probability  of DLT response model.  The model will be adjusted using all of the available 
data and a new estimate of MTD will be projected from the updated model.  There are no 
control groups in this study . 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169020] 2007 -002143 -25
104
Phase 2a
The Phase 2a portion of the study  will be open -label at the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RPTD) and dosing schedule.  The RPTD will be defined b y observed DLTs and/or 
determination of MTD from the Phase [ADDRESS_169021]'s baseline platelet 
count, history  of bleeding or active bleeding, coagulation parameters, CNS metastasis, 
ongoing immune thrombocy topenic purpura, and transplant history .
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The starting dose in this Phase 1/2a trial is derived from the results obtained in the 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169022] dosage used in the 1 -month rat 
study  (10 mg/kg/day ) and the second -lowest dosage used in the 1 -month dog study  
(3mg/kg/day ).  Although mild changes in platelets were noted in the rats and mild to 
moderate changes in platelets and lymphocy tes were noted in dogs at these doses, the 
degree of platelet and l ymphocyte decrease was well tolerated.  At all dosages, the 
decrease in platelets was readil y reversible upon discontinuation of ABT -263.  
Additionally , at the dosages of 10 mg/kg/day  in the rat or 3 mg/kg/day  in the dog, 
platelets returned to baseline or near baseline values in the face of continued dosing.  
Given th e ability  to monitor the anticipated dose -limiting toxicity  (thrombocy topenia) and 
the intended subject population, the safet y factor of [ADDRESS_169023] variability when extrapolating between species.  The 
conversion of the 10 mg/kg dose in rats and the 3 mg/kg dose in dogs to the human 
equivalent dose of approximately  [ADDRESS_169024] that the proposed dose 
of 10 mg taken once daily to a 60 kg human would be expected to produce at stead y state 
a C maxin plasma of 0.2 g/mL and an AUC over a dosing interval (AUC 24) of 
2.6g
•hr/mL.  These predicted values are below those concentrations that resulted in a 
No-Obs erved- Adverse -Effect -Level (NOAEL) in the dog or a tolerated dose in the rat.  
An AUC value of at least 53 g
•hr/mL -88 g•hr/mL  is projected to provide an efficacious 
concentration.  Subsequent to the 10 mg dose, the study  drug dose will be escalated to th e 
estimated MTD not to exceed an increase of 100 mg or a 40% increase from the current 
dose level, whichever is greater.
Phase [ADDRESS_169025] 30% rate of DLT according to the model.  The design 
is adaptive because at each d ose level, the model will be updated using all of the previous 
available data and a new estimate of MTD will be projected from the updated model.  
Aminimum of three subjects will be enrolled to warrant reasonable accuracy for the 
estimates.  The modeling process provides flexibility  so that the new estimated MTD may  
be escalated or decreased from the previous dose.  The design continues in this fashion by 
[CONTACT_147571].  When the next predicted 
MTD is withi n 10% of the current dose, the model is considered to have converged and 
MTD will be declared.  However, dose -determination will stop if the predetermined 
sample size of subjects is reached, based on operational considerations. 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169026] 2007 -002143 -25
106
Once either the MTD is defin ed or dosing in the 4th dose level is completed for the 
14/[ADDRESS_169027], a continuous dosing schedule will be 
assessed.  Dosing with ABT -263 under the continuous dosing schedule (21/21 day ) will 
begin at the dose estimated to provide exposure equivalent to the highest dosing level 
cleared (4thdose level) or the MTD from the 14/21 day schedule.
The starting dose for continuous dosing will be determined by  [CONTACT_147572] a dose of 
equivalent exposure from a 14/21 day  schedule t o a 21/21 day  schedule (MTD 14)/21.  
For example if the highest tolerated dose is determined to be 375 mg then ABT- 263 will 
be dosed at 250 mg once daily  (375 mg 14/21 = 250 mg).
A 7 day  period of dosing with a lead -in dose of ABT -263 will be explored with the 
21/21 day dosing schedule in order to interrogate whether higher doses may then be given 
with overall less reduction in platelet counts.  Subjects will begin dosing at 100 mg on 
Lead -in Day  1 (LD1).  This is the dose level at which a mean maximal platelet drop of 
approximately  60% from baseline with recovery  during 14 day s of continued dosing is 
expected based on observations in this study  to date.  The lead -in titration dose may  be 
adjusted if the defined dose level fails to significantly mitigate ABT -263-induced 
thrombocy topenia following the lead -in period or the defined dose level results in 
significant occurrence of DLT in the lead -in period.

sign/sy mptom, severity , time course, outcome, relationship of the adverse event to study  
drug, and an y action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events not considered "probably  
related" to study  drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For 
adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and

reported spontaneously  by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and u nintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events 
only if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic medical 
intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.7regarding toxicity  
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a preexisting condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169029] 2007 -002143 -25
108
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147528] (e.g., for I.V. h ydration) will not be 
captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), unless there is an additional reason for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147529].
A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with onset or 
worsening report ed by a subject from the time that the first dose of study drug is 
administered until [ADDRESS_169030] elapsed following discontinuation of study drug 
administration.
6.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be r eported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_169031]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to 
an outpatient facilit y.
Congenital Anomaly An anomal y detected at or after bi rth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability  is not intended to include experiences of 
relativel y minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle). 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169032] and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent an y 
of the outcomes liste d above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatme nt 
in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Spontaneous Abortion Miscarriage experienced by  [CONTACT_147573].
Elective Abortion Elective abortion performed on study  subject.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 
(NCI CTCAE).[ADDRESS_169033] the change in sev erity.  For 
all reported serious adverse events that increase in severit y, the supplemental eCRFs 
(paper CRFs for the Extension Study ) also need to be updated to reflect the change in 
severit y.
For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_147574], the following 
should be used:
Grade 1 (Mild) The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by [CONTACT_1560].
Grade 2 (Moderate) The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts 
the subject's usual activities. 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169034] 2007 -002143 -25

Grade 3/4 (Severe) The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may  be incapacitating or 
life-threatening.
Grade [ADDRESS_169035].
6.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Probably Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study  
drug or recurs on re -challenge and an Other cause of event is 
unlikely  or signific antly less likely .
Possibly Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the 
study  drug and an Other cause of event is equall y or less likely  
compared to the potential relationship to study  drug.
Probably Not 
RelatedAn adverse event ha s little or no temporal relationship to the 
study  drug and/or a more likely  Other cause of event exists.
Not Related An adverse event is due to an underl ying or concurrent illness 
or effect of another drug and is not related to the study drug 
(e.g., has n o temporal relationship to study  drug or has a much 
more likely  Other cause of event).
For causality  assessments, events meeting the categories of probabl y or possibly  will be 
considered "associated."  Events that are probabl y not or not related will be considered 
"not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or 
deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_147530] , probabl y not, or not related to study drug is given, 
an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_147575]. 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169036] will be collected onl y if they  are 
considered b y the investigator to be causally related to the study required procedures.
For subjects in the Extension Study , all adverse events that occur after Day  1 visit in the 
Extension Study  should be captured in the Extension Study  paper Case Report Forms.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 5.

COVID- 19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the event meets the criteria 
for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the 
protocol and above.  The following COVID -19 related supplemental eCRFs should be 
completed:
● COVID- 19 Supplemental Signs/sy mptoms
● COVID- [ADDRESS_169038]'s partner should become pregnant during the study, this 
should also be reported and data may  be collected.
Pregnan cy in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_169039] 2007 -002143 -25
114
the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor and may be considered as dose limiting.  
Any of the following events, which are considered possibly  or probabl y related to the 
administration of ABT -263, will be considered a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT ).
●Thrombocy topenia:
○Grade 4 thrombocy topenia (< 25,000/mm3)
●Platelet counts < 25,000/mm3should be confirmed the same day b y manual 
reading and a separate peripheral draw.  If the repeat platelet count is 
≥25,000/mm3, this will not be considered a DLT.  If the repeat platelet count 
cannot be obtained within the same day  as the initial measurement of 
<25,000/mm3, then the initial measurement will constitute a DL T.
●Grade 2 or higher bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia
●All other Grade 3, 4 or 5 advers e events will be considered a DLT.  Exceptions 
include:
○Grade 3, 4 Afebrile Neutropenia less than 7 days
○Grade 3, 4 Leukopenia
○Grade 3, 4 Lymphopenia
○Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea unless unresponsive to treatment
○Grade 2 toxicity  that requires dose modification or delay  of > 1 week, will 
be considered a DLT (e.g., peripheral neuropath y)
Any DLT will require an interruption and possible discontinuation of ABT -263.  
ABT -263 may  be reintroduced, but only  at a reduced dose, if the toxicity grade re turns to 
Grade 1 or to baseline if Grade 2 at stud y entr y.  Following a DLT of thrombocytopenia, 
ABT -263 may  be reintroduced, but only  at a reduced dose, if the platelet toxicity  grade 
returns to Grade 2 ( ≥ 50,000/mm3).  Any  reduced dose level will be jointly  defined by  
[CONTACT_147577].  The dose may  be increased thereafter 
upon joint determination of the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor.  This dose 
is not to exceed the highest tolerated dose level.
For the Phase [ADDRESS_169040] 2007 -002143 -25
115
[COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor, as appropriate.  These decisions will be driven by [CONTACT_147578].
6.7.2 Management of Thrombocytopenia
ABT -263 induces apoptosis, rather than l ysis, of circulating platelets, which differs from 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_147531].
All decisions regarding continued ABT- 263 dosing for individual subjects will be 
determined b y the investigator, in conjunction with the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor, as 
appropriate.  These decisions should be guided b y the following:
Administration of ABT- 263 will be interrupted or d iscontinued for:
●Any pre-dose platelet count < 25,000/mm3
●Any clinically  significant bleeding, defined as Grade [ADDRESS_169041]'s platelet count is 
≥50,000/mm3.  The dose may be increased (not to exceed the highest tolerated dose) 
thereafter upon joint determination of the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor and the investigator.
After an y Grade 4 platel et count < 25,000/ mm3is observed for the first time in a subject, 
serial PK samples will be collected.  PK samples will be collected as soon as possible 
after the Grade [ADDRESS_169042] beneficial effects in treating acute thrombocy topenia following oral 
dosing with ABT -263.
If platelet transfusions are required in response to active bleeding, dosing of ABT -263 
should be suspended.  It should be noted that platelet response with transfusions may not 
follow ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_147532].  Procedures consistent with local institutional blo od banking 
guidelines regarding platelet transfusions should be followed.
Platelet Transfusion Recommendations:
If a platelet transfusion is deemed necessary, the treating ph ysician should be aware of the 
following:
●Due to the rapid apoptotic effect of ABT -[ADDRESS_169043] -transfusion may  be smaller and the duration of 
response may  be shorter.  For this reason, donor platelets collected as recently  
as possible prior to transfusion should be considered.
●A post -transfusion platelet count should be obtained within 10 to 60 minutes.
●Additional transfusions may  be necessary  to achieve the desired platelet 
response.
6.7.3 Management of Ly mphopenia
There is a potential for clinically  significant l ymphopenia in this study .  If clinically 
indicated, anti -infective prophy laxis should be implemented at the investigator's 
discretion, including appropriate proph ylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocy stis 
carinii pneumonia (PCP) infections.  Potential for drug -drug interact ions should be 
considered.  See Appendix Efor a description of excluded and cautionary medications.
6.7.4 Management of Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
There is a potential for tumor lysis in subjects with various tumor ty pes in the presence of 
the following risk factors:  bulky disease, elevated pre -treatment LDH levels, elevated  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169044] 2007 -002143 -25
117
leukocy te count and dehy dration.  Adequate hy dration, careful monitoring of laboratory  
values and an agent to reduce the uric acid level should be considered for subjects at high 
risk during the Lead- in and subsequent cy cles.  Please discuss with the [COMPANY_013] Medical 
Monitor, as appropriate.
6.7.5 Determination of the MTD
The MTD is defi ned as the dose at which 30% of subjects experience a DLT during the 
first cy cle.  At each dose level, MTD will be estimated based on actual observations from 
subjects to construct a dose and toxicity  rate model using the maximum likelihood 
method.  As dat a accumulate and the reassessment continues, the MTD will be determined 
based on the convergence criteria described in Section 5.6.4.  The recommended Phase 2 
dose (RPTD) will be defined by  [CONTACT_147579]/or determination of MTD.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when 
necessary  to eliminate an immediate hazard to study  subjects.  The investigator is 
responsible for comply ing with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and 
applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is 
identified, including those that may  be due to the COVID -19 pandemic), the investig ator 
is responsible for notifying independent ethics committee (I EC)/independent review board 
(IRB), regulatory  authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

Frequencies and percentages will be provided for gender and race.
Treatment Allocation
One of the objectives of the Phase 1 portion of this study  is to determine the MTD, and 
the dose allocation process will be conducted according to a continual reassessment 
method (CRM).35,36,37  A two -parameter logistic regression model will be employ ed to 
characterize dose and toxi city rate relationship.  A prior model based on preclinical and 
clinical data will be employ ed to estimate doses with approximately  30% and 90% 
probability  of inducing a DL T.  The MTD is the dose that reflects a 30% rate of DLT.  
The dose associated with 9 0% DLT rate will be incorporated for future model fitting to 
stabilize the high dose -toxicity  portion of the model.  For each subject, the response will 
be defined as 0 (no DLT event) or 1 (DLT).  Along with the actual observed data, 
10imputed subjects wi ll be added with 9 subjects having DLT and 1 without DL T at the 
dose associated with 90% DLT rate.  A small weight of 0.[ADDRESS_169047] a small degree of certainty, and at the same time to stabilize the 
model fitting process as shown in the simulations.  To estimate the dose corresponding to 
approximately 30% probability  of inducing DLT, one out of the three subjects in the 
160mg dosing cohort from the M06- [ADDRESS_169048] 2007 -002143 -25

0.083 assigne d to these prior data.  For the actual observations, a unity  weight will be 
assigned.  The maximum likelihood method will be employed to estimate the parameters 
and probability  of DLT within the framework of the logistic regression analy sis.  The 
fitted model will be inverted to estimate the target dose associated with 30% chance of 
DLT, or the MTD.  The next cohort of subjects will then be assigned to the projected 
MTD and evaluated.  The outcome will be incorporated to update the logistic regression 
model using all the cumulative information.  The design will continue to adapt data from 
current results and assign subjects to the projected MTD until the target dose changes by 
[CONTACT_21316] 10%, or a sample size of 40 subjects is reached.  Simulations to compare the 
conventional fixed 3+3 design and the CRM based design are provided in Appendix F.
8.1.2 Pharmacokinetics
[IP_ADDRESS] Tabulations and Summary  Statistics
Plasma concentrations of ABT -[ADDRESS_169049] and each dose level, and summary statistics will be computed 
for each sampling time and each parameter.
[IP_ADDRESS] Model and Tests
Dose Proportionality
For subjects who participate in the Phase 1 14/21 day  dosing portion of the study , an 
analysis will be performed on pharmacokinetic variables for C1D1 dose to simultaneously  
explore for demographic variables that explain some of the variability  in 
pharmacokinetics and to address questions of dose proportionality  and linear kinetics.  An 
analysis will be performed for dose -normalized C max, Tmax, and dose -normalized AUC t 
(AUC 0-24), provided that they can be adequately determined from the data.  The model 
used for the statistical analyses will include dose level.  This may be done by [CONTACT_147580], if appropriate, using dose level as a continuous variable.  
Covariates such as age, body  weight, bod y surface area, gender, and potentially 
formulation (if applicable), as well as others that might explain some of the variability in  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169050] 2007 -002143 -25
121
the population will be included in the model initially.  However, a covariate may b e 
dropped from the model if the regression coefficient is not significant at level 0.10.  The 
natural logarithmic transformation will be employed for C maxand AUC tunless the data 
clearl y indicate that other transformation or the untransformed variable pro vides more 
nearl y symmetric probability  distributions and/or more nearly  homogenous variances 
across dose levels.  Within the framework of the model, tests that have good power for a 
trend with dose will be performed on the effect of dose level.
A correspo nding anal ysis will also be performed on pharmacokinetic variables of the dose 
on C1D14 for both the Phase 1 14/21 and 21/21 day  dosing schedules.  The variables will 
include dose -normalized C max, Tmax, and dose -normalized AUC t(AUC 0-8).
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Missing Values and Model Violations
The possibility  of bias from missing data of subjects who prematurely  discontinue will be 
addressed.  Normall y values of pharmacokinetic variables (C max, AUC, etc.) will be 
determined without replacing missing individual concentration values, simply using the 
available data, and if necessary  doing the analy sis with some missing values for a 
pharmacokinetic variable.  However, missing concentration values for isolated individual 
blood samples may  be replaced (imputed) if such might affect stud y conclusions or 
meaningfully  affect point estimates.
8.1.3 Exploratory  Efficacy
The following exploratory efficacy  anal yses will be performed on the data collected from 
the Phase 2a portion of the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression- Free Survival
The distribution of PFS will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier methodology .  Median time 
to PFS and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated. 
ABT -[ADDRESS_169051] was still taking study drug or had previously discontinued 
study  drug.  Events of death will be inc luded for subjects who had not experienced disease 
progression provided the death occurred within 2 cycles (42 days) of the date of the last 
available tumor evaluation.  If a subject has not experienced an event of disease 
progression or death as defined a bove, then the subject's data will be censored at the date 
of the last available evaluation for disease progression.  The date of the last available 
evaluation will be the date of the last study visit at which a tumor assessment was 
performed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Re sponse Rate
The proportion of subjects with a complete remission (CR), complete remission with 
incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi) or partial remission (PR) based on the NCI -WG 
criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be estimated and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval for the proportion will be constructed.  The exact binomial distribution will be 
used to construct this confidence interval.
Asubject will be classi fied as a complete remission (CR), complete remission with 
incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi), partial remission (PR) or as having PD based on 
the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  The objective response rate (CR, CRi, PR ) will be 
computed for all subjects with active disease at baseline (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]).
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Tumor Progression
Time to tumor progression for a given subject will be defined as the number of day s from 
the date the subject started study  drug to the date of the subject's tumor progression .  Time 
to tumor progression may be collected up to 2 cy cles (42 day s) following the date of the 
last available tumor evaluation.  All events of tumor progression will be included,  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169052] study  visit at which a tumor assessment was 
performed.
The distribution of the time to tumor progression will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
methodology .  Median time to tumor progression and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be estimated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
Time to death for a given subject will be defined as the number of day s from the date the 
subject started study drug to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be 
included, regardless of whether the event occu rred while the subject was still taking study  
drug, or after the subject discontinued study  drug.  If a subject has not died, then the data 
will be censored at the date of the last study visit, the last contact [CONTACT_568], or the date the 
subject was last known to be alive, whichever is last.  The date of the last study  visit will 
be determined b y selecting the last available date of the following stud y procedures for a 
subject:  phy sical examination, vital signs assessment, blood chemistry , hematology , and 
urina lysis collection.
The distribution of the time to death will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier methodology .  
Median survival time and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Overall Response
The duration of overall response f or a given subject will be defined as the number of day s 
from the day  the criteria are met for CR, CRi or PR(whichever is recorded first) to the 
date that PD is objectively documented.  The reference for PD will be the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started.  Ifa subject is still responding then the 
subject's data will be censored at the last stud y visit at which a tumor assessment was 
performed.

The distribution of the duration of overall response will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier 
Methodology .
[IP_ADDRESS] ECOG Performance Status
For the ECOG performance scale, descriptive statistics will be summarized for each 
assessment.  In addition, a mean change from baseline to each assessment will be 
summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Results
All subjects enrolled will be assessed for response to treatment based on the NCI -WG 
criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Each subject will be assigned to one of the follo wing 
categories:  1) complete remission, 2) complete remission with incomplete bone marrow 
recovery , 3) partial remission, 4) stable disease, 5) progressive disease, 6) early death 
from malignant disease, 7) earl y death from toxicity , 8) earl y death becaus e of other 
cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).
Subjects in response categories 5 -8 will be considered as failing to respond to treatment 
(disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration will 
not res ult in exclusion from the anal ysis of a response.
Sub-analyses may  be performed on the subset of subjects for whom major protocol 
deviations have not been reported (e.g., earl y discontinuation of treatment, major protocol 
violations, etc.).  The reasons fo r excluding subjects from the anal ysis will be clearly  
reported.

subject completes one cycle of drug, and prior to enrollment of subjects into the Phase 2a 
portion of the study .  A second safet y anal ysis will be performed for all subjects in the  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169055] 2007 -002143 -25
125
Phase 1 and Phase 2a portions of the study  upon completion of the study .  The following 
will be included in these anal yses:
Adverse Events
The number and percentage of subjects having treatment -emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated b y MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.38  The tabulations will also 
be provided with further breakdowns b y NC I CTCAE toxicity  grade and relationship to 
study  drug.  Serious adverse events, events leading to discontinuation of treatm ent, and 
events leading to death, will be summarized.  For subjects who participate in Cycle 1 of 
Phase 1 of the stud y, all summaries will be done by [CONTACT_2715].  For the stud y as a whole, 
summaries will be provided with a breakdown as appropriate.
Platelet Coun ts
Platelet counts will be explored for trends with dose and time and summarized as 
appropriate.  The baseline value (last measurement before the beginning of study  drug 
administration) will be included in the statistical analy sis and changes from baseline will 
be addressed.
A repeated measures model with dose level as a classification variable will be performed 
for values in C ycle 1 of the platelet counts for which multiple measurements will be 
taken.  A transformation of a variable will be used if it clea rly provides more nearl y 
symmetric probability  distribution and/or more nearly  homogenous variances across dose 
levels.
The relationship between drug concentration variables and platelet counts will be 
explored.  The dependence of observations from the same subject will be appropriatel y 
taken into account in all of the above anal yses.
Other Safety Measurements
Laboratory test results, lymphocy te enumeration results, vital signs, echocardiogram 
results, and ECG interval measurements results will be explored for trends with dose and  
ABT -[ADDRESS_169056] 2007 -002143 -25
126
time and summarized as appropriate.  The baseline values (Screening values) will be 
included in the statistical anal ysis and changes from baseline will be addressed.  Changes 
from baseline at the recommended Phase 2a dose will be a nalyzed with a t-test at each 
scheduled visit.  Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology  determinations will 
be categorized according to NCI  CTCAE (Version 3.0) grades, and shifts from baseline 
NCI CTCAE grades to maximum and final post -baseline gr ades for each treatment group 
will be assessed.  Vital signs values will be evaluated for possible clinical significance 
using criteria developed at [COMPANY_013].  Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and 
appropriate.

enrollment numbers historically used for the testing of new oncology compounds.
During the dose -toxicity  modeling process, a minimum of three subjects per cohort will 
be inclu ded to warrant reasonable accuracy  for the estimates.  The total number of 
subjects required for the Phase 1 portion of this study will depend upon the toxicities 
observed as the trial progresses.  The total number of subjects for Phase 1 is not likely to 
exceed 40 based on operational considerations.  For the Phase 2a portion of the study, 
approximately  32 subjects with relapsed disease was chosen to further characterize safet y 
and assess preliminary  evidence of efficacy  with the RPTD in this population.

Appendix F. Simulations Comparing Fixed 3+3 Design Versus CRM- based 
Design
Introduction
Simulations were conducted to compare a fixed 3+3 design to a design based on a specific 
continual reassessment method (CRM).  Designs were compared with respect to total 
sample size required, closeness of the design -determined MTD to the true MTD, and 
number of subjects treated at doses that are potentially 'too high' (e.g. ,doses with a > 90% 
chance of resulting in a DL T).  Two families of dose -toxic ity curves were considered, 
onerepresenting a "steep" dose -toxicity  response curve and another representing a 
"shallow" dose -toxicity  curve.
The CRM -based method provided essentially uniformly better results than the fixed 
3+3design.  That is, for each s imulated dose -toxicity  relationship, the CRM design 
generall y required fewer total subjects, resulted in an estimated MTD closer to the true 
MTD, and treated fewer subjects at potentially toxic doses, compared to the fixed 
3+3design.
The following section s describe the stud y designs, the simulations, and the performance 
of each design in the simulations.

Fixed 3+3 Design
The following steps describe the dose allocation scheme for the simulated fixed 
3+3designs.
●Three simulated subjects treated at the initial dose (10 m g).
●If no DLTs, double the dose.
●Proceed similarly until the first DLT is observed.
●If 1/3 DLT, enroll 3 more subjects at the same dose.
●If 1/6 DLT, increase dose by 33%.
●If > 1/6 DLTs decrease dose by 25%.
●If 2/3 or 3/3 DLTs, decrease dose b y 25%.
●Upon dose decrease:
●If 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, this is the MTD
●If > 1 DLT, dose decrease by  25% and repeat.
●If 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, this is the MTD.
●If > [ADDRESS_169092] dose with 0/3 or 1/6 DL Ts
CRM Design
Three simulated subjects are treated at a dos e of 10 mg.  Data from these 3 subjects (for 
each subject, DLT or no DLT) are combined with 13 imputed values.  Ten values are 
imputed at a very  high dose (2000 mg):  [ADDRESS_169093] 
90%, and they  were assigned a weight of 0.025, so that they collectivel y represent 
one-fourth of one subject.  Three values are imputed at a dose of 160 mg: 1 observation 
with a DLT and two observations without a DLT.  These 3 values represent data borrowed 
from Study  M06 -814, in which 1/[ADDRESS_169094] 2007 -002143 -25
152
essentially  a step function, which generally  does not allow the CRM to converge to the 
MTD.
A 2-parameter logistic r egression model is fitted to the data as described above, and the 
next dose is chosen to be at the model -estimated MTD (the dose predicted to result in a 
30% probability  of DLT, "D30").  If the predicted dose is more than 100 mg above the 
current dose, the new dose is escalated b y 100 mg or less.
When the next predicted D30 value is within 5% of the current dose, the model is 
considered to have converged and the MTD is declared.
Simulation Details
Two families of dose -toxicity  relationships were considered:   one with a steep slope 
Figure 1) and one with a shallow slope (Figure 2).  Parameters were chosen so that a total 
of 7 dose -toxicity  curves for each famil y were assessed, spanning the expected dynamic 
range of ABT -263 doses.  Thus, the fixed 3+3 design w as compared to the CRM -based 
design in 14 different scenarios.  In each scenario, 1000 simulations of each design were 
conducted and the following characteristics were summarized:
●Estimated MTD (median, IQR)
●True DLT probabilities associated with the estimated MTD (median, IQR)
●Sample size (median, interquartile range [IQR])
●Subjects dosed above D90 (median)

Figure 2. Shallow Dose -toxicity Relationships
Results
Results for simulations of the steep dose -toxicity  relationships are summarized in Table 1.  
The CRM design consistently  resulted in better estimates of the MTD.  The median 
estimated MTD ranged from D12 to D35, whereas the fixed design consistently  
underestimated the true MTD (median estimated MT D values ranged from < D01 to 
D25).  The CRM design also had an advantage in total number of subjects required, 
especiall y for dose -toxicity  relationships with a lower true MTD.  For higher true MTDs, 
the sample size advantage disappeared due to the restriction on the maximum dose 
increase (100 mg, see Methods).  Finall y, the CRM design generally dosed a smaller 
number of subjects above the D90.0%20%40%60%80%100%

Section 3.0  Introduction
Subsection ABT -263 Clinical Data
Add:  new fourth paragraph
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects receiving ABT -263may be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected.  
Management of these adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/r isk.  However, based on the population and disease being 
studied, and the anticipation that COVI D-19 related risks are not expected to differ 
substantially  between study  subjects and the broader population of subjects receiving 
treatment for CLL ,no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is 
expected.

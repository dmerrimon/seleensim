Study Design:   
This is a phase 3b single arm, open label, multicenter study describing the percentage of time 
pediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet  response w hile receiving romiplostim, defined as a 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and in the absence of ITP rescue medications  in the past [ADDRESS_1087106] 1 prior ITP therapy (exclud ing 
romiplostim) or are ineligible for ITP  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
The study design consists of a 4 -week screening period,  up to  a 3-year treatment period, an end 
of treatment (EOT) visit , and an end of study (EOS) visit.  
Sample Size:   Approximately [ADDRESS_1087107] Eligibility Criteria:  
Eligible pediatric subjects diagnosed with ITP according to the American Society of Hematology  
(ASH)  guidelines  (Neunert et al, 2011) must have thrombocytopenia ( defined as a platelet count 
≤ 30 x 109/L) or have bleeding that is uncontr olled with conventional therapy  within [ADDRESS_1087108] Dosage and Administration:   
Investigational product will be administered as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of 
romiplostim will be 1 µg/kg based on the subject’s recorded screening weight  in the clinic by a 
qualified healthcare provider .  Throughout the treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic 
for platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.  
Weekly dose increases will be made in increments of 1 µg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 
10 µg/kg, in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L.  Dose adjustments will be 
allowed to maintain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L.  Subjects who 
receive their first 8 doses in clinic and achieve a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without romiplostim 
dose adjustments for [ADDRESS_1087109] presentation, dose, administration, and 
dose adjustments, please see Section 6. 
Control Group:  The study design does not include a control arm . 
Procedures:    
At specified time points , subjects will undergo the following assessments:  informed consent  (and 
assent, if applicable), confirmation of  ITP diagnosis, ITP and medical history, physical exam 
including weight and vital signs.  Subjects will have complete blood counts  with differentials , 
blood chemistry profiles, local platelet counts , and a blood or urine pregnancy test for female s of 
child-bearing potential.  Research staff will document the use of concomitant and rescue 
medications and all adverse events reported for the subject.  Subjects will also provide blood 
samples for anti -TPO/romiplostim antibodies and peripheral blood smears.   
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7 and Table 2. 
Statistical Considerations:   
The primary analys is will be descriptive.  No formal hypothesis will be tested.  Summary statistics 
will be provided for the primary and secondary endpoints.  Categorical data will be presented in 
the form of number and percentage.  Continuous data will be provided with the de scriptive 
statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, Q1 [25th percentile], Q3 [75th percentile], 
minimum, and maximum).  The analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints will be based on the set 
of subjects receiving at least one dose of romiplostim.  Product:

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low circulating platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and decreased platelet production.  Historically, the 
low circulating platelet counts were attributed to antibodies binding to platelet antigens, 
resulting in destruction of platelets in the reticuloendothelial system , primarily the spleen 
(Bottiger and Westerholm, 1972; McMillan, 1981; Kelton  and Gibbons, 1982; 
George  et al, 1995).   However, a recent international consensus report suggests that a 
more complex disease process is present in which impair ed platelet production may play 
an important role in the disease ( Provan et al, 2010) .  Thrombocytopenia, as a result of 
ITP, places patients at risks for bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding, and, more seriously , 
intracranial hemorrhage.   
The annual incidence of ITP among children in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe is estimated between 19 and 64 cases/million population, with a peak incidence between Product:

 ages  2 and 10 and affecting boys and girls equally ( Terrell et al, 2010; Glanz  et al, 2008; 
Tarantino,  2006; Zeller et al, 2000; Lilleyman, 1999).  
Treatment guidelines for ITP have been published by [CONTACT_789422] (ASH) ITP study group, ( Neunert et al, 2011), the British Committee for 
Standards in Hematology and General Hematology Task Force ( BCSH, 2003 ) and an 
International ITP consensus group ( Provan et al, 2010).   Guidelines from these groups 
review and provide recommendations on the diagnosis, management and treatment 
options for ITP s ubjects.  
Unlike adult ITP in which the majority of cases are chronic in duration, pediatric ITP most 
commonly occurs in the acute form (platelet count < 150 x 109/L for < 6 months from 
diagnosis), accounting for 70 % to 80% of ITP cases in children ( Glanz et al, 2008 ).  
Many children with acute ITP require no treatment, and in approximately 60% to 75% of 
cases, the thrombocytopenia resolves within 2 to 4 months regardless of therapy 
(Nugent,  2006).  In pediatric ITP cases, 20% to 30%  are considered chronic ( platelet 
count <  150 x 109/L for > 6 months from diagnosis ) and may become refractory to 
standard treatments ( Glanz et al, 2008).  Chronic ITP in childhood has an estimated 
incidence of 0.46 per 100,000 children per year ( Lilleyman, 1999;  Zeller et al, 2000).  
Predictors for chronic ITP in children include older age (> 10 years) and an insidious 
presentation ( Robb and Tiedeman, 1990 ).  In addition, chronic ITP in children is 
associated with higher presenting platelet count (> 20 x 109/L), lack of mucosal bleeding 
at presentation, and lack of a previous acute illness ( Glanz et al, 2008 ). 
The traditional classification of chronic and acute ITP in the literature is based solely 
on persistence of thrombocytopenia from time of diagnosis, whereas previously 
mentioned, acute ITP is <  6 months and chronic ITP is > 6 months ( Kuhne, 2003 ).  
However, this definition is commonly considered arbitrary ( Bolton- Maggs, 2007; 
Buchanan and Adix,  2006; Glanz  et al, 2008 ; Kuhne, 2006 ).  As a result, an international 
working group of ITP experts recently convened and re -defined the classification.  The 
working group now defines “newly diagnosed ITP” as 0 to 3 months from diagnosis, “persistent ITP” as  lasting between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis, and “chronic ITP” 
as a disease duration ≥ 12 months.   This classification includes patients not reaching 
spontaneous remission or not maintaining complete response off therapy (Rodeghiero  et al, 2009 ).  Based on these recent definitions, important determinants of 
disease severity and need for treatment include time since diagnosis, failure of prior ITP therapy, and bleeding symptoms. Product:

 2.2 Treatments for ITP in Pediatric Patients   
The treatment of ITP in pediatric patients is warranted to prevent clinically significant 
bleeding events, especially intracerebral hemorrhage.  Although fatal bleeding events 
among children with ITP are rare and the overall incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is between 0.2% and 1% ( Cines  and Blanchette, 2002), one review of 332 medical 
records revealed that 17% of children had major hemorrhage defined as intracranial bleeding, epi[INVESTIGATOR_789381], gross hematuria, or other bleeding causing a decline in hemoglobin concentration.  Approximately 75% of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_789382] < 10 x  10
9 /L 
(Tarantino,  2006 ). 
The principal aim of treating children with chronic ITP is to maintain a hemostatically 
safe platelet count and improve quality of life, instead of trying to achieve a cure 
(Kalpatthi and Bussel , 2008).  Clinical management of chronic ITP  in children varies and 
does not always adhere to recommendations set forth by [CONTACT_789423] B CSH and 
General Hematology Task Force  (Neunert  et al, 2011; BCSH, 2003 ).  The ASH 
guidelines incorporate both clinical  and platelet count data to arrive at specific treatment 
recommendations; drug therapy with either intravenous immuno globulin (IVI G) or 
corticosteroids is recommended for children with a platelet count (<  20 x 109/L) and  
minor purpura , and for children with severe life-threatening  bleeding 
(George  et al, 1996 ).  The BCSH gu idelines suggest that pronounced skin purpura and 
bruising may not reflect a serious risk of bleeding and recommend that only patients who experience significant mucous membrane bleeding receive treatment (Tarantino  and Bolton -Maggs, 2007 ; Tarantino, 2006).  Furthermore, the BCSH 
recommends that IVIG be used only for emergency treatment or for those who do not respond to corticosteroids.   
In 2010,  an international consensus report was publ ished to address  the investigation, 
diagnosis , and management of childhood ITP ( Provan et al, 2010 ).  The consensus 
report guidance for the diagnosis and management of ITP remains largely unchanged from the previously published BCSH and ASH guidance.  Cent ral to the committee’s 
recommendations is the adoption of an ITP classification by [CONTACT_24109], which is separated

Traditional pre- splenectomy  treatment options include oral corticosteroids (including 
pulse oral dexametha sone), IVIG, and for chi ldren who are Rhesus -positive, intravenous 
(IV) anti-D (Blanchette and Price, 2003).  Less commonly, immunosuppressive 
strategies have been used to treat  chronic ITP  which include cyclophosphamide, 
azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and autologous stem cell 
transplantation ( Buchanan and Adix, 2006).  While each of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789383], the potential toxicity of these approaches 
compels physicians to weigh the likelihood of clinical efficacy against the likelihood of the occurrence of clinically relevant adverse events ( Tarantino, 2006).  
Recently rituximab has also been used to treat pediatric ITP.  A prospective study of the 
use of rituximab among children with chronic refractory ITP demonstrated a 31% response rate with response defined as maintenance of a platelet count >  50 x 10
9/L for 
4 consecutive weeks ( Bennett et al, 2006 ).  However, rituximab carries a significant  
warning regarding infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, severe mucocutaneous reactions, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(Rituxan
® [rituximab]  Prescribing Information, 2012 ).  Long- term suppression of B cells 
by [CONTACT_789424] (except possibly in very  young children) or serious infections ( Parodi et al, 2006) .  Although the 
need for prophylactic IVIG has not been demonstrated, patients must be closely 
monitored.  H epatitis B virus reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and 
death can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab 
(Kalpatthi  and Bussel, 2008;  Rituxan
® [rituximab]  Prescribing Information, 2012).  
Splenectomy is considered only for those children who have severe ITP.  The fact that 
36% of chronic pediatric ITP patients are reported to experience spontaneous remission (Reid, 1995 ) suggests that there could be a role for therapeutic agents that have the 
ability to delay splenectomy.  Splenectomy is recommended in both ASH and BCSH guidelines for children with ITP lasting > 1 year with both low platelet count and bleeding  symptoms, although the BCSH guidelines stress that splenectomy is warranted 
only with  demonstrable impairment on quality of life ( Kalphatthi and Bussel, 2008;  
Tarantino and Bolton- Maggs, 2007 ).  In the recently published international consensus Product:

 report, splenectomy is also cited as a surgical treatment option, but is generally deferred 
for as long as possible (Provan et al, 2010).  
Splenectomy is successful in resolution of life threatening thrombocytopenia in 
75% to 85% of pediatric patients but is associated with an increased risk of sepsis 
(Nugent , 2006).   A recent survey revealed that only approximately one- third of 
respondents would recommend splenectomy as first -line therapy for a child with severe 
chronic refractory ITP, a decision influenced mostly by [CONTACT_789425] -term 
outcome, such as risk of sepsis, thromboembolic events,  possible relapse, likelihood of 
spontaneous remission without splenectomy , and the irreversible nature of splenectomy 
(Neunert et al, 2008).  Moreover, s plenectomy  may not be warranted in younger patients 
who are at relatively  high risk for infection with encapsulated organisms 
(Kuhne et al, 2007;  Bennett et al, 2006 ).  
2.3 Romiplostim B ackground  
Romiplostim is a recombinant non- glycosylated 59 kDa thrombopoietic protein produced 
in Esch erichia  coli.  It is a fusion protein (peptibody), composed of a human 
immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain with each single chain subunit covalently linked at the 
C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 thrombopoietin (TPO)  receptor binding 
domains.  Romiplostim stimulates platelet production by a mechanism similar to that of 
endog enous thrombopoietin (eTPO); however, there is no amino acid sequence 
homology between romiplostim and eTPO.  The lack of sequence homology with eTPO 
reduces the probability that if antibodies to romiplostim are produced they will cross react with eTPO and  cause thrombocytopenia.  
Romiplostim is approved for use in the adult chronic ITP setting in various regions of the world under the trade name [CONTACT_789459]
® (romiplostim) ; the specific clinical indication 
varies by [CONTACT_11338].   The most common side effects reported include headache, aching 
joints, dizziness, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], muscle aches, pain in extremities and abdominal pain.

 efficacy of romiplostim for the treatment of pediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.   
A total of 22 subjects (17 romiplostim ; 5 placebo) between 12 months and 17 years of 
age were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim or v olume-m atched placebo at 
a starting dose of 1 µg /kg administered weekly by [CONTACT_22666] .  Subjects 
returned to the clinic weekly for platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the 
supervision of the treating physician.  
All [ADDRESS_1087145] (IP) and were evaluated for 
efficacy.  Of the 17 subjects who received romiplostim, 15  (88%) achieved a platelet 
response ≥ 50 x 109/L for 2 consecutive weeks during the 12- week treatment period 
(after excluding  platelet counts within 4 weeks after rescue medication  use).  The same 
15 subjects also achieved an increase in platelet count ≥ 20 x 109/L above baseline for 
2 consecutive weeks (after excluding platelet counts within 4 weeks of rescue 
medication use).  None of the placebo- treated subjects achieved either endpoint.  
With regards to rescue medication use, 2 of 17 subjects (11.8%) in the romiplostim 
group, and 2 of the 5 subjects (40.0%) in the placebo group received rescue medication 
support during the treatment period. 
During the treatment period, adverse events were reported for the majority of subjects in 
each treatment group (16 of 17 subjects [94.1%] in the romiplostim group and 4 of 5 subjects [80%] in the placebo group) , with most adverse events reported as mild 
to moderate in severity.   The most frequently reported adverse events (subject incidence 
> 25% in either treatment group) were (romiplostim, placebo) headache (6  subjects, 
35.3%; 2 subjects, 40.0%), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (6 subjects, 35.3%; [ADDRESS_1087146], 20.0%), cough (2 subjects, 11.8%; 2 subjects, 40.0%) , vomiting (2 subjects, 11.8%; 2 subjects , 40.0%), 
and nasal congestion (0 subjects , 0.0%; 2 subjects , 40.0%) .

 2.5 Bone Marrow Reticulin Evaluation i n ITP 
Reticulin is a normal component of the bone marrow that can be detected with reticulin 
(silver) stain ( Thiele et al, 2005 ; Kuter et al, 2007 ).  Increased reticulin (reticulin fibrosis) 
is associated with many benign conditions, while increased collagen fibrosis (detected 
by [CONTACT_789426]) is characteristic of myeloproliferative disease ( Kuter et al, 2007 ). 
In a retrospective analysis of bone marrow  biopsies  from 40 patients with ITP, reticulin 
was present in approximately two- thirds of romiplostim -naïve patients ( Mufti et al, 2006 ). 
Increased reticulin above normal levels may be observed with or without concomitantly increased collagen in several conditions. Increased reticulin without collagen fibrosis is associated with conditions such as hairy cell leukemia, human immunodeficiency virus  
infectio n, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and treatment with hematopoietic growth 
factors ( Kuter et al, 2007 ). 
Increased reticulin has been observed following treatment with recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO), interleukin -3, and interleukin- 11 (Kuter, 2007 ; 
Kuter  et al, 2007 ), and is likely a response to stimulation of megakaryocytes by 
[CONTACT_789427] (TPO) ( Douglas et al, 2002 ), or related to cytokines or other factors that 
are elaborated by [CONTACT_789428] ( Castro -Malaspi[INVESTIGATOR_193112], 1981;  
Yanagida et al, 1997;  Schmitt et al, 2000).  Bone marrow reticulin (or the presence of 
reticulin on study) was observed in 3.7% (10 of 271) of subjects evaluated who had 
received romiplostim for ITP  [data on file].  Increased reticulin formation may be due to 
the increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow as a result of romiplostim treatment, consistent with findings associated with other thrombopoietins (Kuter, 2007).  
Recent evidence has shown that the amount of bone marrow reticulin detected by [CONTACT_789429], while the presence of type 1 
collagen, as detected by [CONTACT_789426], is often associated with more severe disease, a poorer prognosis ( Kuter et al, 2007 ), and may be associated with malignant 
condi tions such as chronic  idiopathic myelofibrosis  (Tefferi, 2005 ). 
To prospectively evaluate the incidence of both reticulin and collagen formation in the 
bone marrow during  treatment with romiplostim, a trial in adults with ITP receiving open 
label romiplostim for up to 3 years is in progress  ([COMPANY_010] study 20080009) .  Three 
cohorts of subjects will undergo repeat bone marrow evaluation after 1, 2, or 3 years to 
evaluate the incidence and potential sequelae of reticulin and collagen formation in the 
bone marrow .  To date, no development of collagen has been seen in cohorts 1 (1 year) 
and 2 (2 years). Increase by [ADDRESS_1087150]:

2 adult subjects with ITP.  One of the subjects presented with anti- romiplostim 
neutralizing antibodies at the end of study (EOS) time point but tested negative for 
neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim on follow -up 4 months later (after discontinuation 
of romiplostim).  The second subj ect had neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim at an 
unscheduled time point after dosing with romiplostim but tested negative for neutralizing 
antibodies to romiplostim at 2 follow -up time points (week  132 and EOS ) after 
discontinuation of romiplostim.  No cross -reactive binding antibodies to TPO were 
observed.

Previously reported safety results of the earlier phase 2 study (20060195 ), the currently 
enrolling phase 3 study  (20080279) , and open -label long -term follow -up study  
(20090340)  support a favorable benefit risk profile with the use of romiplostim in 
thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects .  This study represents the fourth investigation of

previous pediatric and adult ITP studies and will be used for dosing and administration in 
this protocol.   Romiplostim will be administered initially in  the clinic by a qualified health  
care provider as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of romiplostim will be 
1 µg/kg /week  based on the subject’s recorded screening weight.  Throughout the 
treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic to provide platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.   Weekly dose increases 
will continue in increments of 1 µg/kg up to a maximum dose of 10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10
9/L.  Dose adjustments will be allowed to 
maintain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L.

No formal hypothesis will be tested in this study .  The percentage of time with a platelet 
count ≥ 50 x 109/L in the first [ADDRESS_1087156] a response while receiving romiplostim, defined as 
a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and in the absence of  ITP rescue medications in the past

The study design consists of a 4 -week screening period, up to a 3-year treatment period, 
an end of treatment (EOT) visit , and an end of study (EOS) visit.  
Subjects entering the study on medications to raise platelet counts may remain on these concomitant medications, as needed, along with romiplostim.  After the initiation of romiplostim, if subjects require additional medications to raise platelet counts,  or an 
increase in dose of existing medications,  rescue  ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789384] (see 
Section 6.4).  If the subject’s platelet count is ≥ 50 x 10

 Approximately 200 subjects with ITP will be enrolled and will receive weekly romiplostim 
until they complete the study , discontinue participation in the study for any reason, or the 
study ends.  
The overall study design is described by a study sch ema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis  section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1. 
3.1.1 S ubjects With an Onset of Sustained Platelet R esponse  
During the treatment period, romiplostim doses will be adjusted as outlined in Table 1.  
Subjects who dose reduce romiplostim such that they no longer require treatment with 
romiplostim, no longer require ITP medications  (concomitant or rescue) , and have an 
onset of a sustained platelet response (defined as a consecutive platelet count s 
≥ 50 x 109/L) will be monitored for at least [ADDRESS_1087160] platelet count 
≥ 50 x 109/L.  Subjects whose platelet count remains ≥ 50 x 109/L in the absence of any 
medications for ITP for at least 6 months will then be followed every 12 w eeks for the 
duration of the 36 -month treatment period.   
If during the 36 -month treatment period the platelet count subsequently falls  below 
< 50 x 109/L, treatment with romiplostim at the initial starting dose may be resumed. 
Subsequent doses will be adj usted as shown in Table 1.  Clinic visits will be resumed 
per the Schedule of A ssessment s (Table 2). 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1087161] a platelet count ≤ 20 x 109/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the 
maximum romiplostim dose of 10 µg/kg should be discontinued from romiplostim and will 
be considered non- responders.  If the subject is a non- responder but the investigator 
believ es the subject has obtained clinical benefit, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_789430].

6. TREATMENT PROCEDU RES 
6.[ADDRESS_1087180](s) and/or Medical Device(s)  
The [COMPANY_010] Investigational Product used in this study : romiplostim . 
The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, and administration of romiplostim . 
6.2 Romiplostim   
Romiplostim will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_21931]. and distributed using 
[COMPANY_010]’s clinical study IP distribution procedures.  Romiplostim is supplied in a 5 mL 
single -use v ial as a sterile, white, preservative- free, lyophilized powder containing a 
protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of 10 mM histidine, 4.0% mannitol, 2.0% sucrose, 
0.004% polysorbate 20, and a pH 5.0 when reconstituted with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injectio n. 
6.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
IP will be administered as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of romiplostim 
will be 1  µg/kg based on the subject’s recorded screening weight.  Initially, IP will be 
administered in the clinic by a qualified health  care provider and subjects will return to 
the clinic weekly to provide blood samples for platelet counts and undergo any dose 
titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.   Subjects who receive their first 
[ADDRESS_1087181] the injection administered by a caregiver .  
Weekly dose increases will continue in increments of 1  µg/kg up to a maximum dose of 
10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10
9/L.  Dose adjustments 
will be allowed to main tain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L.  
Dose adjustments will be evaluated every [ADDRESS_1087182]:

 If a dose of < 0.05 m L is required, dilution of romiplostim in a 1:2 ratio (a protein 
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL) or a 1:4 ratio (a protein concentration of 0.125 mg/mL ) 
may be made with 0.9% saline to ensure an appropriate dispensable volume is 
delivered.  
Subjects will be monitored for the onset of a sustained platel et response (see 
Section 3.1.1 ) and, if achieved, may dose- reduce romiplostim.  If a subject no longer 
requires treatment with romiplostim but there is subsequently a fall in platelet counts  of 
< 50 x 109/L during the 36- month treatment period, treatment with romiplostim should 
resume at the initial weekly dose of 1 μg/kg. 
The effects of overdose of romiplostim are not known.   In high -dose preclinical studies, 
the noted effects were related to the pharmacological action of romiplostim.  In the event 
of an overdose, platelet counts should be monitored frequently.   Please refer to

scheduled day of dosing when platelet count falls <  200 x 109/L  
a If the platelet count is elevated in response to the initiation or increase in dose of another ITP medication, 
then the same dose of IP should be administered when the platelet count is ≤  200 x 109/L. 
b Romiplostim may be used with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789388]  (refer to Section  6.4).  If the subject’s platelet count 
is ≥ 50 x 109/L, other  ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789389].  
c If the current dose is 1 μg/ kg and a dose reduction is required, the dose will be withheld until the platelet 
count falls to < 50 x 109/L.  Once the platelet count is < 50 x 109/L, dosing will resume at a dose of 1 μg/kg 
using the dose adjustment rules above.  
d If platelet count ≥ 400 x 109/L is due to rescue medications, it is at the discretion of the investigator to 
reduce the dose by 1 µg/kg.  
In situations in which withholding a romiplostim dose results in a rapid drop in platelet 
count , an alternate dosing schedule may be authorized on a case -by-case basis with the 
approval of an [COMPANY_010] medical monitor.  
The subject’s body weight will be reassessed every 12 weeks.  Subsequent doses of 
romiplostim will be re -calculated using the new weight.  If the  volume (mL or μL) of IP will 
be increasing due to an increase in body weight >  2.5 kg, the unit dose (μ g/kg) of IP 
should not be increased until a platelet count has decreased to < 50 x 109/L requiring an 
increase in dose.  
All doses of romiplostim will be  administered on a weekly basis.  Should a subject miss a 
dose of romiplostim , the dose can be taken within [ADDRESS_1087189] 
will continue with the subsequent dose at the next scheduled weekly date. 
Dosing will be stopped at any time during the study if neutralizing antibodies to 
romiplostim or to eTPO are detected.   
6.2.3 Non-responders to Romiplostim  
Subjects with a platelet count of < 20 x 109/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the maximum 
romiplostim dose of 10 µg/kg  should be discontinued from romiplostim and will be 
considered non -responders.   Non-responders will be discontinued from the study and 
undergo all  EOT and EOS procedures . 
If the subject is a non- respo nder but the investigator believes the subject has obtained 
clinical benefit, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_789431]:

Clinical Study Report:  [ADDRESS_1087190]:  Romiplostim  
Protocol Number:  20101221  
Date: [ADDRESS_1087191]  will be 
eligible for self - administration.  
6.3 Self-administration of Romiplostim  
Romiplostim will initially be administered by [CONTACT_789432].   At the investigator’s discretion, subjects who have been 
dosed in the clinic and achieve a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without romiplostim dose 
adjustments for [ADDRESS_1087192] the injection administered by a caregiver.  
Those subjects who self -administer their medication, as well as those who are eligible to 
self-administer but choose not to, will only be required to return to the site for ongoing 
evaluations (including platelet counts) at designated study visits (performed every 4 weeks), as long as their dose of romiplostim remains stable.  
In the event of a change in dose of romiplostim (per the dose adjustment rules in  
Table 1), subject s will be required to return to the clinic for [ADDRESS_1087193] a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10
9/L for [ADDRESS_1087194] s or their caregiver s are trained to prepare and 
administer the injection.  Subjects and/or subject’s  caregivers will receive training and 
study tools designed to educate the subject on the proper s torage, reconstitution, and 
self-administration of romiplostim .  Once subject s or their caregiver s have  adequately 
demonstrated their ability to reliably administer the medication, subjects  may be allowed 
to self -inject  (or have the injection given by [CONTACT_220683])  away from the investigational 
site.  The completion of training on self - injection (or training to a caregiver) will be 
recorded in the subject’s source documentation.   All training will be monitored. 
The site will be required to ensure that subject s are supplied with necessary materials 
required for self -injecting, including dispensing of the IP.  All used vials of romiplostim  
must be returned to the clinic for drug accountability.  Subject diary cards to record the 
dose, dosing date , and any dosing or storage errors will be provided to subjects.  
While subject s are self-injecting, the IP must be provided to subjects every [ADDRESS_1087195]:

Concomitant medications are allowed for subjects enrolled into the study in any situation deemed medically necessary to increase platelet counts.  Medications to increase platelet counts starting before enrollment and continuing unchanged (dose and schedule) while on treatment with romiplostim will be defined as concomitant medications for ITP.   Rescue medication is defined as any medication or transfusion, 
other than romiplostim and excluded medications, that is administered  after enrollment  
to the subject with the intent of raising platelet counts or to prevent bleeding and 
includes concomitant medications for ITP in which the dose and/or schedule is 
increased.  For the purposes of this study, the permitted rescue medications include the 
following : Concomitant and Rescue Therapy for  ITP 
• co rticosteroids  
• platelet transfusions  
• IVIG 
• azathioprine 
• anti-D immunoglobulin  
• danazol  
Antifibrinolytics can be used at any time during the study and will not be considered 
rescue medication (s).

Rescue medication is allowed throughout the  duration of the study when platelet counts 
are < 20 x 109/L and/or when a subject has bleeding or wet purpura.   Rescue medication 
is also allowed in any situation deemed medically necessary by [CONTACT_789433]. 
Reduction or discontinuation of concomitant or rescue medications for ITP is 
recommended based on investigator judgment when platelet counts are ≥ 50 x 109/L.

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
All subjects and/or  their legally acceptable representatives (eg, parents, legal guardian) 
will sign and date the informed consent form before subject s can undergo any 
study -specific procedures.   If required by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC, the assent of the child also must 
be obtained in addition to written informed consent .  Refer to the S chedul e of 
Assessments (Table 2) for an outline of the procedures required at each visit.  The visit 
schedule is calculated from day 1 (first administration of romiplostim) .  All study 
procedures have a window of ± [ADDRESS_1087204]’s source documentation, with an explanation of why the procedures were not completed.  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to ensure minimize d risks to study subject s.  This includes testing to ensure  analytical 
methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study .  This can 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423],  or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative, [COMPANY_010] may do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and 
back -up) to investigate and better understand ITP , the dose response and/or predicti on 
of response to romiplostim, characterize antibody response, or  characterize aspects of 
the molecule (eg, metabolites).  Results from this analysis will be documented and maintained, but may not be reported as part of this study.  
All subjects enrolled will have samples assayed for binding and if positive, neutralizing 
antibodies.  Product:

7.1.2 Platelet Counts  
Platelet counts will be evaluated by [CONTACT_3878]’s  local laboratory and used to 
assess the need for romiplostim dose adjustments and to evaluate platelet response to 
therapy.   Platelet counts will not be analyzed or reported by [CONTACT_2237].  The 
investigational site’s laboratory should be used whenever possible for the assessment of platelet counts; however , in certain circumstances platelet count may be assessed at a 
laboratory local to the subject’s residence.  Throughout this study, the laboratory 
analyzing a subject’s platelet count should be consistent.  
All platelet counts required for dosing decisions will be collected and recorded on the eCRFs.  Product:

Date: [ADDRESS_1087216] administration of romiplostim.  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for the measurement of  
anti-romiplostim binding antibodies.  Binding antibodies will be assessed for their ability 
to bind to romiplostim or the peptide portion of romiplostim, and their potential (if any) to cross- react with eTPO.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be 
tested for neutralizing antibodies by [CONTACT_789438]/or eTPO in a cell- based bioassay.  Binding antibodies may be further characterized 
for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  While the subject 
is receiving IP,  blood samples will be collected for anti-romiplostim antibodies at 
week  12, week 52, every 24 weeks thereaft er, and at the EOT visit.  Only positive results 
for neutralizing antibodies will be provided to investigational sites; if no results are provided, sites may assume that no neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim were identified.  
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim or to eTPO during the course of the study (or at the EOT visit) will be removed from treatment and will be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This testing should occur every 3 months 
starting from when the site has been notified of the positive result, until: (1) neutralizing 
antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year (± 4 weeks).   More frequent testing (e g, every month) or testing for a 
longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns.  
Subjects who test positive for binding, non- neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -romiplostim antibody 
response, may also be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  
Should a subject fail to respond or fail to maintain a response to romiplostim, an unscheduled serum sample will be required to rule out anti -romiplostim antibodies.  
7.2 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods

the personal physician, or other  third parties, except as specified in the informed 
consent.  
The subject  and/or the subject’s legally authorized representative retain the right to 
request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_21947].  Following 
the request from the subject  (or their legally authorized representative) , the investigator 
is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining (eg, blood) samples and any other components from the cells can be located 
and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or deriv ative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no

 8. WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP or 
procedures at any time during the study  but continue participation in the study .  If this 
occurs, the investigator  is to discuss with the s ubject the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from IP and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2) and collection of data, including endpoints and 
adverse events.  The investigator  must document the change to the S chedule of 
Assessments (Table 2) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] (eg,  
follow -up in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through fa mily/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records).  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  Subjects who withdraw 
early should complete an EOT and EOS visit .  The data generated may potentially not 
be included in the subject’s study data, except in the case of a possibly related serious 
adverse event, where data will be collected.  
8.2  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subjec t(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures, or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with [COMPANY_010] investigational product(s) and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21883] a separate protocol or as provided for by [CONTACT_21956]’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1. Product:

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates the pre- existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study, and involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In t he event a subject, or subject’s Product:

• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias,  or events that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

Adverse Event Summary CRF) . 
Because all subjects who enter the study will be diagnosed with ITP according to the ASH guidelines, ITP should not be reported as an adverse event during the conduct of 
the study.

there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by t he romiplostim?    
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -manda ted activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], device(s) and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonabl e possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, 
administrati on of investigational product, protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], device(s)), and/or 
procedure?”  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and det ermining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,  
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.

To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] encourages the formation of a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and appropriate 
[COMPANY_010] staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication 
Charter .  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other 
investigators and to collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate as defined 
in the Publication Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and 
[COMPANY_010] staff) does not guarantee authorship—the criteria described below should be met for every publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and (3) final approval

 Date Started * – Enter date the adverse event first started rather than the date of diagnosis or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For serious events, the start date is the date the event started, not the date on which the 
event met serious criteria. This is a mandatory field. 
Date Ended – Enter date the adverse event ended. For serious events, this is not the date when the 
event no longer met serious criteria.  If the event has not ended at the time of the initial report, a follow -
up report should be completed when the end date is known.  If the event is fatal, enter the date of death 
as the end date.  
If event occurred before the first dose of Investigational Product (IP)/drug under study , add a 
check mark in the corresponding box.  
Is event serious? * – Indicate Yes or No. This is a mandatory field. 
Serious Criteria Code * – This is a mandatory field for serious events. Enter all reasons why the 
reported event has met serious criteria:  
 Immediately life -threatening – Use only if the subject was at immediate  risk of death from the 
event as it occurred.  Emergency treatment is often required to sustain life in this situation.  
 If the investigator decides an event should be reported in an expedited manner, but it does not 
meet other serious criteria, “Other Medically Important  Serious Event” may be the appropriate 
serious  criterion.  
Relationship to IP/drug under study * – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of 
the event to the IP /drug under study  at the time the event is initially reported. For observational 
studies, remember that SARs are, by [CONTACT_154020], related to the drug under study.  This is a 
mandatory field.  
Relationship to [COMPANY_010] device * – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of the 
event to the [COMPANY_010] device (e.g. prefilled syringe, auto-injector) at the time the event is initially reported. 
If the study involves an [COMPANY_010] device, this is a mandatory field. This question does not apply to 
non-[COMPANY_010] devices used in the study (e.g. heating pads, infusion pumps)  
Outcome of Event * – Enter the code for the outcome of the event at the time the form is completed. 
This is a mandatory field  for serious events.   
 Resolved – End date is known 
 Not resolved / Unknown – End date is unknown 
 Fatal – Event led to death  
If event is related to a study procedure, such as a biopsy, radiotherapy or withdrawal of a current drug 
treatment during a wash- out period, add a check mark to the corresponding box. This does not include 
relationship to IP/drug under study or concomitant medication – only diagnostic tests or activities 
mandated by [CONTACT_760].

Platelet count (x 109/L) Investigational Product Dose Adjustment Rulea 
< 50b Increase dose by 1 µg/kg each week (to a maximum of 10 µ g/kg)  
50 to 200b Dose remains constant  
> 200 to < 400 b,c After the platelet count remains in this range for 2 consecutive 
weeks, dose reduce by 1 µg/kg on the next scheduled dosing day  
> 400 b,c,d Withhold the dose and dose reduce by 1 µg/kg on the next 
scheduled day of dosing when platelet count falls < 200 x 109/L  
a If the platelet count is elevated in response to the initiation or increase in dose of another ITP medication, 
then the same dose of IP should be administered when the platelet count is ≤  200 x 109/L. 
b Romiplostim may be used with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789392] (refer to Section  6.4).  If the subject’s platelet count 
is ≥ 50 x 109/L, other ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789389].  
c If the current dose is 1 μg/kg and a dose reduction is required, the dose will be withheld until the platelet 
count falls to < 50 x 109/L.  Once the platelet count is < 50 x 109/L, dosing will resume at a dose of 1 μg/kg

Date:   [ADDRESS_1087440] s undergoing bone marrow 
evaluations.  The sample size was chosen to provide an assessment/estimation of the 
development of bone marrow abnormalities  (eg, collagen as evidenced by [CONTACT_789456] ) at Year 1 or Year 2 after romiplostim exposure using the  modified Bauermeister 
grading scale.  
With 30 subjects in each cohort, the number of evaluable bone marrow results in each cohort is expected to be between 20 and 25.   The assumption of 20 to 25 evaluable subjects is based on the approximate 30% rate of r epeat inevaluable or missing bone 
marrow samples observed in the current [COMPANY_010] adult ITP bone marrow study with romiplostim (Study 20080009).  The 95% exact confidence intervals for outcomes of bone marrow abnormalities when there are 20 and 25 evaluable bone marrow results are described in Table 4.   
No historical data are available regarding the change in bone marrow morphology in this patient population.  Clinical data from adult ITP subjects receiving romiplostim demonstrated that increases in bone marrow reticulin (or the presence of reticulin on study) were observed in 3.7% (10 of 271 of subjects: romiplostim 120 -day safety update 
dataset used).  However the potential incidence rate could be higher or lower given that bone marrow assessments were not s ystematically performed on all subjects during 
clinical studies.

The number and percentage of subjects who develop collagen as evidenced by [CONTACT_789457] 1 or Year 2, will be summarized by [CONTACT_117311],  splenectomy 
status at baseline, years since diagnosis (
≤ 3 vs > 3 years), age at enrollment ( ≥ 1 year to 
< 6 years; 6 years to <12 years; 12 years to < 18 years) and maximum doses and drug exposures if appropriate.  In addition, logistic regression may be used to investigate the association of bone marrow abnormality and potential predictive facto rs. 
The number and percentage of subjects with collagen as evidenced by [CONTACT_789426] 12 weeks after romiplostim discontinuation among subjects who developed collagen will be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with bone marrow reticulin  increases by ≥ 2

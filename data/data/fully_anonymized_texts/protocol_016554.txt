INTRODUCTION 
Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most common surgeries performed worldwide. It is the most 
common major surgery performed in the [LOCATION_002], with over 1.[ADDRESS_7886] outcomes for patients who 
could benefit from a multidisciplinary, multimodal, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing approach to improving their 
recovery. The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) strongly supports this effort and 
recently released a consensus statement on an enhanced recovery protocol for CS.[ADDRESS_7887] of instituting an enhanced 
recovery program for CS. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 The purpose of this study was to determine if there are significantly improved patient outcomes 
after implementing an enhanced recovery protocol for CS. Initially, we had planned to study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8555]; however, because of Rose’s Law, we determined that length of 
stay would not be an appropriate primary outcome at our institution. Rose’s Law is a state law that 
prohibits early discharge (<96 hours) of a patient after cesarean delivery unless a waiver is signed by [CONTACT_8565] [ADDRESS_7888] of an enhanced recovery program for  CS on postoperative 
pain scores, length of stay, and 30-day complication rates. We hypothesized that implementing an 
enhanced recovery program for CS would decrease postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. 
STUDY DESIGN  
We compared a retrospective pre-enhanced recovery cohort (pre-ERC) of women delivered by 
[CONTACT_8566] a prospective enhanced recovery cohort (ERC) exposed to the enhanced recovery program. The 
pre-ERC included patients from January 1, [ADDRESS_7889] SELECTION  
Analysis was restricted to women undergoing scheduled, elective CS at the Women and Infants’ 
Center who were admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8557]. Patients excluded from analysis 
included those: (1) less than 18 years of age; (2) who had an urgent or emergent CS; (3) who had a 
diagnosis of preeclampsia, eclampsia, insulin dependent diabetes, abnormal placentation, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428]. The pre-ERC group included patients from January 1, [ADDRESS_7890] 24 hours prior to documented delivery time were considered as to exclude 
urgent or emergent surgeries. Also, patients were excluded if they had a documented International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis of preeclampsia, eclampsia, placenta accreta, placenta increta, 
placenta percreta, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 insulin dependent diabetes, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], or had 
outpatient prescriptions for insulin, methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine-naloxone. Eligible 
charts were reviewed, and patients were further excluded if they were admitted for inpatient 
management prior to the day of surgery or if they had an exclusion diagnosis that was in a physician 
note but not captured as an ICD code.  
 
Enhanced Recovery Program Implementation  
The Enhanced Recovery after Cesarean Delivery Program was implemented on July 1, 2018. The 
program included the enhanced recovery protocol and a quality improvement initiative with monthly 
reports. The program was designed by a multidisciplinary committee with leadership from obstetric 
anesthesia and stakeholders including obstetricians, pediatricians, nursing leadership, pharmacy, and 
information technology.  
Patients received a written educational handout on enhanced recovery after CS in the 
preoperative obstetric clinic. Instead of the previous “nil per os (NPO) after midnight” preoperative 
instructions, these patients were instructed to consume a 20-ounce carbohydrate sports drink up to [ADDRESS_7891]-anesthesia care 
unit (PACU) with 20 ml 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_8558]-free morphine. Unless contraindicated, all patients 
received 30 mg of intravenous (IV) ketorolac in the PACU. The ketorolac was given as a scheduled 
medication every [ADDRESS_7892] analgesic medication orders. Patients were now 
offered a clear liquid diet immediately upon arrival to the postpartum floor and advance to solid foods 
as soon as tolerated. Prior to July 1, 2018, the urinary catheter was removed on postoperative day (POD) 
1. This meant that the catheter might have remained in place for up to [ADDRESS_7893] four 
times a day. Changes to the analgesic regimen included scheduled oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen 
throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8559]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8560] (heat/cold packs, distraction therapy) for 
mild pain. Pain scores were defined as: mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10) and were recorded 
by [CONTACT_8567]. There were as needed orders for oral oxycodone 5mg every 
[ADDRESS_7894] errors (SE) for continuous outcomes or 
counts and percentages for categorical outcomes. Two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests were used to 
compare the two cohorts. Normality for continuous outcomes was assessed using probability plots and 
the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk test for normality; for any outcomes where normality could not be reasonably 
assumed, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used in place of two-sample t-tests. For categorical outcomes, 
Fisher’s exact test was used when assumptions for the chi-square test were not met. 
Any missing observations were assumed to be missing at random. Pairwise deletion was used to 
handle missing data. That is, subjects with missing data were not excluded from all analyses, but only 
those analyses where the outcome of interest was missing. For the primary and secondary outcomes, a 
Bonferroni adjustment was used to correct for multiple comparisons. For these outcomes, a two-sided 
p-value < 0.002 (= .05/22) was considered statistically significant. For all other measures, p-value < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to conduct 
all statistical analyses. 
 
 
 
Sample Size Estimate  
We assessed baseline values of our primary clinical outcome to determine appropriate sample 
size. After initial retrieval of patient charts for the pre-ERC, and prior to chart abstraction, the baseline 
total oral morphine equivalents (OME) used postoperatively from July 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018 was an 
average of 126 (5.93) mg. Based on these values, a sample size of 138 patients would give us 80% power 
at the 0.[ADDRESS_7895] a 15% decrease in morphine equivalents from baseline using a 
two-sample t-test. We analyzed patients in the ERC from July 1, [ADDRESS_7896] to audit by [CONTACT_8568].

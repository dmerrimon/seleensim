 2 PRECIS  
 
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are bone marrow disorders characterized by [CONTACT_108659], neutropenia,  
and thrombocytopenia. Patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as 
well as a variable risk of progression to acute leukemia. With the exception of stem cell transplant, the standard treatments for MDS are rarely curative, and relapse rates are significant. MDS patients with 
cytopenias who fail standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801711], and are a t risk for serious bleeding complications.  
 Thrombopoietin (TPO) i s the principal regulator of platelet production by [CONTACT_801746]. A [ADDRESS_1106709], eltrombopag (Promacta®) has been shown to increase platelets in 
thrombocytopenic patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP ).  Eltrombopag is 
administered orally, is well -tolerated, and is FDA approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in 
patients with chronic ITP who failed to respond to standard treatment.  
Because the management of MDS patients with persistent cytopenia s remains unsatisfactory and novel 
therap eutic  approaches are needed, we propose a non-randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], phase II study of eltrombopag in 
low to Int- [ADDRESS_1106710] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801712]. 
 
Subjects will initiate study medication at an oral dose of 50 mg/day (25 mg/day for East Asians), which will 
be adjusted as clinically indicated to the lowest dos e that maintains a stable platelet count ≥ 20,000/ µL 
above baseline while maximizing tolerability. T reatment response will be any increase in a cytopenia, in  the 
lineage  that fulfilled eligibility criteria for enrollment and will be defined as : (a) platele t count increases to 
20,000/µL above baseline at 16 or  20 weeks , or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for a 
minimum of 8 weeks in subjects who were previously transfusion dependent; (b) erythroid response for 
subjects with a pretreatment  hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL will be defined as an increase in hemoglobin by 
> 1.5g/dL without packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion support, or a reduction in the units of PRBC 
transfusions by [CONTACT_2669] 50% during the eight consecutive weeks prior to  response assessment compared 
with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 weeks;  (c) neutrophil response will be defined in 
those with a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5 x 109/L as at least a 100% increase or an 
absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L.  Subjects meeting a response may remain on the extended access until they 
meet an off study criteria or the study is closed. 
 Subjects with response at [ADDRESS_1106711] is transfused platelets for a count >10,000/
µL without a medical indication 
during the study period, the subject may continue on study drug and the response assessment may be 
extended for an additional [ADDRESS_1106712] population will be assessed concurrently.  
 
Secondary objectives include the toxicity profile of extended treatment with eltrombopag (treatment 
longer than 4 months), reduction in incidence and severity of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and response following 
extended access to study drug (treatment longer than 4 months).

The primary endpoint will be the portion of drug responders as defined by [CONTACT_801747]/o r platelet transfusion requirements, or the proportion of subjects who meet erythroid response, or 
neutrophil response criteria(1). Platelet response is defined as platelet count increases to 20,000/ L above 
baseline  at 16 or  20 weeks, or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for a minimum of 8 
weeks.  Erythroid response for subjects with a pretreatment hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL will be 
defined as an increase in hemoglobin by > 1.5g/dL without packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion 
support, or a reduction in the units of PRBC transfusions by [CONTACT_2669] 50% during the eight consecutive weeks prior to response assessment - compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 
8 weeks.  Neutrophil response will be defined in those with a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) of <0.5 x 10
9/L as at least a 100% increase or an absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L.  Subjects with an 
erythroid, and/or neutrophil response at 16 weeks may continue study medication (extended access) until 
they meet an off study criteria.   Subjects with erythroid, or neutrophil response at 16 weeks may continue 
study medication for an additional 4 weeks (to ensure eligibility) prior to being consented for entry into the extended access part of the trial.   Patients may remain on the extended access until they met an off 
study criteria.  
 
The toxicity profile will be measured using the CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria.  
Secondary endpoints  will include incidence of grade 2 or higher bleeding events as measured by [CONTACT_3989] 
v. 4.0; changes in serum thrombopoietin level, measured at 4 months; and progression to higher risk MDS as measured by [CONTACT_148628]
(1).

Secondary objectives include the toxicity profile of extended treatment with eltrombopag (treatment 
longer than 4 months), reduction in incidence and severity of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], erythroid and neutrophil 
response,  and response following extended access to study drug (treatment longer than 4 months). 
2. BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION  
2.1 Path ophysiology of cytopenias in MDS patients  
Myelodysplasia is a clonal disorder which originates from  the hematopoietic stem cell.   Ineffective 
hematopoeisis occurs which results in peripheral cytopenias. Anemia is present in the majority of patients at presentation  but transfusion dependency usually occurs later in the disease course . 
Neutropenia is less common but predisposes patients to sometimes severe infections, predominantly of bacterial and fungal origin.  Thrombocytopenia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with MDS. At presentation, 65% of patients with MDS are thrombocytopenic, and 
hemorrhage is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in MDS patients
(2).  
Thrombocytopenia in MDS patients is caused by [CONTACT_801748], resulting in dysplastic megakaryocytes that cannot produce mature platelets, and 
consequently  undergo inappropriate programmed cell death(3).  The precise molecular mechanisms 
underlying this process are not well defined, although perturbed signaling through the thrombopoietin receptor mpl  may contribute to this process
(4,5).  The regu lation of endogenous TPO 
production is also not yet fully understood.  The major site of production is the liver, and the 
primary determinant of circulating TPO levels appears to be platelet and megakaryocyte mass, with 
low numbers resulting in higher than baseline TPO levels (for review see (6)).  In MDS, TPO levels 
are generally significantly increased, in contrast to TPO levels in ITP, which are generally within the normal range or only moderately increased
(7) (8). 
2.[ADDRESS_1106717] pain.  Neutropenia results in recurrent infections which are usually bacterial in origin but 
fungal infections also occur and can be fatal.  The major symptom of th rombocytopenia in MDS 
patients is bleeding: petechiae of the skin and mucous membranes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_801713].  
Bleeding can be brisk in the presence of accompanying physical lesions related to the underlying 
MDS, or treatment with immunosuppression or hypomethylating agents, such as neutropenia-
related fungal infection of the lungs.  The most feared complication of thrombocytopenia is 
intracranial hemorrhage which is life threatening if not promptly treated.  In the largest series of 
MDS patients repo rted to date, 20% of patients had hemorrhage as a contributory cause of death, 
and in 10% of patients hemorrhage was the sole cause of death .(2) 
2.3 Management of cytopenias in MDS patients  
Management  of cytopenias associated with low to Int -1 risk MDS  may be supportive or include 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3066] G- CSF +/ - erythropoietin stimulating agents, lenalidomide in deletion 5q- 
patients, immunosuppression therapy, or in refractory cases, hypomethylating agents(9).  Patients 
with Int-2 and high risk disease are treated with hypomethylating agents and if appropriate, stem 
cell transplantation(9)  Stem cell transplant is t he only curative treatment for MDS, but many of 
these patients are older with co -morbidities which preclude them from receiving a transplant.  
09-H- 0199

 [ADDRESS_1106718] therapy is  supportive.  Red cell and platelet transfusions may be necessary 
and intravenous antibiotics are used to treat infections in patients with neutropenia.  Patients with a 
platelet count less than 10,000/ µL are routinely transfused to avoid significant bleeding.  Due to the 
short half- life of platelets in the circulation, many MDS patients with severe thrombocytopenia 
require transfusions as frequently as two times per week. Platelet transfusions are assoc iated with a 
number of side effects including febrile or allergic transfusion reactions, transmission of bacterial 
and viral infections, circulatory congestion, transfusion- related acute lung injury and allo -
immunization. The possible increased demands on the blood supply in the future may further limit the feasibility of chronic platelets transfusions as therapy for  MDS, particularly as the population 
ages there will be a concomitant increase in the prevalence of this disease.  Red cell transfusion is 
similarly inconvenient for the patient and also has transfusion reactions as potential side effects. Iron overload is a common complication in heavily transfused patients and many require chelation 
therapy. Red cell alloimmunization may make selection of units difficult with repeated transfusions.  
 In patients responding to immunosuppression, lenalidomide, or hypomethylating agents, blood 
counts may improve weeks to months after treatment, allowing discontinuation of transfusions. However, none of these agents a re curative and relapse rates are significant
(10).  The management of 
MDS patients with persistent cytopenias remains unsatisfactory an d novel therapy approaches are 
therefore needed.  
 It has been demonstrated that megakaryocytes in MDS patients exhibit defective signaling through the TPO receptor, mpl
(4).  Specifically, there is impaired expression of the signaling proteins STAT-
3 and STAT-5 after binding of the receptor to TPO(4).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_801714], we believe there is sufficient justification for a clinical tr ial testing the 
hypothesis that supraphysiologic pharmacologic levels of a TPO-R agonist could result in improved platelet production in patients with MDS by [CONTACT_801749]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_801715], some patients with MDS respond to 
combination therapy with erythropoietin and G- CSF
(11).  In ITP, despi[INVESTIGATOR_801716], pharmacologic dosing of TPO- R agonists can result in overcoming the 
impact of autoimmune platelet destruction. It is reasonable to ask whether TPO-R agonists could 
similarly overcome dysfunctional megakaryopoiesis and dysfunction or loss of more primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in MDS.  Furthermore, we have studi ed eltrombopag in an 
ongoing clinical trial in patients with severe aplastic anemia, and thus far, several patients have achieved hematologic improvements in all 3 cell lines (Olnes NEJM 2012) .  These results suggest 
that eltrombopag stimulates hematopoiesis in patients with marrow failure  and that this agent may 
be a useful approach in the treatment of any cytopenia in MDS  Recently eltrombopag was shown to 
stimulate colony formation in megakaryocytes isolated from low risk MDS patients in vitro
(12), and 
both eltrombopag and the Mpl agonist SB-559457 do not exert any proliferative effects on leukemia 
and lymphoma cell lines, or in primary AML cells grown in vitro(13,14,15). 
2.4 The Investigational Agent Eltrombopag (Promacta®) 
2.4.1 Description of the drug  
Eltrombopag (SB-497115- GR, Promacta®), the bis -monoethanolamine salt form, is an orally 
bioavailable, small molecule 2nd generation thrombopoietin re ceptor (TPO -R) agonist, developed 
for the treatment of thrombocytopenia.  
09-H- 0199

 [ADDRESS_1106719] , the 
thrombopoietin receptor (TPO- R), to stimulate thromb opoiesis. It binds mpl  at a position distinct 
from the ligand binding site, and thus does not compete with TPO for binding to its receptor(16). In 
vivo, eltrombopag increases platelet number in the chimpanzee (the only nonclinical species which 
is pharmacologically responsive to eltrombopag). These findings, coupled with supporting clinical 
efficacy data, sug gested that eltrombopag is an orally active TPO -R agonist that functions in a 
similar manner to endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO).  Additionally, in vitro electrophysiology studies have been performed and in vivo safety pharmacology studies assessed the effects of 
eltrombopag on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_302522].  
2.4.3 Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (distribution, metabolism and excretion in animal models)  
Comprehensive nonclinical pharmacokinetic, distribution, metabolism and excretion st udies were 
conducted in the mouse, rat and dog with eltrombopag. Absorption of eltrombopag was low to 
moderate and plasma clearance was generally low with moderate to long half -lives. Eltrombopag-
related material was widely distributed into peripheral tiss ues in the mouse and rat but the 
concentrations in most tissues were lower than in the blood. Drug- related material did not 
extensively penetrate into the central nervous system or the lens of the eye, nor was it selectively 
retained in melanin containing tissues. There was no evidence of tissue accumulation of drug-
related material in mice, including eyes, kidneys and skin. Eltrombopag was highly bound to 
plasma proteins in nonclinical species as well as in human plasma (>99%), with low association 
with blood cells. Eltrombopag was the predominant circulating component in all species. Minor 
metabolites in circulation included products of oxidation or glucuronidation. Eltrombopag was primarily eliminated as unchanged drug in the feces with renal elimination of cleavage products 
contributing a minor route. Qualitatively, all of the major metabolites of eltrombopag observed in 
humans were observed in the nonclinical species. In vitro, eltrombopag inhibited cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 and several uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 
(UGT) enzymes at potentially clinically relevant concentrations. Eltrombopag was neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and was not a substrate of human organic 
anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1), although it was an inhibitor of this transporter with the 
potential for such an interaction confirmed clinically. 
NTIAL UM2005/[ZIP_CODE]/03 
2.4.4 Nonclinical toxicology  
 
There were no clinically -relevant findings in toxicity studies examining the potential effects of 
eltrombopag on the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_302522]. In vitro, eltrombopag was shown to inhibit hERG ( human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene) , the alpha subunit of a voltage-
gated potassium (K
+) channel  tail curr ent. In an in vitro  study using isolated dog Purkinje fibers, 
eltrombopag was not associated with action potential prolongation, but did cause decreases in the upstroke amplitude, maximum rate of depolarization and action potential durations. In a definiti ve 
clinical QTc study with a supratherapeutic dose of eltrombopag, there was no effect on cardiac repolarization . 
 
The toxicity profile of eltrombopag has been defined in a single dose study in dogs and repeat dose 
toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in mice, 28 weeks in rats and 52 weeks in dogs. In addition, repeat dose toxicity was assessed in 2 year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. The principal 
nonclinical toxicology findings associated with eltrombopag treatment include: 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 9 Cataracts (mice and ra ts):  In vitro phototoxicity (3T3 and CHO cells) was observed. In mice and 
rats, the development of cataracts was dose- and time-dependent and the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_801717]. Cataract development was not assoc iated with 
drug accumulation in ocular tissues. No treatment -related ocular abnormalities were evident in dogs 
given the maximum tolerated dose of 30 mg/kg/day (418 μg.h/mL) for [ADDRESS_1106720] development in young mice. However, there was no evidence of ocular phototoxicity in 
young albino or pi[INVESTIGATOR_801718]-
simulated ultraviolet radiation (UVR). B6C3F1 mice (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302525]) given eltrombopag with or without UVR exposure appeared to be  more susceptible than albino mice to eltrombopag-
induced cataractogenesis. However, given that eltrombopag has not been shown to be selectively retained in melanin -containing tissues, this likely represents a strain difference in sensitivity to 
cataract i nduction. 
Renal toxicity (mice and rats ).  In mice, renal proximal tubular toxicity was observed following 
repeated oral administration of eltrombopag in a 2 year carcinogenicity study at 1.4- fold clinical 
exposure in ITP patients. Renal toxicity was not o bserved in mice in a 13 week study at a greater 
exposure (4.5 -fold clinical exposure in ITP patients, respectively) than that achieved at the lowest 
dose in the 2 year study, suggesting that the renal effects are time-dependent. In rats, an increase in 
the incidence or severity of spontaneous, age-related chronic progressive nephropathy was observed 
at a similar exposure level, but not at lower exposures. The relationship of this finding to the renal effects observed in mice is unknown. No renal toxicity w as observed following repeated oral 
administration to rats for 28 weeks or to dogs for 52 weeks at exposures up to 4.5- and 2.9-fold 
clinical exposure in ITP patients.  
 
Hepatotoxicity (mice, rats and dogs). In mice, rats and dogs, hepatocyte degeneration a nd/or 
necrosis, often accompanied by [CONTACT_302597], was observed following 
repeated oral administration of eltrombopag at exposures generally associated with morbidity and 
mortality. In rats and dogs, no treatment- related hepatic effects were observed after 28 or 52 weeks 
at exposures up to 4.5- or 2.9-fold clinical exposure in ITP patients.  
CONFIDENTIAL UM2005/[ZIP_CODE]/03 
Genotoxicity: The toxic potential of eltrombopag was also assessed in a battery of in vitro and in 
vivo genetic to xicology studies and the weight of evidence provided by [CONTACT_801750] a genotoxic risk in humans.  
Carcinogenicity:  Eltrombopag was not carcinogenic to mice or rats following 2 year 
carcinogenicity studies.  
 
Tera togenicity:   Eltrombopag was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits and did not affect fertility in 
male rats or fertility, early embryonic development, embryofetal development, maternal reproductive function, or development of offspring in female rats at non- maternally toxic doses. No 
effect on embryofetal development was observed in rabbits. At a maternally toxic dose in rats, treatment with eltrombopag was associated with embryolethality, a low incidence of cervical ribs (a 
non-teratogenic fetal variation) and reduced fetal body weight. In definitive juvenile toxicity studies 
in rats, eltrombopag was not associated with adverse effects. In vitro, eltrombopag was toxic in the 
presence of ultraviolet -A (UV -A) radiation, indicating a phototoxic response. However , there was 
no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity in hairless mice or ocular phototoxicity in pi[INVESTIGATOR_302526]. Eltrombopag also showed evidence of photoclastogenicity in vitro that was 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 10 associated with cytotoxic drug concentrations (15 to 29 μg/mL) and high intensity UV exposure [30 
minimal erythematous dose (MED)]. However, no evidence of photoclastogenicity was observed at 
a 2-fold higher concentration (58.4 μg/mL) and UV exposure of ~[ADDRESS_1106721] immune fu nction in an immunotoxicity study in rats. 
2.4.5  Clinical Pharmacology (based on studies done in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic 
impairment or renal impairment)  
Absorption: Eltrombopag is absorbed with a peak concentration occurring [ADDRESS_1106722] 52%. In a clinical study,  administration of a single 75 mg -dose of 
eltrombopag with a polyvalent cation-containing antacid (1,524 mg aluminum hydroxide, 1,425 mg 
magnesium carbonate, and sodium alginate) decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC0- ∞ and Cmax by 
70%. The contribution of sodi um alginate to this interaction is not known.  An open-label, 
randomized, crossover study was conducted to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of 
eltrombopag. A standard high- fat breakfast significantly decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC0 -∞ 
by [CONTACT_3450] 59% and Cmax by 65% and delayed tmax by [ADDRESS_1106723] also contributed to this decrease in exposure.  
 
Distribution : The concentration of eltrombopag in blood cells is approximately 50-79% of plasma 
concentrations based on a radiolabel study. In vitro studies suggest that eltrombopag is highly 
bound to human plasma proteins (>99%). Eltrombopag is not a substrate for p- glycoprotein (Pgp) 
or OATP1B1. 
 
Metabolism : Absorbed eltrombopag is extensively metabolized, predominantly through pathways 
including cleavage, oxidation, and conjugation with glucuronic acid, glutathione, or cysteine. In a human radiolabel study, eltrombopag accounted for approximately 64% of plasma radiocarbon 
AUC0 -∞. Metabolites due to glucuron idation and oxidation were also detected. In vitro studies 
suggest that CYP 1A2 and 2C8 are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of eltrombopag. 
UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 are responsible for the glucuronidation of eltrombopag. 
 
Elimination:  The predominant rou te of eltrombopag excretion is via feces (59%) and urine (31%). 
Unchanged eltrombopag in feces accounts for approximately 20% of the dose; unchanged eltrombopag is not detectable in urine. The plasma elimination half-life of eltrombopag is 
approximately 21 to 32 hours in healthy subjects and 26-35 hours in ITP patients. 
 
Race:  Based on both non- compartment analysis and population pharmacokinetic analysis, plasma 
eltrombopag exposure was approximately 70% higher in some Asian subjects of Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Korean ancestry (i.e., East Asian) with ITP as compared to non -Asian subjects who 
were predominantly Caucasian in these trials.  In addition, the pharmacodynamic (PD) response to 
eltrombopag was qualitatively similar in the Asian subjects, but the absolute PD response was 
somewhat greater. An approximately 40% higher systemic eltrombopag exposure in healthy 
African - American subjects was noted in at least one clinical pharmacology study. The effect of 
African -American ethnicity on exposure and related safety and efficacy of eltrombopag has not 
been established.  
 
Gender:  Results from a population pharmacokinetic model suggest that males have a 27% greater 
apparent eltrombopag clearance than females, after adjustment for the body weight difference.

 11 Hepatic Impairment : Plasma eltrombopag pharmacokinetics in subjects with mild, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects was investigated following administration of 
a single 50 mg dose of eltrombopag. The degree of hepatic impairment was based on Child- Pugh 
score. Plasma eltrombopag AUC0 -∞ was 41% higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 
80% to 93% higher in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy

2.4.6 Safety findings  from completed and ongoing studies in patients with thrombocytopenia  
 
A comprehensive clinical program was designed to assess the clinical utility of eltrombopag in the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). On Nov 20, 2008, the U nited 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for eltrombopag 
(Promacta®) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have had an insufficient response  to corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins or splenectomy.  The approved indication is based on data from two pi[INVESTIGATOR_801719] (TRA100773A and B) and one ongoing long- term treatment 
study of patients with chronic ITP (EXTEND).  Safety data from 462 eltrombopag- treated subjects 
in 8 completed or ongoing [COMPANY_004] sponsored clinical efficacy studies are as follows:  
 
TRA100773A (chronic ITP Study):   A double- blind randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase II, 
parallel group study designed to inves tigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of eltrombopag administered at 30 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg as oral tablets compared with placebo once daily for 6 weeks in 117 subjects with previously treated, chronic ITP.  
 
TRA1 00773B (chronic ITP study):  A double- blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III 
study to assess the safety and efficacy of 50 mg eltrombopag administered as an oral tablet once 
daily for up to 6 weeks in 114 subjects who were previously treated for chronic ITP and who had a 
platelet count of less than 30,000/ µL.  The key safety and efficacy findings in Studies 
TRA100773A and TRA100773B are summarized below:  
 
• No dose- dependent pattern of adverse events (AEs) was observed across the eltrombopag 
30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg treatment groups. 
• No clinically meaningful differences in incidence or severity of the most common (≥5%) 
AEs were observed between subjects treated with eltrombopag 50 mg compared to placebo. 
• Similar incidences of serious adverse events (SA Es) (12% and 11%) and discontinuations 
due to AEs (7% and 5%) were observed in the placebo and eltrombopag 50 mg treatment 
groups, respectively. 
• Increases in hepatobiliary values (ALT, AST, bilirubin, alk phos) were seen in 16/164 
subjects (9.7%) in the el trombopag group (all doses), compared with 5/67 (7.5%) in the 
placebo group. These elevations in liver aminotransferase were generally asymptomatic and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy. 
• One case of thromboembolism was observed (platelet count 108,000/uL) in the eltrombopag [ADDRESS_1106724] who died from sepsis of pulmonary 
origin. 
• Preclinical findings that indicated potential for phototoxicity, cataracts and renal tubular 
toxicity did not appear to translate to clinical consequences during short- term use.  
• Transient decreases in platelet counts to levels below baseline were observed in both treatment groups after eltrombopag treatment ended. However, the decreases in platelet count were not accompanied by a clinically me aningful increase in bleeding symptoms.

TRA105325 (Extend) (chronic ITP Study ):  An open-label, dose-modification, Phase 3 extension 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag for the treatment of 302  subjects  with ITP 
who were previously enrolled in an eltrombopag trial.  Of the 302 subjects enrolled in the study, 
186 (62%) achieved a platelet count ≥50 Gi/L in the absence of rescue therapy for ≥50% of on-
treatment assessments. Response rate in subjects with and without concomitant ITP medication used as baseline was 54% an d 65%, respectively, and in subjects who were or were not 
splenectomised at baseline was 51%  and 68%, respectively.  The incidence of any bleeding 
symptoms (WHO grades 1 -4) decreased from 57% at baseline to 16% at Week 52, 19% at Week 
104, 12% at Week 156, and 14% at Week 208. Clinically significant bleeding (WHO grades 2 -4) 
decreased from 17% at baseline to 4%, 5%, 0%, and 0% at Weeks 52, 104, 156, and 208, respectively.  
 
TRA108057 (Repeat) (chronic ITP study):  An ongoing, Phase II, multi-center, open labe l single 
group repeat dose study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of repeated, short term administration of eltrombopag initially administered as 50 mg tablets once daily in subjects with 
previously treated chronic ITP (66 subjects with ongoing enrollment).  In general, the results from 
the ongoing REPEAT and EXTEND studies confirmed the safety and efficacy profile noted in the 
completed TRA100773A and TRA100773B and are summarized below: 
 
• The incidence of SAEs was 0% and 14% in REPEAT and EXTEND, respectively and discontinuations due to AEs were ≤6% across the 2 studies  
• 2/66 (3%) subjects in REPEAT and 8/109 (7%) subjects in EXTEND developed elevations of hepatobiliary laboratory values. The majority of events were asymptomatic and resolved  following drug discontinuation. 
• The proportion of Asians who had hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities (transaminases >3x ULN, bilirubin ≥1.5x ULN or ALP ≥1.5x ULN) was 15.8%, 16.7%, and 20.8%, as 
compared to 10.2%, 7.5%, and 4.5% of White- Caucasian subj ects, in TRA100773A, 
TRA100773B, and EXTEND, respectively. High plasma eltrombopag concentrations were noted in [ADDRESS_1106725] elevations (>3x ULN). 
• Four eltrombopag treated subjects developed thromboembolic events (4 in EXTEND, 
none in REP EAT). Although risk factors were present in all subjects, a causal 
relationship with eltrombopag cannot be ruled out. 
• With the exception of the hepatobiliary findings in Asian subjects, no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile of eltrombopag were found with regard to age, sex and race.  
 
TRA100773A (chronic ITP Study):  A double blind randomized, placebo controlled, Phase II, 
parallel group study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of eltrombopag administered at 30 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg as oral tables 
compared with placebo once daily for 6 weeks in 117 subjects with previously treated, chronic ITP.  
 
TRA100773B (chronic ITP study) :  A double- blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phas e III 
study to assess the safety and efficacy of 50 mg eltrombopag administered as an oral tablet once 
daily for up to 6 weeks in 114 subjects who were previously treated for chronic ITP and who had a 
platelet count of less than 30,000/ µL. 
 
The primary ana lysis of this endpoint was performed on a dataset which classified subjects as either 
responders or non- responders (primary dataset). For this primary analysis of response, only on -
therapy platelet counts were included. Responders either achieved a platele t count of ≥50 K/ µL 
09-H- 0199

 13 (from a baseline platelet count of <30 K/uL ) at the Day 43 Visit, or achieved a platelet count >200 
GK/u L and discontinued study medication prior to Day 43; and non-responders either did not 
achieve a platelet count ≥50 K/ µL at Day 43 or discontinued treatment prior to Day 43 for any 
reason other than a platelet count >200 K/ µL. Supportive data analyses were performed using a 
dataset of all platelet counts during the treatment and follow-up periods, whether or not the subject 
discontinued treatment prematurely (observed dataset).  
The odds of responding were significantly greater for the eltrombopag 50 mg treatment groups 
compared to placebo in both TRA100773A and TRA100773B (Table 1- ). The primary method of 
analysis was a logistic regression model adjusted for ITP medication use at randomization, splenectomy status and baseline platelet count ≤15 K/
µL. Results using observed Data were similar.

Median Platelet Counts:  Median platelet counts in the eltrombopag 50 mg treatment groups in 
both studies show an elevation of platelet counts as early as Day 8 and continue to rise to Day 15. 
A slight decrease in the median platelet count was observed after Day 15 in the eltrombopag  50 
mg treatment groups in both studies. This decrease is explained by [CONTACT_801751] 15 from the 50 mg treatment groups due to a platelet response >200 K/ µL.  
The median platelet levels remain elevated (>47 K/ µL) throughout daily administration of 50 mg 
eltrombopag (Days 15-43) in both studies (TRA100773A, Figure 1; TRA100773B, Figure 2).

Primary Endpoint by [CONTACT_801752]:  Data presented in this section are pooled 
analyses of the TRA100773A and TRA100773B placebo and eltrombopag 50 mg treatment groups. 
Eltrombopag increased platelet counts after up to 6 weeks of dosing both for subjects who had 
baseline platelet counts of ≤15 K/ µL and for those who had baseline platelet counts >15 K/ µL. A 
higher percentage of subjects in both treatment groups with baseline platelet counts >15 K/uL 
achieved a platelet count ≥50 K/ µL compared to subjects with a baseline platelet cou nt ≤15 K/ µL. 
No significant interaction between response and baseline platelet count status was observed (p=0.443). Analysis of responders at the Day 43 Visit demonstrated that eltrombopag increased 
platelet counts after up to 6 weeks of dosing for subjects who used ITP medication at randomization 
and for those who did not. No significant interaction between the response to treatment and the use of ITP medication at randomization was observed (p=0.893).  
 Analysis of responders at the Day 43 Visit demonstrat ed that eltrombopag increased platelet counts 
after up to 6 weeks of dosing for subjects regardless of splenectomy status.  The percentage of 
subjects in the eltrombopag treatment group who achieved a platelet count ≥50 K/
µL was similar 
regardless of splenectomy status.  No significant interaction between response and splenectomy 
status was observed (p=0.661).  
Analysis of Bleeding: Results of bleeding signs and symptoms reported via the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale during the TRA100773A and TRA100773B are presented.

 15 The WHO Bleeding Scale has 5 grades: Grade 0 - no bleeding; Grade 1 – petechiae; Grade 2 - mild 
blood loss; Grade 3 - gross blood loss; and Grade 4 - debilitating blood loss.  To analyze the data, 
subjects' assessments were summarized into categories: no bleeding (Grade 0), any bleeding (Grade 
1 to Grade 4) and clinically significant bleeding (Grad e 2 to Grade 4) (Table 2). 
 There was a decreased incidence of any bleeding (Grade 1 to Grade 4) on treatment relative to baseline in subjects who received eltrombopag.  At the baseline visit, 61% -63% of subjects in each 
eltrombopag 50 mg treatment group a nd 56% -66% of subjects in the placebo treatment groups 
reported any bleeding.  At the Day 43 Visit, 50% and 60% of subjects in the placebo treatment 
groups in TRA100773A and TRA100773B had bleeding compared with 25% in the eltrombopag 
treatment groups in TRA100773A and 39% in TRA100773B (Table 2).  
 
These data indicate a reduction in the percentage of subjects with any bleeding compared to 
baseline in the eltrombopag treatment groups.  This reduction was not statistically significant in 
Study TRA100773A.  Ho wever, in TRA100773B, the odds of any bleeding in the eltrombopag arm 
were significantly lower than that of placebo at Day 43 (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.27, p=0.029).  In 
addition, a lower proportion of eltrombopag subjects had any bleeding (as indicated by [CONTACT_801753] 1 -4) at any point in time over the course of their treatment (Day 8 up to Day 43) 
compared to subjects in the placebo group (OR=0.49, p=0.021).
 
 
 
     
 
    
 
     
 
    
TRA108057 (Repeat) (chronic ITP study):  An ongoing, Phase II, multi- center, open label single 
group repeat dose study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of repeated, short term 
administration of eltrombopag initially administered as 50 mg tablets once daily in subjects with 
previously treated chronic ITP (66 subjects with ongoing enrollment).  Across all three cycles, the 
median platelet counts at baseline of each cycle were below 35 K/ µL. Elevation in median platelet 
counts was observed by [CONTACT_2006] 8 of each cycle, with the median platelet counts of 74, 110 and 102.5 K/
µL observed in Cycles 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  By [CONTACT_2006] 15, median platelet counts were 124, 132 Table 2  WHO Bleeding Scale Assessment

 16 and 156 K/ µL in each cycle, respectively.   One week after discontinuation of eltrombopag, median 
platelet counts remained >100 K/ µL across all three cycles of treatment. Two weeks after 
discontinuation, platelet counts in each cycle returned to near basel ine levels. These results are 
similar to those from TRA100773A and TRA100773B in which median platelet counts in the 
eltrombopag treatment groups showed an elevation of platelet counts as early as Day 8 and 
continued to rise to Day 15, and in which the median platelet levels remain elevated.  
2.5 FDA approval 
On November 20, 2008 GlaxoSmithKline announced that the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for eltrombopag (Promacta®) for the treatment 
of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy.  The new drug application for eltrombopag was supported by [CONTACT_801754] d clinical 
trial information on investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801720].   The approval of eltrombopag 
was supported by a unanimous decision by [CONTACT_1622]’s Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee 
(ODAC) on May 30, 2008, in which the panel voted, 16-0 that eltrombopag demonstrated a 
favorable risk -benefit profile for the short- term treatment of patients with chronic ITP. The 
indication is based on data from the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (detailed above) in the short- term treatment 
and one ongoing long- term treat ment study of patients with chronic ITP (EXTEND). Eltrombopag 
is the first oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved for adult patients with chronic ITP.  
2.6 Rationale for dose selection  
Eltrombopag 50 mg once daily has been selected as the starting dose for this study because this 
regimen has been safe and effective in increasing platelet counts in patients with ITP and this was 
the FDA’s recommended starting dose for this patient population. A starting dose of [ADDRESS_1106726] Asian heritage (i.e., 
Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) has been implemented for the following reasons.  In 
healthy Japanese subjects, plasma eltrombopag AUC
(0-τ) was approximately 80% higher when 
compared to non- Japanese healthy subjects who were predominantly Caucasian.  Similarly, in 
patients with ITP, plasma eltrombopag exposure was approximately 70% higher in East Asian (i.e., Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) subjects as compared to non–East Asian subjects who 
were predominantly Caucasian as higher drug exposure in East- Asian subjects has been observed.  
After two weeks the dose can be increased by 25 mg per day every 2 weeks in incremental doses  up 
to a maximum dose of 150 mg (East  Asians 75 mg) once daily as detailed in the treatment plan 
(Section 5) based on the following considerations:  
 
• [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; The effective dose in MDS subjects is unknown . 
• In an ongoing open label study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), eltrombopag doses of 75 mg (n=10), 
100 mg (n=6) and 150mg (n=2) have also been given to patients receiving adriamycin and ifosfamide (AI) for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma.  Dose escalations to 
300 mg are planned in this ongoing study.  Eltrombopag is being dosed daily for 5 da ys 
before and 5 days after AI chemotherapy starting in Cycle 2.  There were 4 patients who were 
dosed at 100mg.  Two of the four had improved numeric platelet counts at the nadir in the 
cycle that they received eltrombopag compared to the cycle without elt rombopag.  All had 
higher prechemotherapy platelet counts in Cycle 2 (with eltrombopag) compared to Cycle 1 (no eltrombopag).  The one subject dose at 150mg did not take the tablets according to instructions. 
• In healthy subjects, a clear dose and exposure response was seen for eltrombopag doses of 
10 mg to 200 mg once daily for 5 days, with geometric mean AUC
(0-τ) values of 302 µ g.h/mL 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 17 for the 200 mg once daily regimen.  Eltrombopag was well tolerated in healthy subjects at all 
dose levels.  
• In ITP subjects, a dose response was seen for eltrombopag doses of 30 mg to 75 mg once 
daily, with geometric mean AUC (0-τ) values of 169 µ g.h/mL for the 75 mg once daily 
regimen.  There was no significant difference between the safety profile of ITP subjects 
receiving 30, 50 or 75 mg of eltrombopag.  Eltrombopag has been examined in a placebo-
controlled Phase II study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 183 cancer patients receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Eltrombopag, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg and placebo (1:1:1:1) was dosed for 10 
days after carboplatin and paclitaxel administration for up to 8 cycles in this study; 
eltrombopag was generally well tolerated as described in the Clinical Investigator Brochure 
(CIB)].  The eltrombopag geometric mean AUC
(0-τ) values of 191 µ g.h/mL was observe d for 
subjects at 100 mg dose group.  The study results for the 100 mg group demonstrated that 
there was evidence for increased platelet production seen in all three eltrombopag arms after 
the nadir, with a gradual rise in platelet counts from Day 8 to 18 of chemotherapy.  No apparent safety issues at 100  mg were identified.  
• Thrombocytosis is a theoretical risk of eltrombopag treatment when high dosages are 
administered. Thrombocytosis has been observed in healthy volunteers as well as in subjects 
with ITP.  None of these subjects experienced an AE related to thrombocytosis. The 
likelihood that MDS patients would develop thrombocytosis, given the underlying 
pathophysiology of their marrow disease, is likely to be low. 
• There is evidence that higher doses of growth factors are required in MDS subjects: the 
effective erythropoietin (EPO) dose in MDS is several times higher than the dose used in 
renal anemia 
(11) 
• To ensure subject safety, the current study uses a dose escalation scheme in which subjects 
are exposed to the lowest dose necessary to achieve the desired platelet count target or decrease in bone marrow blast count.  Only subjects who have tolerated the previous dose 
will be considered for the next highest dose, dependent on their last bone marrow blast and 
platelet count.  This approach minimizes potential risks while allowing the subject the 
maximum potential for benefit. 
2.7 Rationale for use of Eltrombopag in MDS  
Eltrombopag is not currently approved by t he FDA for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to 
causes of thrombocytopenia (e.g. myelodysplasia or chemotherapy) other than chronic ITP.  
Eltrombopag stimulation of the TPO receptor on the surface of hematopoietic cells may 
theoretically increase the r isk for hematologic malignancies and progression of MDS to acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML).  
 
In the controlled clinical studies in chronic ITP , patients were treated with eltrombopag for a 
maximum of 6 weeks and during this period no hematologic malignancies were reported. One hematologic malignancy (non- Hodgkin's lymphoma) was reported in the ITP extension study. 
 
A similar theoretical risk exists for MDS patients treated with erythropoietin -stimulating agents.  
However, giving erythropoietin- stimulating agents (Procrit) and myeloid stimulating agents (G -CSF) 
are now considered standard of care in MDS. The combination of G-CSF and erythropoietin has 
recently been reported to improve survival in MDS patients, including patients with RAEB-2 and high 
risk disease
(17).  Moreover, in the same study they reported no increase in rate of progression to AML.  
 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 18 Romiplostim (Nplate) is another TPO- agonist approved for refractory ITP that is administered by 
[CONTACT_801755].  A trial using romiplostim in MDS patients was 
recently reported(18).  The trial is a placebo -controlled study combining romiplostim with Vidaza 
versus Vidaza alone, and they reported that 2 of 27 MDS patients treated with the combination 
progressed to AML, which not beyond the expected rate of progression(18). The warning on the label 
for Nplate® (romiplostim) states that Nplate increases blast cell counts and increases the risk of 
progression to acute myelogenous leukemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. 
Whil e we believe that the theoretical risk of AML progression is present, it is low, and the potential 
benefit of treating life- threatening cytopenias outweighs this risk.  We will carefully monitor our 
patients for progression to AML with serial bone marrow biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], and weekly C BCs.  If a 
patient progresses to AML, it will trigger a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_123803].  
2.8 Rationale for permitting dose interruption:  
The effect of dose interruption is unknown in the MDS population. In the pooled data from ITP 
studies TRA100773A and TRA100773B, a total of 11 subjects (10%) treated with eltrombopag and 
6 subjects (9%) treated with placebo had a transient decrease in platelet counts (platelet counts <10 
Gi/L and at least 10 Gi/L less than baseline platelet count within 4 weeks of eltrombopag 
discontinuation); generally, the decreases in platelet counts were not associated with clinically 
meaningful bleeding events. We anticipate some patients on the current trial will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801721]- related issues such as fever and neutropen ia during the study, and may require 
suspension of the study drug temporarily. 
2.[ADDRESS_1106727] efficacy sustained beyond the treatment period
(20).  As this class of agents is cleared from the 
circulation and metabolized or excreted, new hematopoietic progenitor cells are being produced in the bone marrow and are not exposed to the drug. The impact on production of end- stage cells with 
life-spans in the circulation, such as red cells, platelets or neutrophils, therefore does not last more 
than days to weeks beyond cessation of therapy. [COMPANY_004] study TRA105325 is an o pen label dose 
modification extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of extended therapy of eltrombopag 
in ITP subjects. As of 2/8/2008, the extent of exposure in this population was as follows: the 
median daily dose was 50 mg, the median number of days on treatment was 194 days (6.5 months) 
and the median cumulative dose was [ADDRESS_1106728] dose or duration able to sustain blood counts in a safe and non- symptomatic 
range.

 19 2.10 Scientific and Clinical Justification of the Protocol  
The current management of MDS is suboptimal. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801722], 
lenalidomide and immunosuppressive therapy (9).  None of these are curative and remissions are 
short-lived. P atients with MDS relapsed or  refractory to standard therapy, and not eligible or suitable 
for allogeneic stem cell transplanta tion receive supportive care with transfusions and antibiotics in the 
setting of infection . Quality of life is severely impacted by [CONTACT_801756] a treatment center 
as frequently as several times every week to receive transfusions. Thus, decreasi ng or abrogating the 
need for transfusions could significantly improve the quality of life and ability to carry out normal 
daily activities.  New treatment modalities are needed for this population.  
 Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a potent endogenous cytokine and the principal regulator of platelet 
production. On binding to TPO receptors on megakaryocyte progenitors, TPO
 initiates a number of 
signal transduction events to increase the production of mature megakaryocytes and platelets.  The 
non-peptide mimetic eltr ombopag, a 2nd generation TPO -agonist, has been shown to increase 
platelets in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Eltrombopag is administered orally, well tolerated and does not induce auto- antibodies, in c ontrast 
to first -generation TPO -R agonists such as megakaryocyte growth and development factor.  
 In efficacy studies in subjects with ITP, more than 59% of subjects responded with a clinically 
meaningful increase in platelet counts, regardless of baseline platelet counts, use of concomitant 
medication and/or splenectomy status. Eltrombopag induced elevations in platelet counts ≥50 K/
µL. 
Clinically significant bleeding (WHO Bleeding Grades 2 to 4) in the eltrombopag 50 mg treatment groups was nearly one- half that observed in the placebo –treatment groups.  Summary data indicate 
in the [ADDRESS_1106729] one dose of eltrombopag (from 30 to 75 mg) in 
either a short -term study (Studies TRA100773A and TRA100773B) for up to 6 weeks or an 
ongoing open- label study (Studies TRA105325/EXTEND and TRA108057/REPEAT):  A dose-
dependent increase in platelet count was observed after 5 to 10 day repeat dosing with eltrombopag. 
Maximum platelet counts were observed approximately 2 weeks after initiating dosing, and returned to within normal limits within 2 weeks after discontinuation of eltrombopag dosing in 
healthy adult subjects. Transient decreases in platelet counts to levels below baseline were observed 
in subjects after eltrombopag treatment cycles in REPEAT. However, the decreases in platelet 
count were not accompanied by [CONTACT_801757]. Consistent 
response to eltrombopag was observed based upon analysis of the primary endpoint in the REPEAT study. Eighty- eight percent of su bjects who responded in Cycle 1, responded again in Cycle 2 or 3, 
with a similar pharmacodynamic response to eltrombopag and a decrease in bleeding symptoms as observed in Studies TRA100773A and TRA100773B. Efficacy data from the EXTEND study show 
clinical ly meaningful continuous platelet count elevations ≥50,000/
µL for at least 10 consecutive 
weeks in the majority of subjects, with 24% achieving continuous elevation of platelet counts >50,000/

produce trilineage responses as it acts at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell. Ancillary studies will address questions such as identification of  clinical and laboratory predictors of response, as 
well as cellular and molecular mechanism of eltrombopag action and the mechanism by [CONTACT_9444]

Subjects will initiate study drug at [ADDRESS_1106734] Asian 
ancestry such as Japanese,  Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean  subjects will initiate study drug at 25 
mg orally once a day . 
5.2 Dose Adjustments  (increases/decreases)  of Eltrombopag (See section 2.6) 
Patients will be enrolled on study because of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. The majority of 
patients are expected to have cytopenias in both cell lines lineages, however some patients will 
have normal or close to normal counts in one or the other lineage at baseline.  Therefore, dose 
adjustment criteria will vary depending on whether one or both lineages meet inclusion criteria, however dose adjustment will occur via the tables below and continue to the m aximum dose until 
the inclusion criterion lineage or lineages responds, according to the schema set out below, unless 
toxicity -related stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801724]. Note that patients entering the study 
based on anemia, with normal or near normal platelet count, will be expected to have an increased

 22 in their platelet count on eltrombopag, but dose escalation for anemia will not be halted unless the 
platelet count goes above 400,000/µL.  For patients entering meeting both anemia and 
thrombocyt openia eligibility criteria, dose escalation will not stop until both lineages reach the 
thresholds given below to stay on the current dose, unless platelets go over 400,000/µL or hemoglobin goes over 16.0 gr/dL, in which case drug will be discontinued for one week and the 
dose decreased by 50%.  If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801725].  
 Dose Adjustments for Patients Entering with  Platelets ≤ 30,000/ µL or transfusion -
dependence:  
Depending on response and/or tolerability, the daily dose may be increased or decreased 
according to the following rules: 
 
Platelet Count ≤ 30,000/ µL or transfusion -dependent at 
baseline  Dose Adjustment or Response  
<20,000/µL above base line or platelet transfusion 
requirement has not decreased following at least 2 weeks of

for East As ians).  
≥20,000/µL above baseline but ≤ 200,000/µL following at 
least 2 weeks of eltrombopag Keep at current dosage.  
>200,000/µL (untransfused) at any time on study  Decrease dosage by 25 mg ([ADDRESS_1106736] Asians) every [ADDRESS_1106737] 
dosage that maint ains platelet count

>400,000/µL (untransfused) at any time on study  Discontinue eltrombopag fo r one week, 
if platelets < 2 0,000; restart at 50% of 
current dose.  
 
Dose Adjustments for Patients Entering with Anemia (Hb < 9.0gr/dL or transfusion -
dependence)

 23  
If after dose escalation to 150 mg (or a maximum tolerated dose below 150 mg) there is no 
response within the study period , treatment will be discontinued and subjects will go off study per 
section 8.6.  In the event that a subject is transfused platelets for a count >10,000/ µL without a 
medical indication during the study period, the subject may continue on study drug and the response assessment may extended for an additional 4 weeks at the discretion of the principal 
investigator.  
 
5.3 Dose delays, modifications or discontin uation for non -hematologic side effects 
5.3.1 Infection:  Subjects who experience an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics will not 
have eltrombopag discontinued.  If the subject experiences infection severe enough to require 
vasopressors or intubati on, the drug will be withheld until the subject  is stable.  
 
5.3.2 Liver function abnormalities:   In the event of an increase in the ALT level to  > [ADDRESS_1106739] blood tests drawn by [CONTACT_218069] 3-
4 days. If the ALT remains > [ADDRESS_1106740], eltrombopag will be 
discontinued until ALT is < [ADDRESS_1106741].  Eltrombopag will be restarted at a dose level 25mg/day lower than the prior dose. If the toxicity appeared on a dose of 25 mg/day, 
eltrombopag will be discontinued permanently. If liver tests abnormalities return to and ALT 
of > [ADDRESS_1106742] on this reduced dose, eltrombopag will be permanently discontinued. 
 
5.4 Dose delays, modifications or discontinuation for hematologic si de effects  
5.4.1 Thrombosis/Embolism:  Subjects who experience a deep venous thrombosis or a 
pulmonary embolus, a TIA or stroke, or a myocardial infarction at any time while on 
eltrombopag will discontinue the drug and go off study.  Subjects with platelet  counts of > 
50,000/
µL at the time of thrombosis will be treated with enoxaparin or another appropriate 
anticoagulant as clinically indicated until the platelet count drops below 20,000/ µL with 
discontinuation of eltrombopag. They will be treated for the thrombotic event as otherwise 
clinically -indicated. 
 
5.4.2 Peripheral blood smear shows new morphological abnormalities : The presence of 
persistent morphologic abnormalities (red cell teardrop forms or nucleated red blood cells; 
immature white blood cells) or the development o f significant worsening of anemia or 
neutropenia while on study will require discontinuation of eltrombopag and performance of a bone marrow examination to assess for development of abnormal fibrosis or progression to 
RAEB -[ADDRESS_1106743] eltrombopag discontinued for one 
week if platelets increase to >400,000/ul or Hb to > 16 gr/dL, and if counts have fallen 
below these cutoffs, drug can be restarted at 50% dosage. 
5.5 Extended access to study drug  
Subjects with response at week 16 or week 20 may continue study medication (extended access) 
per dosing criteria given in section 5.2.  Since there are currently no guidelines for length of therapy with eltrombopag in this subject 
population, drug administration for each responding subject may be continued for as long as the study remains open if there is clinical benefit to the subject  and no contraindication to the

 [ADDRESS_1106744]  drug tapered, stopped, and/or re -started .  The 
criteria for dose adjustments during the extended  access phase are:  
 
Once platelets >50,000/µL, Hb > 10 g/dL in the absence of transfusions, and neutrophils 
> 1,000 for more than 8 weeks, eltrombopag will be discontinued.  If platelets drop to 
<30,000/µL, Hb to <9g/dL, or ANC to <500/µL the dose can be re- initiated back to the 
full dose. Once count stabilization again occurs, a slow dose reduction by [ADDRESS_1106745] response, and maintain the 
response, they will be taken off study after two years.  
 After the study is closed, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_801726].  
The research team will help arrange follow -up care with the referring physician . 
5.6 Permitted Supportive care  
• Transfusion supportive care (e.g., blood and platelets) as clinically indicated. 
• Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G- CSF or erythropoietin) as clinically indicated. 
Filgrastim (G -CSF) must be held for 3 weeks prior to enrollment bone marrow biopsy and 
prior  to each study assessment bone marrow biopsy.  
• Estrogens or combination oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (OCPs ) as indicated for uterine bleeding . 
• Prophylactic antibiotics and antivirals as clinically indicated.  
• Romiplostim (N -Plate) or IL -11 (Neumega) should not be administered. 
5.7 Concurrent Medi cations: 
Rosuvastatin ( Crestor®):  In vitro studies demonstrated that eltrombopag is not a substrate for the 
organic anion transporter polypeptide, OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter in vitro and 
as evidenced by [CONTACT_801759] -
administered in a clinical drug interaction study. When co- administered with eltrombopag, a 
reduced dose of rosuvastatin should be considered and careful monitoring should be undertaken. In 
clinical trials with eltrombopag, a dose reduction of rosuvastatin by 50% was recommended for co-administration of rosuvastatin and eltrombopag. Concomitant administration of eltrombopag and 
other OATP1B1 substrates (including pravastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin)  should be undertaken 
with caution.  
Inhibitors of Cytochrome p450:  In vitro studies demonstrate that CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 are involved in the oxidative metabolism of eltrombopag. Trimethoprim, gemfibrozil, ciprofloxacin, 
fluvoxamine and other moderate or strong inhibitors of CYPs may therefore theoretically result 
enhanced activity of eltrombopag, however these interactions have not yet been established in 
clinical studies. Subjects on cyclosporine requiring prophylaxis against PCP should be given 
inhaled pentamidine instead of TMP/SULF.  NIH SAA patients are routinely placed on 
pentamidine instead of TMP/SULF for PCP prophylaxis to avoid potential marrow- suppressive 
effects of TMP/SULF anyway.  Other CYP inhibitors can be used concomitantly but with careful attention to possible increased eltrombopag activity and toxicity. 
 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 25 Other medications: Subjects  may continue on any of the medications that they were prescribed 
prior to study enrollment for co-morbid conditions, and standard anti -infectious prophylaxis 
medications including valacyclovir, and voriconazole. 
 
5.8 Instructions to subjects  
 
Timing in relation to food : Administration of a single [ADDRESS_1106746] that included dai ry products reduced plasma eltrombopag AUC [0-∞] 
by 59% (90% CI: 54%, 64%) and C max by 65% (90% CI: 59%, 70%). Food low in calcium [<50 mg 
calcium] including fruit, lean ham, beef, and unfortified (no added calcium, magnesium, iron) fruit 
juice, unfortified soy milk, and unfortified grain did not s ignificantly impact plasma eltrombopag 
exposure, regardless of calorie and fat content.  Subjects will be advised to take eltrombopag on an 
empty stomach ([ADDRESS_1106747]  2 hours after a meal).  
 
Timing in relation to antacids: Eltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as aluminum, 
calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc.  Antacids, dairy products and other products 
containing polyvalent cations such as mineral supplements should not be administered less than 4 
hours before, or after e ltrombopag dosing to avoid significant reduction in eltrombopag absorption.  
 
Vigorous activities:  should be avoided, as mild trauma could result in bleeding.

Criteria for  response to the primary endpoint : A treatment response will be any increase in a 
cytopenia in the  lineage that fulfilled eligibility criteria for enrollment, which  is defined as 
follows.  Platelet  response is defined as platelet count increases to 20,000/ µL above baseline  at [ADDRESS_1106760] is transfused 
platelets for a count >10,000/ µL without a medical indication during the study period, the subject 
may continue on study drug and the response assessment may extended for an additional [ADDRESS_1106761] the response assessment extended an additional 4 
weeks, to week 20, at the discretion of the principal investigator. Erythroid response for subjects with a pretreatment hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL will be defined as an increase in hemoglobin 
by > 1.5g/dL without packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion support, or a reduction in the 
units of PRBC transfusions by [CONTACT_2669] 50% during the eight consecutive weeks prior to response assessment - compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 
weeks.  Neutrophil response will be defined in those with a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5 x 10
9/L as at least a 100% increase or an absolute increase > 0.5 x 
109/L.  Subjects with a platel et, erythroid, and/or neutrophil response at 16 to 20 weeks may 
continue study medication (extended access) until they meet an off study criteria.   Subjects with 
erythroid, or neutrophil response at 16 weeks may continue study medication for an additional 4 
weeks (to ensure eligibility) prior to being consented for entry into the extended access part of the trial.  Patients may remain on the extended access until they met an off study criteria.  
 
Transfusion Units:   Single donor apheresis platelets have become the primary source of platelets 
in the US. Therefore, one transfused, single donor platelet apheresis product is considered 1 unit for protocol purposes. In the rare case that a patient received pooled platelet products, each 
completed platelet transfusion (1 bag) independent of donor units pooled, will be counted as 1 
unit transfused.  
8.2 Endpoints  
The primary endpoint will be the portion of drug responders as defined by [CONTACT_218075]/or platelet transfusion requirements  or the propo rtion of subjects who meet erythroid 
response or neutrophil response criteria
(1) Platelet response is defined as platelet count increases 
to 20,000/ µL above baseline at 16 to 20 weeks, or stable platelet counts  with transfusion 
independence for a minimum of 8 weeks.   Erythroid response for subjects with a pretreatment 
hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL will be defined as an increase in hemoglobin by > 1.5g/dL 
without packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion support, or a reduction in the units of PRBC 
transfusions by [CONTACT_2669] 50% during the eight consecutive weeks prior to response assessment - compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 weeks.   Neutrophil response 
will be defined in those wit h a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5 x 10
9/L as at 
least a 100% increase or an absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L.  Subjects with a platelet, erythroid, 
and/or neutrophil response at 16 to 20 weeks may continue study medication (extended a ccess) 
until they meet an off study criteria.  Subjects with erythroid, or neutrophil response at 16 weeks may continue study medication for an additional 4 weeks (to ensure eligibility) prior to being 
consented for entry into the extended access part of the trial.   Patients may remain on the 
extended access until they met an off study criteria.  
 The toxicity profile will be measured using the CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria. 
 
Secondary endpoints  will include incidence of grade 2 or higher bleeding events as measured by 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 30 CTCAE v. 4.0; changes in serum thrombopoietin level, measured at16 to 20 weeks; progression 
to higher risk MDS as measured by [CONTACT_148628](1); and discontinuation of drug in robust 
responders enrolled in extended access . 
8.[ADDRESS_1106762] experience with this patient population, a novel treatment with a response rate 30% or 
more would generally warrant further investigation, while the treatment would be rendered non-
effective if it has a response rate of 10% or less.  We will use Simon’s Two-Stage Minimax Design 
((21)) with a response probability of 10% or less to terminate the treatment and the hypothesized 
actual response probability of 30% or more. The sample size is determined by [CONTACT_11700] H
0: p≤10% versus the alternative H 1: p ≥30% at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1106763] stage, then an additional 10 subjects will be 
accrued, bringing the total number of subjects to n = 25. The null hypothesis of p ≤ 10% will be 
accepted if the total number of responders within  4 months is 5 or less.  
 
Subjects who discontinue the study drug prematurely (before 20 weeks ):  Platelet count 
measurement will be attempted even if a subject discontinues study drug .  Importa nt covariates for 
this study include age, karyotype, IPSS score, duration of platelet transfusion dependence, marrow 
cellularity and TPO level. The Cox proportional hazard model will be applied to time- to-event 
variables, such as time- to-death, time -to-relapse and time -to-progression. Since the sample size is 
relatively small, we will mostly consider Cox models with a single continuous or categorical covariate to ensure reasonable statistical accuracy. Such analysis is exploratory in nature and aimed 
at generating statistical hypothesis for future studies. Subjects who withdraw from the study for 
reasons other than lack of efficacy or toxicity (rendering platelet count missing) may be replaced.  All other subjects should be evaluable for efficacy (i.e. all subjects who withdraw for treatment 
related concerns prior to end of week 16 or 20  assessment for toxicity or failure to respond will be 
counted as non- responders at the primary time points (intent to treat paradigm )). Based on the 
assumed dropout rate of 1 5-20% and the goal of having [ADDRESS_1106764] model will be applied to time- to-
event variables, such as time- to-death, time- to-relapse and time -to-progression. Since the sample 
size is relatively small, we will mostly consider Cox models with a single continuous or categorical covariate to ensure reasonable statistical accuracy. Such analysis is exploratory in nature and aimed 
at generating statistical hypothesis for future studies. Graphical tools will be used to display the 
appropriate estimates (i.e. estimated proportions, the cumulative incidence curves, Kaplan -Meier 
curves) and their correspo nding 95% confidence intervals.  Methods based on univariate and/or 
multivariable regression, analysis of variance, and logistic regression with the above covariates will also be employed if deemed appropriate. For example, a logistic regression model will be used to 
evaluate which patients will have a higher probability of response at 16 to 20 weeks or at an 
extended time period. Again, since the sample size is small, it is likely that categorical covariates

 31 specified by [CONTACT_801763], and exploratory data analysis techniques, 
such as classification and regression trees, will be used to evaluate the threshold choices.   
 
The 5 patients accrued to date will not be included in the primary analysis of the Two- Stage Minimax 
Design, but will be included as an exploratory analysis for the endpoints considered.  Amendment L submitted on 2/13/2013, included revisions to the eligibility criteria to include MDS patients with anemia and revisions to  the primary response criteria to also include erythroid and neutrophil 
responses (which prior to Amendment L were secondary response criteria).  Given the significant 
changes to the protocol it was decided it would not be appropriate to include the first 5 patients in the 
primary analysis.  The accrual ceiling for the protocol is 30 subjects, so this will allow for the goal of 
having 25 evaluable subjects.  The review of Amendment of L included both a Scientific and Statistical review, both of which were approved, and the IRB approved Amendment L on 5/13/2013. 
8.5 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_167854] a specified set of treatment related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) that occur during the treatment period does not substantially 
exceed an anticipated rat e.  The following specified TRSAEs determined to be probably or 
definitely related to eltrombopag will be considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]: 
1. Death  
2. Any Grade IV toxicity excluding readily reversible metabolic or laboratory abnormalities    
3. Grade IV thrombosis/embolism 
4. Progression to acute myeloid leukemia by [CONTACT_56649] (20% or greater bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts), or other marrow morphology changes deemed concerning by [CONTACT_4520]  
5. Increase in reticulin fibrosis grade by 3 points above baseline  
We anticipate the rate of these specified TRSAEs within the 16 to 20 weeks study period to be 20% or less. Following Geller et al. ( Advances in Clinical Trial Biostatistics, 2004 ), our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801730] a Bayesian approach. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801731]’s exceeds this benchmark rate of 20% is at least 90%. We take our prior distribution to be a 
beta distribution with parameters (α, β) = (0.6, 2.4). The parameter are chosen so that the mean α / (α 
+ β) = 0.2 as the expected proportion of specified TRSAE’s and the sum α + β = 3 as the “worth” we place on our prior clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. This indicates that the relative weight we place on our prior 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_197727] 3/30=10% of the weight we will place on the results of the new study.  Hence when we make decisions about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098], the data from this  study will dominate over the prior 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  Since we have seen in the past that the first few subjects to be accrued are possibly sicker than the rest of the subjects in the sample, we will start safety monitoring when [ADDRESS_1106765] developed any of the specified 
TRSAE’s reaches:  
≤ 6 3 
≤ 9 4 
≤ 13 5 
≤ 17 6

 [ADDRESS_1106766] developed any of the specified 
TRSAE’s reaches:  
≤ 21 7 
≤ 25 8 
 
We investigated the performance of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106558] a simulation study. In each simulation 
run, we generated a study with 25 independent Bernoulli trials, each had a probability p for having 
TRSAE an d q=1-p for not having TRSAE and compared the TRSAE outcomes with the above 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106559].  We repeated the simulation 100,000 
times and computed the proportion of stopped studies (i.e. “number of stopped studies”/100,000) 
which were stopped using the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  The following table summarizes the proportions 
of stopped studies under a number of scenarios for p: 
 
Probability of TRSAE = p  0.10 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.40 
Proportion of Stopped 
Studies  2.4%  22.7% 41.5%  61.5%  89.7%  
Average number of subjects  24.[ADDRESS_1106767] that our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106560] a low probability stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study when the 
proportion of specified TRSAE is below the benchmark value of 20%, and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a study is high when the true proportion of TRSAE exceeds this benchmark value. Based on these 
results, we believe that our Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106561].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1106768]  choice :  Subjects  may withdraw from study at their request.  The risks of 
withdrawing will be discussed, as will alternative treatment options.  Those subjects who choose to withdraw while taking eltrombopag will be strongly en couraged to continue to have labs monitored 
until he/she initiates alternative therapy.  
 8.6.2 Per principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21781]:  Should any of the following adverse events occur 
during the [ADDRESS_1106769] will be followed until resolution of the event.  Labs will be 
monitored through 30 days off study drug time point or until he/she initiates alternative disease 
directed therapy at which time the subject’s participation on this study will be considered complete 
and the subject will go off study. 
• Intolerance of eltrombopag not resolved by [CONTACT_29874] 
• Life threatening acute hypersensitivity reaction  
• Thrombosis/embolism (DVT, PE, stroke or TIA, myocardial infarction) other than central line thrombosis  
• Persistent hepatotoxicity as defined in section 5.3.2  
• New or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s) (see section 5.4.2) 
• No treatment response by [CONTACT_5875] 16, (20 weeks at P.I. discretion)  
• Any Grade IV toxicity considered related to the study medication excluding readily reversible metabolic or laboratory abnormalities or hematologic toxicities  
• Significant progression of disease or a concomitant condition that would make the subject ineligib le for further protocol participation

Once off study (either by [CONTACT_801764] [INVESTIGATOR_21781]), subjects will be referred back to 
his or her referring physician or consented to the NHLBI  evaluation and treatment protocol (94-
H-0010) for consideration for standard therapy or evaluation for eligibility for another Branch 
protocol, depending on what is considered to be in the best interest of the subject. 
 
9 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
9.1 Safety Monitoring  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_106567], efficacy and safety data will be monitored by [CONTACT_9532], Neal S. Young, M. D. 
 
NIH  Intramural IRB. Accrual and safety data will be monitored and reviewed annually by [CONTACT_5030] (IRB). Prior to implementation of this study, the protocol and the proposed patient consent will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_801765] (IRB) operating according to Title [ADDRESS_1106770] continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or follow up of subjects or data and sample analysis is 
ongoing. 
 
NHLBI DSMB :  The NHLBI Data Safety and Monitoring Board will review the protocol at 6 to 
12 month intervals, as determined by [CONTACT_4318] . A progress report will be forwarded to the 
DSMB at thes e times and their recommendations will be expeditiously implemented. The DSMB 
may recommend early termination of the study for considerations of safety and efficacy.  
 
FDA:   An annual progress report, protocol amendments, and changes in the status of the protocol 
will be forwarded to the FDA using the following address:

9.2 Event  Characterization and Reporting  
Events include adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), protocol deviations 
(PD), unanticipated problems (UP), and non- compliance.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_218035] (AEs, protocol deviations, UPs, SAEs)  to 
determine the seriousness, expectedness, and reportability of the event.  As required and/or 
needed, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_302515]. 
9.2.1 Definit ions 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 34 Adverse Event (AE):   Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not 
considered related to the research.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  A serious adverse event that:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred);  
• results in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity;  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction:  Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 Serious event : An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if 
it requires immediate corrective action by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or IRB to protect the safety,  welfare or rights 
of subjects.  
 
Unexpected adverse reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed;  or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adver se 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP):   Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event:   An unanticipated problem that does not fit 
the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involves risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research 
data.  For example, report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of 
study records, or unaccounted-for study drug. 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 35  
Protocol Deviation (PD) :  Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research 
protocol.  
Non-compliance:  The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, 
or regulatory  requirements for the protection of human research. Noncompliance may be further 
characterized as:  
 
1. Serious non -compliance : Non -compliance that:  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Com promises the integrity of the NIH HRPP.  
d. Invalidates the study data. 
 
2. Continuing non -compliance :  Non -compliance that is recurring.  An example may be a 
pattern of non- compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non -compliance 
will continue. Continuing noncompliance could also include a failure to respond to IRB requests 
to resolve previous allegations of non- compliance.  
 
3. Minor (non -serious) non -compliance:   Non -compliance that, is neither serious nor 
continuing. 
9.2.2 Adverse Events  Management:  
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those observed by [CONTACT_107696], will be recorded .  The AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_801766] 
4.0.  A copy of the criteria can be down-loaded at   http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf
. 
 Eltrombopag has known and unknown toxicity profiles, thus, any observed or volunteered adverse events that are as listed in the Package Insert and/or Investigator’s Brochure will not be 
reported unless (1) the adverse event was not present at baseline exam; (2) the adverse event is 
previously unknown (not on the label); (3) the adverse event is more severe than on the label; (4) 
the frequency of the adverse events increases above the listed frequency; or (5) meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.  
 
Non-hematologic a bnormal laboratory findings  used to evaluate the safety of this protocol 
regimen will be collected to include any change from laboratory assessments done prior to first dose of eltrombopag that result in a progression to a grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicity and/or are 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: 
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_12244] r to be of significant clinical impact  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
 In view of the underlying illness (bone marrow failure), many patients may enter the study with 
compromised hematologic indices that would be classified as toxicities.  Therefore, we will look 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 36 at the relative decline of hematologic parameters and length of time to recovery to the patient’s 
baseline as more significant than absolute values of these parameters. The laboratory toxicities 
will be graded by [CONTACT_167894] 4.0 or as mild, moderate, severe or life 
threatening according to the tables below:  
 
Attrib ution of Adverse Events:  
 
Criteria for Determining Category of Relationship of Clinical Adverse Events to Treatment  
 
1  
Not related  This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to e xtraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
 
2  
Unlikely  
(must have two)  In general, this category can be considered applicable to those adverse events which, after 
careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to 
the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered unlikely if or when:  
1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug.  
2. It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
3. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
4. It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
 
3  Possibly  
(must have two)  This category appli es to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the test drug 
administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An adverse event may be considered possibly r elated if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug.  
2. It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
3. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
4  Probably  
(must have three)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of  certainty to be 
related to the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered probably related if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_36712]'s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists (e.g., bone marrow depression, fixed drug 
eruptions, tardive dyskinesia).  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
5  
Definitely  
(must have all)  This category  applies to those adverse events which, the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to test drug.  An adverse event may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of  the test drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose with re -exposure to 
drug.  (Note:  this is not to be construed as requiring re -exposure of the subject, 
however, a category of definitely related can only be used when a recurrence is observed.)  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
Grading of Adverse events:

care activities of daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using 
the toilet, taking  
medications, and not bedridden)  
4 Life-threatening 
consequences  urgent intervention indicated.  
5 Death  Death r elated to AE.  
 
Duration of adverse event collecting and  reporting:   Thirty days after the last dose of study drug, 
adverse event reporting will be limited to those events considered possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study drug. 
 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events Management  
 
Serious adverse events will be attributed as definitely (clearly related to the research), probably 
(likely related to the research), possibly (may be related to the research), unlikely (doubtfully related to the research) and unr elated (clearly not related to the research).  
 
Treatment related SAEs (TRSAEs)  are those attributed as definitely, probably, or possibly. As 
detailed in section 8.5  that will be monitored and considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801732] 4 toxicity considered to be probably 
or definitely  related to study medication.  John Tisdale, MD, will serve as the independent monitor 
who reviews the attribution of TRSAEs.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801733] (to receive a transfusion) or upgrading to ICU for routine 
monitoring will not be reported as an SAE. 
 Duration of Serious Adverse Event collecting and reporting:  The collection of SAEs will begin 
on the first day of initiation of the study drug and will continue along as the subject is on study.   
SAE  reporting will continue as long as the subject remains on study.

Reports to the IRB and CD:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218039], and 
PDs that are not Serious to the I RB, not more than [ADDRESS_1106775] report all deaths (that are not UPs) to the CD as soon as possible, but not more than [ADDRESS_1106776] learns of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] At continuing review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16161] a summary of:  
• All UPs  
• All PDs  
• All AEs (except for those granted a waiver of reporting)  
• If, while preparing the continuing review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_31797] a greater frequency or level of severity 
of expected adverse events than was previously identified in the protocol or investigational brochure (IB), these should be reported separately as a UP.  If such an observation occurs before the time of 
continuing IRB review, it should be reported to the IRB and CD as a UP in the time frames noted 
above and summarized at the time of continuing review.  
 
Exclusions to data reporting:  
The following Adverse Events will be captured only in the source documents and will not be reported 
to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
• Laboratory values that do not meet the definition of AE listed in Section 9.2.2. 
• All grade 1 events listed as  expected in the investigator’s brochure, package insert, and/or 
anticipated events.  
• In view of the underlying illness, MDS, all patients w ill enter the study with abnormally low 
blood counts that would meet criteria as grade 3 or more commonly grade 4 toxicity, and 
requiring frequent platelet and/or red cell transfusions, and thus AEs regarding hematologic lab 
values including thrombocytopen ia or platelet -transfusion dependence, anemia or red cell 
transfusion dependence, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or leukopenia will not be evaluable. Thus, 
we will collect hematologic laboratory values in the subject’s source documents, but will not 
record or report these abnormalities as adverse events.  
 
In addition, the following non-hematologic AEs will be captured only in the source documents and will not be  reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review: 
• Because eltrombopag (Promacta®) is an FDA appro ved drug with known toxicity profiles, 
any observed or volunteered adverse events that are listed on the package insert will not be 
reported unless (1) the adverse event is previously unknown (not on the package insert); 
(2) the adverse event is more severe than on the package insert; or (3) meets the criteria for 
a serious adverse event. The collection of AEs information will begin on the first day of 
initiation of therapy. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] NHLBI DSMB Reporting : 
Reports of serious adverse events that are unexpected and thought to be related to the experimental 
drug will also be forwarded as soon as possible but no later than seven (7) days in the case of death or 
life-threatening serious adverse events or within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of all other 
forms of serious adverse event  to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). A summary of 
events will be included in DSMB reports for review by [CONTACT_4318].

 IND Safety Reports to th e FDA (Refer to 21 CFR 312.32) 
The sponsor must notify FDA in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1106777] also notify FDA of any 
unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the informatio n. 
 
15-day reporting 
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The 
sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences 
of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in 
the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 
 The sponsor must submit each IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 3500A.

Subjects who become pregnant during the study should discontinue the study immediately.  The 
investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any subject who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study.  The investigator, or his/her designee, will submit 
pregnancy information to the DSMB, IRB, FDA and [COMPANY_001]  within two weeks of learning of a 
subject’s pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the DSMB, IRB, FDA and [COMPANY_001] .  Generally, follow-up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_1106779] by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to the DSMB, IRB, FDA and [COMPANY_001] .

electronic system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The principal 
investigator, associate investigators, research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
with the data management efforts.  Data will be abstracted from Clinical Center progress notes as 
well as from progress note s forwarded from the home physician. Laboratory values from referring 
home physicians will be entered into the system.  All human subjects personally identifiable 
information (PII) eligibility and consent verification will be recorded.  Primary data obtained during 
the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites 
that comply with NIH security standards.  Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant, e.g., unique code or 
minimum PII required for subject identification.  
 In order to maintain patient confidentiality, all communications relating to the study will identify 
participants by [CONTACT_801768]. No personally identifiable information will be sent 
to the DSMB, IRB, FDA or [COMPANY_001] .  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may also 
request access to all study records, including source documentation for inspection. 
 
End of study procedures :  Data will  be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected 
database until it is no longer of scientific value.  
 
Loss or destruction of data :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect 
patient confidentiality and trial  data has occurr ed, the IRB will be notified.  
 Publication Policy : Given the research mandate of the NIH, patient data including the results of

accordance with the appropriate regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a 
monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent form (ICF) and documentation of the ICF process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and accurate 
recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted 
information with individual subjects’ records and source documents (subject’s charts, la boratory 
analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance with the protocol. The 
monitors also will inspect the clinical site r egulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements 
(Office for Human Research Protections- OHRP), FDA and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are 
being followed. During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  
 The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms and pertinent

10. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION 
10.[ADDRESS_1106782] Selection  
MDS is not known to show a racial or gender preference in incidence, as such, there will be no restrictions based on ethnicity or gender in patient selection. One of the difficulties clinicians face is distinguishing between hypoplastic MDS and aplastic anemia when faced with a hypoplastic 
marrow.  For the purposes of this protocol, patients with hypocellular marrows (<30%) will be 
classified as MDS.   A cytogenetic abnormality in the setting of a hypoplastic marrow makes a 
diagnosis of MDS. When there are no cytogenetic abnormalities the distinction between MDS and 
aplastic anemia needs to be made on morphologic grounds.  However, dyserythropoiesis, which is a feature of both AA and MDS will not be used as a sole diagnostic criterion. 
 
The Hematology branch has a robust source of patients with bone marrow failure and we do not 
anticipate recruitment to be problematic. Sinc e 1997, we have screened over 550 bone marrow 
failure patients for the actively enrolling protocols to include 250 patients with MDS (about 
35/year). We expect a similar distribution by [CONTACT_545], gender and age as described below :  
 
• By [CONTACT_547]:   99 females (36 %), and 160 males (64%).  
• By [CONTACT_654]:    12-85 (median 61), subjects under 18:  3 (1%) 
• By [CONTACT_545]:   16 Asian (6.4%), 14 Black (5.6%), 30 Hispanic (12%), and 190 white (76%).   
 
For subjects of Asian heritage :  Plasma eltrombopag exposure was approximately 70% hi gher in 
East Asian (i.e. Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) subjects as compared to non -East Asian 
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 42 subjects who were predominantly Caucasian. Therefore, subjects of Asian heritage will be included 
but they will be initiated at a lowered dose and monitored closely.  
 
For subjects with renal impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied 
after administration of eltrombopag to adult patients with renal impairment. Following administration of a single 50 mg dose, there was a trend for reduced plasma eltrombopag exposure in patients with renal impairment, but there was substantial variability and significant overlap in 
exposures between patients with renal impairment and healthy volunteers.  Therefore , patients with 
impaired renal functio n will be included but participation will be monitored closely. 
 
For subjects with hepatic impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied 
after administration of eltrombopag to adult patients with hepatic impairment. Following the 
administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0- ∞ of eltrombopag was increased by 41% in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment and by 80% to 90% in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy volunteers. Therefore, patients with min imally impaired 
hepatic function will be included but participation will be monitored closely.  
For pregnant and nursing mothers :  Eltrombopag was not teratogenic when studied in pregnant 
rats and rabbits but caused a low incidence of cervical ribs (a feta l variation) and reduced fetal body 
weight at doses that were maternally toxic.  There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of 
eltrombopag in pregnant women. The effect of eltrombopag on human pregnancy is unknown. 
Therefore , women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) and for the duration of study participation.  
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while on study, her treating physician  
should be informed immediately.  
Recruitment efforts: The study will be listed on the clinicaltrials.gov, Clinical Center research 
studies, The MDS Foundation, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute patient recruitment websites.  If recruitment goals are not met, recruitment plan will be developed by [CONTACT_801769]. Hematologists and Oncologists throughout the country will 
be informed about the protocol by [CONTACT_31711]. 
 
Competition between Branch Protocols:  There ar e no competing Branch protocols for this 
patient population.   The ability to offer patients who fail to have an optimal response to initial 
immunosuppression protocols another option will be a very positive addition to our MDS program. 
 
Reimbursement for protocol, travel, food, and lodging will be consistent with  NHLBI DIR 
Travel and Lodging Compensation of Clinical Research Subjects policy or institutional guidelines.

 43 WARNING: RISK FOR HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC 
HEPATITIS C  
 
RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY 
 
See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. 
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may 
increase the risk of hepatic decompensation.  
 
PROMACTA may increase the risk of severe and potentially life -threatening hepatotoxicity. 
Monitor hepatic function and discontinue dosing as recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Warnings and Precautions:  
 
Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C  
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may increase the risk of hepatic decompensati on. In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic 
hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, ascites and encephalopathy occurred more frequently on the arm 
receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals (7%) than the placebo plus antivirals arm 
(4%) . Patients with low albumin levels (less than 3.5 g/dL) or Model for End- Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1106783], and bilirubin prior to initiation of PROMACTA, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase, and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. PROMACTA 
inhibits UDP- glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, which may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If bilirubin is elevated, perform fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat testing within [ADDRESS_1106784] in patients 
with normal liver function or greater than or equal to 3 x baseline (or greater than [ADDRESS_1106785], whichever is the lower) in patients with pre- treatment elevations in transaminases and are:  
• progressively increasing, or 
• persistent for greater than or equal to 4 weeks, or  
• accompanied by [CONTACT_218080], or 
• accompanied by [CONTACT_218081].  
 If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with PROMACTA is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then consider cautiously reintroducing PROMACTA and measure serum 
liver tests weekly during the dose adjustment phase. Hepatotoxicity may reoccur if PROMACTA is 
reinitiated. If liver test abnormalities pe rsist, worsen, or recur, then permanently discontinue 
PROMACTA.  
 Isolated cases of severe liver injury were identified in clinical trials. The elevation of liver 
laboratory values occurred approximately three months after initiation of PROMACTA. In all cases, 
the event resolved following PROMACTA discontinuation.

 44 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications  
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with 
PROMACTA. Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications include d both venous and 
arterial events and were observed at low and at normal platelet counts.  
 
Consider the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolism when administering PROMACTA to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, 
antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use PROMACTA in an attempt to normalize 
platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain target platelet 
counts.  
In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, 3% 
(31/955) treated with PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic event compared with 1% (5/484) on 
placebo. The majority of events were of the portal venous system (1% in patients treated with 
PROMACTA versus less than 1% for placebo).  
 In a controlled trial in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia not related to ITP undergoing elective invasive procedures (N = 292), the risk of thrombotic events was increased in 
patients treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily. Seven thrombotic complications (six patients) were reported in the group that received PROMACTA and three thrombotic complications 
were reported in the plac ebo group (two patients). All of the thrombotic complications reported in 
the group that received PROMACTA were portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Symptoms of PVT 
included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Five of the six patients in the group tha t 
received PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with PROMACTA and at a platelet count above 200 x 10
9/L. The risk of portal venous 
thrombosis was increased in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures.  
Cataracts 
In the three controlled clinical trials in adults with chronic ITP, cataracts developed or worsened in 
15 (7%) patients who received 50 mg of PROMACTA daily and 8 (7%) placebo-group patients. In 
the extension trial, cataracts developed or worsened in 11% of patients who underwent ocular examination prior to therapy with PROMACTA. In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, cataracts developed or worsened in 8% of patients 
treated with PROMACTA and 5% of patients treated with placebo.  
 Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents. Perform a baseline ocular examination prior to administration of PROMACTA and, during therapy with PROMACTA, 
regularly monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cataracts.  
 Clinical Experience:  
For full information on clinical experience with eltrombopag in for the treatment of all approved indications, see PACKAGE INSERT.  
 
Severe Aplastic Anemia:  In the single -arm, open- label trial, 43 patients with severe aplastic anemia 
received PROMACTA. Eleven patients (26%) were treated for greater than 6 months and 7 patients 
(16%) were treated for greater than [ADDRESS_1106786] common adverse reactions (greater than or 
equal to 20%) were nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, and headache.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category C  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of eltrombopag use in pregnancy. In animal 
reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, there was evidence of embryo lethality and reduced fetal weights at maternally toxic doses. PROMACTA should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
 In an early embryonic development study, female rats received oral eltrombopag at doses of 10, 20, 
or 60 mg/kg/day (0.8, 2, and 6 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in 
patients with ITP at 75 mg/day and 0.3, 1, and 3 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Increased pre- and post-
implantation loss and reduced fetal weight were observed at the highest dose which also caused 
maternal toxicity.  
 Eltrombopag was administered orally to pregnant rats at 10, 20, or 60 mg/kg/day (0.8, 2, and 6 
times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 mg/da y 
and 0.3, 1, and 3 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Decreased fetal weights (6% to 7%) and a slight increase in the 
presence of cervical ribs were observed at the highest dose which also caused maternal toxicity. 
However, no evidence of major structural malformations was observed.  
09-H- 0199  
Neal S. Young, M.D.  
5/24/2019 (Amendment GG/3 3) 
 46  
Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral eltrombopag doses of 30, 80, or 150 mg/kg/day (0.04, 0.3, 
and 0.5 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 
mg/day and 0.02, 0.1, and 0.3 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in 
patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). No evidence of fetotoxicity, embryo lethality, or 
teratogenicity was observed.  
 
In a pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study in pregnant rats (F0), no adverse effects on 
maternal reproductive function or on the development of the offspring (F1) were observed at doses 
up to 20 mg/kg/day (2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 
mg/day and similar to the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Eltrombopag was detected in the plasma of offspring (F1). The plasma 
concentrations in pups increased with dose following administration of drug to the F0 dams. 
 
Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether eltrombopag is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from 
PROMACTA, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue PROMACTA taking into account the importance of PROMACTA to the mother.

10.5 Informed Consent Processes and Procedures  
Note: Effective January 21, 2019, a witness to the signature [CONTACT_801775] (whether initially approved by [CONTACT_801771] 21, 2019) is no longer a requirement.  
 The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, t he procedures and treatments 
involved and their attendant risks and discomforts and benefits, and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801739]. An associate, principal, or medically respons ible investigator on this protocol delegated to obtain the informed 
consent  will lead the discussion. The consent form will be signed in the presence of the 
investigator and a witness prior to commencement of the treatment plan. The treatment plan and 
risks will be discussed again and in detail during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801740].  
 If at any time during participation in the protocol, new information becomes available relating to 
risks, adverse events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to each enrolled or prospective patient.  Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the 
informed consent amended to reflect relevant information.  
 
If it is anticipated that a potential research participant previously enrolled in the screening 
protocol, may not be able to be physically present at the NIH at the time of consent into this protocol, we will use the following telephone consent process in accordance with the NIH Policy: 
MAS 77 -2: 
• Ideally, a copy of the consen t document will be provided at the time of screening so in the 
event the subject is found eligible, there is sufficient time to make an informed decision or come up with questions to bring up during the telephone consent process. 
• Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_801741]. If not already done, a copy of the 
consent document will be sent to the potential subject via fax or e-mail or the U.S. Postal 
Service, if fax & e- mail options are not available.  
• Either the investigator  or the potential subject may initiate the phone call for discussion of 
the study after a reasonable amount of time is given to participants to review the consent document prior to telephone consent. A conf erence call is recommended and both parties 
will properly identify themselves and the purpose of the telephone call followed by a 
thorough explanation of the protocol by [CONTACT_801772].  
• The potential subject will be instructed to sign and date the consent document along with 
the signature [CONTACT_801776].  
• The original signed informed consent document may be faxed back (301-402- 3088) or e -
mailed to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_801742], Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Building 10, CRC Room 4-5362, MSC 1607, Rockville Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], Bethesda, MD, [ZIP_CODE].  
 The telephone informed consent process will be documented in the progress note by [CONTACT_801773] a copy of the note and the original fully signed consent 
document will be filed in the subject’s medical records with a copy provided to the subject.

 50 Informed Consent of Non -English Speaking Research Participants:  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no translated extant 
IRB approved consent document, the principal i nvestigator and or those authorized to obtain 
informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in NIH HRPP SOP 12. The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB approved consent 
document.   
 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form for up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1106789] that consent document translated into the given inherent language.  
 Informed Consent for adult research participants unable to provide consent:  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant unable to provide informed consent,  
we will follow the  procedures for obtaining informed consent from a legally authorized 
representative (LAR) (Category B) per NIH HRPP SOP 14E. See Appendix D for details.  Justification for inclusion:   This research provides the prospect of direct benefit, therefore 
inclusion is justified .  The benefits to the participants could be improvement of cytopenias 
resulting in improved quality of life and also decreased morbidity and mortality from transfusion-
associated viral agents.  Potentially, bleeding complications and treatment with other more toxic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_106580].  Not allowing participants who cannot provide 
consent would deny them the potential benefits this protocol offers for their MDS.  There are no 
plans to include in stitutionalized participants.  
 Risk/Benefit Assessment : 
This research involves greater than minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 
CFR 46.102) 
 
Consent and Assent: 
Procedures to determine capacity: If documentation of decision mak ing capacity is not present in 
the medical record or the investigator questions the decision making capacity of the individual, 
then the Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) (301 -496-9675 or [PHONE_6314]) will be 
contact[CONTACT_302602]. 
 
Procedures to obtain assent  and documentation of assent or dissent:   The informed consent 
discussion will include the individual unable to provide informed consent along with LAR.  The individual unable to provided informed consent will be asked if they ag ree to participate in  the 
research and this will be documented in the medical record.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF AN LAR’S APPROPRIATENESS TO CONSENT 
TO RESEARCH NOT INVOLVING GREATER THAN MINIMAL RISK (CATEGORY A) AND FOR 
RESEARCH INVOLVING GREATER THAN MINIMAL RISK BUT PRESENTING THE PROSPECT OF DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS (CATEGORY B)  
First preference is #1. If not possible, go to option #2. If #2 is not possible, go to option #3.) 
 
Cognitively Impaired Adults and 
Identification of a LAR  Requirements for Determining 
Appropriateness of LAR to Consent 
to Research at Clinical Center (CC) 
and non - CC sites  Role of the LAR at all 
sites  
1. Adults who cannot consent and have a 
court-appointed guardian from a state that 
allows iti or a DPAii for healthcare and/or 
research participation.  PI/designeeiii, unless the IRB designates 
an independent person(s) to perform this role (e.g., ACAT
iv if the protocol is 
taking place at the CC), must assess 
appropriateness of LAR to consent to research.  
 An appropriate LAR is one who at least:  
(a) Understands that the protocol involves research;  
(b) Understands the risks, potential benefits (if any), and alternatives to the 
study; and  
(c) Has sufficient reason to believe 
participation in the study is consistent with the subject’s preferences and values.  LAR may give 
permission for the research and sign the consent form for the protocol on behalf of the subject.  
2. Adults who cannot consent a nd who do 
not have a DPA or court -appointed 
guardian, but who are capable of understanding the DPA process and can 
assign a DPAv . 
3. Adults who cannot consent, who do not 
have a DPA or court -appointed guardian, 
and cannot appoint a DPA:  
 At the CC: A person at the highest level of the following may consent to research 
participation if found to be appropriate: 1) 
spouse or domestic partnervi, 2) adult child, 3) parent, 4) sibling, 5) other close relative  
 
At non- CC sites: Consult with OGC to 
identify a pplicable state law.  
i A court appointed guardian may only consent to enroll a subject in research if the guardian has authority to do so 
under the laws of the state that issued the guardianship order and the terms of the guardianship order. The Office of 
the General Counsel (OGC) should be asked to review guardianship orders to determine if the guardian has legal authority to consent to the subject’s participation in the research. PIs are encouraged to seek an OGC consultation in advance of a potential  subject with a guardianship order coming to an NIH research site to enroll on a study.  
ii DPA means the individual holding the durable power of attorney for healthcare. Consult with OGC if concerned 
about the authority provided in a DPA.  
iii If the prot ocol is taking place at the CC, the PI’s designee may be someone on the research team or a member of 
ACAT. If not at the CC, the PI’s designee may be someone on the research team or an independent person outside of 
the research team if it is felt that the team does not have the required competencies to undertake the evaluation.  
iv NIH Ability to Consent Team. For definition please see 14E.4 .

Purpose of the Study  
  
This is an observational, direct -to-participant sub -study that distributes at -home, self -administered, 
SARS- CoV-2 antigen testing kits to people in  designated communities. Duke will be in charge of the 
coordination of the sub -study. Adults and children liv ing within the pre -identified communities will be 
invited to take part in the substudy,  provided they meet the inclusion criteria. Potential subjects will 
self- identify by [CONTACT_272442]. They will be able to participate via REDCap or through the DCRI Call Center. The 
study will be called You & Me COVID -Free Research Study.  
 Background & Significance  
 In the US, > [ADDRESS_332954] been infected with the SARS -CoV-2 virus and >400,[ADDRESS_332955] at -home testing in asymptomatic 
populations as part of a broader mitigation strategy that includes protective measures (masking, s ocial 
distancing, increased hygiene) and contact -tracing and isolation. With 50% or more of infections 
resulting from pre -symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission, at -home testing may offer an effective 
option for screening and for breaking chains of trans mission. Rapid antigen tests are relatively 
inexpensive and therefore can be used frequently for detecting infected individuals who are 
asymptomatic, pre -symptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS -CoV-2. However, 
even with antigen tests, the implementation of community level testing will be challenging, with an 
impact that is still to be determined.  
 
The public health crisis of the COVID -[ADDRESS_332956]/self- testSARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_332957].  This sub -
study  will provide participant level behavioral information essential to understanding the relationship 
between large s cale at -home testing and community transmission  during the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic and  
relevant for implementation of public health interventions in future pandemics.    
 
Design & Procedures  
 
This is an observational, direct -to-participant sub -study that distributes at -home, self -administered, 
SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_332958] kits will include a QR code for the REDCap surveys and a toll- free number to the DCRI 
call center/eConsent for those interested in participating. Using scripted interview guides, call center staff will be ready to explain study participation, obtain verbal consent, administer study questionnaires 
including soliciting test results, and issue phone reminders for participants who chose not to use 
REDCap. Using NIH Tier- 1 Common Data Element (CDE) measures, the  surveys and questionnaires will 
collect data on demographic characteristics, medical history and health status, SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_332959], they are asked to take a baseline survey (20 minutes to complete), then 28 days later they are prompted via text and email to take the end -of-study survey 
(about 1 minute to complete).  
 Selection of Subjec ts 
  
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must sign and date informed consent form. There are no exclusion criterias if inclusion are met. Community selected is Merced County, CA.  
 Subject Recruitment and Compensation  
 Through partnership with CCPH, the United Way of Merced County, CA was identified as the lead Community Partner to spearhead the enrollment of this substudy. Using materials created by [CONTACT_123894], they will introduce to study subjects in their region. They hope to enroll approximately 100,[ADDRESS_332960] (up to $60) as detailed in the consent form.  
 
If a participant is interested in the sub study, they will either call th e DCRI call center to verbally consent 
or will click a link to access REDC ap. If they would like to learn more, they will be taken to the consent 
form, will fill that out and then will complete surveys. If they have questions either through REDCap or 
websi te about the sub study, they will be directed to call the DCRI call center to have their questions 
answered. The compensation schedule is listed in the consent forms as follows:  
 
If the particpant chooses to be part of our study, they will be asked to com plete survey questions, and 
will complete surveys after testing. Combined, the three surveys (1 short survey, 1 detailed survey, and, 28 days later, 1 final short survey) will take about 20 minutes to complete:  
 For pre -consent survey: Participant has a 1  in 10 chance of rec eiving a $[ADDRESS_332961] -consent surveys: Particpant will be provided gift cards worth up to fifty dollars, and will be paid 
according to the following schedule:

 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Study -related risks include potential loss of confidentiality but steps will be undertaken to minimize this 
risk. There are no interventions involved in this study. The benefit of this study is to learn testing impact 
on reducing the community spread of the infection, however there is no direct benefit to participants.  
 Data A nalysis & Statistical Considerations  
 The approach to analysis will be primarily descriptive. Demographics, questionnaire data, and testing  
results will be reviewed and summarized using graphical techniques and summary statistics. Where  
applicable, exact method confidence intervals will be computed around point estimates. Trends over  
time will be evaluated graphically. The proportion of participants adhering to social distancing guidelines  
after a positive vs. negative test result will be compared using tests of proportion clustered by  
[CONTACT_272443]- participant correlation. Stratified analyses by [CONTACT_272444]. We will explore the associatio ns between positive test results and  
critical behavioral measures using mixed modeling techniques to account for the participant and  
household correlations. Analyses will be conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and R with R  
Studio (R -project). Poin t estimates with 95% confidence intervals will be reported. The analysis will be 
done for applicable study populations as described above, and stratified by [CONTACT_272445] (e.g., age,  gender). There will be a comparison of the proport ion of participants that report 
adhering to social  distancing guidelines after positive vs. negative test result.

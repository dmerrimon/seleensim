 Title:      The safety and efficacy of naltrexone and scopolamine utilized in combination i n the treatment 
of major depression: A double blinded randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
 
Precis:    A double blinded randomized controlled trial utilizing oral scopolamin e and naltrexone will be 
performed in subjects who have current major depression. The trial duration will be [ADDRESS_321601] the option of crossing over to active 
treatment. 
 
Objectives:     The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and efficacy of oral 
scopolamine and naltrexone utilized in combination in the treatment of depression. 
 
Endpoint:  The MADRS tool will be utilized throughout the study to determine medication respons es and   
remission from depression. Side effects noted by [CONTACT_264589]. Pre and post study blood chemistries and E CGs will similarly 
be collected and monitored for significant changes. 
 
Population:   The sample size will be a total of [ADDRESS_321602] ages will be between 18 and 65. Subjects included will be in reasonably good health as 
interpreted by [CONTACT_189451]. The subjects will live no further than 40 miles fro m the 
research site.  The male: female ratio of the study will likely be approximately 1: 2 as noted in the 
population with major depression at large. All demographic groups will likely be represe nted in 
proportion to the local population. 
 
Phase:   Scopolamine and naltrexone are FDA approved medications that have been utilized off l abel for 
the indication of depression. The side effect profile with this combination is anticipated to be less than 
that noted with each medication utilized separately as the doses utilized in this study are significantl y 
lower than those utilized in their respective current indications when each medication is administ ered 
alone.  The study is therefore exempt as defined in 21CFR312.2, and eligible for expedited rev iew.

 2   Introduction: Background Information and Scientific Rationale 
 
2.[ADDRESS_321607] at b oth mu and delta opi[INVESTIGATOR_264574]. An oral dose of 50-100 mg can reverse opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178]. Paradoxically, ultra-low dose 
naltrexone(less than 1 mcg) enhances the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453]. Naltrexone binds to t he C-terminal 
pentapeptide of the scaffolding protein filamin A with strong avidity which may prevent o r reverse a 
change in G-protein signaling in G-coupled receptor systems, such as the mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_264575]. Low dose naltrexone has additionally been anecdotally found to be 
helpful in many disorders, including fibromyalgia, which has symptom overlap with depressio n. 
Naltrexone has recently been noted in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_264576] (1) .  
 Scopolamine has been demonstrated to be a rapid acting antidepressant administered both as an IV 
infusion as well as dosed oral ly.  Interest in the muscarinic cholinergic system in mood disorders 
stemmed initially from evidence suggesting hypersensitivity of the cholinergic system pla ys a role in the 
pathophysiology of depression. Researchers have shown increasing cholinergic activity exacerbates  
depressive symptoms. Two studies have demonstrated that scopolamine administered b oth IV and 
orally result in rapid remission from major depression in a majority of patients (2- 4). The principle 
investigator has utilized scopolamine in the treatment of depression and anxiety IV and orally with a 
high level of efficacy and minimal side effects. 
The Principle Investigator believes that a combination approach, much like that utilized in o ncology for 
decades, will have the highest likelihood of producing rapid remission from major depressi on. A n 
acceptable side effect profile is hypothesized, as well as a lower rate of relapse than that noted wi th the 
use of single agents. This treatment approach will additionally be very cost effective, utilizin g two 
inexpensive generic medications, which can be easily compounded in inexpensive buccal drop s.

effectiveness. The 1mg B.I.D. naltrexone dose and 0.15 mg  B.I.D. dose of scopolamine co mbination has 
been chosen based on our clinical experience with the medications, and our desire to maximize both 
efficacy and tolerability. 
7 | P a g e  
 The [ADDRESS_321609] been noted in high-dose 
naltrexone however this is unlikely to be an issue at the proposed low dose schedule. 
 
2.3.1    Known Potential Risks 
 
 There are potential economic risks should additional medical care be required due to 
medication induced side effects. There are potential psychological risks should the 
intervention worsen the subjects’ underlying depression.  
 
Immediate risks mainly relate to medication side effects, as noted above. 
Any long term risks utilizing scopolamine are unknown.  Naltrexone has a very favorab le 
profile utilized long term by [CONTACT_1962]. 
 
This study is a clinical trial and therefore of requires human subjects. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_264577], the potential benefits far outweigh the risks. Major depression is a  life 
threatening disease and this combination of medications may provide a high rate of 
response and remission with a positive safety profile.   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_321610] been demonstrated to be effective agents in the trea tment of 
depression both in clinical trials and in the clinic of the Principle Investigator.  
8 | P a g e  
  Potential short and long term benefits of this study may be short and/or long term remissio n from 
major depression if participants continue treatment after the conclusion of the study .  
 
3     Objectives and Purpose 
 
The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and efficacy of naltrexone and 
scopolamine utilized in combination for the treatment of depression.  
 
4   Study Design and Endpoints 
 
4.1     Description of the Study Design 
The trial will be a placebo-controlled, double blinded, randomized study. The trial will be a si ngle center 
study. There will be one control group and one active agent group. The doses noted will remain fi xed 
during the entirety of the study except as noted in section 6.1. There will be the opportunity for 
crossover of the placebo control group to active treatment. There will be the opportunity for  subjects 
receiving the active treatment to continue treatment after the trial. 
4.2    Study Endpoints 
          4.2.1    Primary Endpoint 
        The primary endpoint will be to measure remission from depression and responses to 
medication. The MADRS questionnaire is a validated tool utilized in many depression studies t o 
measure affective changes correlated with remission from depression. This questionnaire will 
utilized throughout the study. These questionnaires will generate granular data which can be 
easily analyzed with simple statistical tools. The group sizes are expected to generate data with 
adequate statistical power to determine whether or not the intervention is effective. Remission 
from depression will be considered a 50% reduction in MADRS score. A response to treatment 
will be considered a 25% reduction in MADRS score. 
          4.2.2     Secondary Endpoint 
There is no secondary endpoint in this trial. 
         4.2.2     Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory endpoint is to determine the relative safety of this medication combinatio n.  A 
standardized questionnaire will be utilized at all visits to determine the presence and severity of side 
effects or adverse reactions. These data will be pooled and the relative incidence of side effects and 
adverse reactions in the active group will be compared to the control group.

5.3  Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
 
10 | P a g e  
 Participants will be recruited utilizing advertisements on The Taub Group and The Charlott e 
Ketamine Center websites (included with this protocol), as well as through their respective 
Facebook pages. Similar advertisements will be sent to psychiatrists and psychologists within a 
30 mile radius of the study site periodically. It is anticipated that utilizing th ese strategies will 
allow the accrual of 40 appropriate subjects over a 6- 12 month period.  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. If the study is prematurely suspended or prematurely terminated, the 
Principle Investigator will promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for the  
termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
 
1. Determination of unexpected, significant or unacceptable risk to participants 
2. Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
3. Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements 
4. Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
5. Determination of futility 
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and 
satisfy the Principle Investigator. 
[ADDRESS_321613] of inactive drops prepared by [CONTACT_264593] 
60% propylene glycol and 40% anhydrous ethanol. In the active group, naltrexon e and scopolamine will 
be compounded by [CONTACT_264594]. 
6.1. Dose adjustments/Modifications/Delays 
The scopolamine/naltrexone and control drops dose will be modified in case of side effects or lack of 
efficacy. After the first three days of treatment in the study, the participants will be queried by [CONTACT_264595]. If the participant notes significant side effects, such as sedation, dizziness, severe dry thr oat 
or other problematic side effects, the dose of the drops will be reduced by 50% for the remainder of the 
trial.  If the participant notes no improvement in affect and notes no significant side effects, the  dose of 
drops will be increased by 50%.  
6.2       Duration of Therapy 
Four weeks appears to be the minimum duration within which significant responses would be not ed 
with the two active agents if a response or remission is likely to occur. 
6.3    Tracking of Dose 
The patients will be seen weekly and will bring their medications with them. The Study Supervi sor or 
Research Assistant will review the dosing with participants each visit to ensure adherence to prescribed 
dosing.

8.1    Specification of Safety Parameters 
       Safety parameters recorded will include all adverse effects note by [CONTACT_264597]. In particular, adverse events requiring medication dose modification or medication  
withdrawal will be recorded. Any adverse events requiring actual intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264578]. 
8.1.1    Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of the Principal 
Investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or a persistent or  significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Impor tant medical 
events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defini tion. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_321618] the safety, welfare, or right s of 
participants. Examples of corrective actions or changes that might need to be considered in resp onse to 
an unanticipated problem include: 
1. Modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified ris ks 
2. Implementation of additional safety monitoring procedures 
3. Suspension of enrollment of new participants or halting of study procedures for all participants 
4. Modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized ri sks 
13 | P a g e  
 5. Provision of additional information about newly recognized wrist to previously en rolled 
participants 
Unanticipated problems involving ri sk to participants include any incident, experience or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research protocol described in 
protocol related documents, such as the IRB approved research protocol and informed consent 
documents; and be unexpected taking into account the population been studied; 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and 
3. Suggest that the research places participants at a greater risk of harm, including physical, 
psychological, economic or social harm than was previously known or recognized 
8.2     Classification of Adverse Events 
8.2.1   Severity of Event 
All adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [CONTACT_2329] a protocol defin ed grading system 
as follows: 
1. Mild -events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participants daily  
activities. 
2. Moderate -events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
3. Severe -events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_321619] their relationship to the study agents assessed by [CONTACT_458].  Definitions 
of causation are as follows: 
1. Related --The adverse event is known to occur with the study agents, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study agents causing adverse event, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study agents and event. The reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study agents and the adverse event. 
2. Not related - there is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agents 
cause the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established. 
8.2.3    Expectedness 
Expected adverse reactions are adverse events that are common and known to occur with the study 
agents being studied and will be collected in a format which discusses the magnitude of the reaction . 
14 | P a g e  
 Expected adverse events have been noted previously as potential side effects of the medications and 
are noted in the informed consent as well. 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed i n the 
informed consent or in the overview of expected risks with the medications noted. The Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_264579]. 
An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the ev ent is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described with study agents.

Adverse events will be solicited through the utilization of a review of systems q uestionnaire that will be 
completed by [CONTACT_264598]-up visit and is included with this protocol .  
The occurrence of an adverse event or suspected adverse event may come to the attention of study 
personnel during study visits and interviews of study participants presenting for medical care,  or upon 
review by [CONTACT_079]. All adverse events including local and systemic r eactions not 
meeting the criteria for solicited adverse events will be captured in the research log and in the 
participant ’s medical record. Information to be collected will include event description, time of on set, 
the Principal Investigator ’s assessment of  severity, relationship to study agents, as well as time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_264599]. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant ’s intake screen will be considered 
baseline and not reported as an adverse event. However, if the study participant ’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be reported as an adverse event. Unexpected event s 
will be recorded in the research log as well as in the participant ’s medical record throughout the study. 
Changes in the severity of an adverse event will be documented to allow an assessment of the durati on 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent will 
be documented at each onset and the duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_264580].

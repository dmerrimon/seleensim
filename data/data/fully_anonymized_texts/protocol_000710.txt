A. Title: Web (YouTube) based educational intervention to improve patient -
physician  awareness of cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis  
 
B. Organizational detail : Rush is a not -for-profit health care, education and research enterprise.  
Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) encompasses a [ADDRESS_1078765] care for our patients. A unique combination of research and patient care has 
earned Rush national rankings in 9/ 16 specialty areas in U.S. News & World Report 's 2013 -14 
America's Best Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_784287]. Our education and research endeavors, community servi ce 
programs are dedicated to enhancing excellence in patient care in the Chicago area. RUMC ’s core 
values — innovation, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence —translate into highest 
quality patient care. The Department of Medicine ’s leaders hip is dedicated to supporting research 
endeavors to improve patient care. Hence, both the organization and  departmental leadership are 
committed to improving patient care and research .   
The Division of Rheumatology at RUMC (and its affiliated institutio ns) provides care to 
patients  with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and thus has access to large numbers of RA patients 
to pursue research. The division includes 15 salaried MD rheumatologists at two clinical 
locations. At RUMC, we see approximately 500 RA patie nts per year. John Stroger Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(JSH) is affiliated and in vicinity of RUMC. The primary investigator (PI) has clinical privileges at 
both the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The JSH ’s Rheumatology division provides longitudinal care for 
rheumatology patients, mostly with poor or no medical insurance. Approximately 1000 RA 
patients per year are seen by [CONTACT_784306]. Our combined (RUMC and JSH) 
Rheumatology division ’s leadership and faculty are actively engaged in investigator -initiated 
clinical trials, including qual ity improvement projects.  
 
The Department of Preventive Medicine at RUMC has been specializing in design and testing 
of rigorous multi -level interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction. The proposed study will 
have access to its statistical and methodo logical expertise, including experts in cardiovascular 
prevention, cardio -metabolic conditions and behavioral science. The resources of the  
Department of Preventive Medicine will enhance the methodological rigor and likelihood of  
success of this study.  
 
Other resources available to the PI : [INVESTIGATOR_784288] , a busy clinical trials 
unit located within the Division of Rheumatology, helps with study coordination and patient 
recruitment; and clinical assessments are performed on site. It has b een conducting clinical 
research and clinical trials successfully for more than 15 years. Approximately 30 -40 
protocols/year are performed, which include investigator -initiated research and multi site 
clinical trials in RA and other conditions. It maintain s a disease -oriented database of 
potential study volunteers. Other Center resources include nurse coordinators, a regulatory 
affairs  specialist, patient recruiters, phlebotomists, administrative, clerical and front -office 
staff , and  physician faculty of th e Division of Rheumatology. Two conference rooms with 
audio -visual  equipment are available. In addition,  networked computer facilities are available 
for study  coordination, statistical and data analysis, and database management.  
 
Interdisciplinary Leadersh ip of the proposed project and their specific roles are as follows:

C. Goal: Our goal is to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test a multi -level web -based EI aimed to improve  
cardiovascular risk awareness (CVRA) in rheumato id arthritis (RA).  
 
D. Objectives: We propose to conduct this study in two phases with the following aims:  
 
1. EI development phase.  
 
Aim 1. To develop a multi -level web -based EI for improving CVRA targeted to the patients with  
RA and their primary health care providers (PHCPs; see definition in section F). The intervention 
will be designed over the first 6 months in collaborative effort of patients  and the trans -
disciplinary panel of experts  in rheumatology, preventive cardiology/endocrinology, and  
experim ental health and social psychology.  
 
2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing phase . 
 
Aim 2A . To compare changes in CVRA in RA patients (a) after web -based EI. We hypothesize a  
20% increase in CVRA (measured using standardized survey) at [ADDRESS_1078766] intervention;   
(b) among patie nts with and without web -based EI. We hypothesize significantly greater 
improvement in CVRA (using standardized survey) among RA patients with EI as compared 
to RA patients without EI, at 2 -3 months.

Aim 2B . To explore changes in cardiovascular risk screening (CVRS) at the primary health care  
visits among RA patients with and without EI, at one year.  
 
E. Assessment of Need: Health care and disease burden o f cardiovascular  disease among men  
and women is substantial. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and a 
major cause of disability worldwide. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death 
worldwide. In the [LOCATION_002], CVD accounted for 34.4 % of the 2.[ADDRESS_1078767] productivity from CVD exceeded $[ADDRESS_1078768] unique risk factors  for CAD (2), and CAD ’s impact on women traditionally has 
been under appreciated due to higher rates at younger ages in men. The death ra tes from CAD  
in US women [ADDRESS_1078769] women -specific 
recommendations for CVD prevention were published in 1999. In 2007, CVD still caused 
approximately 1 death/minute among women in the US. Major gaps among patients and  
physicians  remain regarding CVRA in women .   
The American Heart Association now recognizes systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g. RA) as an 
independent CV D risk in women  (1). RA, the most common autoimmune arthritis, affects at 
least 1.3 million US adults. 1 -3% of women may get RA in their lifetime. Usually, 75% of RA  
patients are women, and between 40 -50 yrs. Major cause of mortality in RA is CVD . As 
compa red to general population, CVD morbidity in RA is 1.5 -2.0 folds (3). The mortality gap 
between RA and the general population has widened (2). Ischemic heart disease in RA is often  
silent, and precedes myocardial infarction in RA. Identification and address al of modifiable 
traditional CVR factors in patients with RA is important, besides simultaneously targeting RA -
specific risks . The increased CVD risk in RA cannot be explained by [CONTACT_111308]. 
Immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, plaque  instability, impaired coronary reserve, 
elevated thrombotic markers, medications (corticosteroids and non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory medications) and extra -articular manifestations contribute to increased CVD risk 
in RA (2 -4). The absolute risk of CVD is  highest for elderly, male patients with RA, whereas 
relative risk is  highest among young female patients with RA  (5). Innala et al reported 
traditional CVD risks to  explain new CVD events in very early RA, and it being potentiated by 
[CONTACT_784307]  (6). Hence, attention to both traditional and RA -specific factors  to decrease 
CVD morbidity and mortality in RA is required.  
 
Primary preventive screening before the onset of CVD is key to identifying modifiable 
traditional CVD risk factors  (7). European League against rheumatism ( EULAR) guidelines  
recommends CVRS using national guidelines for all RA patients  (5). It has been suggested that in 
patients with low CVD risk and inactive RA, a lower frequency of assessment (e.g. every 2 -3 
years), could be adopt ed. Currently there are no guidelines on this from the American College 
of Rheumatology. National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines  recommend checking for 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_784292] ≥ 20 yrs every 5 years for the general population; to have this tested 
more often if either there is dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_784293], male gender >45 yrs, or a woman > 50 
years, HDL <40 mg/dl, or if there are other risk factors for CVD. Current US preventive services

task force guidelines  strongly recommends dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_784294] ≥ [ADDRESS_1078770] screening; 44% had consulted their 
internist, while 69% made at least one healthy behavior change (8). Diabetes EI is associated 
with self -management behavior (9 -10), thus improving care outcomes, without having a major 
impact on health care costs (10).In another study aimed at improving di abetes care, an EI that 
targeted both the patient and physician, demonstrated the largest and most consistent drop in 
hemoglobin A1C, as well as the lowest treatment cost (11), suggesting that the patient -
physician dyad based EI, may be a better target  than either person alone, as is being proposed 
in this project.    
Web -based EI (including video) have been found to be effective  in improving practice patterns 
and health outcomes in several studies (12 -17). Web -based EI have several advantages  over 
conventi onal class room based EI as they provide flexibility, privacy and time efficient utility to 
users. For health services providers web -based EI can provide easy and quick access, globally 
to vast number of patients, efficiently and effectively, quick impleme ntation, with least 
administrative and financial burden.  
 
Current Clinical Gaps Identified: Status of CVRS, lipid screening or treatment of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_784295], even in Medicare age group patients . Traditional CVD risks and RA -
specific r isk/s are well noted be to be associated with greater CVD in RA. However, the 
presence of RA does not always trigger CVRS or treatment . In RA patients (≥ 65 years), primary 
lipid screening was performed in 45% (7), an age group where all patients should re ceive 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_784296], regardless of their RA status. Adjusted predicted probabilities of lipid  
screening were 26% for RA patients seeing rheumatologist alone, to 44 -48% for patients with 
some primary care physician visits  (7). In another study, one  third of RA patients did not have 
any lipid testing (18 - 19). Furthermore, upto 26% of RA patients without CVD have sufficiently 
high risk for CVD to require statin therapy, yet and most of them remain untreated (20).  
 
Potential reasons  for poor CVRS in R A, despi[INVESTIGATOR_784297]/limited  
knowledge  among RA patients and their PHCP ’s about the CVD risk. Lack of knowledge in  
general about CVD risks in women and their PHCPs  has been previously reported. Women do 
not always perceive themselves to be at risk for CVD (21). Furthermore, existent medical  
literature is lacking  in published studies in the [LOCATION_002] in RA that (i) ascertain patient or 
physician awareness of CVD risks, or (ii) compare the rates of CVRS pre and post EI against RA 
patients receiving usual care from PHCP. These are lost opportunities  to make PHCP ’s aware of 
the existent gap in knowledge and thus the need for changing behaviors. In a study done in 
[LOCATION_008], only 32% of general practitioners identified RA as a risk for CVD  (22). They 
reported lack of educational resources  on this matter.  
 
06/02/2017  Page | 4  
ORA: 14090405 -IRB01  Date IRB Approved: 10/31/2016  Amendment Date: 7/6/[ADDRESS_1078771], were more likely to 
get CVRS by [CONTACT_784308] (23). Time constraints during eac h visit may also burden the PHCP. 
Performance of CVRS to Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI)  in RA may be helpful.  
 
Currently, there are no published, effective, EI targeting patient -PHCP CVRA in RA . 
Furthermore, there are barriers to use of curr ently available EI resources  (classroom style 
educational events) to improve CVRA among RA patients and their PCHP. These include access, 
need for dedicated substantial time and/or financial commitment to attend continuous medical 
education or other educat ional events, lack of flexibility, which may impose on patient care or 
personal time. Similar access, lack of flexibility, lack of awareness of resources available, 
complexity in the content delivery, need for dedicated time and financial time commitments 
may be encountered by [CONTACT_784309]. A brief, focused, simple web -based EI, if found to be  
effective, can overcome the above mentioned obstacles, and be made available globally , 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and in a cost effective use of available resources .   
F. Target Learn er Audience: Primary audiences are RA patients and their PHCPs. Direct 
benefits  from the project to RA patients are targeted in the form of improved awareness of 
primary and secondary prevention of CVD in RA. PHCP refers to any health care provider 
identif ied by [CONTACT_784310] . This may be their 
rheumatologist, family  practitioner, internist, other specialists or mid -level health providers.  
 
G. Project Design and Methods: G.1. Study design, number of participants, sites  and duration :  
As mentioned previously, the study will consist of two phases:  
 
(i) EI development phase consisting of EI development by [CONTACT_784311], collaborative 
team  (including RA patients), and qualitative assessments used to refine the intervention,  (ii) 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing phase.  
 
We propose a longitudinal of 300 RA (150 with and 150 without EI), to test for ( primary  
outcome ) change in CVRA at 2 -3 months following web -based EI, and compare that with CVRA  
changes among RA patients without IE. The proposed secondary outcomes will explore the 
rates of CVRS via medical chart review among RA patients with and without IE. Consenting 
participants (RA patients (n=300) and PCHPs) will have (a) baseline survey on CVRA, followed 
by a short EI delivered via YouTube vi deo (n=150), followed by [CONTACT_784312] 2 -3-month 
follow up surveys, to quantitate changes in CVRA, (b) a medical record review of participating 
RA patients (n=300) will be undertaken (records from preceding one year duration) and at 12 
months (after baseli ne visit) to determine the changes in CVRS in RA (Figure 1). Only PHCPs  
providing care to the EI arm RA patients will receive the CVRA evaluations and the EI. Care will 
be taken to avoid enrollment of PCHPs providing care to RA patients not in the EI arm, to not 
confound the results.  
 
Educational approach  is discussed in the section I. We expect to reach out to 600 RA patients 
at RUMC and JSH, with the goal of recruiting 300 RA patients over 12 months. This screening -
to-enrolment ratio is consistent with pr eviously observed 10:9 ratio for survey -based one -visit 
 
06/02/2017  Page | 5  
ORA: 14090405 -IRB01  Date IRB Approved: 10/31/2016  Amendment Date: 7/6/[ADDRESS_1078772] to reach our expected goal of 300 RA patients even if 
screeni ng-to-enrollment ratio erodes to 10:5. Sample size calculation : To show an 
improvement of 20% in overall CVRA, with 90% power and 0.05% alpha error, we need 127 RA 
patients in each group.  
 
H. Innovation : We did not find on our review of current medical lit erature (PubMed and Ovid  
Medline) using the search terms “Rheumatoid arthritis ” and “educational intervention ” and 
“web ” for any existent EI studies that study patient -PHCP CVRA or utilize a YouTube based  EI to 
improve CVRA. Furthermore, use of patient -PHCP dyad  for CVR EI has not been reported. We 
feel confident that our study idea is original and has significant advantages over existent  
methods as it is easier, quicker and has significant potential applications. The you tube video EI 
if successful can be offered through National organizations e.g. American College of 
Rheumatology or Arthritis Foundation; and can be made available to large numbers of RA 
patients worldwide with less resources utilization and advantages of privacy, flexibility and 
access to u sers.

CVR management through Department of Preventive Cardiology. Rush has a history of 
cardiovascular prevention research studies through the Preventive Medicin e Department. [CONTACT_784322] is a co -investigator in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and NIH –

I. Outcomes Evaluation: I.1 CVRA refers to cardiovascular risk awareness, whereas CVRS 
refers  to cardiovascular risk screening.  
 
1. EI development phase: The primary ou tcome of the EI development phase will be patient -
centered EI video and PHCP -centered EI video aimed at increasing CVRA in RA patients and 
their PHCPs. 2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing phase : Primary outcomes of interest are (a) changes in CVRA after 
an EI among RA patien ts, and (b) changes in CVRA rates among RA patients with and without IE 
at 2-[ADDRESS_1078773] is the change in rate of CVRS among RA 
patients with and without IE at one year. Other exploratory outcomes may include correlation 
between PHCPs CVRA and baseline CVRS; patient and PHCPs predictors of change in CVRS. 
Outcomes evaluations in terms of metrics used for the needs assessment, and addressal of 
gaps for each target group, and amount of changes expected are shown in Table 1 belo w.

primary care to the RA patients recruited for this study for the EI group. Definition of PHCP has 
been previously provided (section F), (ii) Informed consent (iii) Not providing PHCP to RA 
patients in the non -EI group.  
 
I.2. Methods: 1.  Education intervention development phase:  The primary outcome of the 
interve ntion development phase will be patient -centered EI video and PHCP -centered 
education EI to increase CVRA in RA. The interdisciplinary study  team will develop a multi -level  
web -based EI  for CVRA targeted to RA patients and their PHCPs. This team will consi st of 3 -6 
RA patients and the panel of experts in rheumatology, preventive cardiology/endocrinology, 
and experimental health and social psychology. To improve overall RA patient outcomes, our  
educational approach for the web -based EI is specifically aimed at changing the knowledge, 
and thus health behaviors of RA patients and their PHCP.    
Educational Approach : In the  development of the web -based EI (Table 1, Figure 1), we will  
utilize credible, useful, innovative educational platform and input from opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n leaders  in the 
therapeutic areas. All educational content will be learner centric  in approach, language and 
content (Table 2). Content appropriateness of the  tailored  intervention will be verified by 
[CONTACT_784315]. Processes of change will be focuse d on increasing RA patients or their 
PHCP CVRA in general and in RA, and increasing their awareness of the need for change. This 
20-30 minute You Tube EI video will be developed using scientifically researched content 
(Table 2).

Assessment of CVRA in Patients : After informed consent, each participant will be assigned a  
unique study number, which will be used to pair data from the pre - and post -intervention visits. 
Participants will be given an online survey to fi ll to assess their CVRA ( Baseline Patient survey ). 
A You Tube video will be shown to the patient on a tablet or a computer screen. The video 
recording will be of 20 -30 minutes duration to avoid attention fatigue. Immediately after 
viewing the video, each p atient will be given the CVRA online survey ( Follow up Patient survey  
1). An exit online credibility survey will be used to gather feedback on credibility (user -
friendliness, content, understandability, and relevance), barriers experienced in using the web -
based intervention and any suggestions (open -ended). To assess retention of knowledge, 
between [ADDRESS_1078778] -intervention assessment ( Follow  
up Patient survey 2 ) using the same CVRA survey will be administered online.  Follow up survey

2 will be paired data. Medical charts records will be reviewed to quantify prevalence of CVRS 
by [CONTACT_784316] (within one -year period precedi ng baseline visit) at baseline and one -year follow up 
visit. For patients whose PHCP is not within Rush University Medical Center or John H Stroger 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we will contact [CONTACT_784321] (within one -year period preceding baseline visit) at baseline and 
one-year follow up visit. Study participants will be asked to provide informed consent to 
communicate with their PHCP and access to their medical records to allow for assessm ent of 
CVRS.  
 
Assessment of CVRA in PHCPs: PHCPs will be contact[CONTACT_19904]. Acceptance to proceed with  
the study online will be taken as informed consent. Online survey on their CVRA ( Baseline PHCP  
survey ) will be evaluated using case scenarios developed specifically for this purpose, followed  
by a You -Tube video developed using evidence based literature review, specially including 
autoimmune diseases and risk of CVD in women and RA. This will be developed at the level of 
the targeted audience and of 20 -30 minutes duration. They will then be prompted to take the 
same case scenario based survey immediately to assess their CVRA ( Follow up PHCP survey 1 ). 
An exit online credibility survey will be used to gather feedback on credibility (user -
friendliness, conte nt, understandability, and relevance), barriers experienced in using the web -
based intervention and any suggestions (open -ended).    
I.3.Tools:  
 
Survey to assess CVRA: The survey will include the following components:  
 
1. The content of Patient surveys: Brief  survey to collect demographic and self reported past 
medical history, family history, Social history and current medications, current weight and 
height. This will be administered to RA.  
 
Perception of risk of heart disease scale (PRHDS) (8), Heart Disease  Fact Questionnaire 
(HDFQ)(24) will be modified to include some items on autoimmune diseases (including 
RA).Relevant components of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2013 
survey from US Centers for Disease Control 2013 (22). This will i nclude sections and modules 
on hypertension awareness (2 items), cholesterol awareness (3 items), chronic health 
conditions (12 items), tobacco use (5 items), pre diabetes and diabetes (10 items), 
cardiovascular health (7 items), Mental Illness and Stigma (10 items) and Emotional Support 
and life satisfaction (2 items).  
 
2. The content of PHCP surveys: A survey to assess CVRA in PHCPs will be developed. This 
survey development will be guided by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators and a questionnaire adapted from 
BRFSS and Na tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (21) that was used previously in a 
similar study (8). The survey will be modified to include questions about CVRA in women and in 
autoimmune diseases. In addition, five hypothetical case scenarios will be crea ted with various 
combinations of CVR in patients with and without autoimmune disease, and PHCP will be 
asked to select the CVRS indicated and strategies to optimize the patient ’s individual CVD risks.  
 
The finalized surveys used for CVRA will be pretested among 5 -10 RA patients and Physicians.

I.4. Incentives: For the participating RA, a $50 honorarium will be provided at baseline and 
follow up visit (T able 4).  
 
I.6. Data: Patient : Demographic (age, gender, ethnicity), Socio -economic status (education) and 
RA pertinent data (duration, presence of Rheumatoid factor and/or anti cyclic citrullinated 
peptide, bony erosions, medications (including steroids an d biologics)). Self reported CVRA 
(Overall, Traditional and RA) will be assessed at baseline, immediately after viewing the video 
(follow up 1), and after 2 -3 months (follow up 2).  
 
PHCP : Demographic (age, gender, ethnicity), type of physicians (Internal M edicine, Family  
practice, Rheumatologist), years since completion of residency in Internal Medicine or Family 
Practice, years since board certification, currently board certification status, setting of practice 
(academic, community or private practice), ra nk (if any), approximate number of RA patients 
seen yearly. Self reported CVRA (Overall, Traditional and RA) will be assessed at baseline, 
immediately after viewing the video (follow up 1), and after 2 -3 months (follow up 2).    
Rates for CVRS at baseline and one year later for all RA patients (with and without EI) will be 
determined using a checklist.  
 
I.7. Proposed Analyses: (Table 1) SPSS software will be used for data analyses. Data distribution 
will be evaluated. Standard descriptive statistics will be  used to analyze (a) patient 
characteristics: demographics, socioeconomic status, RA disease pertinent information; and (b) 
PHCP characteristics: demographics, type of physician and practice, board certification status, 
and annual count of RA patients. Com parison between demographics and disease 
characteristics of RA patients with and without EI will be conducted using chi square and t test 
analysis.  
 
I. Intervention development phase  
 
Aim 1. Qualitative analyses will be used to gather data about the content, relevance, ease -of-
use, credibility and delivery of the educational materials. This data will be used to refine the 
intervention. Descriptive EI fidelity monitoring data analysis  will be undertaken (mean duration 
(Patient or PHCP) engagement YouTube EI vid eo, completion of CVRA at follow up 1 for 
patients and PHCPs, and credibility survey data). Latter data will evaluate the need, ease, 
content and understandability, relevance of the EI.  
 
Engagement of audience  will be judged through observation of body lan guage RA patients 
during the entire study. In addition, feedback on the credibility of the intervention is being 
sought from both the patients and PHCP to establish its user -friendliness, content, relevance 
and understandability. Moreover, special efforts have been undertaken to limit survey burden 
and limit the duration of the EI to allow for full engagement of the participants. We feel that 
the technology platform being used for the intervention, brevity, its speed and ease will allow 
for greater audience  engagement.  
 
II. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing phase.  
 
 
06/02/2017  Page | 12  
ORA: 14090405 -IRB01  Date IRB Approved: 10/31/2016  Amendment Date: 7/6/2017  
 
 
 
 
 
Aim 2A . To compare changes in CVRA in RA patients (a) after web -based EI. We hypothesize  
that 20% increase in overal l CVRA (measured using standardized survey) at [ADDRESS_1078779] 
intervention; (b) with and without web -based EI. We hypothesize significantly greater 
improvement in overall  CVRA among RA patients with EI as compared to non EI group, at 2 -3 
months.  
 
For pati ents (a) Overall CVRA (ORA), (b) Traditional CVR awareness (TRA) (c) RA CVR awareness 
(RARA) will be calculated. Awareness of all 18 CVR being tested (listed in section 1) will denote 
100% CVR awareness. To score ORA, patient ’s correct responses denoting a wareness to each 
of the 18 CVR being tested will be calculated in percentage of total responses. Domain -specific 
CVR awareness for traditional CVR (TRA) and RA (RARA) will be scored separately using the 
same strategy.    
Paired t tests to compare pre and p ost (Follow up 2) patient overall CVRA for our primary 
outcome of interest will be performed. Effect size of gains in overall CVRA for RA patients after 
EI (Follow up survey 2 and baseline) will be calculated. We will then compare percent change in 
overall  CVRA rates (between baseline and follow up 2) using chi square analysis, among EI and 
non-EI patients with RA. A p value of ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant on two tailed tests.  
 
Aim 2B . To explore changes in cardiovascular risk screening (CVRS) at t he primary health care  
visits among RA patients with and without EI.  
 
The medical records of RA patients with and without EI will be reviewed in electronic medical 
record, and analyzed using standardized checklist to assess the prevalence of CVRS and CVD 
risk reduction plan (meaningful use). Changes in CVRS rates among EI and non EI groups will be 
calculated, and compared using chi square analysis. A p value of ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_1078780] size will be 
obtained. In addition exploratory univariate and multivariate logistic or linear regression 
analysis for patient and PHCP correlates of CVRS (baseline) and change in CVRS will be 
performed. Improvements in Traditional and RA -specific CVRA among RA and PHCPs will be 
assessed.  
 
J. Dissemination plan: The first step in disseminating outcomes will be to share the results  of 
the study with the participants of the study, RA patients and their PHCP.  
 
Next, the results of the study would be submitted for presentation at a regional or National 
conference pertinent to primary care providers, rheumatology and preventive cardiolo gy 
audience. Options include American College of Physicians, Quality improvement 
conferences, American College of Rheumatology, American Heart Association and Women ’s 
health Conferences. Preparation and publication of the manuscript will be the pi[INVESTIGATOR_784304] p in 
disseminating the outcomes. Potential target journals for submission could be from Internal 
Medicine, Preventive Medicine, Cardiovascular, Outcomes or Rheumatology based. General 
Medicine Journals targeted could include Journal of American Medical Ass ociation, Lancet,

ORA: 14090405 -IRB01  Date IRB Approved: 10/31/2016  Amendment Date: 7/6/[ADDRESS_1078781] would 
include Journal of Rheumatology, Art hritis Care and Research, Annals of Rheumatic Diseases  or 
Arthritis Research & Therapy. Publication of data may encourage discussion or statement from  
the National organizations with strategies to increase CVD risk awareness and screening. 
Continuing medic al education activities could be built based on the results dissemination.  
 
We feel that web -based EI  could reach many more RA patients in a timely fashion without 
using many resources. In addition, this strategy could provide patients ease, flexibility an d 
privacy with their educational module administration. National organizations such as the 
Arthritis Foundation and with support of such web -based resources through unrestricted 
educational funds could further mobilize this intervention to across the globe .

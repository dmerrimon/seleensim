Design Phase III, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled, global, multicentre study.
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the Week 24 
timepoint. The study will continue until Week 52.
The study will follow an add -on design; subjects receiving any 
ongoing concomitant medical treatment at stable doses at the time of 
Screening for Crohn’s disease (CD) will be allowed to continue it 
throughout the study.
Study treatments will be allocated, in a 1:1 ratio, by [CONTACT_613697] (IWRS). 
Eligible subjects will be stratified to one of the following 6 
combinations based on:
1.Concomitant treatment:
Current use of concomit ant immunosuppressant (IS) or
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (ie, anti-tumor necrosis
factor [anti-TNF] or anti-integrin [ie, vedolizumab] or
anti-interleukin [IL]12/23 [ie, ustekinumab]) as a single
agent.
Current use of concomitant IS or mAbs (.e, anti-TNF or
anti-integrin [ie, vedolizumab] or anti-IL12/23 [ie,
ustekinumab]) as combination treatment.
No ongoing concomitant IS or mAbs at time of
randomization.
2.External opening(s):
1 versus >[ADDRESS_813773] shown an inadequate response, a

ConfidentialBaseline homogeneity and optima l preparation of fistula(s) tract(s) 
for the local administration of Cx601 or placebo will be guaranteed 
by [CONTACT_613699] (EUA), fistula 
curettage and seton placement for all subjects, done at least [ADDRESS_813779] 7 days 
following the fistula curettage (ciprofloxacin and/ormetronidazole 
are recommended unless documented previous intolerance or 
contraindication to both ).
Seton(s) placed will be removed on the administration day, just 
befor e the administr ation of the study treatment.
Training on the surgical procedure and study treatment 
administration and technical support and assistance will be 
implemented for all participating sites by [CONTACT_613700] (and some of 
the subsequent treatment administrations if required) to monitor the 
compliance to the Surgery Procedure Manual, especially the proper 
study treatment administr ation and to provide assistance to the 
surgeon’s questions if needed. 
Central reading of local pelvic MRIs will be performed. All local 
MRIs will be assessed centrally by [CONTACT_282336] 
(CRO) MRI central lab in a treatment -blinded appr oach for 
eligibility and both treatment -and sequence -blinded for efficacy 
assessments at Week 24 and treatment -blinded at Week 52. 
Disease or disorder 
under studyComplex perianal fistula(s) in subjects with otherwise clinically well 
controlled, non active or mildly active luminal CD.
Determination of 
sample sizeThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects with 
combined remission at Week 24. The following assum ptions are 
made in the sample size calculations:
True combined remissio n rates at Week 24 of 42.2% and 
30% in the Cx601 and placebo groups, respectively (based 
on estimates from a similar population in the Phase 3 
ADMIRE -CD study).
The family -wise Type -1 error rate will be controlled at 0.05 
for the analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints at Week 24.
Based on the above assumptions, a total sample size of 554 subjects 
(277 per treatment arm) will provide at least 85% power for the 
primary efficacy endpoint analysis at Week 24.

Confidential1 Introduction
1.1 Crohn’s Disease and Fistulising Crohn's Disease
Crohn’s disease is an idiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that often 
leads to fibrosis and obstructive symptom s and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract 
from the mouth to the anus, believed to be the result of an imbalance between pro-inflammator y 
and anti-inflammatory mediators[1]. This transmural inflammation results in thickening of the 
bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen, and as Crohn’s disease progresses, it is complicated by 
[CONTACT_613709], microperforation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption[2].
The specific pathogenesis of Crohn's disease perianal fistulas is unknown, but two mechanisms 
have been proposed: (a) fistulas may begin as deep penetrating ulcers in the anus or rectum[3]and 
then extend over time as faeces are forced into the ulcer with the pressure of defecation; and 
(b)fistulas may also arise as a result of an infection or abscess of the anal glands that exist at the 
base of the anal crypts, which penetrate into the inter-sphincteric space and can easily ramify 
from this location[4]. 
The fistula tracts can communicate between intestinal segments, or between an intestinal segment 
and other organs (bladder, vagina), adjacent tissue or the skin. Fistulas are classified as internal 
when they communicate with adjacent organs (e.g., entero -enteric and rectovaginal fistulas) and 
external when they communicate with the dermal surface (i.e., enterocutaneous, peristomal and 
perianal fistulas).
Following the commonly used Parks classification based on the anatomical characteristics of 
perianal fistula
s[5], from  the inter-sphincteric space, a fistula can then tract downwards to the skin 
(superficial fistula and inter-sphinteric fistula), extend to the external anal sphincter 
(trans -sphincteric fistula), track upwards into the inter-sphincteric space (supra -sphincteric 
fistula), or extend out of the external sphincters and penetrate the elevator muscle into the rectum 
(extra-sphinteri c fistula).
The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_585940]'s disease perianal fistulas increases when the disease involves the 
distal bowel. Only 12% of patients with isolated ileal disease develop perianal fistulas, compared 
with 92% of patients with rectal involvement[6]. The  20 years -cumulative risk of perianal fistulas 
in patients with Crohn's disease ranges from 26% to 28%[6, 7].
 Perianal disease is associated with 
high morbidity and, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], with local pain and discharge; it therefore has a very negative 
impact on the quality of life of the affected patients. 
1.[ADDRESS_813806] hidden lesions (abscesses or fistula branches) may result in 
perianal disease becoming persistent or recurrent.
Ther e is consensus among the Amer ican Gastroenterological Association (AGA)[8, 9]and 
European Crohn’s & Colitis Organization (ECCO)[10]working groups concerning the need to

Protocol Amendment 03, 28October 2019
Page 32/ 137
Confidentialcomplement the study of perianal disease with ot her diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Pelvic MRI should be the initial procedure according to the ECCO consensus statement[11}
because it is accurate, reproducible and non-invasive, although it is not needed routinely in 
simple fistulas. MRI has an accuracy of between 76% and 100% for diagnosis and classification 
of perianal fistulas[12, 13]. Imaging techniques in general and MRI in particular is essential to 
provide the surgeon with a virtual view that allows treating all lesions during the surgical 
procedure as well as to select the best surgical approach toavoid, if possible, more radical or 
extensive procedures which may increase the risk of functional impairment.
Examination Under Anaesthesia
In general surgeon practice, examination under anaesthesia (EUA) is considered the gold standard 
only in the hands of an experienced surgeon[11]. EUA has an accuracy of 90% for diagnosis and 
classification of fistulas and abscesses[13]. With this technique, it is possible to perform 
concomitant surgery of the lesions: incision and drainage of abscesses with seton placement, and 
other techniques to treat fistulas.
Anor ectal ultrasound
Anor ectal ultrasound (AUS) requires expertise, but can be equivalent to pelvic MRI in 
completing examination under anaesthesia if rectal stenosis has been excluded[11]. It offers a 
diagnostic accuracy of 56% to 100%, especially when perfor med by [CONTACT_613710]. Associated findings do influence the surgical approach in 10% -
15% of cases[13, 14]. Occasional pain caused by [CONTACT_613711], but this can also be used to guide medico -surgical treatment of perianal fistulas in 
Crohn’s disease, resulting in a high response rate[15].
The combination of either of these imaging techniques (MRI or AUS) with EUA yields a 
diagnostic accuracy of 100% for perianal disease.
1.3 Perianal Fistulas Classification Scores
Classification according to anatomical location (Parks’ classification)
The 5 types of perianal fistula previously described following Parks’ classification[5]are 
commonly used but do not include reference or a classification method reflecting the presence of 
abscesses and/or connection with other organs such as the vagina or bladder, even though such 
information is important for determining medical and surgical management of the disease.
Classification according to complexity
The AGA technical review proposes a simpler classification with just two categories: simple and 
complex fistulas[8,9]. 
For non-commercial use only
Protocol No.: Cx601 -0303
Protocol Amendment 03, 28October 2019
Page 33/ 137
ConfidentialSimple fistulas are low (superficial, low inter-sphincteric or low trans -sphincteric), have 
a single exter nal opening and are not associated with perianal abscess, connection to the 
vagina or bladder, rectal steno sis or m acroscopic proctitis. 
Complex fistulas are high (high inter-sphincteric, high trans -sphincteric, supra -
sphincteric or extra -sphincteric), can have several exter nal openings and be associated 
with perianal abscess, connection to the vagina or bladd er, rectal stenosis or macroscopic 
proctitis.
This classification has greater clinical relevance: simple fistulas respond better to treatment 
wher eas complex ones have lower cure rates with medical treatment and an aggressive surgical 
procedure will often lead to incontinence.

1.4 Treat ment of Fistulising Crohn’s Disease
Crohn’s disease cannot be cured by [CONTACT_613712][1]. The aim  of therapy is 
to alleviate symptoms and treat complications of the disease in order to improve the patients’ 
quality of life. More recently, aggressive treatments such as immunomodulators and biologics 
have aimed to modify the natural course of the Crohn´s disease[34]. 
Given that perianal disease is a prognostic factor of sever e Crohn´s disease[28], and has a strong 
negative impact on quality of life, it requires special attention and should be treated. The 
spontaneous cure rate for perianal fistulas ranges from 6% to 13% in the placebo arm of three 
controlled studies[17, 19, 25]
Simple perianal fistulas
The ECCO consensus statement[11]recommends to assess if simple perianal fistula are 
symptomatic. If not, nothing has to be done. Noncutting seton or fistulotomy are only 
recommended when simple fistulas are symptomatic. Antibiotics, metronidazole (750–1500 
mg/day[26]) or ciprofloxacin[29](1000 mg/day) should be added.
The presence of a perianal abscess must be ruled out and if present should be drained as a matter 
of urgency.

ConfidentialComplex perianal fistulas
The ECCO consensus statement[11]recommends the seton placement for complex fistulas. The 
timing of removal depends of subsequent therapy. Active luminal Crohn’s disease, if present, 
should be treated in conjunction with appropriate surgical management of fistulas. 
The ECCO consensus statement[11]recommends antibiotics and azathioprine/mercaptopurine as 
the first choice of therapy for complex perianal fistula(s) in combination with surgical therapy, in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a lack of clinical trials. Infliximab or adalim umab are used as a second line medical 
treatment.
In the AGA technical review[8, 9],
 infliximab is recommended for treatment of complex perianal 
disease along with azathioprine or mercaptopurine and antibiotics for the induction phase. 
Maintenance with azathioprine or mercaptopurine is recommended, in some cases in association 
with infl iximab.
Surgical treatment of complex perianal disease aims to control sepsis through abscess drainage 
and intervention in the fistulous tracts, including placement of noncutting setons[20]. Fistulectomy 
or fistulotomy are now rarely indicated in complex perianal fistulas in view of the high rate of 
incontinence associated with the procedure. In severe cases with high fistulas, endorectal flaps are 
useful. In patients with sever e refractory disease, diverting colostomy or ileostomy or even 
proctectomy might be necessary. Other procedures such as those involving fibrin glues have been 
shown to be useful, but only in small uncontrolled series.
Complete fistula closure is usually clinically defined as absence of spontaneous suppur ation or 
suppuration on applying gentle pressure[18].
 The fistula drainage assessment is widely used for 
assessing treatment outcomes in clinical trials with the primary endpoint commonly defined as 
improvement or remission deter mined with this assessment measure which classifies fistulas as 
open (i.e., pur ulent material is expelled with gentle pressure) or closed[18].
Key point for achieving long-term closure of the fistulas is closure of the internal opening, thus 
avoiding septic material to enter the fistulous tract. Periana l abscesses (defined as T2 
hyperintense cavities or cavities with a T2 hyperintense rim) visualized by [CONTACT_613713] a fistula tract, which means a dilation of the fistula tract 
caused by [CONTACT_613714]. Eviden ce of fluid perianal abscesses in the tract could be a sign 
of incomplete and non-permanent closure of the fistula. However, the implications on treatment 
outcome of inflammation seen as T2-hyperintense lesions in MRI rema in unsure. It is uncertain 
whether the patients’ condition will deteriorate with the formation of new abscesses and complex 
fistulas. No excessive development of new abscesses was observed in patients treated with 
infliximab and unconfirmed MRI[21]closure of the exter nal opening. So, it seems reasonable to 
adher e to a clinical measure of closure, along with a MRI combined endpoint.
Cell therapy can be a simple, minima lly invasive outpatient alternative that, based on the 
available preclinical and clinical data, would have significant benefits over current clinical 
management of CD patients with previously treated complex perianal fistula(s).

Confidential2 Rationale and Objectives
2.1 Treat ment Rationale
The ultimate therapeutic goal in perianal Crohn’s disease is a complete and sustained closure of 
the fistulas without development of abscesses and thereby [CONTACT_613715], and improving the patients’ quality of life[1]. In a high number of patients, complet e 
closure cannot be achieved despi[INVESTIGATOR_98767] (including infliximab) and surgery in 
accordance with clinical practice.
Cell therapy based on stem cell technologies is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_613658] a variety of areas of 
medicine, particularly since the introduction of adult stem cells[22], avoiding ethical concerns, 
relative to embryonic stem cells. As adult adipose stem cells may be obtained in a technically 
simple way from subdermal adipose tissue, these cells represent adequate candidates for the 
treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies. Hum an lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_613659] a 
population of stem cells of mesenchymal origin with multilineage capacity: adipose derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (ASC). ASC obtained from huma nadipose tissue constitute an easily 
accessible and abundant source of stem cells for several applications as cell based medicinal 
products.
An extensive program of non-clinical pharm acology, biodistribution and safety studies has been 
conducted with eASC, Cx601 at TiGenix (now [COMPANY_005]). Data from these studies indicate that 
Cx601 exhibits immunomodulatory functions. One of the key roles demonstrated for Cx601 has 
been the capacity to impair the proliferation of activated lymphocytes.
Specifically, co-cultur e of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with eASC 
results in dose-dependent reductions in PBMC proliferation and suggests that both cell-cell 
contact [CONTACT_613716]. Additionally, 
in the context of inflammation and tissue repair, co-culture of eASC and PBMCs during 120 
hours reduced production of inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN -γ) and tumor necrosis 
factor -α (TNF -α). Stimulation by [CONTACT_613717]-γ results in upregulation 
of eASC indoleamil 2-3 digoxigenase (IDO) and lead to the accumulation of the tryptophan 
metabolite, kynurenine, in vitro. These findings appear relevant to the pathophysiological 
environment of perianal fistula in CD, wher e both the role ofthe helper 
compartment of the T 
cells in the induction and maintenance of the intestinal inflammatory reaction in CD has been 
suggested in both anim al models and clinical studies, and the production of IFN-γ by T- helper  
(Th1) cells is widely reported. Indeed, in a study wher e T-cells derived from the perianal fistulas 
of 9 patients with CD were characterised, accumulation of Th1, Th17, and Th17/Th1 cells in the 
fistula as compared to peripheral blood was apparent. 
The anti-inflammatory activity of eASC ha s also been confirmed in colitic mouse model, where a 
single intraperitoneal treatment with the product was associated with reduced concentrations of 
inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in 
comparison to untrea ted colitic mice. In addition, mice were less diseased and recovered more

Page 36/ [ADDRESS_813807] demonstrated that after intrarectal injection of eASC, cells only 
distribute locally, with positive signals detected in the rectum  and jejunum. In addition, a 
relatively short persistence (approximately 14 days) is reported and toxicology data for the 
intrarectal route show s the product is well tolerated at doses up to 106cells per rat. When 
considered together, data indicate that eASC are likely to act locally in intralesional 
administration for treatment of perianal fistula, with no distribution expected and a possibility of 
mild host -mediated local reactions at the site of administration demonstrating a good tolerability .
Based on the therapeutic potential of eASC, TiGenix (now [COMPANY_005]) developed the treatment for 
complex anal fistulas based on the local administration of the product.
As commented, the clinical investigation of the product (and the mechanism of action behind this 
local use) has initially been focused within the scope of such a local administration for the 
treatment of complex anal fistula. In autologous set ting, eASC have been proven to be efficacious 
in healing of complex perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn´s disease. The clinical development 
of Cx601 has started to use such cells administered allogeneically to stimulate the healing of 
fistulas in Crohn’s disease patients, which will bring some additional advantages such as the 
avoidance of the liposuction of each patient, and standardization of the investigational product, 
amongst others. 
A first phase II exploratory trial (Cx601 -0101) in Europe with allogeneic eASC administered 
locally for the treatment of complex perianal fistula revealed no significant clinical safety 
concerns at 6 mont hs after the initial administration of eASC. Fifteen out of the 24 subjects who 
received initial treatment with 20 million eASC, received a second administration of 40 million 
cells, due to incomplete closure of the fistula at Week 12. After 24 weeks follow -up, 56.3% (ITT) 
of subjects had the external opening closed, 69.2% (ITT) of subjects had reduction in the number  
of initially draining tracts and40.0% (ITT) of subjects had the fistulous disease closed 
(reepi[INVESTIGATOR_275447], absence of suppuration and lack of collections >2 cm) (data on file).
A subsequent randomized phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_613661](s) in subjects with Crohn’s disease. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled study, Cx601 -0302, ADMIRE -CD study, conducted in a population of 
subjects aged 18years or over, with Crohn’s disease that was non-active or mildly active 
clinically (as defined by a CDA I ≤220 points) at baseline and with complex perianal fistulas that 
had shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional or biologic therapy.
In this study, 212 subjects were randomi zed on a 1:1 ratio to Cx601 or matching placebo (saline 
solution). Cx601 was administered as a single intra-lesional dose of 120million cells and it 
demonstrated efficacy across a range of endpoints.
At Week 24 more subjects in the Cx601 treated group than in the placebo group had achieved 
complete closure of their fistula(s), as reported by [CONTACT_228680]és et al.[45]:
Cx601 was associated with a statistically significant increase (p=0.024) in the 
percentage of subjects with combined remission at Week 24 (49.5%) compared to

sensitivity analyses that assessed the effects of imputing conventions for missing 
data[39, 40]and rescue therapy (imputed as non-response) on the treatment effect and 
which also showed statistically significant increases in proportions of subjects with

the chance of combined remission was increased by 42% with Cx601 compared to 
placebo (relative risk 1.42; 97.5% CI 0.98 -2.06).
Increases in the percentages of subjects with clinical remission and response at 
Week 24 (key secondary endpoints) in the ITT population with Cx601 (53.3% and

treatment differences of 12.3% [p=0.064] and 13.0% [p=0.054], respectively in the ITT

observations were made in the mITT, per protocol and safety (post-hoc analysis ) 
populations.
Cx601 reduced the median time to clinical remission from 14.6 weeks in the placeb o 
group to 6.7 weeks in the Cx601 group. Similarly, the media n time to Response was 
also reduced by [CONTACT_613719]601 from 11.7 weeks in the placebo group to 6.3 weeks in the 
Cx601 group.
The percentage of subjects with Relapse by [CONTACT_10585] 24 was numerically lower for the 
Cx601 group than for the placebo group (38.0% and 50.0%, respectively). The median 
time to Relapse was similar for the Cx601 and placebo groups (19.1 and 18.0 weeks). 
Similar observations were made in the mITT and safety (post-hoc analysis ) 
populations.
Cx601 reduced the activity of the subjects’ perianal disease (as assessed by [CONTACT_613720]) such that it was close to inactive. Themean PDAI total score was reduced 
from 6.8 at baseline to 4.4 at Week 24 following Cx601 administration (a score of 
≤4indicates perianal disease which does not require medical or surgical treatment). 
With placebo, the mean PDAI total score reduced from 6.7 at baseline to 5.1 at Week

ConfidentialThe percentage of subjects in the Cx601 group who had combined remission at 
Week 24 and then relapsed prior to We ek52 was lower in the Cx601 group than in the 
placebo group (25.0% and 44.1%, respectively). The difference in Relapse rate 
between the Cx601 and placebo groups was -19.1% (95% CI -39.5, 1.3). The chance of 
a subject with combined remission at Week 24 notrelapsing by [CONTACT_10585] 52 was 
approximately twice as high with Cx601 than placebo (hazard ratio 2.12; 95% CI 1.00, 
4.47).
This efficacy data was initially submitted to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in March 
2016 to support Marketing Approval Authorization (MAA) to demonstrate that Cx601 treatment 
effectively induces fistula closur e, an effect that is maintained for up to [ADDRESS_813808] one 
conventional or biologi c therapy. Marketing approval was received from the EMA in March 2018. 
In addition , Cx601 was well tolerated and safe at the intended dose of 120 million cells in this 
study.
Subjects were required to under go EUA, fistula curettage, and, if clinically indicated, seton 
placement 2 to 3weeks prior to administration of IMP. AEs collected during this time were 
therefore additionally collected. Non-treatment -emer gent procedure -emer gent AEs occurred in a 
small proportion of subjects and included procedural pain, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, proctalgia, 
diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, and hypotension. 
Similar proportions of subjects exper ienced treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the Cx601 and 
placebo groups up to Week 52 visit (74.6%) . The proportion of subjects who di scontinued due to 
TEAEs was low overall (8.8%) and similar in both treatment groups up to Week 52 visit. 
However, subjects in the placebo group experienced a higher number (n=275) of individual 
TEAEs compared with the Cx601 group (n=250). The m ajority of TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in intensity; sever e TEAEs (overall 10.7%) were reported for similar proportions of subjects in 
both Cx601 and placebo groups up to Week 52 visit. The majority of TEAEs (overall 68.3%) 
were considered to be not related to study treatment up to Week 52 visit. However, it is 
noteworthy that proportionally more subjects in the placebo group (n=49) reported treatment -
related TEAEs than the Cx601 group (n=27) up to Week 52 visit.
TESAEs up to Week 52 visit were reported in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the 
Cx601 group (24.3%) than the placebo group (20.6%). The most common TESAE was anal 
abscess, which was reported in slightly more subjects in the Cx601 group than the placebo group 
(13.6% versus 7.8%). The proportions of subjects with TESAEs of anal abscess consider ed 
related to study treatment or reported as sever e were similar in the Cx601 (n= 9 and 4, 
respectively) and placebo (n=12 and 5, respectively) groups. There were no clinically important 
trends of untoward study treatment -related effects on hematology or clinical chemistry, physical 
examination, or vital signs.
In conclusion, this treatment would prevent one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would 
diminish recurrence of the fistula disease and would reduce drastically the significant disorders 
provoked by [CONTACT_613721]. Indeed, the procedure does not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_613662].

treatment for CD at stable doses at the time of Screening visit,will be allowed to continue it 
throughout the study. A total of appro ximately 740 subjects are planned to be screened in order to 
randomise 554 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a local injection of Cx601 (120 million 
cells) or matching placebo. 
Eligible subjects will be stratified to one of the following 6 combina tions based on:
1.Concomitant treatment:
Current use of concomitant immunosuppressant (IS) or monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) (i.e., anti -tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) or anti -integrin (i.e., vedolizumab) 
or anti- interleukin (IL)12/23 (i.e., ustekinumab) as single agent 
Current use of concomitant IS or mAbs (i.e., anti-TNF or anti-integrin (i.e., 
vedolizumab) or anti-interleukin (IL)12/23 (i.e., ustekinumab) as combination 
treatment 
No ongoing concomitant IS or mAbs treatment at time of randomization

All setons must be withdrawn; fistula(s) curettage should be done, placing a stitch 
on each internal opening according to the Surger y Procedure Manual (provided as 
a separate document). Subjects will be observed after their surgical procedure until 
full recovery, with special attention to signs and symptoms of potential allergic 
reactions. 
Collection of curettage material (optional) before treatment administration, details 
will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Microbiome collection (optional) from the fistula, details will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.
Similar specific training material will be prepared and implemented to standardize 
the procedures at all sites. Please refer to the Surgery Procedure Manual. More 
information is included in section 3.5.
An unblinded sponsor representative will attend the first treatment administration, 
during the surgical procedure, at each site (and some of the subsequent if needed 
upon request) to monitor the compliance to the Surgery Procedure Manual, 
especially the proper study treatment administration and to provide assistance to 
the surgeon’s questions if needed. 
Note that if there is any problem administering the IMP during Visit 0, the visit 
will need to berescheduled. It will not be necessary to repeat the preparation visit, 
the setons will be maintained until the rescheduled treatment visit and will be 
withdrawn just before the injection of the IMP. The timeframe for the new V0 
should be minimum of 2 week s to a maximum of 3 weeks from the date of the 
original V0. All V0 procedures will be repeated during the rescheduled visit.

Cx601 is a 24 mL suspension of huma n expanded adipose -derived stem cells (eASC) of 
allogeneic origin in aseptic buffered huma n albumin solution presented in disposable vials with 
no preservative agents. The cells will be given at a dose of 120 million cells (5 million cells / mL) 
locally injected into the tissue around the internal openings and into the walls of the fistula tracts.
Placebo (saline solution) will be locally injected into the tissue around the internal openings and 
into the walls of the fistula tracts at the same quantity (volume: 24 mL) and following the same 
procedure described for the eASC. Throughout this protocol the treatment administrated in the 
study meaning Cx601 or matched -placebo will be referred to as IMP.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Form , Dose, and Administration Route
Investigational ATMP
Cx601 is a 24 mL suspension of huma n expanded adipose -derived stem cells (eASC) of 
allogeneic origin in aseptic buffered huma n albumin solution presented in disposable vials with 
no preservative agents. Cells are obtained through lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_613668]. Cx601 for clinical use is supplied as a sterile, clear, white to yellowis h 
suspension for local injection, provided in 4x6 mL vials (suspension of 5 million eASC per mL of 
Dulbecco Modified Eagle’s Medium [DMEM] with huma n serum albumin). See the label on the 
investigational product vial for expi[INVESTIGATOR_4389]. 
eASC will be re
-suspended manually, moving them in a gentle manner, avoiding bubble 
formation, until a homogeneous suspension with no visible lumps is obtained. Once cells are re-
suspended, the resulting cell suspension should be used immediately to prevent re-sedimentation 
of the cells. The cell suspension will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_613669] a conventional needle no 
thinner than 22G. The needle used to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_613670] a longer needle, again no 
thinner than 22G. 
A longer needle is needed in order to reach the internal opening(s) (e.g., 88 mm long) (needles 
used for spi[INVESTIGATOR_613671] 90 mm long are adequate for such a purpose). The needle will 
be entered through the anus, and the contents of 2 vials of Cx601 will be injected into the tissue 
surrounding the internal opening(s), making several small blebs . 
A needle will then be entered through the external opening(s), and the contents of the other [ADDRESS_813847](s) in order to avoid the leakage of cells. Specific training material will be prepared to 
homogenise all sites, and the eCRF will include a checklist of the fistula preparation and 
treatment administration procedures. In order to provide further assistance to the sites a sponsor 
representative specifically trained and experie nced in administration protocol might be available 
at site. The Surgical Procedure Manual is provided as an independent document.

Study medication will be shipped by [CONTACT_613740][INVESTIGATOR_613673] e the study treatment administration will be performed,  
according to local practice and/or regulations. See the label on the investigational product vial for 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_4389].
The Drug Administrator or Designee will maintain adequate records of the receipt and disposition 
of study drug shipment to the site. All used and unused vials of study drug must be recorded and 
tracked until data is monitored. Vials then should be destroyed locally and destruction will be 
documented as appropriate.
Study Drug administration must be performed by [CONTACT_613741].
A specific Surgery Procedure Manual will be provided to the site as a separate document, 
ensuring appropriate training.
3.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Treatments will be allocated by [CONTACT_613742] 
(IWRS) and subjects will be stratified using the following criteria:
Current immunosuppressant or biologics as single agent or as a combination or 
no ongoing concomitant treatment at Screening visit
External opening(s) (1 or >1) 
3.5.4 Blinding
Treatments will be prepared for administration close to the surgery room  but if possib le in a 
separate room and the administration of the treatment will be partially masked. The cell 
suspension will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_38105] a syringe to unable identification 
of the IMP. There will be a 
specific blinding plan at every site, agreed and signed by [CONTACT_613743].
However, in addition, the double -blind design will be preserved by [CONTACT_613744] 
(administrator surgeon) who will administer the treatment and another inves tigator (efficacy 
evaluator) who will evaluate the fistula in a blinded fashion.
Members of the unblinded surgical team (i.e. assistant to surgeon) are not allowed to share any 
information about the potentially suspected study treatment used in the surgery procedure with 
the blinded investigators team (efficacy evaluators), but they will clearly identify the treated 
fistula(s) in order to allow the evaluator to assess the efficacy during the study visits.
Additionally, surgeons who administer the study treatment and any ancillary personnel involved 
in study treatment administration will not be allowed to participate in any clinical assessment of 
the fistula(s) during the study.

Confidential4 Adverse Events
The development of the IMP, among others, is under the EU “Detailed guidelines on good 
clinical practice (GCP) specific to advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP)” and it implies 
that relationship to procedure administ ration is to be also assessed for any adverse event reported 
among other obligations for specific reporting related to IMP administration and use.
Other guidances have being considered in the development of the study protocol; among other, 
US guidances (“Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue -Based Products (HCT/Ps) from 
Adipose Tissue: Regulatory Considerations”; “Considerations for the Design of Early -Phase 
Clinical Trials of Cellular and Gene Therapy Products, as an example”).

Investigational Medical Product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP.
Medical disorders, including concomitant diseases present at the time of signing 
the informed consent are only considered AEs if they worsen after this time. All 
baseline conditions should be recorded as part of Medical History.
Changes in laboratory parameters (biochemistry, haematology), as well as

administration of study medication and that the investigator considers to be 
clinically relevant shoul d be recorded as AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs), 
provided that the definitions given in this section and in the Section 4.1.4 (“Serious 
Adverse Event”) are m et, respectively. In contrast, clinically significant changes in 
laboratory parameters or other tests that are associated to the disease under study 
will not be rated as AEs or SAEs, unless the investigator judges them to be more 
serious than expected base d on the subject condition.
Fluctuations or re-occurrences of the disease under study (Crohn’s disease), that 
are consider ed normal for the subject and are recorded in the Medical Histor y, 
need not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition were to deteriorate 
(worsening) during the study this would then be recorded as an AE.
For the purpose of this study, drainage of the treated fistula and abscesses, defining 
the primary endpoint, will not be captured as AEs unless there is evidence 
suggesting a caus al relationship between the IMP or the administration procedure .

Confidential4.1.2 Adverse Reaction (AR)
All untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose administered. All AEs 
judged by [CONTACT_96949] a reasonab le causal 
relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression reasonable causal 
relationship means that a relationship between the IMP and the adverse event cannot be ruled out. 
In this study, AEs for which no investigator assessment is available (missing or unknown) are 
considered as adverse reactions.
4.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Reaction (uAR)
An adverse reaction, the nature or sever ity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved IMP or the SmPC/ Product 
Infor mation for a marketed drug).
Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) constitute unexpected events. In the same way, 
when the outcome of the AR is not consistent with the applicable product information, this AR 
should be considered unexpected.

Results in death,
Is life -threatening,
Requir es inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or
Is a medica lly significant event, including any event or synonym described in the 
[COMPANY_005] Medically Significant AE List (APPENDIX 3), or requires intervention to 
prevent at least one of the outcomes listed above, or 
Is a suspected tra nsmission of an infectious agent.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situation, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but might jeopardize the subject or might 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. These events should also 
usually be considered serious. Examples of such adverse events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency (addiction) or drug abuse.
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” re
fers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.

Confidential4.2 Adverse Event Severity Assessment
Seriousness and Severity should not be confounded.
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or sever e myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).
This is not the same as "serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning (see Section 
4.1.4 ). Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
Severity of the adverse events will be recorded at the time they occur and will be rated according 
to the following criteria:
 Mild (asymptomatic), an event easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minima l 
discomfort that does not prevent the subject from fulfilling daily activiti es.
 Moderate, symptomatic, but does not significantly interfere with function.
 Sever e, causes a significant interference with function.
Death itself is not an adverse event, but rather the outcome of a previously reported event , which 
should be described using medical terminology. Only in those cases wher e either no cause for 
death is known (e.g. sudden death, Death NOS) the event “death” should be reported.
The terms death/death of unknown cause and sudden death are clearly distinct and must not be 
used interchangeably.
4.3 Adverse Event Relatedness Assessm ent (Causality Assessm ent)
The investigator must establish, based on his clinical judgment and the information on IMP 
provided by [CONTACT_613748]/or the 
surgical procedure and the occurrence of the AE/SAE.
The expression: “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there is 
evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship. In this study, AEs that are consider ed as 
related to IMP, including for which no investigator assessment is available (missing or unknown) 
are consider ed as adverse reactions. For AEs considered as not related to study treatment it is 
assumed that there is no reasonable causal relationship.
Detailed consid erations to be taken into account on causality assessment include:
-associative connections (time or place: plausibility),
-pharmacological explanations,
-previous knowledge of the drug,
-presence of characteristic clinical or pathological phenomena,
-exclusion of other causes and/or absence of alternative explanations.
Other causes, such as: the natural histor y of other underlying diseases, namely the disease under  
study, concomitant treatments, other risk factors like surgical procedures, and time relationship of 
the event to the IMP need to be taken into account for the assessment.

following situations:
a)Missing data, including no MRI or no clinical assessment at Week 24, evaluation of 
Week 24 combined remission is not possible; OR
b)Treatment failure is documented for a subject if they require rescue medication or

Confidential6.1.4 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses
The following exploratory endpoints will be analyzed:
Change from baseline in total Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) score at Week 
6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 52.
Change from baseline in total PRO -2 score (defined as average daily stool frequency 
and average daily abdominal pain) at Week 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 52.
Change from b aseline in blinded central MRI Van Assche score at Weeks 24 and 52.
Change from baseline in modified Van Assche blinded central MRI score at Weeks 24 
and 52.
Change from baseline in the Magnetic Resonance Novel Index for Fistula Imaging for 
Crohn's Disease (MAGNIFI -CD) score at Weeks 24 and 52.
Change from baseline at Weeks 24 and 52 in blinded central MRI analysis of 
hyper enhancement in T1 sequence, and hyperintensity in T2 sequence.
Change from baseline in electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) listed below, all 
measured through Weeks 12, 24 and 52:
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from [ADDRESS_813869] 2 weeks prior to the visit,
CDAI items score,
Num ber of pads used per day along last 2 weeks pri or to each visit,
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI),
EQ-5D[44],
SF36,
Health Resources Utilization (HRU)
Immunogenicity responses as measured by [CONTACT_48919] -specific antibody (DSA) levels 
Change from baseline in cytokines, immune -and other inflammation -associated 
markers at Weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52.
Change from baseline in the microbiome diversity at Week 6.
All continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with treatment, stratum , and visit (if data collected at multiple post-treatment visits) as fixed 
factors with the inclusion of the time by [CONTACT_9866] (if appropriate); if available, the 
baseline value will be used as covariate. The treatment compar isons and corresponding 95% Cis 
will be presented for each scheduled visit. 
All binary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methodology as used for the primary 
efficacy endpoint described above, including the handling of missing data and treatment fa ilures.
Antidonor antibody kinetics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The results will be reported 
in a separate report.

Confidential6.1.5 Safety Analyses
The primary analysis set for all safety analyses will be the Safety analysis set. Analyses will be 
performed with subjects grouped according to the actual treatment received.
Detailed evaluation and summaries of safety endpoints will include:
Incidence of treatment -emer gent adverse events (TEAEs)
Incidence of TEAEs related to study treatment
Incidence of treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)
Incidence of AESIs
Incidence of TESAEs related to study treatment
Incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs according to their intensity/severity
Incidence of TEAEs or TESAEs leading to study withdrawal
Incidence of NTEAEs, whet her or not related to surgical procedure(s), during fistula(s) 
preparation visit up to the to study treatment administration (if related, then, procedure -
emergent non –treatment -emer gent adverse event)
Incidence of serious NTEAEs and serious TEAEs related to the procedure or treatment 
administration
Incidence of TEAEs, whet her or not related to the surgical procedure(s), following 
treatment administration and within up to two weeks since the last procedure
Incidence of deaths (Fatal SAEs)
Incidence of clinical findings on physical examination, vital signs, or laboratory tests
Immunological humoral response by [CONTACT_613756] (including vital signs and laboratory tests) will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. The number of subjects exper iencing each AE category will be summarized by [CONTACT_613757] (MedDRA) 
terminology.
Safety analysis will be performed on the Safety analysis set. Categorical data will be summarized 
with absolute and relative frequencies (percentages), and continuous data will be summarized 
with the num
ber of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, the first quartile, median, the 
third quartile, and maximum.
Non–treatment -emer gent adverse events (serious and non-serious events that occur during the 
Screening period) will be collected and reported separately.
6.2 Interim Analysis
No interim analysis is planned for this study.
6.3 Determination of Sample Size
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjec ts with combined remission at 
Week 24. The following assumptions are made in the sample size calculations:
For non-commercial use only
Protocol No.: Cx601 -0303
Protocol Amendment 03, 28October 2019
Page 85/ 137
ConfidentialTrue combined remission rates at Week 24 of 42.2% and 30% in the CX601 and placebo 
groups, respectively (based on estimates from a similar population in the Phase 3 
ADMIRE -CD study).
The family-wise Type -1 error rate will be controlled at 0.05 for the analyses of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 24. 
Based on the above assumptions, a total sample size of 554 subjects (277 per tr eatment arm) will 
provide at least 85% power for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis at Week 24.
6.4 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data
The following approach for imputation of missing data will be used in the Week 24 primary 
efficacy analysis:
A subject will be classified as a non-responder at Week 24 (single imputation) in any of the 
following situations:
a)Missing data, including no MRI or no clinical assessment at Week 24, evaluation of 
Week 24 combined remission is not possible; OR
b)Treatment failure is documented for a subject if they require rescue medication or 
procedure as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Other sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data and the analysis populations on the 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be detailed in the SAP. The analysis of the secondary and 
other efficacy responder rate endpoints will use a similar approach as described above for 
handling of dropouts or missing data. Under this approach, a subject will be classified as a non-
responder at a given visit in any of the following situations:
a)Missing data at the visit of interest; OR
b)Treatment failure is documented for a subject before the visit of interest if they require 
rescue medication or procedure as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

with a follow -up period up to 52 weeks after the administration of a new therapy with 
eASC (Cx601) for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in patients wit h Crohn’s 
disease.
The study will follow an add-on design: patients receiving any ongoing concomitant 
medical treatment for Crohn’s disease (CD) at stable doses at the time of Screening 
visit, will be allowed to continue it throughout the study. A total ofapproximately 
[ADDRESS_813889] 326 patients in

patients were based on the estimate of 15.2% of the true treatment difference in the primary 
endpont from th e completed phase III study (ADMIRE -CD) and provided at least 80% power for 
the primary efficacy analysis. However, an estimate of 12.2% was obtained from an ADMIRE -
CD post hoc subgroup analysis using a subgroup of subjects who are more similar to the targ eted 
patient population in ADMIRE -II. Therefore, an updated sample size of 554 subjects that is based

Rationale for Change: Editorial changes made for completeness and improved clarity in the 
definition of the secondary endpoints. For the change to the key secondary endpoint, ‘clinical 
response’ is defined as 50% healing of fistulas which were draining at baseline, and while 
clinically important, is likely less relevant to the patient than ‘time to clinical remission’ which is 
defined as the time to 100% healing of fistula.

size to 554 subjects from the originally planned sample size of 326 patients was added.
The primary change occurs in Section 6.3Determination of Sample Size .
Initial 
wording:The sample size calculation for this study is based on the results from the previous 
phase 3 ADMIRE -CD study (Cx601- 0302) performed in Europe and Israel in a 
similar patient population and study design. Briefly, 212 patients were randomized, 
107 patients to a Cx601 treatment arm and 105 to a control of matching placebo: 1) 
the placebo -arm combined remission rate at Week 24 was approximately 34% which 
increased to 50% in the Cx601 containing -arm thus a 15.2% absolute differ ence; 
97.5%CI: 0.2-30.3%; p=0.024 on intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis. Accordingly, a 
sample size of 326 patients (163 patients per arm) will be needed with at least 80% 
power to statistically detect a minimum 16 per cent points differ ence in the 
percentage of patients achieving Combined Remission of perianal fistula(s) as 
clinically and radiologically assessed with absence of collections >2 cm (in at least 2 
dimensions) confirmed by [CONTACT_613791] 24 between 
Cx601 and placebo (two-sided α=0.05; Chi-square test). Accordingly and assuming 
an estimated 25% of screening failures as per previous phase III study, 
approximately 436 patients will be screened in order to randomise, on a 1:1 ratio 326 
eligible patients. No allowa nce for premature withdrawals is made since all 
randomised patients will be included in the analysis, although 10% premature 
withdrawals are accounted for in the difference to be detected).

calculations:
True combined remission rates at Week 24 of 42.2%  and 30% in the 
CX601 and placebo groups, respectively (based on estimates from a 
similar population in the Phase 3 ADMIRE -CD s tudy).
The family -wise Type -1 error rate will be controlled at 0.05 for the 
analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 
24.
Based on the above assumptions, a total sample size of 554 subjects (277 per 
treatment arm) will provide at least 85%  power for the primary efficacy 
endpoint analysis at Week 24.
The sample size calculation for this study is based on the results from the previous 
phase 3 ADMIRE CD study (Cx601 0302) performed in Europe and Israel in a 
similar patient populatio n and study design. Briefly, 212 patients were randomized, 
107 patients to a Cx601 treatment arm and 105 to a control of matching placebo: 1) 
the placebo -arm combined remission rate at Week 24 was approximately 34% which 
increased to 50% in the Cx601 conta ining arm thus a 15.2% absolute differ ence; 
97.5%CI: 0.2-30.3%; p=0.024 on intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis. Accordingly, a 
sample size of 326 patients (163 patients per arm) will be needed with at least 80%

Cx601 and placebo (two sided α=0.05; Chisquare test). Accor dingly and assuming 
an estimated 25% of screening failures as per previous phase III study, 
approximately 436 patients will be screened in order to randomise, on a 1:1 ratio 326 
eligible patients. No allowance for premature withdrawals is made since all 
randomised patients will be included in the analysis, although 10% premature 
withdrawals are accounted for in the difference to be detected).
Rationale for Change: The assumptions made to calculate the original sample size of 326 
patients were based on the estimate of 15.2% of the true treatment difference in the primary 
endpont from the completed phase III study (ADMIRE -CD) and provided 80% power for the 
primary efficacy analysis. However, an estimate of 12.2% was obtained from an ADMIRE -CD 
post hoc subgroup analysis using a subgroup of subjects that are more similar to the targeted 
patient population in ADMIRE -II. Therefore, an updated sample size of 554 subjects that is based 
on an assumption of 12.2% for the true difference and provides approximately 85% power for the 
primary analysis was consider ed appropriate to ensure that ADMIRE -CD II is an adequate and 
well-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076].

ConfidentialChange 33:Editorial changes to the section describing the handling of dropouts or missing data 
were made for improved clarity. Language that was not applicable to the section was removed .
The primary change occurs in Section 6.4Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data . This section 
was Section 6.[ADDRESS_813922] ing:All efforts will be developed to keep the anticipated percentage of missing data not 
above the 10%, especially related to the outcome values meaningful for the analysis 
of the primary and key secondary endpoints.
In particular, the following measures[41, 42]will apply:
Missing data due to discontinuation of study treatment due to, e.g., adverse events 
or lack of efficacy will be avoided as patients receiving a rescue medication or 
procedure will be followed during the study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and investigators 
are exhorted to consider any patient’s withdrawal by [CONTACT_613793]/or safety to study 
medication whenever is applicable (see Section 3.4.1).
Missing data because of lacking MRI due to waiting time for this assessment is 
anticipated to be minimal considering the North Amer ica top ranking in the number  
of MRI machines per-capi[INVESTIGATOR_17399]; the selection of investigational sites will be based on 
this key feasibility asse ssment globally.
Patients will be provided a reminder of next study visit at each visit throughout the 
study. Investigators will be trained on the importance of avoiding missing data.
Monitoring of adher ence by [CONTACT_1962], especially those who cannot tolerat e or do not 
adequately respond to treatment will be performed.
The analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed on ITT, mITT, and per protocol anlaysis sets, with the ITT as the 
primary analysis set. In ITT analysis, for the non- treated patients or those treated 
patients who have missing value for their primary or key secondary efficacy 
assessments or have taken any rescue medication or go through a rescue surgery 
(for details see also Section 6.1.3) at any time before Week 24 visit during the 
study, for both primary and key secondary endpoints will be imputed as a non-
response: i.e. non-Combined Remission, non-Clinical Remission and non-
Response, respectively.
If any of the rescue medications or surgery occurred after theWeek 24 but befor e 
the Week 52, the non-response will be imputed from the documented date of 
occurrence up to Week 52 but not retrospectively if any efficacy data is available at 
Week 24.
If a patient’s endpoint(s) is imputed as an overriding non-response at any point 
during the study, then that endpoint will necessarily be imputed as an overriding 
non-response at all subsequent time points throughout the rema inder of the study, 
regardless of whether the patient has any actual non -missing data at any subs equent 
time point.
Reasons for treatment failure (TF) imputation will be explored and categorized.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary and the key secondary endpoints with respect to 
missing values and the use of rescue medication or surgery will be detailed in the 
SAP.

wording:The following approach for imputation of missing data will be used in the Week 
24 primary efficacy analysis:
A su bject will be classified as a non-responder at Week 24 (single imputation) in 
any of the following situations:
a)Missing data, including no MRI or no clinical assessment at Week 24, 
evaluation of Week 24 combined remission is not possible; OR
b)Treat ment failure is documented for a subject if they require rescue 
medication or procedure as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Other sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data and the analysis 
populations on the analysis of the primary endpoint will be detailed in the SAP. 
The analysis of the secondary and other efficacy responder rate endpoints will 
use a similar approach as described above for handling of dropouts or missing 
data. Under this approach, a subject will be classified as a non-responder at a 
given visit in any of the following situations:
a)Missing data at the visit of interest; OR
b)Treat ment failure is documented for a subject before the visit of interest 
if they require rescue medication or procedure as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]

The primary change occurs in Section 8.4Data Quality Assurance
Initial 
wording:[…]
The database quality will be asse ssed before the database closure; and only when 
the SAP is approved and the analysis sets are determined, the database will be 
locked and provided to Statistics to perform the stat istical analysis and prepare the 
Clinical Study Report at Week 24, then Week 52. The blinding will be kept 
throughout the study for investigators and patients. Treatment codes will not be 
revealed to participating investigators and patients until the results of the follow 
up period, up to [ADDRESS_813923] their assessment done at Week 24.

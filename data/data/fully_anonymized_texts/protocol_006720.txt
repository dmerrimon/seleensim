5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently randomly assigned to the stud y treatment  or entered in the study.  A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants  to 
meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen 
failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse eve nt (SAE).  
 
 
 
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_645940]  500 patients will be screened in order to reach target enrollment.   The 
source of participants is expected to come primarily from outpatient clinics and the general public.  As 
Demodex  positive patients are widely available, participants are expected to come from in -office visits of 
participating  investigators.  In the gen eral public, participants may be identified by [CONTACT_501519]  (e.g., 
itching and burning of the lids margins)  and can be reached through print advertisements (e.g., 
newspaper, magazine advertisement, flyer, poster, etc.) ; social media; radio or television advertisement; 
and/or telephone screening script.   
 
As the risk to participants is considered minimal,  employee s of the study site and family members of site 
staff may be invited to participate in the clinical trial.   Site staff who work on the clinical trial  are not 
eligible to participate . 
 
To retain participants, participants may receive visit reminders and some reimbursement for their time 
and travel expen ses. 
 
In the event prohibited medications / treatments  are indicated for care, participant s will not be 
discontinued.  
 
6 STUDY TREATMENT  
 
6.1 STUDY TREATMENT (S) ADMINISTRATION  
  
6.1.[ADDRESS_645941] substance.  Lotilaner is an isoxazoline and inhibits the γ -
aminobutyric acid (GABA) -gated chloride channels (GABACls) of arthropods.  The GABA -mediated 
chloride influx leads to hyperpolarization of the cellular memb rane and generates an inhibitory 

Saturn -[ADDRESS_645942] should be stored at 15 ° to 30°C .  
There are no light or humidity requirements.   Participants will be instructed to store the study drug at 
room temperature in a climate -controlled environm ent (15 ° to 30  °C) avoiding extreme heat or cold.  
 
6.2.4  PREPARATION  
 
Not applicable.  
 
6.3 PARTICIPANT ID ASSIGNMENT AND MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  
AND MASKING  
A balanced (1:1) randomization will be used for this study .  A computer -generated blocked 
randomization schedule will be generated by .   will use the randomization 
schedule to package the study drug .  The labelled study drug will be shipped to the US distribution 
center for distribution to the clinical sites.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a potential study participant has provided written informed consent and met all eligibility criteria, the 
participant  is considered eligible to participate .  If the potential participant elects to participate in the 
study, they can continue with the Day 1 procedure or  be scheduled to return for Day 1.   At Day 1,  they 
will be dispensed  the next available study drug bottle from the current site inventory by [CONTACT_276359] (IRT) system  , which uses block 
stratification  by [CONTACT_3725] .  The participant will receive their assigned study drug at the completion of the  Day 
[ADDRESS_645943] in a dosing compliance diary on a daily basis.  Dosing compliance 
will be assured by [CONTACT_28920] -office review of a dosing diary.   
 
  Participants  will 
be reinstructed on dosing compliance and this will be documented in the source documents.  
 
6.5 CONCO MITANT THERAPY  
 
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician.  Medications to be recorded  in the source document  are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications , supplements , and relevant 
treatments and/or procedures (e.g., lid scrubs,  tea tree oil,  etc.) .  All concomitant medications including 
over -the-counter medications and nutritional supp lements used within the [ADDRESS_645944] visit 
will be documented.  Any changes to concomitant medication use or initiation of new medications will 
be reported throughout the study.  
 
For the duration of the study, any therapy considered necessary  for the participant ’s welfare may be 
given to the participant at the discretion of the investigator.  Initiation of new medications or changes to 
concomitant medications should be recorded in the source document . 
 
6.5.1  RESCUE MEDICINE  
  
No rescue medication is available for this indication.  
 
7 STUDY TREATMENT  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY TREATMENT  
 
Discontinuation from use of the study treatment  does not mean discontinuation from the study, and 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically 
significant finding is identified after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will determine if 
any change in participant management is needed.   Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as 
an AE.  Participants to be discontinued for AE(s) will be followed until the event is resolved or 
considered medically stable by [CONTACT_093].  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study treatment  discontinuation may  include the following:  
• An AE assessment and performance of safety assessments including visual acuity , IOP, slit lamp 
biomicroscopy , endothelial cell density , hematology, blood chemistry , drug concentration 
analysis  and urinalysis   
• Any follow -up evaluations  required per investigator determination  
 
Temporary discontinuation of the study treatment could include the onset of such conditions as an 
allergic conjunctivitis or signs or symptoms of eyelid allergy (e.g., injection, swelling, itching, etc.).  Per 
investigator discretion, the study treatment could be discontinued until such a time that the a llergic

7.[ADDRESS_645945].   An 
investigator may discontinue a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Pregnancy  
• If any clinical AE  or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation 
in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Reasons relating to C OVID -19 
• Other (specify reason)  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the exit eCRF.  Participant s 
who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study treatment  will 
not be replaced.  Participant s who sign the informed consent form , are randomized and receive the 
study treatment  and subsequently discontinue , or are disco ntinued from the study,  will not be replaced.    
 
7.[ADDRESS_645946] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_46342] , counseling the participant on the importance of  continuing the administration of the 
study drop and  of maintaining the assigned visit schedule .  In addition, t he site should ascertain 
if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, three  telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
method s).  These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or 
study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
discontinued  from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.

taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate.  
 
Events that are considered sight -threatening in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_501511] b e considered SAEs.

8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
The following guidelines will be used to describe the severity  of AEs .  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures.  Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   
 
Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serio us.”  Severity is a measurement of 
intensity .  Thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a SAE.  For example, a headache may be severe in 
intensity, but would not be serious unless it met one or more of the criteria for a serious adverse event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONS HIP TO STUDY TREATMENT  
 
All AEs must have their relationship to study treatment  assessed by [CONTACT_501520]/her clinical judgment.   The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  In a clinical trial, the study product 
must always be suspect.  
 
• Definitely Related  – Evidence indicates a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the 
study drug adm inistration exists  or that the association of the event with study drug  
administration is unknown and the event is not reasonabl y supported by [CONTACT_501521]:  
o There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset  of the AE and study treatment 
administration, and/or  
o There is a biologically plausible mechanism for study treatment causing or contribut ing to 
the AE,  and 
o The AE cannot be reasonably attributed t o concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs  or 
procedures.  
• Potentially Related – Evidence  indicates a possible relationship to the study drug such that:  

Saturn -2 Trial   
Protocol TRS-010 9-Dec-2021  
   24 o The event  occurs within a reasonable period of time relative to the treatment that makes a 
causal rela tionship possible, but plausible explanations may a lso be provided by [CONTACT_501522], products, chemicals, underlying disease, environment, etc.  
o The event is possibly related to the study treatment.  
• Not Related  – Evidence indicates no plausible direct relationship  to the study drug  such that:  
o A clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset  of the AE and drug 
administration, and/or  
o A causal relationship is considered biologically implausible  
o The AE ca n be attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs  or procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
  
The investigator  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or fre quency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study treatment .  Expectedness should  be determined  
if the AE is characterized as  related  to treatment and is serious  (met one or more of the criteria for a n 
SAE).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  OUTCOME  
The clinical outcome of an AE will be characterized as follows:  
• Resolved without sequelae  
• Resolved with sequelae (specify)  
• Death  
• Ongoing (i.e. , continuing at time of study discontinuation)  
• Unknown  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  TREATMENT OR ACTION TAKEN  
The clinical treatment or action taken from an AE will be characterized as follows:  
• None  
• Medical intervention  
• Surgical intervention  
• Unknown  
• Other  (specify)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ACTION TAKEN WITH INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
The action taken with the IP will be characterized as follows:  
• None  
• Drug temporarily withdrawn  
• Drug discontinued  
• Unknown  

Saturn -2 Trial   
Protocol TRS-010 9-Dec-2021  
   25  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.   At 
study visits, study personnel should  pose general questions to the participant to ascertain if  the 
participant experienced any issues prior to the visit.   
 
All AEs , including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs , will be captured on the 
appropriate  eCRF.  Information to be collected includes event description, date  of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of t he event.  All AEs occurring while 
in the  study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.    
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
Baseline  and not reported as an AE.  However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be p erformed.   
 
The investigator or designee  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
study drug is first administered  until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each s tudy visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used when recording AEs.  Colloquialisms 
and/or abbreviations should not be used.  Only one medical concept, preferably a diagnosis instead of 
individual symptoms, should be recorded as the event (e.g. , record congestive heart failure rather than 
dyspnea, rales and cyanosis).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual sign or 
symptom  should be recorded as a separate AE.  A diagnosis that is subsequ ently established should be 
reported as follow -up information.   
 
Adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g. , sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_163031].  A "primary" event, if clearly identifiable, should represent the most accurate  clinical term to 
record as the AE event term.  For example: Orthostatic hypotension   fainting and fall to floor   head 
trauma   neck pain.  The primary event is orthostatic hypotension and the sequelae are head trauma 
and neck pain.  
 
Centralized safety o versight for this multi -site study will be provided by [CONTACT_46449].

   27 8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
 
Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) include s any females who have experienced menarche and 
who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or 
bilatera l oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal at least [ADDRESS_645949] menses.  WOCBP will 
be required to use designated methods of birth control during the course of the study.  All women who 
are pregnant, nursing an infant or planning a pregnancy during  the duration of this study will be 
excluded from participation.  
 
If a participant or investigator suspects that the participant may be pregnant prior to study drug 
administration, the study drug should be withheld until the results of pregnancy testing are available.  If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the participant should not administer the study drug and should not be enrolled 
in the study.  
 
If a female participant becomes pregnant during the study,  use of the study drug should be discontinued  
immediately .  The investigator will notify the sponsor  (or designee) immediately after the pregnancy is 
confirmed.  The investigator will (1) obtain a consent from the female participant for pregnancy follow -
up and (2) follow the progress of the pregnancy to term.  The investigator should document the 
outcome of the pregnancy and provide a copy of the documentation to the sponsor  or designee.   The 
sponsor  or sponsor’s designee  will be responsible for reporting t o the IRB and regulatory agencies as 
appropriate.

Saturn -2 Trial   
Protocol TRS-010 9-Dec-2021  
   29 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
A total sample size of  300 subjects (150 subjects per arm)  yields approximately 99% power to establish 
superiority of TP -03 to vehicle in the participants meeting the primary efficacy endpoint assuming a 
response rate of  80.0% in TP -03 and 15.8% for vehicle treatments, respectively  using Pearson chi -
squared to test a 1 -sided hypothesis with a significance level of 0.025 .  Response rates for sample size 
calculations are  based upon a prior OUS clinical study of TP-03, 0.25%,  for the treatment of Demodex  
blepharitis.  
 
Based on the results of a more recent Phase 2b/3 study, TRS -009 (Saturn -1), with a response rate of 
44.0% for the TP -03 treatment group and 7.4% for the vehicle treatment group, a total sample size of 
300 subjects still provide s greater than 99% power.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study will be considered a success and TP-03, 0.25%, will be considered superior to vehicle in clinical 
cure if H [ADDRESS_645950] > 95% power to claim 
success for clinical cure.  A closed hierarchical testing structure will be used such that  the analysis will 
first be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Accounting for a 30% discontinuation, approximately 209 subjects per arm (approximately 418 total) will 
be randomized.   The planned enrollment is much greater than typi[INVESTIGATOR_501513] [ADDRESS_645951] of COVID -19 and the possibility that up to  two 
sites are unable to complete the study.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
 
The a nalysis datas ets will include the following :  
• Full Analysis Set – The full analysis set will include all randomized participants.  Participants in 
the FAS will be analyzed as randomized.  
• COVID -[ADDRESS_645952] 5% of subjects met th ese criteria.  
• Per Protocol Set – The per -protocol (PP) set will include participants in the FAS who do not have 
significant protocol deviations that effect the primary endpoint analyses.  Protocol deviations 
will be assessed prior to unmasking.  Participants in the PP s et will be analyzed as treated.  
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all participants who have received at least one dose of 
the investigational product.  Participants in the safety population will be analyzed as treated.  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENER AL APPROACH  
 
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed prior to unmasking of the study data.   If there 
are any discrepancies between the protocol and the SAP, the SAP will take precedence.   
Quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  Qualitative/categorical data will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages.  Statistical testing, unless other wise indicated, will be performed at a 1 -
sided 0.025 significance level.  
 
When applicable, two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported.   Baseline will be considered the 
last non -missing measure prior to initiation of study therapy.  Change from ba seline will be calculated as 
follow -up visit minus baseline.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint  analysis  will be conducted  with  the FAS, with intercurrent events handled 
as described in the missing data section .  Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_2939].  
Testing of the percentage of subjects cured at Day [ADDRESS_645953] p -value 
will be tested at the 0.0125 level.  If this secondary endpoint is significant at the 0.0125 level, then it and 
the remaining secondary variable will be declared statistical ly significant.  If not, the remaining 
secondary will be tested at the 0.0083 level.  If the null hypothesis, H 01 is not rejected at a one -sided α of 
0.025, testing will stop and the three secondary efficacy hypotheses will not be tested . 
  
Missing Data  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted with missing data and intercurrent events handled in the 
following manner:  
• Discontinuation of study medication and non-optimal compliance is ignored [treatment policy 
strategy] .  
• Withdrawal due  to lack of efficacy  or adverse events : missing data will be imputed as failure 
[hypothetical strategy] . 
• Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy  or 
adverse events : missing data will be imputed employing Mult iple Imputation (MI) using 
randomized treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology [hypothetical 
strategy] .  
 
Sensitivity analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed as specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) .   
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The statistical approach for the secondary efficacy endpoint s will be the same as for the primary efficacy 
endpoint  analysis . 
 
  
 
 
 
 
9.4.5  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
All safety analyses will be conducted using the safety set.  Safety measures will be summarized for each 
treatment arm and visit (as appropriate) using descriptive statistics.   Adverse events will be coded using 

Saturn -2 Trial   
Protocol TRS-010 9-Dec-2021  
   32 the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Each MedDRA preferred term  will be 
counted once only for a given participant.  The severity, frequency , relationship of AEs to study 
treatment , expectedness if serious, duration, and outcome will be presented  either in a table or listing .  
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study treatment  and serious treatment -
emergent AEs will be presented either in a table or a listing.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_645954] been completed and  all associated study data has been received and corrected, the analysis 
of the endothelial cell density results will be performed.  A report of the endothelial cell density results 
will be prepared and the report w ill be submitted to the NDA.

Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
investigator.   The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.    
  
Study participation should be captured in a participant’s medical record.   This is to ensure that anyone 
who would access the patient medical record has adequate knowledge that the patient is participating 
in a clinical trial.  
  
All source documents should be  completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.   Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation o f the trial.   Electronic source 
data are data initially recorded in electronic form.   Examples of source data include, but are not limited 
to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, participants’ memory aids 
or evaluatio n checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, audio recordings of counseling sessions, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_71975], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfi lm or magnetic media, x -rays, and 
participant files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico -technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial.  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_501514].    
  
Clinical data (including AEs and concomitant medications) and clinical laboratory data will be entered 
into , a [ADDRESS_645959] protection and internal quality checks, such as 
automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  Clinical 
data will be entered directly from  the source documents.   Data recorded in the electronic case report

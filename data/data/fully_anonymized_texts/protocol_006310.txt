Study Design:
This is a multicentre, randomised, active- control, prospective, Phase 3 study in adult
cardiac surgery patients. Approximately 500 patients will be randomised at
approximately 12 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681098].
The study will include adult (18 years old) patients who undergo cardiac surgery with
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) and require coagulation factor replacement due to
bleeding post- CPB and after adequate reversal of heparin with protamine (as assessed 
by [CONTACT_681142]) during surgery, and who
have a known (e.g., as indicated by [CONTACT_213395]) or suspected coagulation factor deficiency.
Patients will be randomised to receive either 4-factor PCC ( Octaplex ) or FP when the 
blood bank/pharmacy receives the first order for coagulation factor replacement and 
determines patient eligibility with t he study team based on the study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria . IMP will be administered once treatment indications are met. Patients
will be treated according to their assigned group until the maximum dose of IMP is
administered during the treatment period, which represents 24 hours after IMP initiation
(defined as the start of IMP administration). If additional treatment is required after the
maximum dose of IMP is administered or the treatment period has elapsed , patients in
both groups will receive FP.
Other aspects of coagulation management will be according to a standardised
transfusion algorithm. Measurements of INR and haemoglobin will be performed at

2000 IU for patients weighing >60 kg. The dose for FP will be 3 U for patients weighing
and 4 U for patients weighing >60 kg).
If a second order of coagulation factors is received during the treatment period of 24 
hours after IMP initiation, the blood bank/pharmacy will release a second dose of
Octaplex or FP as above. The maximum allowable dose of IMP will be: Octaplex 3000
If further doses of
coagulation factors are required, non-IMP FP will be administered . That is, once the
maximum dose of IMP (i.e., two doses) has been administered, if additional amounts of
coagulation factors are ordered during the treatment period, and for any requests after 
the treatment period, the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will release FP (in 1– 4 U
increments at the discretion of the ordering physician) for both groups; these additional
FP units will not be counted as part of the IMP.
Duration of Treatment:
Twenty-four hours from IMP initiation or until the maximum dose of the IMP has been

Study Procedures:
At the screening assessment, voluntarily given, written, informed consent will be obtained
from the patient. Once consent has been obtained and the patient enrolled into the study,
eligibility according to inclusion criteria [ADDRESS_922202] provided informed consent) and 
the exclusion criteria will be confirmed.
Only patients who bleed and require coagulation factor replacement therapy during 
surgery will be randomised to receive study drug, and undergo the following visits and
assessments. 
When the first order for PCC or FP is received by [CONTACT_223027]/pharmacy while the 
patient is in the operating room, the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will confirm 
patient eligibility with the clinical team. Following confirmation of eligibility, the 
technologist will randomise the patient to PCC or FP according to the randomisation and

dosing schedule and pre pare and release the IMP in a tamper sealed container (with 
weight device in PCC containing boxes to ensure adequate concealment). Operating 
room personnel will remain blinded until the decision to administer the IMP is made.
IMP can be administered if ble eding is severe enough to necessitate treatment (meaning
at least a grade 2 level [moderate] bleeding according to the validated Bleeding Severity
Scale - see Appendix 1), heparin is adequately reversed (confirmed by [CONTACT_681144]-
protamine activated clotting time [ACT] to within 10% of pre-
IMP can also be administered if bleeding is severe enough to require urgent therapy, in
which case treatment can be initiated irrespective of the INR value. Once the decision is
made to administer the IMP, the administering clinician will break the seal on the
container, carry out routine safety checks, and initiate IMP administration according to 
the weight-based dosing recommendations.
A second dose of IMP can be administered if the patient continues to have at least
moderate bleeding and a suspected coagulation deficiency (e.g. )after 
completion of the first dose. If an order for a second dose of coagulation factors is 
received within 24 hours after IMP initiation (either from the operating room or in the ICU
after surgery), the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will release the IMP as determined 
by [CONTACT_681145], as per usual practice 
(a tamper-sealed containe r will not be used for these orders as clinicians will by [CONTACT_681146]).
If further doses of coagulation factors are required after the second dose of IMP, all 
patients will receive non- IMP FP. That is, for subsequent orders once the maximum dose
of IMP has been administered (i.e., two doses), or after the 24- hour treatment period has 
elapsed, the technologist will release non-IMP FP for both groups.
The type of IMP administered will be recorded in a manner that will not unblind the
outcome assessor. Patients will also be blinded to treatment allocation.
If any of the IMP doses is returned from the operating room without any part of the IMP
being administered for any reason, the reaso n for return of the IMP and status of the seal
on the tamper-sealed container will be recorded by [CONTACT_223027]/pharmacy
technologist. Octaplexwill be accounted for and FP will be handled according to the local 
practice.

administration. Other than the treatment algorithm, and the haemoglobin and INR
measurements at preestablished time points (if not available already) , no other aspects 
of routine clinical care will be modified.
Ethics:
This is a prospective trial that compares two coagulation factor replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681105]. Informed consent will be
obtained from the patient before the patient is exposed to any study-related procedure.
Statistical Analysis Plan:
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will involve comparison of haemostatic
treatment response to IMP, defined as ‘effective’ if no additional haemostatic
intervention, such as administration of any systemic haemostaticagents (including
platelets, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], fibrinogen concentrate, activated recombinant factor VII, other 
coagulation factor products or a second dose of IMP) or any haemostatic interventions
(including surgical re- opening for bleeding) is required from [ADDRESS_922206] dose of IMP.
Patients categorised as having an ‘ineffective’ haemostatic treatment response to IMP,
due to requiring administration of any haemostatic intervention , including a second dose
of IMP, in the time window from [ADDRESS_922207] IMP
dose, will be considered as treatment failures.
Ofthe more than 100 patients studied in the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], approximately 75% of
patients in the PCC group and 65% in the FP group demonstrated haemostatic treatment
response from [ADDRESS_922208] IMP dose. Using a more
conservative estimate of 70% versus 65%, it is estimated that [ADDRESS_922209].
It is anticipated that up to 20% of randomised patients may not meet administration 
criteria (based on objective Bleeding Severity Scale and INR) due to cessation of 
haemorrhage between randomisation and delivery of IMP to the operating room and 
therefore will not receive the therapy.

evaluation of the conditional power makin g use of the observed response rates and
inverse normal combination test statistic with equal weights given by (-1(1 – p 1) +-1(1

in the second stage is limited to 210–800 evaluable patients. Accounting for dropouts as
described above, the total sample size will range between 513–1250 if the study is not
stopped for futility at the interim.
The non-inferiority of theprimary endpoint ‘haemostatic response’ will be tested between 
the treatment groups by [CONTACT_3553] a Farrington-Manning score test with a non- inferiority
margin of 0.10. At the end of the trial, the inverse normal test statistic with equal weights
given by (-1(1 – p 1) +-1(1 – p 2))/[ADDRESS_922211] statistic exceeds the value 1.96, non- inferiority is demonstrated.
Only in case that non-inferiority is demonstr ated, i.e., the null hypothesis is rejected at
the one- sided 2.5% level of significance, superiority of PCC with regard to the primary
endpoint will be investigated.
Descriptive statistics or frequency tables will be presented for all efficacy and safety data 
in addition to the inferences performed. The summary tables and exploratory inferences
will be chosen according to the scaling level of the measurements, e.g., frequency tables
for categorical responses, sampling statistics for continuous data. Safety endpoints will
be analysed analogously to the primary endpoint, presenting point estimates and two-
sided 95% CIs in addition to descriptive statistics. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)
will detail all analyses to be undertaken prior to study initiation.
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all consented and randomised patients who 
receive any amount of the intervention, which will serve as the primary analysis set. A

Bleeding and transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including 
up to an 8-fold increase in the odds of death [2], and patients with major bleeding are at 
particularly high risk of adverse outcomes (e.g., infection, heart failure and mortality) [5-
17]. 
Coagulopathy during cardiac surgery is caused by [CONTACT_71411], including the contact [CONTACT_681147] (CBP) circuit, which activates the intrinsic and 
extrinsic coagulation pathways (despi[INVESTIGATOR_681107]-coated circuits), 
causing excessive clot formation and breakdown. Other contributory factors include 
haemodilution, hypothermia, blood loss, surgical trauma and use of foreign substances 
such as aortic grafts causing the consumption of coagulation factors [18-22]. These in turn 
can lead to excessive fibrinolysis, fibrinogen deficiency, platelet dysfunction and 
thrombocytopenia [20, 21]. Deficiency of enzymatic coagulation factors (e.g., vitamin K-
dependent factors II, VII, IX, X and XI) is also an important cause of coagulopathy, leading 
to impaired generation of thrombin, which is a central component of the coagulation 
cascade [23, 24]. Activated thrombin converts soluble fibrinogen into insoluble strands of 
fibrin, which forms the basis of the clot, and it also catalyses numerous other coagulation-
related reactions [25]. Consequently, replacement of coagulation factors is an important 
aspect of a multimodal approach to coagulopathy to reduce bleeding and transfusion [4,
26].
To replenish depleted coagulation factors and improve thrombin generation, two 
therapeutics, frozen plasma (FP) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), are 
available. FP is currently the mainstay of therapy for patients with acquired coagulopathies 
in North America whereas PCC is the mainstay of therapy in much of Europe [27]. 
Frozen PlasmaFP is obtained from donated whole blood and contains all enzymatic coagulation factors, 
although some coagulation factor activity is lost during storage and processing (including 
freezing for storage and thawing prior to transfusion) [28]. FP utilised in North America is 
not commonly pathogen-reduced. FP is the mainstay of therapy for bleeding cardiac 
surgery patients requiring coagulation factor replacement in many countries and is 
administered in around 15% of all cardiac surgeries in the [LOCATION_002] [29]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] 
a mainstay of therapy, there is limited clinical trial evidence on the use of FP in bleeding 
cardiac surgery patients requiring coagulation factor replacement [30]. Nevertheless, it is 
recommended by [CONTACT_681148], as indicated by [CONTACT_681149] (INR) >1.5, which indicates that one or more coagulation 
factor levels are below the 30% critical threshold [31-37]. 
The widespread use of FP needs to be considered in the context of the risks associated 
with its use [38, 39]. FP can cause serious adverse events (SAEs) including allergic 
reactions (which occur in 1–3% of transfusions, ranging from mild to life-threatening 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 26 of 86anaphylaxis) [30]; transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), which is a leading cause 
of transfusion-related death [30, 40]; and transfusion-associated circulatory overload 
(TACO), which occurs in approximately 5% of transfusions as a result of the large volume 
of transfusion (10–15 mL/kg) that is required to achieve therapeutic effect with FP [41]. FP 
transfusion can also lead to transmission of infectious diseases, as FP is not usually filtered 
or treated with solvent/detergent [42]. These adverse effects are often dose-dependent 
[43-46]. Another important consideration with FP use is that it requires ABO blood group 
compatibility matching and thawing, which can delay therapy. The large volumes of FP 
needed to achieve therapeutic effect can further delay time to haemostatic control and lead 
to substantial haemodilution, resulting in additional RBC transfusions [47]. Therefore, 
although FP is currently a mainstay of therapy in North America, due to the disadvantages 
and risks associated with its use, it could be considered to be an unsatisfactory treatment.
Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC)
PCC offers a potential alternative to FP for treating bleeding cardiac surgery patients 
requiring coagulation factor replacement; however, no PCC product is currently approved 
for this indication in the [LOCATION_002]. PCCs contain prothrombin and other enzymatic 
coagulation factors, the anticoagulant proteins C and S, and small amounts of heparin; 
thus, they are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to heparin or have a prior history 
of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. PCCs are routinely defined as 3-factor (containing 
factors II, IX and X) or 4-factor (containing factors II, VII, IX and X) formulations [48]. PCCs 
are purified from human pooled plasma, which is fractionated into cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_681108]-free plasma fractions through a process of slow thawing, then eluted from 
cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]-free plasma [48]. The production of PCCs includes numerous pathogen 
inactivation steps using solvents, detergents, pasteurisation, nanofiltration and vapor-
heated treatment [1, 48].
PCCs have several potential advantages over FP. Solvent/detergent treatment and 
filtering to remove pathogens substantially reduces the risk of transmission of infectious 
agents with PCCs. Indeed, a Consensus Conference recommended in 2007 that pathogen 
reduction technologies should be implemented to improve the safety of transfusion when 
they became available [49]. Unlike FP, PCCs do not require ABO compatibility matching 
or thawing, and can therefore be prepared and administered more quickly. PCCs are 
associated with a substantially lower risk of TRALI (due to pooling of the source donor 
plasma), and also a lower risk of TACO [38] as substantially lower volumes of PCC are 
required than with FP to achieve dose-equivalence for increasing thrombin generation (for 
example, in a 70-kg patient, a standard dose of 25 IU/kg PCC would be administered in a 
volume of [ADDRESS_922224] dose of 15 mL/kg FP would be administered in a 
volume of 1000 mL) [47]. Finally, PCCs contain standardised levels of coagulation factors 
and thus have a more predictable therapeutic effect than FP, whose coagulation factor 
concentrations vary depending on the characteristics of the donor [50, 51].
On the other hand, PCCs do not contain the full balanced complement of procoagulants 
and anticoagulants present in FP [52] and it is therefore conceivable that they might be 
less effective, although in vitro studies suggest that PCCs may be more effective than FP 
in enhancing thrombin generation after cardiac surgery [47]. Also, because PCCs contain 
more procoagulants than anticoagulants, they may carry a higher risk of thrombotic events, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute kidney injury (AKI) when administered in high doses [48, 53-57]. However, the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_681109]. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 27 of 86of adverse events (AEs; 77.8% in PCC group versus 87.2% in FP group) and 
thromboembolic events (TEEs; 7.4% in PCC group versus 8.2% in FP group) were similar 
between patients receiving PCC or FP [58]. Other prospective studies, as well as 
retrospective studies and meta-analyses, have also reported comparable rates of AEs and 
TEEs between cardiac surgery patients treated with PCC or FP [59-66]. Furthermore, 
some of these studies in cardiac surgery patients, including a recent meta-analysis [64],
the PROPHESY pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (organ failure, including renal) [62] and the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
[58], reported the risk of AKI with PCC to be similar to that with FP [61]. Outside of cardiac 
surgery, meta-analyses and Phase [ADDRESS_922225] shown that PCC also has a favourable
safety profile and is well tolerated in patients requiring anticoagulant reversal, with rates of 
AEs and TEEs comparable with FP [38, 67-69]. 
Review of the Literature
Few guidelines exist on the use of PCC in acquired coagulopathies. The European Society 
of Anaesthesiology recommends goal-directed therapy with coagulation factor 
concentrates, including PCC, suggesting that their use may reduce transfusions during 
cardiac surgery [70], and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists suggests PCCs for 
excessive bleeding in the presence of elevated INR [71]. Joint guidelines from the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and the European Association of 
Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology recommend PCC or FP in patients with bleeding related 
to coagulation factor deficiency and suggest that PCC may be preferred over FP in 
situations where rapid normalisation of coagulation factors is needed [72]. However, there 
is little high-quality clinical evidence to support these recommendations: there are few 
direct comparisons of PCC versus FP for managing coagulopathy resulting from 
coagulation factor deficiency during cardiac surgery (or other types of surgery) and 
randomised controlled trials are limited to small, pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] [58, 62].
An observational study that compared outcomes for patients at Toronto General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681110] ( n=1151), PCC ( n=79) or both ( n=125) for management of coagulopathy 
after cardiac surgery was carried out between 2012 and 2016 [61]. Using propensity score 
matching, 117 patients who received FP were matched with 117 patients with similar risk 
and surgery profiles who received PCC (with or without FP). The odds ratio (OR) for red 
cell transfusion avoidance was 2.4-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–4.8) higher for 
patients receiving PCC. In addition, incidences of massive transfusion (OR 0.58; 95% CI 
0.33–1.0) and refractory bleeding (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24–1.03) tended to be lower in 
patients who received PCC. Results from this exploratory study suggest that PCC is 
potentially more efficacious than FP in avoiding transfusion, and AE profiles were similar 
between groups, suggesting a comparable safety profile. 
These results are similar to those from other observational studies. A recent systematic 
review identified 4 observational studies – including our study noted above [61] – 
comparing perioperative PCCs to FP in cardiac surgery [64]. The meta-analysis showed 
that PCCs were associated with reduced risk of RBC transfusion (OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.45–
3.40) and fewer units of RBCs transfused (OR 1.34; 95% CI 0.78–1.90). PCCs were not 
associated with increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.59–1.49), stroke (OR 
0.80; 95% CI 0.41–1.56) or AKI occurrence (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.58–1.12). In one of the 
studies in the systematic review, Arnekian and colleagues [59] compared three groups of 
cardiac surgical patients: [ADDRESS_922226] frequently in patients who received

Page 28 of 86both products. However, given the small sample size and lack of risk-adjusted analysis, 
few conclusions can be drawn from this study. In another study that included only patients 
who underwent pulmonary endarterectomy with cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB), Ortmann 
and colleagues [63] compared transfusion requirements and outcomes between [ADDRESS_922227]-CPB coagulopathic bleeding. In an unadjusted analysis, they found that the PCC 
group had lower blood loss than the FP group, but transfusion rates were similar. They 
conducted multivariable regression analysis for AEs and found no differences between the 
two groups. However, given its small sample size, limited generalisability and lack of risk-
adjustment for efficacy outcomes, this study should be interpreted with caution. In a larger 
study involving 3,454 consecutive cardiac surgery patients, Cappabianca and colleagues 
[73] used propensity scores to match 225 patients who received PCC (with or without FP)
to [ADDRESS_922228]-CPB coagulopathy. Among
the propensity-score matched pairs, RBC transfusion requirements were lower in the PCC
group (84% versus 93%), as were multiple (more than two units) RBC transfusions (51%
versus 70%) and number of units of RBCs transfused (3.4 versus 5.2 units). While there
were no major between-group differences in adverse outcomes, in a regression analysis
that incorporated the propensity score in a larger patient series, the authors noted an
association between PCC use and AKI that led them to caution about this potential risk,
though the difference was not statistically significant among the 225 matched pairs.
Similarly, in a recent multicentre observational study not included in the above systematic
review, Biancari and colleagues compared 101 patients who received FP following
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) to 101 propensity-score-matched patients who
received PCC with or without FP [74]. PCC was associated with a significant decrease in
the rate of RBC transfusions (67.3% versus 83.2%) but was also associated with an
increased risk of AKI as measured by [CONTACT_67490]: Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) score, though not with KDIGO AKI stage 3. The authors suggested that this could
be related to a relative hypovolemia in patients treated with PCC compared with those
receiving FP. However, there were many limitations to this study, including unknown
differences in PCC dosage, bleeding severity and coagulopathy. Furthermore, in the group
of patients that received both FP and PCC, it was not known what the order of
administration was and so PCC could have been given as salvage therapy [74]. Together,
these studies suggest that PCC may be more efficacious than FP in cardiac surgery;
however, data from adequately powered, prospective, randomised trials are lacking.
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_681111] 4-factor PCC 
with FP [58, 62]. The study by [CONTACT_681150]. included 50 patients who underwent cardiac 
surgery and required coagulation factor replacement, with 25 randomised to 4-factor PCC 
and 25 randomised to FP [62]. IMP dose was limited to 1000 IU (approximately 15 IU/kg) 
for PCC and 4 units (approximately 15 mL/kg) for FP. The study aimed to assess 
recruitment rate for a large trial and hypothesis testing was not carried out, but safety and 
efficacy event rates were similar between the groups.
A randomised pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (the FARES study) [58] was carried out at two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681112]. The study randomised 101 adult patients who required
coagulation factor replacement for management of bleeding during cardiac surgery to 
Octaplex (N=54) or FP (N=47). IMP dosing was weight based: PCC dose was 1500 IU for 
and 4 U, respectively. Dosing could be repeated only once as needed within 24 hours; FP 
was used for any subsequent doses in both groups. Patients and outcome assessors were

patients. 
Overall, the PCC group received a median (IQR) of 24.9 (21.8–27.0) IU/kg of PCC [two 
patients (3.7%; 95% CI 0.4–12.7%) required FP after PCC], and the FP group received a 
median (IQR) of 12.5 (10.0–15.0) mL/kg of FP [four patients (8.5%; 95% CI 2.4–20.4%) 
required >2 doses of FP]. Median (IQR) 12-hour chest tube drainage was 310 (250–455) 
mL and 500 (310–750) mL in the PCC and FP groups, respectively (P<0.001). One of the 
primary measures of haemostatic effects was treatment response, based on receipt of any 
haemostatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23695] 60 minutes to 4 and 24 hours after initiation of study treatment. 
Haemostatic therapy was not required at the 4-hour time point for 43 patients (79.6%) in 
the PCC group and 32 patients (68.1%) in the FP group (P=0.25), nor at the 24-hour time 
point for 41 patients (75.9%) in the PCC group and 31 patients (66.0%) in the FP group 
(P=0.28). Another primary outcome measure was cumulative and individual allogeneic 
blood component units administered within 24 hours after the start of surgery. Median 
(IQR) 24-hour post-by[CONTACT_681151], including red cells, 
platelets and all (IMP + non-IMP) FP were 5.0 (4.0–9.0) units in the PCC group and 12.0 
(7.0–19.0) in the FP group; ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.43–0.73; P<0.001. Excluding IMP FP, the 
median (IQR) cumulative allogeneic transfusions were 5.0 (4.0–9.0) and 8.0 (4.0-15.0) 
units, respectively; ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.58–1.06; P=0.11. For red cells alone, the median 
(IQR) was 1.0 (0.0–2.0) and 2.0 (1.0–3.0) units, respectively; ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.36–0.78; 
P<0.001. Adverse event profiles were similar.
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_681114] 4-factor PCC may be a suitable substitute for FP for mitigation 
of bleeding in cardiac surgery and validated the study methodology and dosing that will be 
used for the proposed trial. It also clearly illustrated that a large, multicentre, confirmatory 
trial is warranted to determine the relative risk-benefit profiles of these two therapeutics. 
Purpose of the StudyThe purpose of the LEX-[ADDRESS_922229] 
undergone treatment with pathogen reduction technologies [75]. The proposed study, by 
[CONTACT_681152][INVESTIGATOR_681115], is well aligned with this change. 
Given the potential advantages of PCC over FP detailed above (viral inactivation, ease of 
administration, standardised dosing/predictable effect and substantially lower risk of 
TRALI and TACO due to smaller volume), as well as the haemostatic superiority signals 
detected in observational studies and the recently completed FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_681116] 
[58], a large multicentre trial adequately powered to establish haemostatic superiority or non-inferiority is warranted. The need for such a trial was highlighted in a recent editorial 
[76], as it will have a profound impact on clinical practice, potentially altering the long-
established practice of administering FP for coagulation factor replacement in bleeding 
patients. If the study is positive, it will lead to the adoption of PCC over FP as first-line 
therapy for the management of bleeding surgical patients requiring coagulation factor 
replacement. If it is negative, on the other hand, it will prevent the inappropriate adoption 
Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 30 of 86of PCC over FP for this indication. Thus, the study will inform clinical practice and promote 
the rational use of healthcare resources.
Study Population
To ensure that the results of the study are clinically relevant and generalisable, the LEX-
211 study aims to include a wide spectrum of cardiac surgery patients (including simple or 
complex procedures and elective or non-elective procedures). In particular, t wo important,
interrelated risk factors for haemorrhage due to coagulation factor deficiency are complex
surgery and prolonged CPB duration. Complex surgeries include combined procedures
(e.g., CABG + valve or multiple valves) and surgery on the aorta, and these are the
procedures that also require prolonged CPB duration. Another equally important risk factor 
is non-elective surgery, as the risk of haemorrhage is substantially higher in patients who
require emergency cardiac surgery. Thus, it is important to include patients undergoing
complex or non-elective cardiac surgery in clinical studies on management of
haemorrhage during cardiac surgery to ensure that the findings are clinically relevant and 
generalisable to this important population.
Therefore, the study will include adult patients undergoing any type of cardiac surgery
(excluding those undergoing highly specialised procedures where there is wide variability 
in clinical practice, such as heart transplantation) who require coagulation factor
replacement due to haemorrhage in the operating room, post-CPB. Given that patients 
undergoing isolated CABG are at low risk for haemorrhage, with approximately 2.5–7.5%
receiving coagulation factor replacement with FP [77], it is anticipated that the study will 
primarily include patients who develop haemorrhage after complex surgeries, non-elective 
surgery or both. Overall, cardiac surgery patients who require coagulation factor
replacement due to haemorrhage represent a small proportion of those undergoing cardiacsurgery. In the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], patients for whom coagulation factor replacement was
ordered during surgery for management of bleeding represented approximately 12% (169 
of 1360) of all adults who underwent cardiac surgery at the two study centres in Canada
during the study period [58].
Importantly, the study will not involve treating patients prophylactically before surgery as a
Cochrane review found no evidence to support the prophylactic administration of FP to
patients without coagulopathy undergoing elective cardiac surgery [30].
In the study, IMP will be administered if bleeding is severe enough to necessitate treatment
or require urgent therapy. The severity of bleeding will be graded according to the Bleeding
Severity Scale [78], which fulfils US Food and Drug Administration requirements for a
validated, clinician-reported scale to standardise bleeding in clinical studies of
intraoperative bleeding. The scale was developed to assess the performance of
haemostatic agents in clinical studies, in order to generate clinically relevant labelling 
claims and identify appropriate haemostatic agents for clinical use.
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and other regulatory requirements. 
1.2 Dose rationale
The doses of PCC and FP selected for the study are the same doses used for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_681117]. There is an absence of a consensus regarding PCC dosing in acquired 
coagulation factor deficiency; however, the study dose of PCC represents current

Page 31 of 86recommended dosing for bleeding indications in various settings and is consistent with 
doses used in other studies in cardiac settings [27, 61, 79, 80]. Moreover, the maximum 
dose is equal to or lower than doses of PCC that have demonstrated a good safety and 
tolerability profile in other clinical settings (e.g., factor Xa inhibitor reversal in major 
bleeding [81-83] and trauma [84]. Of note, neither PCC nor FP will be administered to 
patients unless they are deemed to be clinically indicated by [CONTACT_681153]. 
1.[ADDRESS_922230] ordered 
coagulation factor replacement for treatment of bleeding according to clinical and 
laboratory criteria; thus, patients would have received one or the other therapy as part of 
their routine clinical care. The two coagulation factor replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Octaplex (the 
PCC to be used in this study) and FP, are both commonly used therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681118], with an expected comparable clinical safety profile. Octaplex is currently 
approved for use in Canada (but not in the [LOCATION_002]) for the “treatment of bleeding 
and perioperative prophylaxis of bleeding in acquired deficiency of prothrombin complex 
coagulation factors, such as deficiency caused by [CONTACT_681154] K antagonists, or 
in case of overdose of vitamin K antagonists, when rapid correction of the deficiency is 
required” [85]. This approved indication falls within the proposed use in this study. In 
contrast, in the [LOCATION_002], Octaplex is approved under the tradename [CONTACT_681186] [CONTACT_297766] K antagonist 
(VKA, e.g., warfarin) therapy in adult patients with need for an urgent surgery/invasive 
procedure.
The experience to date with this PCC has shown a favourable safety profile [81, 82, 86-
88]. As discussed, PCC is pathogen-reduced, can be administered quickly and in 
predictable doses, and has a substantially lower risk of TRALI and TACO compared with 
FP, making its administration likely to be both safer than, and at least as efficacious as, 
FP. It is possible that treatment with PCC may not be as effective as FP given that it does 
not contain the full complement of clotting factors that plasma contains, but the study 
protocol will allow patients in the PCC group to receive FP if haemostatic control is not 
achieved after two doses of PCC. By [CONTACT_681155] [81, 82, 86-88], theoretical risks for 
thrombotic complications have been mitigated.

advance and options such as alternative monitoring approaches will be implemented. In 
addition, for the support of the study processes (e.g., provision of the study medication), 
only well-established service providers are selected which have strong regional expertise 
and strict risk and quality guidelines in place, including with regards to potential COVID-
19-related risks. The current regulations regarding transport and logistics will be
continuously monitored for the countries participating in the study, and flexible solutions
and longer lead times will be implemented wherever appropriate.

3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicentre, randomised, active-control, prospective, Phase 3 study in adult 
cardiac surgery patients. Approximately 500 patients will be randomised at approximately 
12 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (10 in Canada and two in the [LOCATION_002]), and the study will require 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 36 of 86approximately two years to complete. The study is planned to start in quarter 4, 2022 and 
to be completed in quarter 4, 2024.
The study will include adult ( 18 years old) patients who undergo cardiac surgery on CPB 
and require coagulation factor replacement due to bleeding post-CPB and after adequate 
reversal of heparin with protamine (as assessed by [CONTACT_681156]) during surgery, and who have a known (e.g., as indicated by [CONTACT_213395]) or 
suspected coagulation factor deficiency. Patients will be randomised to receive either 
4-factor PCC ( Octaplex ) or FP when the blood bank/pharmacy receives the first order for
coagulation factor replacement and determines patient eligibility with the study team based
on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Following confirmation of eligibility, the technologist will randomise the patient to PCC or 
FP according to the randomisation and dosing schedule and prepare and release the IMP 
in a tamper sealed container. Operating room personnel will remain blinded until the 
decision to administer the IMP is made.
IMP can be administered if bleeding is severe enough to necessitate IMP (meaning at least 
a grade 2 level [moderate] bleeding according to the validated Bleeding Severity Scale 
[78]), heparin is adequately reversed (confirmed by [CONTACT_681144]-protamine activated 
clotting time [ACT] to within 10% of pre-pump ACT)administered if bleeding is severe enough to require urgent therapy, in which case 
treatment can be initiated irrespective of the INR value. Once the decision is made to 
administer the IMP, the administering clinician will break the seal on the container, carry 
out routine safety checks and initiate IMP administration according to the weight-based 
dosing recommendations.
The recommended initial dose for Octaplex will be 1500 IU for patients weighing and 2000 IU for patients weighing >60 kg. The recommended initial dose for FP will be 3
U for patients weighing  kg and 4 U for patients weighing >[ADDRESS_922237]
moderate bleeding and suspected coagulation deficiency (e.g., INR ) after completion 
of the first dose. If an order for a second dose of coagulation factors is received within 24 
hours after IMP initiation (either from the operating room or in the ICU after surgery), the 
blood bank/pharmacy technologist will release the IMP as determined by [CONTACT_681157] ( Octaplex-sealed container will not be 
used for these orders as clinicians will by [CONTACT_681158]).
If further doses of coagulation factors are required after the second dose of IMP, all 
patients will receive non-IMP FP. That is, for subsequent orders once the maximum dose 
of IMP has been administered (i.e., 2 doses), or after the 24-hour treatment period has 
elapsed, the technologist will release FP for both groups (in 1–4 U increments as per the 
ordering physician); these additional FP units will not be counted as part of the IMP ( Figure 
1). 
Transfusion of non-IMP blood components and all haemostatic agents will be according to 
a standardised transfusion management algorithm ( Figure 2 ). Measurements of INR and 
haemoglobin will be performed at preestablished time points, if not available already. No 
other aspects of routine clinical care will be modified.

3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group
3.3.1 Study Design
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Administration of IMP
The decision to administer the IMP will be based on objective clinical and laboratory criteria 
(Section 6 ). Incorporating these criteria in the study will standardise administration of IMP 
such that it is administered when clinically indicated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Transfusion Protocol Standardisation
All participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681120]-IMP blood components and all haemostatic agents. 
Recognising that the intervention will occur during a very dynamic period (i.e., bleeding 
during surgery); however, the study employs a pragmatic design that will allow clinicians 

Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.[ADDRESS_922238] failed when studied in later phase trials because of the 
inability of the sites to accurately follow the specified design, which itself has been criticised 
for not being consistent with usual clinical practice. 
[IP_ADDRESS] External Validity
This Phase [ADDRESS_922239] the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681121]. For these reasons, external validity should not be an issue. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomisation and Baseline Differences
Given the size of the study and random patient assignment stratified by [CONTACT_82064], study 
groups should be reasonably balanced with respect to important clinical variables. The 
random allocation schedule will be prepared by a biostatistician not involved in the conduct 
of the trial, and neither the individual randomising nor any of the health care providers will 
know which treatment will be assigned to the patient when coagulation factor replacement 
is ordered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Recruitment and Informed Consent
This is a pragmatic trial that compares two coagulation factor replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681122]. It is not expected that participating in the trial will pose any risks to 
patients. 
All patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB at the study centres will
be offered the chance to participate in the study prior to their surgery. Voluntarily given, 
written, informed consent will be obtained from the patient before the study procedures 
start. Once consent has been obtained and the patient enrolled into the study, eligibility 
according to inclusion criteria [ADDRESS_922240] provided informed consent) and the exclusion 
criteria will be confirmed. If screening is performed before the day of surgery, exclusion 
criterion 3 (i.e., severe right heart failure [clinical diagnosis ± echocardiography]) will be 
rechecked on the day of surgery2. 
Only patients who require coagulation factor replacement therapy during surgery will be 
randomised, receive study drug, and undergo the proceeding visits and assessments.
When the first order for PCC or FP is received by [CONTACT_223027]/pharmacy while the 
patient is in the operating room, the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will confirm patient 
eligibility with the clinical team. Following confirmation of eligibility, the technologist will 
randomise the patient to PCC or FP according to the randomisation and dosing schedule.
2In Canada, informed consent will be obtained after randomisation, in accordance with Article 3.7A of 
the [ADDRESS_922241] for Research Involving Humans.
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 39 of 86Randomisation (1:1) will continue until at least 410 evaluable patients are obtained (205 
patients per group).
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Given that the products have quite different physical properties, it is not possible to blind 
treating clinicians to group assignment. To minimise bias, treating clinicians will be blinded 
to group assignment until immediately prior to IMP infusion. The blood bank/pharmacy
technologist will randomise the patient to PCC or FP, according to the randomisation
schedule, and prepare and release the product in a tamper sealed container (with weight 
device in PCC boxes to ensure adequate concealment). The operating room personnel 
will be blinded to group allocation until the tamper lock seal is broken in the operating room 
immediately prior to infusion. For subsequent orders, a tamper-sealed container will not 
be necessary, and the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will release IMP as determined 
by [CONTACT_681159], as per usual practice. The type of IMP administered will 
be recorded in manner that will not unblind the outcome assessor. Patients will also be 
unaware of treatment allocation. These same processes were successful in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_681123].
[IP_ADDRESS] Drop-outs and CrossoversDrop-outs: Based on the results of the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it is anticipated that 
approximately 20% of randomised patients will not receive the IMP due to cessation of 
bleeding or identification of other causes of bleeding by [CONTACT_681160]. (Significant dropouts are not anticipated for any other reasons, including 
not having undergone an index cardiac procedure.) Since clinicians will be blinded to group 
assignment until the decision is made to administer the IMP, and the decision to administer 
the IMP will be based on objective criteria, exclusion of these randomised but untreated 
patients from the primary analysis set will not bias the results. Study sample size has been 
calculated to compensate for dropouts. To ensure between-group comparability in 
baseline characteristics and outcomes, data will be collected for these patients for [ADDRESS_922242] switching: Other than the coagulation factor replacement order being cancelled, 
all patients will be treated according to the randomisation schedule up to the maximum 
allowable dose during the treatment period (24 hours after IMP initiation). Thereafter, all 
patients will receive non-IMP FP when coagulation factor replacement is required. To 
ensure minimal product switching, instructions will be entered into the blood 
bank/pharmacy information system to dictate the randomisation product for the 24 hours 
after IMP initiation and will flag the laboratory technologists if attempts are made to override 
the instruction. In the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], all treated patients received the appropriate IMP; 
thus, product switching is not anticipated to be a significant problem.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC)
An IDSMC will review accumulating safety, endpoint and other study data (recruitment, 
retention and compliance, data quality and timeliness, risk versus benefit).
The function of the IDSMC will be to protect and serve the recruited patients particularly 
pertaining to patient safety as well as to assist and advise the Sponsor on medical 
questions and issues of study conduct and continuation. The IDSMC will be independent 
of the investigating team and the Sponsor in operating and formulating recommendations. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.[ADDRESS_922243] practice [90] and would withhold an effective treatment 
from patients and thus be unethical. Moreover, the question being addressed does not 
meet any of Freedman’s five conditions that would justify the use of a placebo control, 
which are: 1) no standard treatment exists; 2) standard treatment is not better than 
placebo; 3) standard treatment is a placebo or no treatment; 4) new evidence has shown 
uncertainty of the risk-benefit profile of the standard treatment; and 5) effective treatment 
is not readily available due to cost or supply issues [91]. 
3.3.3 Study Parameters
A dichotomous classification of haemostatic effectiveness will be used to assess treatment 
response to PCC or FP in bleeding adult cardiac surgical patients. T reatment will be 
considered ‘effective’ if no additional haemostatic intervention is required in the time 
window from [ADDRESS_922244]. Patients will be assigned a haemostatic treatment response classification of 
‘ineffective’ if their management required haemostatic interventions during the time window 
from [ADDRESS_922245] IMP dose . 
Haemostatic intervention includes the administration of any systemic haemostatic agents 
(including platelets, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], fibrinogen concentrate, activated factor VII, other 
coagulation factor products, or a second dose of IMP) or any haemostatic interventions 
(including surgical re-opening for bleeding). Because of the complexity and dynamic nature 
of cardiac surgery, as well as the multifactorial nature of haemorrhage during cardiac 
surgery, it is inherently not feasible to assess the specific haemostatic response to 
individual therapeutic agents.
The following secondary endpoints will be included to provide supportive evidence of 
haemostatic efficacy: global haemostatic response, INR reduction, the incidence and 
amount of individual allogeneic blood components transfused and the incidence of other 
bleeding-related clinical endpoints.
Global haemostatic response will be based on the haemostatic efficacy scale used 
successfully in a Phase 3b RCT by [CONTACT_681161] [69] (in discussion with the 
Food and Drug Administration), modified to reflect the special considerations of 
haemorrhage during cardiac surgery.

Page 41 of 864 STUDY POPULATION 
4.1 Population Base
The study will include approximately 500 randomised bleeding adult ( 18 years old) 
cardiac surgical patients who require coagulation factor replacement after CPB. The study 
will continue until there are at least 410 evaluable patients, accounting for dropouts in both 
arms, with a minimum of 205 patients assigned to each of the two treatment groups.

administered (e.g., heparin and protamine dose, antifibrinolytic drugs, desmopressin, 
rFVIIa, idarucizumab, andexanet alpha or topi[INVESTIGATOR_681125]) will be recorded, as 
well as all procedures that may influence amount of bleeding (e.g., retrograde autologous 
priming of CPB circuit, cell salvage). In addition, concomitant medications used to treat 
SAEs will be reported throughout the duration of follow-up (up to POD-30).
4.2.[ADDRESS_922249]/Patient Withdrawal
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without the 
need to justify their decision. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients for 
reasons such as intervention no longer indicated due to cessation of bleeding, 
randomisation of ineligible patients and adverse events attributed to previous doses of 
IMP. For any withdrawals after study entry, the Investigator will obtain all the required 
details and document the reason(s) for discontinuation, and report to the IDSMC and 
institutional review board (IRB) where indicated. If the reason for withdrawal of a patient is 
an AE, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorded, and the Investigator will 
make thorough efforts to clearly document outcomes up to the time of withdrawal of 
participation.
4.3.[ADDRESS_922250]/Patient Replacement Policy
Patients withdrawn from the study for safety reasons will not be replaced.
4.4 Assignment of Patients to Treatment Groups
Patients will be assigned to treatment with either PCC or FP using a permuted-block, 
stratified (by [CONTACT_82064]) random allocation scheme prepared by a biostatistician not involved 
in the conduct of the trial. Group allocation will apply to the first two doses of IMP during 
the treatment period (up to 24 hours from IMP initiation). For any additional doses (i.e., the 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.[ADDRESS_922251] dose and thereafter), patients in both groups will receive FP. Patients are not

The Octaplex manufacturing process includes two dedicated virus inactivation/removal 
steps, by [CONTACT_34058] a solvent/detergent viral inactivation process and a virus removal 
nanofiltration step. The solvent/detergent treatment causes enveloped viruses such as 
pseudorabies virus (PRV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) type 1 to be irreversibly destroyed. Nanofiltration removal of infectious agents from 
protein solutions on the basis of their size may be the only method to date permitting 
efficient removal of enveloped (e.g., HIV-1, SBV, PRV, bovine viral diarrhoea virus) and 
non-enveloped viruses (e.g., hepatitis A virus) under conditions where 90–95% of protein 
activity is recovered [92]. Other precautions against viral transmission include: selection of 
plasma donors, screening of donations and plasma pool, as well as quality control 
measurements of the final product.
[IP_ADDRESS] Composition of Octaplex
Octaplex is a human PCC for intravenous (IV) use. The composition of Octaplex is 
described in the current edition of the IB. Differences in composition may exist between 
countries; please refer to the country-specific Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
and Package Insert (PI). 
5.1.2 Frozen plasma
For patients randomised to FP, the blood bank/pharmacy will assign to the study, prepare
and release FP for the first and second orders received during the treatment period (24 
hours after IMP initiation). The recommended dose for FP will be 3 U for patients weighing 
and 4 U for patients weighing >60 kg.  While there is no maximum dose for FP, 
up to 8 U for patients weighing >60 kg will be counted as part of the IMP.
FP will be provided by [CONTACT_681163], thawed and 
pooled by [CONTACT_223027]/pharmacy according to current standards. FP will be infused as 
per standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681126] (i.e., infused using timing 
recommended in the current monograph through standard 140 µm blood infusing set).
5.2 Packaging and Labelling
Octaplex 500 IU and 1000 IU will be used in this study. Octaplex is supplied as a powder 
for solution for injection together with a solvent (20 mL or 40 mL Water for Injection, 
respectively), which should be used for the reconstitution. The batch number(s) used will 
be recorded in the Clinical Study Report. Octaplex will be labelled and packed as IMP 
according to the local regulations.
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.[ADDRESS_922255] be stored at room temperature (not more than 25°C) and protected from 
light. The product must not be frozen. The Investigator/authorised personnel at the site will 
ensure that Octaplex is stored in appropriate conditions with restricted access and in 
compliance with national regulations.
FP is to be stored at the blood bank/pharmacy in line with the local standard practice.
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule
For patients randomised to Octaplex, the blood bank/pharmacy will prepare and release
either [ADDRESS_922256] and second orders received during the 
treatment period (24 hours after IMP initiation). The recommended dose for Octaplex will 
be 1500 IU for patients weighing and 2000 IU for patients weighing >60 kg. The 
maximum dose of Octaplex will be 4000 IU. If requests for additional doses are received 
during the treatment period or at any time thereafter, FP will be used, which will not be 
counted as part of the IMP.
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration
Each vial of Octaplex will be reconstituted with 20 mL or 40 mL WFI (as per the 
manufacturer’s instructions) at room temperature (not more than 25°C). Octaplex
dissolves at room temperature to an almost colourless and slightly opalescent solution 
within [ADDRESS_922257] of the trial (see Section 9.3 ). To minimise bias, neither the individual randomising nor any of the health care providers will know which treatment will be assigned to a given 
patient when coagulation factor replacement is ordered. Blood products will be transported 
to the OR in weighted temper-proof boxes to maintain the blind until IMP infusion.
The type of IMP administered will be recorded in a manner that will not unblind the outcome 
assessor. Patients will also be blinded to treatment allocation.

consent) and the exclusion criteria will be determined. If screening is performed before the 
day of surgery, exclusion criterion 3 (i.e., severe right heart failure [clinical diagnosis ± 
echocardiography]) will be rechecked on the day of surgery.
Only patients who require coagulation factor replacement therapy during surgery will be 
randomised, receive study drug, and undergo the proceeding visits and assessments.
When the first order for PCC or FP is received by [CONTACT_223027]/pharmacy while the 
patient is in the operating room, the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will confirm patient 
eligibility with the clinical team. Following confirmation of eligibility, the technologist will 
randomise the patient to PCC or FP according to the randomisation and dosing schedule 
and prepare and release the IMP in a tamper sealed container (with weight device in PCC 
containing boxes to ensure adequate concealment). Operating room personnel will remain 
blinded until the decision to administer the IMP is made.
IMP can be administered if bleeding is severe enough to necessitate IMP (meaning at least 
a grade 2 level [moderate] bleeding according to the validated Bleeding Severity Scale 
[78] – see Appendix 1), heparin is adequately reversed (confirmed by [CONTACT_681144]-
protamine ACT to within 10% of pre-pump ACT)Signature [CONTACT_681187]; Instrumentation Laboratory). IMP can also be administered if bleeding is
severe enough to require urgent therapy, in which case treatment can be initiated
irrespective of the INR value. Once the decision is made to administer the IMP, the
administering clinician will break the seal on the container, carry out routine safety checks,
and initiate IMP administration according to the weight-based dosing recommendations:
For Octaplex
Octaplex and FP will be administered intravenously. For the first ordered dose, the blood 
bank/pharmacy will prepare and release either Octaplex or FP, as per the randomised
group allocation. The recommended dose for Octaplex will be 1500 IU for patients 
weighing and 2000 IU for patients weighing >60 kg. The recommended dose for 
FP will be 3 U for patients weighing and 4 U for patients weighing >[ADDRESS_922259] 
moderate bleeding and a suspected coagulation deficiency (e.g. ) after 
completion of the first dose. If this second order of coagulation factors is received within 
24 hours after IMP initiation (either from the operating room or in the ICU after surgery), 
the blood bank/pharmacy technologist will release the IMP as determined by [CONTACT_681157], as per usual practice (a 
tamper-sealed container will not be used for these orders as clinicians will by [CONTACT_681164]). The maximum allowable dose of IMP will be: Octaplex 3000 IU 
If further doses of coagulation factors are required after two doses of IMP, all patients will 
receive non-IMP FP. That is, for subsequent orders once the maximum dose of IMP has 
been administered (i.e., two doses), or after the 24-hour treatment period has elapsed, the 
technologist will release FP (in 1–4 U increments as per the ordering physician) for both 
groups, but these will not be counted as part of the IMP ( Figure 1 ). To maintain blinding

7.2 Efficacy Assessments
7.2.1 Assessments for Primary Efficacy Endpoint
[IP_ADDRESS] Haemostatic Treatment Response to IMP
A dichotomous classification of haemostatic effectiveness will be used to assess the 
primary endpoint of haemostatic treatment response to PCC or FP in bleeding cardiac 
surgical patients. Treatment will be considered ‘effective’ if no additional haemostatic
intervention is required in the time window from [ADDRESS_922268] IMP dose ( Table 3 ). The 60-minute time period will allow for the administration of 
the IMP and establishment of treatment effect. Patients will be assigned a haemostatic
treatment response classification of ‘ineffective’ if their management required haemostatic
interventions during the time window from [ADDRESS_922269] 
IMP dose .

due to requiring administration of any haemostatic intervention, including a second dose 
of IMP, in the time window from [ADDRESS_922270] IMP dose, 
will be considered as treatment failures.
7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Global Haemostatic Response
A secondary endpoint of global haemostatic response is included to provide supportive 
evidence of haemostatic effectiveness. This will be based on the haemostatic efficacy 
scale developed by [CONTACT_681161] [69] (in discussion with the Food and Drug 
Administration), modified to reflect the special considerations of haemorrhage during 
cardiac surgery. Global haemostatic response will be considered as ‘positive’ if no 
additional haemostatic intervention (as per Table 4 ) is required andhaemoglobin levels 
decrease by <30% (after accounting for red cell transfusions) in the time window from [ADDRESS_922271] IMP dose. Global haemostatic response will 
be considered as ‘negative’ if additional haemostatic intervention is required or

Page 55 of [IP_ADDRESS] Surgical and Surgery-Related Data
The following surgical data will be collected: details of procedure, CPB duration, CPB start 
and end times, cross-clamp duration, circulatory arrest duration, fluid intake and output, 
any medications administered, haemodynamic support (e.g., IABP), as well as any blood 
conservation methods used (e.g., haemoconcentration, retrograde prime, cell salvage), 
length of stay in the OR and need for surgical re-exploration.
In addition, extubation time, ICU length of stay and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681129]. Data collected will be used for a pharmacoeconomic analysis to be 
conducted at a later date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Transfusion Data
Details of all blood products and haemostatic agents released from the blood 
bank/pharmacy and transfused will be collected from the blood bank/pharmacy databases. 
These include allogeneic blood components (RBCs, pooled or apheresis platelets and 
plasma) and albumin. Other haemostatic agents include: desmopressin, fibrinogen 
concentrates, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], rFVIIa, antithrombin, idarucizumab and andexanet alpha.
Data collected will be used for a pharmacoeconomic analysis to be conducted at a later 
date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding Data
Severity of bleeding before IMP administration according to the Bleeding Severity Scale 
by [CONTACT_92077] [78] will be collected during surgery. 
The comparison of ‘major’ bleeding based on the universal definition of perioperative 
bleeding (UDPB) in cardiac surgery [89, 93] ( Table 5 Error! Reference source not found.)
will be assessed. The UDPB is a multistage definition for perioperative bleeding based on 
easily measured clinical endpoints, including total blood loss from chest tubes at [ADDRESS_922273] closure, allogeneic blood components transfused, surgical re-
exploration including cardiac tamponade, delayed sternal closure and the need for salvage 
treatment. Modifications to the UDPB will include addition of fibrinogen concentrate to 
cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_681130].
Depending on these components, bleeding is graded as insignificant, mild, moderate, 
severe or massive ( Table 5Error! Reference source not found. ) [89]. 
Intracerebral and gastrointestinal haemorrhages will be documented.

7.3 Safety Assessments
7.3.1 Assessments for Safety Endpoints
Any of the following drug safety information shall be collected:
AEs and SAEs temporally associated with the administration of IMP (for definitions
and reporting requirements, see Sections 7.3.2, 7.3.[ADDRESS_922274]-
study SAEs (see Section 7.3.6 ).
7.3.2 Adverse Events (AEs)
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Adverse event (AE): An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient
receiving an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally
associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP. An AE is
defined as a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) if first onset or worsening is after the
first treatment with study drug.
Adverse drug reaction (ADR): An ADR is any noxious and unintended response
to an IMP related to any dose. The phrase ‘response to an IMP’ means that a causal
relationship between the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility,
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 57 of 86Other significant AEs: Any marked laboratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead
to an intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or
significant additional concomitant therapy.
Withdrawal due to AE/ADR: AE/ADR leading to discontinuation of treatment with
IMP. Any such events will be followed up by [CONTACT_681168]. All follow-up
information collected will be made available to the Sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of AEs
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether 
scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non-leading question such 
as “How have you been since the last visit/during the previous study period?” In addition, 
the Investigator/blinded outcome assessor will check the patient records for any 
documented event.
Any AE or ADR which occurs during the study will be noted in detail on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms representing a single 
syndrome or diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded in the CRF. The Investigator will 
grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non-
serious or serious) and the causality as defined below. The Sponsor is responsible for 
assessing the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected) as defined below. 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be confirmed 
and the patient followed up until the laboratory values have returned to normal and/or an 
adequate explanation for the abnormality has become available. 
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already present before the 
first administration of IMP will not be considered AEs unless an exacerbation in intensity 
or frequency (worsening) occurs.  
The Investigator will provide detailed information about any abnormalities and about the 
nature of and reasons for any action taken, as well as any other observations or comments 
that may be useful for the interpretation and understanding of an AE or ADR.
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of AEsThe intensity/severity of AEs will be graded as follows:
Mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with
the patient’s routine activities
Moderate: an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s
routine activities
Severe: an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s
routine activities
The grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement of the Investigator and will be decided 
on a case-by-case basis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality of AEs
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]: 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 58 of 86Probable: reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume
a causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not
necessarily highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal
sequence from administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected
response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_681132]’s clinical state.
Possible: reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a
causal relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the
connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or
insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from
administration of the IMP; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the
suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of
other factors.
Unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP
administration. An event which may have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical
state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293].
Not related (unrelated): events for which sufficient information exists to conclude
that the aetiology is unrelated to the IMP.
Unclassified: reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g.,
because of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).
[IP_ADDRESS] Classification of ADRs by [CONTACT_681169]: 
Expected: an ADR that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure
(IB) or other reference safety information.
Unexpected: an ADR that is not listed in the current edition of the IB or other
reference safety information, or that differs because of greater severity or greater
specificity.
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome of AEs
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows: 
1. Recovered, resolved
2. Recovering, resolving
3. Not recovered, not resolved
4. Recovered, resolved with sequelae
5. Fatal
6. Unknown
NOTE: A patient’s death per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted 
in the patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in cases where the 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No. LEX-211, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL 25 Aug 2023 
Page 59 of 86death occurs within 4 weeks after IMP treatment end and regardless of whether or not it is 
considered treatment related.
[IP_ADDRESS] Action(s) taken
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognised standards of medical care 
to protect the health and well-being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment 
and medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment in an emergency 
situation.
The action taken by [CONTACT_222554]:
a) General actions taken in the event of an AE
–None
–Medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started
–Test performed
–Other (to be specified)
b) IMP-related actions taken in the event of an AE
–None
–Product withdrawn
–Dose reduced
–Dose increased
The Investigator will follow up on each AE until it has resolved or until the medical condition 
of the patient has stabilised. Any relevant follow-up information will be reported to the 
Sponsor.
7.3.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
Standard statement:
Aserious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death,
is life-threatening (see below),
requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
is another important medical event.
NOTE: The term ‘life-threatening’ refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view 
of the reporting Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which may hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe.
In deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious, medical judgment should be exercised. Thus, 
important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681133].

Page 60 of 86In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected 
transmissions of an infectious agent should be reported as SAEs. A suspected virus 
transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive 
transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission. 
7.3.4 SAE Reporting Timelines
All SAEs, whether or not they are suspected to be related to study treatment, are to be 
reported within 24 hours of recognition of the event by [CONTACT_681170]:

Waivers from SAE Reporting Requirement
Waivers from the SAE reporting requirement are surgical procedures that are elective or
were planned before study entry, and prolongation of the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681134]. Such events should 
not be considered as SAEs.
7.3.5 Occurrence of TEEs
All TEEs (thrombotic, embolic, or thromboembolic events) must be recorded in the source 
data and reported as SAEs within 24 hours. If TEEs are suspected, appropriate 
examinations according to local standards (e.g. Doppler scan using color duplex, X-ray, 
CT scan) should be obtained and documented. Therapeutic measures for managing TEEs 
shall be initiated according to local clinical practice (e.g., anticoagulation).

Recording of Clinically Significant Abnormal Laboratory Values as AEs/ADRs
Other than abnormal laboratory values due to the underlying condition, the Investigator 
must assess the clinical significance of abnormal laboratory values outside the specified 
normal range. Any clinically significant abnormalities will be documented. All specified 
clinically significant abnormalities will be documented as AEs/SAEs and investigated.
Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or aetiology of 
specified abnormalities or to monitor the course of an AE will be obtained if clinically 
indicated. Follow-up will persist until resolution or up to the Study Completion Visit, 
whichever occurs first. 
7.3.7 Other Relevant Safety Information
a) Post-study related safety reports
Proactive monitoring for post-study SAEs is not required.

Patients who are known to be pregnant will not be included in the study. In patients of 
reproductive age, pregnancy is ruled out prior to the cardiac surgery as part of standard of 
care.
Overdose, interaction, medication error and lack of efficacy
The following safety relevant information should be reported as AE or, if the reaction fulfils 
one of the criteria for seriousness, as SAE.
c) Drug overdose
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher 
than specified in the protocol and higher than the known therapeutic dose that is of clinical 
relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.
d) Drug interaction
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance or medicinal product affects the 
activity of an IMP, i.e., increases or decreases its effects, or produces an effect that none 
of the products would exhibit on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as a drug 
interaction.
e) Medication error
A medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by [CONTACT_151814], presentation of pharmaceutical 
form/packaging or instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as 
a medication error.

allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical study.
The Investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or patient files 
for each patient enrolled). Source records should be preserved as required by [CONTACT_13125].
For each patient enrolled, the Investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the 
patient participates in this study.
For data capture, a validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system providing an 
electronic CRF (eCRF) application will be used.
All data entered in the eCRF must be supported by [CONTACT_222564].
The Investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), by [CONTACT_206717]/records.
The Investigator may authorise site staff (e.g., sub-investigators, clinical research 
coordinators/assistants, nurses) to enter study data into the eCRF. This must be 
documented in the Delegation of Authority Log signed by [CONTACT_737].
8.1.2 Case Report Forms
Authorised study site staff (e.g., blood bank/pharmacy technologist, research 
coordinator/assistant) will be responsible for completing an eCRF record for each patient 
enrolled. All site personnel will be trained on completion of a patient’s eCRF. The site is 
also provided with the approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data 
entry and data issues/questions. Additional site training may be provided as refreshers 
throughout the study, if needed. All persons allowed to enter or to change eCRF data must 
be listed in the Delegation of Authority Log.
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF record will be completed within the EDC system and 
finally approved by [CONTACT_595327]-investigator. 
Prior to operational use, the eCRF application will be validated. All site personnel will be 
trained on the EDC system and study specific eCRFs prior to receiving access to the live 
system for data entry.
8.1.3 Changes to Case Report Form (CRF) Data
Monitors will perform source data verification (SDV) as defined for the study and described 
in the study Monitoring Plan.
If any errors or discrepancies in the eCRFs are found during data entry or review, 
discrepancies will be generated programmatically within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ 
queries will be generated by [CONTACT_5640] a monitor or Data Management.

8.5 Provision of Additional Information
If errors in data transcription are encountered, a query should be raised which needs to be 
answered by [CONTACT_681173]. Provision of additional patient data should 
be avoided (except if needed for SAE reporting). In case of particular issues or 
governmental queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in accordance with applicable 
regulations.
8.6 Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
An IDSMC will be established by [CONTACT_1034]. The IDSMC will be composed of recognised
experts in the field of statistics, perioperative medicine and haematology who are not 
actively recruiting patients.
The IDSMC will review accumulating safety, endpoint and other study data (recruitment, 
retention and compliance, data quality and timeliness, risk versus benefit, summary 
statistics of outcomes) every time [ADDRESS_922280] completed the study.  
The IDSMC will provide recommendations about continuing, modifying and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_681135], patient safety and trial futility as 
appropriate. In addition, the IDSMC may make observations or recommendations to the 
sponsor about, but not limited to, the following:Efficacy of the study intervention;
Definitions of and responses to AEs and patterns in AEs;
Benefit/risk ratio of procedures and participant burden;
Selection, recruitment and retention of participants;
Adherence to protocol requirements;
Completeness, quality and analysis of measurements;
Amendments to the study protocol and consent forms;
Performance of individual centres and core labs; and
Patient safety.
A written study-specific charter will define in detail the composition, responsibilities and 
procedures of the IDSMC.

Page 68 of 869 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
The statistical analysis will be delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities 
to an external statistician. Details on planned descriptive and exploratory analyses will be 
provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will involve comparison of haemostatic
treatment response to IMP, defined as ‘effective’ if no additional haemostatic intervention, 
such as administration of any systemic haemostatic agents (including platelets, 
cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], fibrinogen concentrate, activated recombinant factor VII, other coagulation 
factor products or a second dose of IMP) or any haemostatic interventions (including 
surgical re-opening for bleeding) is required from [ADDRESS_922281] dose of IMP. 
Patients categorised as having an ‘ineffective’ haemostatic treatment response to IMP, 
due to requiring administration of any haemostatic intervention, including a second dose 
of IMP, in the time window from [ADDRESS_922282] IMP dose, 
will be considered as treatment failures.
Of the more than 100 patients studied in the FARES pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], approximately 75% of 
patients in the PCC group and 65% in the FP group demonstrated haemostatic treatment 
response from [ADDRESS_922283] IMP dose [58]. Using a 
more conservative estimate of 70% versus 65%, it is estimated that [ADDRESS_922284].
It is anticipated that up to 20% of randomised patients may not meet administration criteria 
(based on objective Bleeding Severity Scale and INR) due to cessation of haemorrhage
between randomisation and delivery of IMP to the operating room and therefore will not 
receive the therapy.
An administrative unblinded interim analysis will be carried out after [ADDRESS_922285] been randomised and treated and will be used to re-estimate the sample size or stop 
for futility (non-binding) ( Section 9.4 ). Patient recruitment will continue during the conduct of the interim analysis. The sample size in the second stage is limited to 210–800 evaluable 
patients. Accounting for drop-outs as described above, the total sample size will range 
between 513–1250 if the study is not stopped for futility at the interim (see table below).

Page 69 of 869.2 Statistical Analysis
A formal SAP describing all details of the analyses to be performed will be prepared by [CONTACT_681174]. 
The non-inferiority of the primary endpoint ‘haemostatic response’ will be tested between 
the treatment groups by [CONTACT_3553] a Farrington-Manning score test with a non-inferiority 
margin of 0.10 at a one-sided significance level alpha of 2.5%, testing the null hypothesis 
as follows:
H0p(FP) – 0.[ADDRESS_922286] the alternative 
H1: p(PCC) > p(FP) – 0.10
where p(PCC) and p(FP) denote the haemostatic response proportions in the PCC and 
FP treatment groups, respectively.
At the end of the trial, the inverse normal test statistic with equal weights given by 
(-1(1 – p 1) + -1(1 – p 2))/[ADDRESS_922287] statistic 
exceeds the value 1.96, non-inferiority is demonstrated (see [94]). 
Only in case that non-inferiority is demonstrated at the second stage of the study, i.e., the 
null hypothesis is rejected at the one-sided 2.5% level of significance, superiority of PCC 
with regard to the primary endpoint will be investigated:
H0p(FP)  
will be tested against the alternative 
H1: p(PCC) > p(FP) 
The Farrington-Manning score test will be used to calculate a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval based on the inverse normal test statistic as given above. This confidence interval 
corresponds with the test decision for showing non-inferiority and/or superiority [95]. This
hierarchical test procedure allows to perform the superiority test at the full alpha of 2.5%. 
9.2.1 Populations for Analysis
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all consented and randomised patients who 
receive any amount of the intervention, which will serve as the primary analysis set. A 
supporting efficacy analysis will be performed for the per-protocol set (PPS), which will 
exclude all patients with major deviations (e.g., patients who receive an IMP different to 
the IMP assigned by [CONTACT_17975]; patients who receive <50% of the planned dose; and 
patients who significantly violate inclusion/exclusion criteria). Randomised but untreated 
patients will not be included in the efficacy or safety analyses, but will be followed for [ADDRESS_922288] manager, the study statistician, and Octapharma’s responsible medical 
expert, and will be agreed and documented before the database is locked and the 
statistical analyses are performed.
The safety analysis population (SAF) will be identical to the FAS. In addition, to ensure 
that the safety reporting is complete, all haemostatic therapy and SAE data will be collected
in cases where consent for remaining in the study cannot be obtained from Canadian sites
due to logistical issues (e.g., patient died and a legally authorised representative could not 
be reached) and REB approval is obtained to collect the information. For Canadian 
patients who refuse consent, only treatment allocation data will be collected, and patients 
will not be included in any analyses.
The following subgroups will be analysed: sex (male/female); urgency (elective/non-
elective surgery); and complexity (simple/complex surgery [procedures other than isolated 
ACB, single valve or repair of atrial septal defect]). Moreover, the impact of CPB duration 
on effectiveness will be evaluated by [CONTACT_681175].
Details on the subgroup analyses will be given in a Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9.2.2 Efficacy Analysis Plan
Descriptive statistics or frequency tables will be presented for all efficacy data in addition 
to the inferences performed. Simple tests of comparison will be used to compare endpoints
between the two groups. The summary tables and exploratory inferences will be chosen 
according to the scaling level of the measurements. Frequency tables will be provided for 
categorical responses and summary statistics for continuous data. The SAP will detail all 
analyses, including exploratory analyses (e.g., p-values and confidence intervals) to be 
undertaken.
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Plan
Secondary safety endpoints will be analysed analogously to the primary endpoint, 
presenting point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs in addition to descriptive statistics. Prior 
to study initiation, the SAP will detail all analyses to be undertaken.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events, including thromboembolic and other events of special 
interest
AEs will be coded according to the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version as specified in the Data Management Plan. The analysis will focus on 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), i.e., AEs that started or worsened after start 
of infusion with IMP.
All TEAEs, related TEAEs (i.e., AEs unlikely, probably or possibly related to the IMP) and 
serious TEAEs will be summarised and tabulated according to primary system organ class 
and preferred term. TEAEs leading to death and TEAEs resulting in withdrawal from the 
study will be tabulated using frequency tables if a reasonable number of events of this type 
are observed.
Analogous frequency tables for TEEs (identified using MedDRA SMQs) and composite 
events will be provided separately.

from the study and AEs leading to death. Listings for non-treatment-emergent AEs, e.g., 
for patients enrolled but not randomised will be provided separately.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mortality 
The number of patients who died will be summarised. A possible difference between 
treatment groups will be estimated by a risk ratio with 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 
the time to death distribution will be calculated and graphically presented if a sufficient 
number of cases have been registered. 
Routine laboratory data
All laboratory values will be classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratories’ 
normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant or not clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786]. The following approaches will be taken for each laboratory parameter for the 
statistical analysis:
Quantitative data will be examined for trends using descriptive analysis (number of
patients, number of missing values, mean, SD, median, quartiles, minimum,
maximum) of actual values at each scheduled time point and changes from
baseline to each scheduled time point. Mean concentration versus time profiles will
be plotted for quantitative data
Qualitative data based on reference ranges will be described according to the
categories (i.e., low, normal, high)
Shift tables illustrating changes with respect to the laboratories’ normal ranges
between baseline and a defined scheduled time point. Scatterplots between
scheduled time points of lab values with normal ranges will be used for visual
illustration.

and secondary endpoints for different analysis sets, further multiple imputation methods
may be used to impute missing values. Technical details will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.
9.3 Randomisation, Stratification and Code Release
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Octaplex or FP. 
Randomisation lists using a permuted-block, randomisation scheme (stratified by [CONTACT_3725]) will 
be prepared by [CONTACT_46134]. Sealed randomisation envelopes based on the 
randomisation lists will then be provided to the blood banks/pharmacies of the participating 
centres who will be responsible for providing the IMP.
Patients will be identified using a sequential numbering system within the centre.
Randomisation will then be performed in sequential order of the patient IDs.

Unblinded information will be communicated only to the IDSMC. Possible outcomes of this 
analysis and recommendations to the sponsor are: 
The study will be stopped for futility. The decision to stop for futility is non-binding.
The sample size will be re-estimated by [CONTACT_164762].
Patient recruitment will continue during the conduct of the interim analysis. The study 
cannot be stopped for efficacy at the interim analysis.
The sample size re-estimation will be based on the evaluation of the conditional power, 
calculated as described in section 7.3 of [94] making use of the observed response rates
at the time of the interim analysis and inverse normal combination test statistic with equal 
weights given by

A 20% drop-out rate will be added to the re-estimated sample size of evaluable patients to 
receive the number of patients to be enrolled in the second stage.
The minimum number of patients for the second stage is 210 evaluable subjects (even if 
the re-estimated sample size is below this number) or 263 including the possible dropouts
(+20%). The sample size for the second stage cannot exceed 1250 patients (dropouts
included). If the drop-out adjusted re-estimated sample size exceeds this threshold, the 
IDSMC may recommend to either stop the trial for futility or to enrol the maximum number 
of [ADDRESS_922291] completed the study ( Section 8.6 ).

This is a pragmatic trial that compares two coagulation factor replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681122].   
The Investigator will obtain freely given written consent from each patient after an 
appropriate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, and 
any other aspect of the study which is relevant to the patient’s decision to participate. The 
informed consent form must be signed, with name [CONTACT_301336] [CONTACT_681177]-related procedure, including screening tests for

collected. 
The study coordinator or assistant will explain that the patients are completely free to 
refuse to enter or withdraw from the study at any time, without any consequences to their 
future care and without the need to justify. Each patient will be informed that his/her 
medical (source) records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_11200], a quality assurance

4In Canada, informed consent will be obtained after randomisation, in accordance with Article 3.7A of 
the [ADDRESS_922295] transfusion and bleeding-related complications [1-4].
Bleeding and transfusions are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and risk of 
adverse outcomes (e.g., infection, heart failure) [2, 5-17]. 
The current standard of care for this complication in North America is FP, which is 
administered in around 15% of all cardiac surgeries in the [LOCATION_002] [29]. However, 
FP can cause SAEs including allergic reactions [30]; TRALI, which is a leading cause of 
transfusion-related death [30, 40]; and TACO, which occurs in approximately 5% of 
transfusions [41]. FP transfusion can also lead to transmission of infectious diseases, as 
FP is not usually filtered or treated with solvent/detergent [42]. FP use also requires ABO 
blood group compatibility matching and thawing, which can delay therapy. The large 
volumes of FP needed to achieve therapeutic effect can further delay time to haemostatic 
control and lead to substantial haemodilution, resulting in additional RBC transfusions [47]. 
PCCs, such as Octaplex , have several potential advantages over FP. PCCs are 
associated with a substantially lower risk of TRALI (due to pooling of the source donor 
plasma), and also a lower risk of TACO [38] as substantially lower volumes of PCC are 
required than with FP to achieve dose-equivalence for increasing thrombin generation [47]. 
The production of PCCs includes numerous pathogen-inactivation steps using solvents, 
detergents, pasteurisation, nanofiltration and vapor-heated treatment [1, 48], which is 
beneficial to patients because of the reduction in the risk of transmission of infectious 
agents. Unlike FP, PCCs do not require ABO compatibility matching or thawing, and can 
therefore be prepared and administered more quickly.
The potential benefits of Octaplex , compared with FP, were investigated in FARES, a
multicentre, randomised, active-control, pragmatic, Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [58]. Efficacy data 
obtained from the FARES study showed significantly lower chest tube drainage in the PCC 
group (P<0.001); a numerically higher percentage of treatment response in the PCC group; 
and a significantly lower number of transfused units of ABP in the PCC group versus the 
FP group (P<0.001) [58]. The significantly lower blood loss and, consequently, reduced 
exposure to ABP transfusions and their associated risks demonstrates how PCC use can 
directly benefit patients in this context, as both bleeding and transfusions during cardiac 
surgery have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality [2, 11, 14, 15, 17].

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Treatment Schedule: 
Screening Period 
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. After informed consent is obtained, 
information (including demographics, medical history and maternal-related information) from 
subjects will be collected, and subjects will undergo screening evaluations. Inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to determine the subject’s eligibility at Screening.  
Inpatient Admission 
Eligible subjects will be admitted to inpatient unit on Day -1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
reviewed to confirm eligibility. Breast milk (non-PK samples) will be collected per subject’s 
pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364360] 1. Subjects will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 
consecutive days; including the day of admission to inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing 
SM (Day 1-3), and the day of discharge from inpatient unit (Day 4).  
Treatment Period 
Subjects will receive 600 mg SPN-812 in the morning on Days 1, 2, and 3 after the completion 
of safety assessments. On Day 2 and Day 3, SM will be administered at the same time in the 
morning (±30 min) relative to the time that SM administration occurred on Day 1. On Days 1-4, 
breast milk will be pumped/collected from each breast per the PK breast milk sampling schedule 
or subject’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361]. For each breast milk collection period, the start and end times of 
the collection will be recorded, and the total volume (mL) of breast milk collected will be 
measured and recorded. 
Serial breast milk and blood samples will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_454146] 
milk samples collected out of the PK sampling period (non-PK breast milk sample) will not be 
analyzed for drug concentrations. The end of study (EOS) procedures will be conducted prior 
to discharge on Day [ADDRESS_454147] 
discontinues early, all EOS procedures will be conducted.   
Pharmacokinetic Sampling: 
Breast Milk:   
A total of [ADDRESS_454148] milk samples will be collected on Day 3 at the following time 
intervals:   
Day 1: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose; 
Day 3: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose, and ‘0 to 4’, ‘4 to 6’, ‘6 to 8’, ‘8 to 10’, ‘10 to 12’, ‘12 to 16’ and 
‘16 to 24’ hours post-dose.  
Breast milk from each breast will be emptied as thoroughly as possible at each session using 
an electric breast pump at the planned time intervals. To ensure that the pump completely 
removes milk from the breasts, double pump for no less than [ADDRESS_454149] milk samples (not to be analyzed for drug concentrations but volume will be 
recorded) will be collected at the following time intervals:  
 Day -1: store milk as pumped per subject’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361] 
 Day 1: [ADDRESS_454150]’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361] 
 Day 2: [ADDRESS_454151]’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364362], Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 02 September 2022

of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Blood:  
A total of 13 blood draws (4 mL each) for PK will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_454152]-dose. 
The following windows are permitted relative to the protocol-specified PK sample collection 
times:  
Pre-dose:  -15 minutes < [ADDRESS_454153]-dose:   ± [ADDRESS_454154]-dose:   ± 5 minutes 
> [ADDRESS_454155]-dose:  ± [ADDRESS_454156] milk will be determined 
using validated achiral chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry methods.  
Safety Monitoring: 
See Table 1 for safety monitoring procedures. Adverse event (AE) and concomitant medication 
monitoring will be performed throughout the study.  
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Populations 
 The Safety Population  will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of SM. 
 The PK Population  will include all subjects in the safety population who have a 
sufficient PK profile to derive at least [ADDRESS_454157] the PK data (e.g., emesis).  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
The PK Population will be used to generate breast milk and plasma PK parameters of viloxazine 
and 5-HVLX-gluc for all subjects.  
Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], and coefficient of 
variation [CV], minimum, median, and maximum) will be used to summarize breast milk and 
plasma concentration data at each planned sampling time point for each analyte in breast milk 
and plasma. The midpoint time for breast milk expressions will be used as the milk sampling 
time. Breast milk and plasma PK parameters calculated from the concentrations and actual 
times will be summarized by [CONTACT_364376] (including geometric mean and 
geometric CV). Individual and mean breast milk and plasma concentration-time profiles for 
viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc will be presented graphically on linear and semi-logarithmic scales. 
All PK parameters will be derived using a non-compartmental analysis method. 
Sample Size Determination 
The sample size selected is not based on statistical power considerations. Up to 15 healthy 
lactating women volunteers will be enrolled in the study, with the expectation that 12 subjects 
will complete the study. A sample size of 12 subjects is considered sufficient to achieve the 
primary objective of this study. 
Safety Analysis:  
AEs coded by [CONTACT_364377]. Vital signs, 
ECG, C-SSRS, physical examination and clinical laboratory values will be summarized and 
listed with abnormal values flagged.

To distinguish between data in the public domain and that generated by [CONTACT_364378], historical data 
will be associated with the term “viloxazine” and data generated by [CONTACT_364379] “SPN-809V [IR], SPN-812, SPN-812 IR, or SPN-812 ER.   
1.1 Background 
SPN-812 (viloxazine extended-release capsules; QELBREE®) is a structurally distinct, bicyclic, 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331]. The active substance in SPN-812 is viloxazine, whose 
mechanism of action is multimodal with antagonistic activity observed at 5-HT2B and agonistic 
activity at 5-HT2C receptors, as well as weaker antagonistic effects at ADRα1B, ADRβ2 and 5-
HT7 receptors. Additionally, SPN-812 acts as a modulator with inhibitory effects at the 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_364364]. Viloxazine was previously marketed in several European 
countries as an antidepressant as an immediate-release (IR) product. An extended-release (ER) 
formulation of viloxazine, SPN-812, has been developed by [CONTACT_364380]-administration, thereby [CONTACT_364381] a drug 
with a relatively short half-life. As of April 2022, SPN-812 ( QELBREE PI ) is FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD in persons [ADDRESS_454164] been conducted with SPN-812. Data collection in two open-label extension studies 
evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of SPN-812 in ADHD patients, one inchildren and 
adolescents (6 to 17 years of age) with ADHD and one in adults (18-65 years of age) with ADHD, 
has concluded; final results are pending.  
1.2.1 Phase 1 Studies 
Phase 1 studies include comparison of various ER formulations to an equivalent daily dose of IR 
viloxazine (812P101), comparison of single- and two-bead SPN-812 ER formulations to an IR 
formulation at single and multiple doses (812P102 and 812P103, respectively), an evaluation of 
maximum tolerable doses in a single- and multiple-ascending dose study (812P120), as well as 
an evaluation of food and sprinkling effects (812P105) and alcohol (812P115). In addition, a 
[14C]-labelled oral solution was used to examine absorption, metabolism, and excretion 
(812P111). Drug-drug interaction of SPN-812 on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 
isoenzymes was evaluated in study 812P113.1. Drug-drug interaction studies with stimulants 
were performed with d-amphetamine and methylphenidate in the 812P113.2 and 812P113.3 
studies, respectively. A study evaluating the DDI potential of paroxetine (strong inhibitor of 
CYP2D6) as a perpetrator of SPN-812 metabolism (812P113.4) was conducted. The effect of a 
multiple supratherapeutic dose of SPN-812 on QT interval has also been evaluated (812P117). 
Further, the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SPN-812 has 
also been evaluated in 812P112.1 and 812P112.2, respectively. 
Results from these studies demonstrated that 200 mg single dose of an extended release SPN-
812 formulation resulted in a mean maximum plasma concentration (C max) of 1.33 µg/mL, area

median time to maximum concentration (T max) of 5 hours, and a half-life of approximately 7 hours 
(812P103). Lower mean C max was observed for SPN-812 as compared to SPN-812 IR and by 48 
hours overall viloxazine exposure was comparable between the two formulations. The rate of 
absorption of viloxazine was formulation dependent; SPN-[ADDRESS_454165] the relative bioavailability of viloxazine following administration 
of SPN-812 capsules (812P105). SPN-812 interacted as a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, a weak 
inhibitor of CYP2D6, a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4; and displayed no significant differences in 
metabolism within CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (812P113.1). 
There was no DDI between SPN-812 and d-amphetamine (812P113.2) nor between SPN-812 
and methylphenidate (812P113.3). There was no clinically relevant impact of paroxetine on SPN-
812 (812P113.4). In addition, there was no dose dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364365]-administration of 
alcohol with SPN-812 (812P115). Renal impairment resulted in a 1.09-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.9-fold 
increase in AUC for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment subjects receiving 400 mg SPN-
812 as compared to healthy subjects (812P112.1). Hepatic impairment (HI) resulted in 
approximately 21% increase and up to 6% decrease in AUC of viloxazine for mild and moderate 
HI subject receiving SPN-812 400mg compared to matched healthy subjects; severe HI subjects 
receiving 200mg of SPN-812 had a 25% increase in AUC of viloxazine compared to matched 
healthy subjects (812P112.2). Multiple doses of 1800 mg (supra-therapeutic) SPN-[ADDRESS_454166] cardiac repolarization as measured by [CONTACT_364382] (812P117). In the single ascending/multiple ascending dose study (812P120), SPN-
812 was well tolerated up to 2100 mg/day as a single dose and up to 1800 mg/day as multiple 
doses given once daily for 5 consecutive days. Intolerable adverse events (AEs) were not 
observed at doses of up to 1800 mg/day. SPN-[ADDRESS_454167] of viloxazine (812P120).  
In the human absorption, metabolism, and excretion study (812P111), absorption of the isomers, 
R- and S-viloxazine, was rapid with a median T max of 1.0 hour and showed a 2:1 concentration 
ratio, respectively. Nearly 100% of the radioactive dose was recovered with approximately 90% 
being recovered within 24 hours of administration, demonstrating complete absorption of the drug 
followed by [CONTACT_364383]. The primary circulating form was SPN-812; the only metabolite 
found above 10% total radioactivity was 5-hydroxyviloxazine-glucuronide (5-HVLX-gluc).   
The most common AEs in the Phase [ADDRESS_454168] AEs were mild; none were severe or serious. No clinically significant, study medication-
related findings were observed for laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) tests in any study. In 
general, SPN-812 is considered to be well-tolerated with no safety events observed that would 
be unexpected for viloxazine.

Study 812P201, conducted in adults with ADHD using an earlier, IR formulation of viloxazine, was 
a randomized, blinded, proof-of-concept study. Subjects received either placebo or IR formulation 
of viloxazine three times a day in a dose range of 150 to 300 mg/day (26 subjects per treatment). 
The most common AEs the treatment group were nausea, decreased appetite, headache, and 
insomnia. No serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths occurred during the study. 
In the Phase 2 dose finding study, 812P202, children 6-12 years old with ADHD were randomized 
in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio to received placebo or 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg SPN-812 ER once daily for 
5-8 weeks (titration and 5 weeks of maintenance). SPN-[ADDRESS_454169] been conducted, including two clinical trials in children 6 
to 11 years of age with ADHD (Studies 812P301 and 812P303; evaluated 100 mg, 200 mg, and 
400 mg) and two clinical trials in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with ADHD (Studies 812P302 
and 812P304; evaluated 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg). In April 2021, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved SPN-812 (Qelbree®; viloxazine extended-release capsules) 100-
400mg for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients [ADDRESS_454170] common 
adverse events (100-400mg) for were somnolence, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, insomnia, and irritability.  
A single pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2-arm, 
parallel-group clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SPN-812 (200-600mg) for the 
treatment of ADHD in adults 18 to 65 years of age with ADHD (Study 812P306) was also 
conducted. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or SPN-812 (200 to 600mg/day) 
for a total of 6 weeks of treatment. In total, 374 subjects were randomized and 372 subjects were 
treated: 183 subjects with placebo and 189 subjects with SPN-812. SPN-812 was well tolerated 
in all dose levels, with no deaths, and 2 SAEs were reported in 2 subjects receiving placebo 
(cardiac failure congestive and pancreatitis), and no SAE occurred in any subject receiving SPN-
812. No safety concerns were identified in this study. The most frequently reported treatment-
emergent adverse events (≥5%) were insomnia, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, headache, 
fatigue and decreased appetite. 
As of July 2022, data collection in two open-label extension studies evaluating the long-term 
safety and efficacy of SPN-812 has concluded, including one in children and adolescents (6 to 17 
years of age) with ADHD (Study 812P310) and one in adults (18 to 65 years of age) with ADHD 
(Study 812P311); final results for both are pending. 
Information and data from clinical studies are available in greater detail in the current SPN-812 
Investigator Brochure.

This study is comprised of Screening, Inpatient Admission, Treatment Period and End of Study 
(EOS). The total duration of the study is up to 1 month including Screening up to 28 days and 4 
days of Treatment Period. Subjects will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 days, including the day 
of admission to the inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing SM (Days 1-3), and the day of 
discharge (Day 4). 
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. After informed consent is obtained, 
information from subjects will be collected (including maternal-related information) and subjects 
will undergo screening evaluations (see Table 1). Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to 
determine the subject’s eligibility at Screening. A lactation consultant will be available to provide 
lactation support to subjects once they are enrolled.  
Subjects will be admitted to inpatient unit on Day -1 to confirm eligibility. Subjects will receive 600 
mg SPN-812 on the morning of Days 1, 2 and 3 after completion of safety assessments. SM 
should be administered at the same time in the morning (±30 min) of dosing days. Breast milk 
and blood sample for PK analysis will then be collected on Day 3 per schedule in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , respectively.  Non-PK breast milk expressed on Days -1, 1, and 2 will be 
collected over the time intervals in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , and these samples will not be analyzed for 
drug concentrations. The volume and the start and end times of the collection of each non-PK 
and PK breast milk sample will be recorded. The end of study (EOS) procedures will be conducted 
prior to discharge on Day [ADDRESS_454174] 
discontinues early, all EOS procedures will be conducted. Study schematic is shown in Figure 1, 
and Schedule of Events and Procedures is presented in Table 1.

therapeutic doses of viloxazine extended-release capsules to assess concentrations of viloxazine 
in breast milk” . This study will be conducted in healthy lactating women, and drug concentration 
in breast milk and estimated infant dose via breastfeeding will be assessed following the FDA 
guidance ( FDA guidance for clinical lactation studies, May 2019 ); the mother-infant pair will not 
be enrolled in this study, since there is no information available about the extent of drug transfer 
into breast milk, including evidence that the drug accumulates in breast milk and if the drug is 
likely to be absorbed by [CONTACT_364384]. In this study, a multiple-dose design will be used 
since SPN-812 is administered chronically to treat patients with ADHD. The plasma steady-state 
will be reached after two days of once-daily administration without obvious accumulation 
(QELBREE PI ). In this study, the dose of SPN-812 will not be titrated up in incremental doses since a previous multiple ascending dose study of up to 2100 mg/day SPN-812 (812P120) has 
been conducted and no safety concerns were reported. The dose to be administered in the study,

consecutive days with either (a) formula or (b) stored breast milk (e.g., breast milk pumped and 
stored in freezer during screening period between screening visit and day of admission to 
inpatient unit). 
6.1.2 Inpatient Admission (Study Day -1) 
Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient unit on Day -[ADDRESS_454190] milk samples will be collected according to the schedule described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Subject will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 consecutive days, including day of 
admission to inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing SM (Days 1 to 3) and day of discharge from 
inpatient unit (Day 4).  
6.1.3 Treatment Period (Study Days 1, 2, and 3) 
All eligible subjects will receive [ADDRESS_454191] milk 
samples, according to the schedule described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

7.1 Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic parameters will be captured: date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity. 
The following will be assessed as related to the eligibility criteria as listed in  Section 4.2 and 
Section 4.3 and will include the following: 
 Medical History 
 Medication History (including all medications taken within 30 days before Screening) 
 History of drug, tobacco, and alcohol use 
7.[ADDRESS_454202] milk samples will be collected for PK analysis at the following 
time intervals:  
 Day 1: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose; 
 Day 3: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose, and ‘0 to 4’, ‘4 to 6’, ‘6 to 8’, ‘8 to 10’, ‘10 to 12’, ‘12 to 16’ 
 and ‘16 to 24’ hours post-dose.  
Breast milk from each breast will be emptied as thoroughly as possible at each session using an 
electric breast pump at the planned time intervals. To ensure that the pump completely removes 
milk from the breasts, double pump for no less than [ADDRESS_454203] milk samples (not to be analyzed for drug concentrations but volume will be 
recorded) will be collected at the following time intervals:  
 Day -1: store milk as pumped per subject’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361]; 
 Day 1: [ADDRESS_454204]’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361]; 
 Day 2: [ADDRESS_454205]’s pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_364361]. 
The type of breast pump preferred will be determined on an individual basis. Those subjects with 
their own pumps and sterilizers will be permitted to continue using these. Subjects without their 
own pumps will be provided with a breast pump by [CONTACT_3652]. For each breast milk collection 
period, the start and end times of the collection will be recorded, and the total volume (mL) of 
breast milk collected will be measured and recorded.

7.4.7) if deemed so in the Investigator’s judgment. 
7.4.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs’ measurements, including orthostatic blood pressure, pulse rate, oral temperature and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], will be obtained at times (+/- 15 minutes) designated in the Schedule of Events 
and Assessments ( Table 1). Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the 
subject has been seated for a minimum of 5 minutes and within 3 minutes of standing. Vital signs 
(resting or non-resting) may also be taken at any other time, as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_227559]/Site Investigator. 
7.4.3 Physical Examinations  
The physical examination conducted at Screening and EOS/ET will include assessments of head, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal. Measurement of height and weight will be performed at Screening.  
Any clinically significant findings during screening will be recorded as medical history and any 
clinically significant abnormal findings during treatment will be recorded as an AE. At the EOS 
physical examination, only changes from Baseline will be noted. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_454211] examination conducted at Screening, Baseline (day of admission to inpatient 
unit prior to first dose), and at EOS/ET, is a physical examination of each breast, including visual 
inspection of the skin and nipples, and an assessment of the underarms and collarbone area. Any 
clinically significant findings during screening and/or baseline will be recorded as medical history 
and any clinically significant abnormal findings during or after treatment (after first dose of SM) 
will be recorded as an AE. Only changes from Baseline will be noted for the clinical breast 
examination at the EOS. 
7.4.5 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as per the Schedule of Events and Assessments ( Table 
1). Additional ECGs may be performed at other times if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_54421]/Site 
Investigator. 
The ECG will be recorded while the subject is resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes. 
The ECG will electronically measure the PR, QRS, QT, RR, and QTc intervals, and heart rate. 
All ECG tracings will be reviewed within 24 hours by [CONTACT_54421]/Site Investigator or qualified 
Sub-Investigator. PR intervals will be determined for each of these ECGs from a single reading. 
Invalid measurements will be repeated. QTc will be reported as QTcF (QT corrected using 
Fridericia's method).

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 7.4.6 Prospective Assessment of Suicidality via C-SSRS 
Suicidality assessment will be performed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-
SSRS), which will be administered by a trained professional during Screening , Day -1, and at End 
of Study. 
The C-SSRS is a questionnaire that prospectively assesses suicidal ideation and behavior using 
a semi-structured interview to probe subject’s responses ( Posner et al., 2011 ).  The C-SSRS 
versions applicable to the current study are the “ Baseline/Screening ” version ( Appendix [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
and the “ Since Last Visit ” version ( Appendix [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
 The Baseline/Screening version of the scale assesses suicidal ideation and behavior for 
lifetime and last [ADDRESS_454212]’s first interview and 
will be used at Screening to identify volunteers who must not participate in the trial due to 
their suicidal tendencies.   
 The Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses any suicidal thoughts or behaviors the 
subjects may have had since the last administration of the C-SSRS.   
 Training will be provided on the administration and interpretation of the C-SSRS. 
 C-SSRS findings 
Positive suicidality reports are generated for ANY of the following findings: 
 Suicidal ideation with intention to act 
 Suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent 
 Made suicide attempt 
 Interrupted suicide attempt 
 Aborted suicide attempt 
 Preparatory behaviors for making a suicide attempt 
Should the interview reveal that a subject has a positive suicidal ideation, the site staff should 
take appropriate steps to refer the subject to a psychiatrist for a follow-up evaluation.  The subject 
should not be released from the evaluation site until it is confirmed that the questionnaire answers 
are reviewed by [CONTACT_54421]/Site Investigator or designee and the subject is not considered to 
be at risk. Ultimately, the determination of suicidality and risk is up to the Principal/Site 
Investigator’s judgment.  
Any confirmed positive findings occurring after initiation of the SM dosing may qualify as 
treatment-emergent suicidality and should be recorded as an AE on the AE CRF. Positive suicidal 
findings recorded as an AE should be evaluated by [CONTACT_54421]/Site Investigator, in consultation 
with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee, as a potential important medical event ( Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). If the suicidal indication has been determined to be an SAE, the subject must be 
immediately withdrawn from the study and the SAE must be reported to the Sponsor using the 
SAE Form (See Section 9.1 ).

of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 7.4.7 Adverse Event 
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study by [INVESTIGATOR_41805]/Site Investigator for AEs. Adequate 
medical surveillance will be assured during the confinement period and a physician will be 
available on call at all times.  If necessary, a physician, either at the study site or in a nearby 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307], will administer treatment for any AEs. Subjects experiencing AEs will be re-evaluated for 
eligibility criteria to assess their continuation in the study. 
As defined by [CONTACT_345704], an adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
 Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease. 
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in 
symptoms, a change in treatment or discontinuation from SM. 
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require 
surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected during 
the study period. 
 Causality 
Adverse events may be categorized as either Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Adverse 
Drug Reactions based on their relationship to SM and the degree of certainty about causality.  
Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the SM and the AE, i.e., there is a 
reasonable possibility that the SM caused the adverse event. 
Adverse Drug Reactions  (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to conclude 
that the SM caused the event. 
 Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are enrolled and who receive SM will be monitored and questioned regarding 
the occurrence of AEs. Adverse events occurring prior to SM administration on Study Day [ADDRESS_454213]’s medical history. Throughout the study, the Investigator must seek 
information on AEs by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  
Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the source document and also in the 
appropriate section of the case report form (CRF).  
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document, though they may be grouped under one diagnosis.  For

of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”. 
All AEs occurring after enrollment and receipt of SM and throughout the study period must be 
recorded.  A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on 
or after the first dose of SM, or that worsened following first administration of SM, therefore, all 
AEs will be treatment-emergent.  The clinical course of each AE should be followed until resolution 
or until, in the medical judgment of the Investigator, the event has stabilized. Subjects that have 
experienced AE(s) may be re-evaluated for eligibility criteria to assess their continuation in the 
study as determined by [CONTACT_2725]. 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
 Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by [CONTACT_1149]? 
 Causality: Was AE related or possibly related to the SM? 
 Serious vs. Non-serious: Is the event a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)? 
 Criteria for Assessing Severity 
The Investigator will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to treatment in order 
that he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  Severity refers to the accumulated 
intensity of discomfort/impairment of health since the last recording of AEs and will be assessed 
according to the following criteria: 
 Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom or event, but easily tolerated 
 Moderate: Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may warrant intervention 
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical 
status and warrants intervention 
 Criteria for Assessing Causality 
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the administration of SM 
and the occurrence of an AE as not suspected  or as a suspected reaction to SM.  These are 
defined as follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or implausible, or 
there is an evident other cause. 
 Unlikely related :  Temporal relationship to SM administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations.

of such information that is not authorized in writing by [CONTACT_345659].  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions do 
not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 Possibly related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event.  Information on medication 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  This will be reported as a Suspected Adverse 
Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
 Definitely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, and 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event.  The response to 
withdrawal of the medication (de-challenge) should be clinically plausible.  The event must 
be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re-challenge 
procedure if necessary.  This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) . 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
AEs are classified as serious or non-serious.  An AE or adverse drug reaction  (ADR) is 
considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the 
following outcomes:  
 death 
 life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred. This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death.) 
 in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364370].  They may jeopardize the subject 
and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For 
example, drug dependence or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a seizure that did not result in in-patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm in an emergency department 
would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
7.5 Screening Scales and Assessment Tools 
7.5.1 Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a commonly used screening tool developed to assist in identifying possible symptoms of depression in women during pregnancy and during 
the postnatal period ( Cox et al., 1987 ; Wisner et al., 2002 ; see Appendix 14.1.1 ).  The EPDS is a 
10-item self-report questionnaire; items of the scale correspond to various clinical depression 
symptoms, such as guilt feeling, sleep disturbance, low energy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation.  
The individual rates themselves on each item on a 4-point Likert (various response option

1, 2, and 4, the four response options are assigned a numeric value of 0-3 top to bottom. For 
items 3 and 5-10, the four response options are assigned a numeric value of 3-0 top to bottom. A 
total score is calculated by [CONTACT_364390] 10 items. The total score ranges between 
0 and 30, and a total score of >13 represents presence of depression. It takes approximately 3-5 
minutes to complete the EPDS.

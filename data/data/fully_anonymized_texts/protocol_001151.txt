Title of Study: A Phase 2, multicenter open -label, non -randomized study of bavituximab 
plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer who have 
progressed on or after at least one prior standard therapy  
Number of  Study Sites: Approximately 28 
Study centers: This global, multicenter trial will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US), 
United Kingdo m ([LOCATION_006]), South Korea, and Taiwan  and other countries as deemed appropriate.   
Studied period (years):   
Date first patient enrolled: Approximately June   [ADDRESS_1246423] patient completed:  Approximately June  2021  Phase of development:  2 
 
Rationale:  
Oncologie, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_890351] , a chimeric monoclonal antibody  (mAb) that 
inhibits  the immunosuppressive effects of phosphatidylserine  (PS), for the treatment of 
cancer . PS modulates the tumor microenvironment as a ligand for multiple receptors on 
suppressor cells leading to secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming 
growth factor -beta (TGF -) and interleukin -10 (IL -10) from M2 -macrophages and  myeloid -
derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ). PS exposure in the tumor microenvironment  prevents 
dendritic cell maturation and inhibits development of tumor -specific cytotoxic T cell s. Of 
import ance, expression of PS on the external surface of t umors  cell acts as an 
immunosuppressive ligand for multiple immune receptors , including TIM/TAM.  Nonclinical 
data show that bavituximab blocks PS immunosuppressive sig naling, provides specifici ty for 
innate immune responses, and activates T -cell-driven adaptive immunopathways that 
reactivate a therapeutically effective immune response to the tumor.   
Pembrolizuma b is a mAb  that acts by [CONTACT_890377] b etween PD -1 and its ligands, 
programmed death -ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD-L2). Molecules 
that disrupt the interaction of PD1/PD -L1, also known as immune check  point inhibitors 
(CPI), are emerging as a front -line treatment for several  types of cancer.  Pembrolizumab is 
approved in the US for the treatment of patients with  recurrent locally advanced or metastatic 
gastric or gastroeso phageal junction  (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma after disease progression on or 
after two or more p rior lines of the rapy including fluoropyrimidine - and platinum -containing 
chemotherapy . 
Although efficacy is notable and can be sustained, many patients fail pembrolizumab 
treatment potentially due to exhaustion of specific T -cells. Exhausted T -cells express elevated 
level s of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), as opposed to activated or 
partially activated T -cells. Bavituximab binding to PS interrupts its binding to TIM3, which 
 
Amendment  4 Page 5 of 102 Confidential  
  may partially reverse the exhaustion and restore activity to pembrolizumab. Theref ore, the 
combination of bavituximab with pembrolizumab may enhance the antitumor immune 
response resulting in increased clinical benefit.   
Given the potential for this combination to enhance antitumor responses, it is being evaluated 
in 2 populations  of advanced gastric or GEJ cancer patients : patients  that have progressed on 
standard chemotherapy  and are naïve to CPI [CONTACT_48831]  (Group 1) ; patient s that had a confirmed 
partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890352] , then subsequ ently progressed following treatment with  CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890353] ( Group 2 ).  
Study Objectives:  
Study obje ctives are the same for both Group 1 ( CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve ) and Group 2 ( CPI [CONTACT_128472]).    
Primary:  
To assess the safety and tolerability of bavituximab in combination with pembrolizumab in 
patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer  
To assess the antitumor activity of  the treatment combination based on Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guideline  version 1.1 ( Appendix A ) 
Secondary:  
To further characterize the antitumor activity of the treatment combination based on 
additional assessments of clinical benefit  
To evaluate bavituximab concentrations when administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab  
To assess the potential immunogenicity of bavituximab   
Tertiary:  
To evaluate a novel biomarker signature [CONTACT_890421] -pembrolizumab combination  
Study Endpoints:  
Study endpoints are the same for both Group 1 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve) and Group 2 (CPI [CONTACT_128472]).    
Primary:  
• Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  
graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 , including changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters  
• Objective response rate (ORR) as assesse d by [CONTACT_890378]  
1.1 
Secondary:  
• Duration of response ( DoR), disease control rate (DCR) (as defined by [CONTACT_890379] 6 weeks ), progression -free survival (PFS), and o verall survival 
(OS)  
• Bavituximab concentrations before and after bavituximab infusions   
• Presence of a nti-bavituximab  antibo dies (anti-drug antibodies [ADAs ])  
 
Amendment  4 Page 6 of 102 Confidential  
  Tertiary:  
• Analysis of tissue to determine percentage of patients with defined genetic signature  
• Preliminary correlation of ORR to genetic signature  
• Status of genomic and immune biomarkers in blood and tissue samples at baseline and 
change from baseline upon treatment  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, non-randomized study with an initial safety 
analysis to assess the safety and tolerability of bavituximab administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab, a PD -[ADDRESS_1246424] chemotherapy and are naïve to CPI [CONTACT_48831]  
(Group  1), or have progressed following treatment with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890354]  (Group 2) .  Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled  in the study; a  
minimum of 40 patients w ill be enrolled in Group 1 and a minimum of 20 patients will be 
enrolled in Group 2 .  
Following a minimum of 3 and a maximum of a 10-patient safety  run-in with bavituximab 
(3 mg/kg intravenous [IV] weekly) and pembrolizumab (200  mg IV every 3 weeks [Q3W]),  
additional patients will be recruited if the initial doses of the regimen are tolerable. Lower 
doses of bavituximab may be explored if the initial doses are not tolerable. Primary anti -
tumor activity will be documented by [CONTACT_10670] -assessed ORR per REC IST v. 1.1. A total 
of [ADDRESS_1246425] 3 patients will be evaluated for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the purpose of 
declaring the tentative recommended dose for expansion (RDE). The Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) will review d ata from these patients for DLTs at the end of the first 3 -week 
cycle:  
• If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, the RDE will be tentatively 
declared and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 patients. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT, the RDE will be tentatively declared 
and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level 0, Dose Level -1 will 
be explored. If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level -1, Dose 
Level -2 will be explored.  
• If  2 DLT(s ) occur  in up to [ADDRESS_1246426] 1 cycle (3 weeks), the SRC will review data from these patients to determine the RDE. 
In case of DLTs during Cycl e 1, de -escalating doses of bavituximab in combination with 
pembrolizumab will be ( Table A ) as follows:

▪ Grade 4 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of 
>38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained  temperature of ≥38 
degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour, with life -threatening 
consequences and urgent intervention indicated.  
o Grade 4 lymphocyte decreases lasting > 14 days

Safety data in subsequent cycles will also be monitored on an ongoing basis to determine the 
cumulative incidence of late -onset toxicities . 
Patients who experience a DLT, but in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_890355], may 
be offered continued treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab.  
Dosing will continue until criteria for study treatment discontinuation are met (unacceptable 
toxicity, progressive disease [PD], or withdrawal from the study) or up to a maximum of 
35 cycles.  
Patients will be assessed for tumor response/progression per RECIST version1.1 ( Appendix 
A). The initial tumor assessment on study therapy will be conducted [ADDRESS_1246430] be confirmed by a second scan 4 weeks after initial PD diagnosis in 
the absence of clearly symptomatic and/or r api[INVESTIGATOR_890356]. It is anticipated that most patients will remain on 
treatment during the 4 weeks between scans.  
Number of Patients Planned: Up to 80 patients are planned.

administration section for more details.  
The doses of bavituximab will be adjusted or interrupted as appropriate based on treatment 
modifications defined in the protocol.  
No dose reductions of pembrolizumab  are permitted. Doses will be withheld as appropriate 
based on treatment modifications defined in the protocol . 
Duration of Treatment :  
Treatment may be continued until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Progressive disease (PD): In patie nts with PD, a confirmatory scan will be performed 
at least 4  weeks later to confirm PD prior to removing the patient from study 
treatment.  
• Intervening illness that prevents further administration of treatment.  
• Unacceptable AEs.  
• The patient, for any reason , requires treatment with another therapeutic agent that has 
been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of the study indication.

Amendment  4 Page 14 of 102 Confidential  
  Pharmacokinetics of bavituximab:  Peripheral venous blood (4 mL) will be collected from 
all patients during Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 15 within 24 hours prior to bavituximab infusion, 
and at 1 hour (± 30 minutes) after the end of bavituximab infusion. Samples a re also collected 
within 24 hours prior to bavituximab infusion on Cycle 2 Days 1 and 15, and Day 1 of Cycles 
3, 4, and 6 for quantitation of bavituximab.  
Biomarkers:  
Peripheral blood and tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker analysis. Tissue will be 
obtained prior to therapy (mandatory fresh tumor biopsy and, if available, archival sample) 
and this tissue will be used to measure potential tissue -based predictive biomarkers. Those 
biomarkers include immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as RNA signatures. Residual 
sample material available after completion of the designated analyses may be used in the 
future for identification of predictive markers or to enhance understanding of disease biology 
unless prohibited by [CONTACT_44896].  Samples will be de -identified to ensure patient 
privacy. Serum will be collected at baseline and at timepoints post treatment as specified in 
the protocol to assess circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  
Statistical Methods:  
The trial will evaluate safe ty and efficacy of the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination in 
a disease setting in which pembrolizumab has shown promising but modest activity. The 
hypothesis to be evaluated is whether the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination will yield 
an ORR superior  to historical ORR of pembrolizumab in the 2nd-line setting in patients who 
have not previously been exposed to an anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 agent.  
Sample Size:  
The primary efficacy objective of this Phase [ADDRESS_1246450] 72% to 86% po wer to show that the lower bound of 
the 80% CI is greater than 15% for 30 -50 patients is the with a true ORR of 30%, and the 3rd 
line cohort will have 67% to 78% power to show that the lower bound of the 80% CI is 
greater than 6% for 30 -50 patients is the with a true ORR of 15%.   
For Group 1 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve),a pproximately 40 patients are needed to show a statistical 
superiority  of bavituximab -pembrolizumab with 80% statistical power at one -sided type I 
error rate of α=0.10. For the CPI -relpase patient populatio n, the n was set to 20 patients for 
the initial assessment of safety, tolerability and initial antitumor activity.  See the statistical 
section of the protocol for further detail . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the safety 
analyses (safety analysis set). DLT evaluable set will be included for the first [ADDRESS_1246451] 1 dose and comp leted 1 full cycle 
follow up  or experienced a DLT . 
The safety and tolerability of study treatment will be evaluated based on AEs (incidence and 
severity), performance status, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, standard 
clinical laboratory safety evaluations. Laboratory abnormalities and AEs will be graded 
according to CTCAE v5.0. Immune -related reactions (IRRs) may occur with bavituximab 
and/or pembrolizumab. Detailed guidance for the handling of IRRs will be presented in the 
protocol.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Serum concentrations for bavituximab will be listed and summarized using descriptive 
statistics by [CONTACT_491684].   
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of bavituximab (ADA formation) will be investigated during the course 
of the study.  
Efficacy  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the full analysis set, and per protocol analysis set, 
including predefined biomarker subgroups (as below). Radiological and clinical tumor 
assessments will be evaluated based on RECIST version1. 1. For patients with PD, a 
confirmatory scan will be performed at least 4  weeks later to confirm PD prior to removing 
the patient from study treatment. This confirmatory scan is recommended but not required , it 
is at the discretion of the treating physicia n. 
Statistical Methods:  
Tabular summaries of data will be descriptive in nature (i.e., number of patients [n], mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and n and 
percent for categorical variables). A more detailed description of analysis methods will be 
provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be completed prior to the clinical database 
lock.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Overview of Bavituximab  
Oncologie, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_890360] . Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse) monoclonal antibody (mAb) derived from 
murine mAb 3G4 that targets phosphatidylserine (PS) after binding to β2 -glycop rotein 1 (β2 -
GP1).  
In normal non -tumorigenic cells, PS is segregated to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. 
Conditions that induce cellular stress, including normal cell death, immune phagocytic cell 
clearance, oxygen radicals, hypoxia, irradiation, and chemotherapy, cause a shift resulting in the 
externalization of PS to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Exposed PS is recognized and 
bound by [CONTACT_890384]. 
This relocation also o ccurs in tumor cells, exosomes, and vascular endothelial cells inducing 
non-inflammatory signals via multiple receptors which contribute to the immunosuppression of 
the tumor microenvironment , including binding to  TIM/TAM receptors . Phosphatidylserine -
targeting agents block PS -mediated immunosuppression by [CONTACT_890385]. Antibody -
mediated PS blockade reduces the levels of myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSC s), 
transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -β), and interleukin (IL) -10, and increases the levels of 
tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α) and IL -12. Phosphatidylserine blockade also repolarizes 
tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs) from predominant M2 to predominant M1 phenotype, 
promotes the mat uration of dendritic cells , and induces potent adaptive antitumor T -cell 
immunity. In vitro  studies have shown that bavituximab binds to PS in the presence of β2 -GP1 as 
a high affinity complex, modulating β2 -GP1 binding to PS from 1 μM to 1 nM. In experimental 
mouse cancer models, the bavituximab surrogate antibody mch1N11 as a single agent reduc ed 
tumor growth and prolonged survival. In addition , the anti -tumor effects of mch1N11 were 
enhanced by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of checkpoint inhibitors (anti - Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte Associated 
Protein 4  (CTLA4 ) and anti -PD-1/L1), as well as chemotherapy or radi ation (Yin et al., 2013a ; 
Yin et al., 2013b ). 
Bavituximab is an attractive immunotherapeutic approach to treating cancer, because its primary 
mechanism of action involves modulating the tumor microenv ironment from a primarily 
immunosuppressive, angiogenesis -promoting state (with infiltrating MDSCs  and M2 -
macrophages) to an immune activating state (with long -term tumor -specific immunity facilitated 
by M1 macrophages, mature dendritic cells, and activate d T lymphocytes). In essence, 
expression of PS on the external surface of the cell acts as an immunosuppressive signal in 
normal cell death and immune phagocytic clearance , thus allowing tumor growth and 
progression . Exposing PS on the exter nal surface of the cell provides a rich source of ligand for 
multiple immune rece ptors expressed on immune cells present in the microenvironment, 
including PS binding to T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3  (TIM3 ) receptors .  
Nonclinical  data suggest that bavituximab and pembrolizumab can be co -administered 
effectively as demonstrated in murine models for melanoma and triple negative breast cancer. 
Combining PS -targeting antibody mch1N11 with a single dose of radiotherapy and anti -
program med cell death protein 1 (PD -1) blocking antibody , a triple therapy combination, to treat 
 
Amendment  [ADDRESS_1246461] complete tumor elimination and leads to 
statistically significant prolonged survival  (Giese et al., 2018 ). 
Gray et al. (2016 ) demonstrated that immune -competent  mice i mplanted  with triple negative 
breast cancer ( TNBC ) cell lines and treated with a combination of the PS -targeting anti body 
mch1N11 and anti-PD-1 antibody therapy ha d significantly greater inhibitory tumor growth 
activity and significantly increased overall survival compared with either sing le treatment alone, 
and is cap able of causing complete tumor regression. Addition ally, mice treated  with the 
combination experi enced complete tumor regression , demonstrated increased splenic IFN γ 
production  and enhanced number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ). Furthermore, on 
TNBC re -challenge those treated with the combinations were capable of mounting a durable 
immune respons e tha t suppressed tumor growth.  
Bavituximab has been administered to [ADDRESS_1246462] cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic 
cancer. A Phase 3 advanced NSCLC trial, SUNRISE, was completed.  The primary endpoint of 
improved overall survival (OS) in bavituximab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel plu s placebo was 
not met. However, subgroup analysis indicated that patients who progressed on study treatment 
with bavituximab plus docetaxel and went onto a checkpoint inhibitor showed significantly 
improved OS compared to a similar group of patients with p rogressive disease (PD) post 
docetaxel plus placebo who went onto receive a checkpoint inhibitor.  
1.1.1.  Nonclinical Experience with Bavituximab  
In nonclinical studies, no target organs of toxicity were identified in rats and monkeys receiving 
doses of bavituxim ab of up to 100 mg/kg. Incidental minimal histological findings were noted in 
heart and lungs in high -dose monkeys and included left ventricular thrombus, right ventricular 
subendocardial fibrosis and arteriopathy, and fibrosis in the lung. In rats, subend ocardial 
inflammation was noted in the high -dose group. Bavituximab has been associated with 
immunogenicity in rats and monkeys. A dose -related prolongation of aPTT in rats and of aPTT 
and PT in monkeys has been demonstrated to be an in vitro phenomenon du e to inhibition of 
phospholipid -dependent coagulation assays. Bavituximab up to 100 mg/kg did not affect time -to-
healing in dermal healing rodent models.  
Refer to the bavituximab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed nonclinical data.  
1.1.2.  Clinical Experien ce with Bavituximab  
Phase 1 (single agent, safety, and pharmacokinetic [PK]) and Phase 1b (safety, tolerability, and 
PK) studies of bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy have been completed in patients 
with advanced cancer. Several Phase [ADDRESS_1246463] cancer , and previously untreated Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. A Phase 3 
clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bavituximab when given with docetaxel in 
patients with previously treated Stage 3b/4 non -squamous NSCLC was discontinued following a 
pre-specified interim analysis. Addition of bavituximab to docetaxel did not improve OS in 
previously treated advanced NSCLC. Subset analyses suggested possible benefit in high β2GP1 
 
Amendment  4 Page 28 of 102 Confidential  
  cases and those subsequently receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Current d evelopment of 
bavituximab is focused on the combination of bavituximab with other therapeutic approaches 
including radiation and immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Across all studies, the profile of serious adverse events (SAEs) in subjects receiving bavituximab 
in combina tion with chemotherapy or an antiviral was similar to those receiving chemotherapy 
alone. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (4.6%), neutropenia (4.0%), pneumonia 
(2.7%), and pulmonary embolism (2.0%), anemia (1.6%), pyrexia (1.6%), dyspnea (1.1 %), deep 
vein thrombosis (1.3%), asthenia (1.2%), diarrhea (1.0%), fatigue (1.0%), and sepsis (1.0%). The 
only events that occurred at a meaningfully higher frequency (increase by >1.0%) in subjects 
receiving bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy co mpared to those receiving 
chemotherapy alone were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and anemia. These events were not 
observed in the small group of patients receiving bavituximab monotherapy.  
Infusion reactions and similar events (e.g. hypersensitivity re actions and anaphylaxis) have 
occurred in association with bavituximab administration and are a known class effect of chimeric 
mAbs. These types of reactions have occurred more commonly in oncology studies in which 
chemotherapy is also administered, but ha ve also occurred in monotherapy studies in both the 
antiviral and oncology programs. The highest incidence was in Study PPHM 0704, a study 
conducted in the Republic of Georgia in which patients with advanced breast cancer also 
received docetaxel therapy. A ll reactions in that study were mild or moderate in severity, and 
patients were able to continue to receive bavituximab without an apparent increase (or decrease) 
in the frequency or severity of the reactions. It is unclear what impact, if any, that the 
concomitant chemotherapy, patient characteristics, or environment had on the frequency of 
events in this study.  
Grade [ADDRESS_1246464] occurred both with and without 
premedication, and it is unclear whether the type of co -administered chemotherapy or 
premedication with steroids and antihistamines impacts the frequency or severity of infusion 
reactions. Reports of infusion reac tions will continue to be monitored.  
Refer to the bavituximab IB for detailed clinical data.  
1.1.3.   Rationale for Study and Starting Dose of Bavituximab  
The approved dose and schedule of pembrolizumab will be used in this trial in combination with 
the recommend ed dose of bavituximab for Phase 2 and Phase 3 development. No overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_890361], and the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review emerging data 
during the conduct of the trial.    
1.2. Overview of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent human ized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)  monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand  2 (PD-
L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. 
Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
 
Amendment  4 Page 29 of 102 Confidential  
  indications. For more details on specific indications  and background information,  refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure /approved labeling for pemb rolizumab . 
1.2.1.  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, 2010]. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tu mor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+  effector 
T-cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can 
be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objecti ve tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma [Dudley et al., 2005; Hunder et al., 2008].  
The PD -[ADDRESS_1246465] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 ( CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 ( CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement  of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [Greenwald et al., 2005; Okazaki et al., 2001].  
The structure of murine  PD-1 has been resolved [Zhang et al., 2004]. PD -1 and its family members 
are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable –type (IgV -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling  
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch 
motif. Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases , SHP -1 and SHP -2, 
to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta (PKCθ), 
and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70 ), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling 
cascade [Okazaki et al., 2001; Chemnitz et al., 2004; Sheppard et al., 2004; and Riley, 2009]. 
The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_1246466] from, 
that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [Parry 
et al., 2005; Francisco, 2010]. As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention in gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) aden ocarcinoma .  
1.2.2.  Non-clinical  and Clinical Trials  
 
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD -
1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to 
tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ot her treatment modalities 
[Hirano, 2005; Blank, 2004;Weber, 2010;  Strome, 2003; Spranger, 2014; Curran, 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768], 
2010] .  Anti -mouse PD -[ADDRESS_1246467] demonstrated antitumor responses 
in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia 
and colorectal carcinoma [Strome, 2003; Curran, 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768], 2010; Nomi, 2007; Zhang, 2004 ].  
In such studies, tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin 
 
Amendment  4 Page 30 of 102 Confidential  
  expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD -
1 checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo  
[Curran, 2010] . Experiments have confirmed the in vivo  efficacy of anti -mouse  PD-1 antibody as 
a monotherapy, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see the Investigator’s Brochure [IB]).  
1.2.3.  Justification for Dose  
The planned dose of pembrolizumab  for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200  mg Q3W is the appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab  for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined 
below, this dose is justified by:  
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including ove rall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and  
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK 
[PBPK] analysis) at 200 m g Q3W . 
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings 
(treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all-comers ) and different treatment 
settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2  mg/kg 
Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and 
KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10  mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, 
KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -
response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 -fold 
difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fix ed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to 
the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationships were also 
observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and 
classical Hodgkin Lymph oma, confirming [ADDRESS_1246468], PK data in 
KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD -[ADDRESS_1246469] tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor 
penetration and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab  at 200 mg 
Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor.  
Finally, populat ion PK analysis of pembrolizumab , which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based  dosing, with considerable overlap in  the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by 
[CONTACT_131877], and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity 
 
Amendment  4 Page 31 of 102 Confidential  
  and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was sel ected for evalua tion 
across all pembrolizumab  protocols.  
 
1.3. Rationale for Combining Bavituximab with Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab was recently approved in the US and other countries for later line treatment of 
recurrent or advanced gastric or GEJ ad enocarcinoma based on the KEYNOTE 059 in which 
patients received 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) every 3  weeks until disease 
progression, Investigator or patient decision to withdraw, or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 259 
patients were enrolled;  most were male (198 [76.4%]) and white (200 [77.2%]). The median 
(range) age was 62 (24 -89) years. Objective response rate (ORR) was 11.6% (95%CI, 8.0% -
16.1%; 30 of 259 patients), with complete response (CR) in 2.3% (95%CI, 0.9% -5.0%; 6 of 259 
patients). Median (range) response duration was 8.4 (1.6+ to 17.3+) months. ORR and median 
(range) response duration were 15.5% (95%CI, 10.1% -22.4%; 23 of 148 patients) and 16.3 (1.6+ 
to 17.3+) months, and 6.4% (95%CI, 2.6% -12.8%; 7 of 109  patients) and 6.9 (2.4 to 7 .0+) 
months in patients with PD -L1–positive and PD -L1–negative tumors, respectively. Forty -six 
patients (17.8%) experienced 1 or more Grade 3 to 5 treatment -related adverse events (AEs). 
Based on these results, albeit positive for gastric cancer patients b ut still suboptimal in this 
aggressive disease, and pembrolizumab’s manageable safety profile, pembrolizumab will be a 
rationale combination for the treatment of gastric cancer.  In addition, KEYNOTE 061 
pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel , pembrolizumab did n ot significantly improve overall survival 
compared with paclitaxel as second -line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro -esophageal 
junction cancer with PD -L1 CPS of 1 or higher, although a better safety profile than paclitaxel 
was identified.   Median ove rall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2 –10·7) with 
pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6 –9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio  [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·66 –
1·03; one -sided p=0·0421). Median progression -free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4 –2·0) 
with pembrolizumab a nd 4·1 months (3·1 –4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03 –
1·57).  The ORR in these patients was 13.3% (95% CI, 8.2 -20.0), including a complete response 
(CR) rate of 1.4% and a partial response (PR) rate of 11.9%.  
Pembrolizumab  has received accelerated a pproval for the treatment of 3rd-line (plus) gastric/GEJ 
cancer. However, the ORR was 11.6% (95% CI, 8.0%, 16.1%) , implying that the majority of 
such patients fail to derive sufficient benefit from pembrolizumab monotherapy. In experimental 
mouse cancer mo dels, the bavituximab surrogate antibody used in combination with an anti -
PD-1/L1 antibody demonstrated enhanced tumor control. Bavituximab has also demonstrated a 
tolerable safety profile. Thus, little to no overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_621787].  The SUN RISE  
subgroup analysis indicated that patients who progressed on study treatment with bavituximab 
plus docetaxel and went onto a checkpoint inhibitor showed significantly improved OS. These 
data in combination with the preclinical data suggest that bavitux imab may restimulate T cells or 
render exhausted T  cells susceptible to checkpoint inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesize the 
addition of bavituximab to  pembrolizumab may enhance the antitumor immune response and 
eventually potentiate the activity of the antibody that is already targeting checkpoint inhibition, 
resulting in increased clinical benefit . 
Given the potential for this combination to enhance an titumor responses, it is being evaluated in 
2 populations  of advanced gastric or GEJ cancer patients: CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve patients that have 
 
Amendment  [ADDRESS_1246470] chemotherapy and are naïve to CPI [CONTACT_48831]; and CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890362] a confirmed PR or CR  then subsequently progressed following treatment with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890363].  
1.4. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Clinical trials in cancer are designed to assess new therapeutic strategies that may provide greater 
benefit, less toxicity or b oth than those of existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This trial is an initial attempt to 
understand the activity and safety profile of an approved agent for gastric/GEJ cancer when used 
in combination with an experimental agent that has shown promise in preclinical testi ng. 
However, subjects enrolled in clinical trials cannot expect to receive direct benefit from this 
proposed combination.  
Common AEs observed with anti P D-1/PD-L1 agents include diarrh ea/colitis, 
pneumonitis/ interstitial lung disease ( ILD), hepatitis and increases in transaminases, 
endocrinopathies (hypo - and hyper -thyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_280486] 1 diabetes mellitus), myocarditis, nephritis and increases 
in serum creatinine, dermatitis/rash and pruritus, neuromuscul ar toxicity such as myasthenia 
gravis and Guillain -Barré , and pancreatitis.  
Emerging safety data from bavituximab trials, indicates that the overall safety profile appears to 
be acceptable and consistent across studies. Combination therapy, particularly w ith docetaxel, 
did not substantially increase the AE risks. Sporadic infusion reactions have occurred, and it is 
not clear if corticosteroid premedication mitigates this risk. Refer to the bavituximab IB for 
additional details.  
No patients have been treate d with bavituximab and immune checkpoint inhibitors to date in 
Oncologie -sponsored trials.  Overall,  the potential additional benefits of the combination of 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab therapy are l ikely to outweigh the risk s.

a confirmed PR or CR then subsequently  progressed following treatment with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_890364]  (Group 2).   
Following a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10  patient safety run -in with bavituximab 
(3 mg/kg IV weekly) and pembrolizumab (200  mg IV every 3  weeks [Q3W]), additional patients 
will be recruited if the initial doses of the regimen are tolerable. Lower doses of bavituximab 
may be explored if the initial doses are not tolerable. Primary anti -tumor activity will be 
documented by [CONTACT_10670] -assessed objective response per RECIST 1.1. A pproximately   [ADDRESS_1246472] 3 patients will be evaluated for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the purpose of 
declaring the tentative RDE. The SRC will review data from these patie nts for DLTs at the end 
of the first [ADDRESS_1246473] 
1 cycle (3 weeks), the SRC will review data from these patients to determine the recommended 
dose for expansi on (RDE ). In case of DLTs, de -escalating doses of bavituximab in combination 
with pembrolizumab will be assessed  (see Section  5.6). After the DLT observation  period , 
expansion may proceed. The cumulative safety data from the initial 3 to 10 patients will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_12217], as well as subsequent safety data from the expansion population, as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_12217].   
Once the RDE of the com bination of bavituximab  and pembrolizumab  has been confirmed,  
additional patients , for a total of 80  across both groups , will be enrolled in the expansion and  
assessed for preliminary efficacy and pharmacodynamic  effects, as well as  safety and 
tolerability. Patients will be evaluated regularly for safety and efficacy according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table  8). 
Safety data  will be monitored throughout the course of the study including but not limited to; 
reviewing trends in safety data, laboratory analytes, and AEs including monitoring of adverse 
events of special interest (AESIs).  
The SRC, comprised of a medical monitor, statistician, the primary Investigator, and ad hoc SRC 
members, as needed, will be responsible for review of safety data. The SRC will convene 
regularly to review data to assess DLTs, and will convene at least yearly to review all safety 
data.  
Additional formal meetings for the SRC will occur

On days when both pembrolizumab and bavituximab are administered, pembrolizumab  will be 
administered first. After a window of at least [ADDRESS_1246499] 3 to 10 patients  (See 
Section  5.6).  
Patients enrolled in the safety run - in phase t he dose of bavituximab will be adjusted or 
interrupted as appropriate ; see Section  5.6 
Patients enrolled in the expansion phase (once RDE is de termined ) may not have a reduction in 
the dose of bavituximab.  The dose of bavituximab will be interrupted as appropriate, see Section 
5.7 and Table 6. 
No dose reductions of pembrolizumab  are permitt ed. Doses will be withheld as appropriate based 
on treatment modifications  defined in Table 7. 
 
Amendment  4 Page 44 of 102 Confidential  
  Administration of bavituximab and pembrolizumab will be performed in a setting with 
emergency medical facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical 
emergencies.  
If continued treatment with bavituximab is contraindicated due to AEs, the patient may continue 
treatment with pembrolizumab after consultation with the medical monitor . If continued 
treatment with pembrolizumab is contraind icated due to AEs, bavituximab administration may 
continue upon consultation with the medical monitor.  
5.2. Description of Bavituximab  
Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse) version derived from the original murine PS -targeting 
mAb 3G4. It is a genetically engineered immunoglobulin gamma 1 -kappa (IgG1)κ consisting of 
human IgG1κ constant regions linked by [CONTACT_890388] d (DNA) techniques 
to murine 3G4 var iable regions . 
Bavituximab is supplied as a sterile, preservative -free solution with a composition of 
bavituximab, in 10 mM acetate, pH 5.0. It is provided in borosilicate Type 1 glass vials and 
stored at 2°C to 8°C cont aining 120  mg/5mL (24mg/mL).  
Vials containing bavituximab drug product will be labeled according to national regulations for 
investigational products.  
5.3. Description of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a PD -1 blocking antibody . 
Pembrolizumab is supplied as 100  mg/4  mL (25 mg/mL) solution in a single -dose vial.  
Pembrolizumab vials should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242652]. Each  vial is intended for single use only. Vial contents should not be frozen or 
shaken and should be protect ed from direct sunlight.  
5.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Patients will be enrolled through an interactive web response system (IWRS).  
5.5. Preparation and Administration of Study Treatment  
5.5.1.  Bavituximab  
The Investigator or designee will be respo nsible for administering the appropriate dose of IV 
bavituximab to all patients. Bavituximab must be stored at 2°C to 8°C in its original package.   
Infusion reactions have occurred both with and without premedication, and it is unclear whether 
the type of co-administered chemotherapy or premedication with steroids and antihistamines 
impacts the frequency or severity of infusion reactions. Reports of infusion reactions will 
continue to be monitored. Prior to each bavituximab infusion, the patient should be premedicated 
with an antihistamine to decrease the  risk of an infusion reaction . A recommended regimen is 50 
mg diphenhydramine IV and 325 mg acetaminophen  orally ( PO) administered  1.5 hours ( ± 30 
minutes)  prior to infusion . See Section 6.2 for full recommendations for IRRs.  The regimen, 
dosages, and timing of the premedications can be adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 45 of 102 Confidential  
  The bavituximab d osage is calculated at 0.125 mL/kg body weight and diluted with normal 
saline to a volume of no less than 100 mL. The total dose will not be recalculated based on body 
weight unless there is a ≥ 10% change in weight from Day 1. Administer as  IV with in -line 
0.2 m filter over [ADDRESS_1246500] administration of pembrolizumab.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using a 30 -minute IV infusion.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes ( -5 min/+10 min). This is an open -
label study; study treatments will not be blinded.  
5.6. DLT Dose De -escalation/Modification  
Patients who complete the DLT  observation period  without a DLT will continue study treatment 
until a criterion for discontinuation is met ( Section  4.6). See Section  5.7 for information about 
administration of bavituximab dose modifications for patients who continue on study treatment 
after they complete the DLT observati on period.  
If the patient experiences a DLT during the DLT observation  period (see Secti on 3.1), dosing of 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab must be interrupted, as shown in Table  2. If a DLT resolves to 
Grade  1, dosing may be resumed at the next available reduced dose level  for bavituximab or 
the same dose for pembrolizumab  if agreed to b y the I nvestigator and the Sponsor’s  medical 
monitor . If the patient was on the lowest dose level of bavituximab when the DLT occurred, they 
must be discontinued from the study.  No intra -patient dose re-escalation is allowed  after a dose 
reduction .

A patient will be considered evaluable for DLTs if he or she (1) receives at least one dose of 
either study treatment  and completes the DLT observation period or (2) discontinues because of 
a DLT. A patient will be considered nonevaluable for DLTs if he or  she discontinues during the 
DLT observation period for a reason other than a DLT; patients who are not evaluable for DLTs 
will be replaced.  
The first [ADDRESS_1246501] 3 -week cycle:  
• If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, the RDE will be tentatively 
declared and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If 1of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 patients. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT, the RDE will be tentatively declared and 
further dose expansion will continue.  
• If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level 0, D ose Level -1 will be  
explored. If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Leve l -1, Dose 
Level -2 will be explored.  
• If  2 DLT(s ) occur  in up to 6 patients at Dose Level -2, further enrollment and dosing 
will be stopped until there is a full review of all avai lable data, including PK, by [CONTACT_12217].

Hematological toxicities as follows:  
o Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia:  
 
Amendment  4 Page 47 of 102 Confidential  
  ▪ Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration  
▪ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding  
o  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
▪ Grade 3 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 
degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38 degrees C 
(100.4 degre es F) for more than 1 hour  
▪ Grade 4 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 
degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38 degrees C 
(100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour, with life -threatening consequences 
and urgent in tervention indicated.  
o Grade 4 lymphocyte decreases lasting > 14 days  
 
Non-hematologic toxicities:  
o Any nonhematologic AE ≥Grade 3 in severity should be considered a DLT, with the 
following exceptions: Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 3 days; Grade [ADDRESS_1246503] of care; Grade [ADDRESS_1246504] of care.  
o Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic laboratory value if:  
▪ Clinically significant medical intervention is required to treat the subject, 
or 
▪ The abnormality leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  the abnormality persists for 
>1 week ; the abnormality results in a Drug -induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
▪ Exceptions: Clinically nonsig nificant, treatable, or reversible laboratory 
abnormalities including liver function tests, uric acid, etc.  
o Prolonged delay (>2  weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment -related toxicity.  
o Any treatment -related toxicity that causes the participant to di scontinue treatment during 
Cycle 1.  
o Missing >25% of planned d oses as a result of drug -related AE(s) during the first cycle.  
o Grade 5 toxicity.  
 
Isolated laboratory changes without associated clinical signs or symptoms may not be included 
in this definition.  These findings will be discussed and reviewed by [CONTACT_192666]’s medical monitor.  
Safety data in subsequent cycles will also be monitored on an ongoing basis to determine the 
cumulative incidence of late -onset toxicities.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 48 of 102 Confidential  
  Patients who experience a DLT, but in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_890355], may be 
offered continued treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab.  
Dosing will continue until criteria for study treatment discontinuation are met (unacceptable 
toxicity, PD, or withdrawal from the study) or up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1246505] be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
If appro priate, the Investigator may attribute each toxicity event to either bavituximab or 
pembrolizumab alone or in combination.  
Bavituximab Dose Reductions:  Once RDE derived from the DLT observation period is 
established, bavituximab doses may not be reduced.  
Bavituximab Dose Interruptions:  Treatment with bavituximab  may be interrupted for  up to 
21 days ( 1 cycle ) for toxicity or reasons unrelated to toxicity. If bavituximab  is withheld because 
of AEs for  21 days, then the patient will be discontinued from bavituximab . If, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from bavituximab  after a hold of 
 21 days, study drug may be restarted with the approval of the medical monitor.  
Recommendations for bavituximab  dose modifications for the management of specific AEs are 
presented in Section  6.3. 
Pembrolizumab Dose Reductions:  Dose reductions of pembrolizumab are not permitted.  
Pembrolizumab Dose Interruptions:  Treatment with pembrolizumab may be temporarily 
suspended for up to 12 we eks (3 cycles) beyond the last dose to allow for resolution of immune -
related AEs and tapering of corticosteroids.  
If a patient must be tapered off steroids used to treat AEs, pembrolizumab  may be with held for 
up to [ADDRESS_1246506] dose until stero ids are discontinued or reduced to prednisone dose  
equivalent  10 mg/day. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on an agreement 
between the Investigator and the medical monitor.  
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as sur gical procedures, may be allowed 
with medical monitor approval. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on agreement 
between the Investigator and the medical monitor.  
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
The study treatments will be administered to subjects at t he study site, under the supervision of 
the Investigator or designee in accordance with the protocol. Compliance with schedule infusions 
during study visits will be recorded on the CRF.  
5.9. Study Drug Accountability  
Study personnel will maintain accurate reco rds of study treatment shipments/receipts and 
administration. The site is responsible for the return or destruction of study treatment as required.  
 
Amendment  [ADDRESS_1246507] care for the 
treatment of symptoms and intercurrent illnesses. Medications to trea t concomitant diseases, e.g., 
diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are allowed. Patients 
may also receive therapy to mitigate side effects of the study medication as clinically indicated, 
as well as best supportive care as per institutional guidelines. This may include, e.g., 
anti-emetics, antidiarrheals, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, antipyretics, antihistamines, 
analgesics, antibiotics, and other medications intended to treat symptoms. The Investigator 
should instru ct the patient not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the study without prior consultation.   
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1246508] dose of study treatment should be recorded for 
SAEs and AESIs,  
5.11. Premedication for Infusion Reactions  
Routine premedication (e.g., diphenhydrami ne and acetaminophen) is required prior to infusion 
of bavituximab  (Section  5.5.1 ). Management of infusion -related reactions is described in 
Section  6.2. 
5.12. Corticosteroid Use  
Systemi c corticosteroids and tumor TNF -α inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab but may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician. If feasible, alternatives to corticoste roids should be 
considered. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for 
patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed. Megestrol 
administered as an appetite stimulant is acceptabl e while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
5.13. Hematopoietic Growth Factor and Blood Products  
Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic colony -stimulating factors for treatment 
of cytopenias should be administered according to institutional gui delines. Prophylactic use of 
these agents is not permitted.  
Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional 
guidelines.  
5.14. Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_890366]:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 
Amendment  4 Page 50 of 102 Confidential  
  • Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed 
at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1246509] dose of either pembrolizumab or 
bavituximab, whichever is later . Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typho id vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus 
vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live 
attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose o ther than to modulate symptoms from an AE 
that is suspected to have an immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Medical Monitor   
 
Note: Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma.  
 
Participants who, in the assessment of the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant ’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  
5.15. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1000 mg or 
≥5 times the indicat ed dose.    
For this study and overdose of bavituximab will be defined as any dose of 15mg/kg or ≥[ADDRESS_1246510] should be observed  closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
In the event of a known or suspected overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate 
hematology and clinical c hemistry and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary. Please 
also refer to Section  6.3 for guidelines on the management of potential study treatment -related 
toxicities.

Staff administering study drug are required to closely monitor all patients for possible systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (e .g., generalized exanthema, urticaria, paraesthesia, 
bronchoconstriction, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814])  during and after the first infusion of both study drugs.  
All systemic hypersensitivity manifestations will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page(s) 
and identified as being due to a hypersensitivity reaction.  
6.2. Management of Infusion Reactions – Bavituximab and 
Pembr olizumab  
Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or famotidine or another H2 receptor 
antagonist, as per standard practice.  
Precautions for anaphylaxis should be observed during both bavituximab and pembrolizumab 
administration. Vital signs should be measured as outlined in Section  7.1.10  during both 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab infusions. All supportive measures consistent with optimal 
patient care will be provided throughout the study acco rding to institution standards. Emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications should be readily available. Addi tional supportive 
measures should also be available and may include, but are not limited to, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],

Amendment 4 Page 56 of 102 Confidential  
 6.3. Bavituximab Expected or Potential Treatment -related Toxicities  
6.3.1.  Management of Thromboembolic Events  
Very high doses of bavituximab (100 mg/kg) in animals have been associated with evidence of 
minimal to mild thrombi (see bavituximab IB). Although it is known that tumor disease causes 
thromboembolic events, it is unknown whether treatment with bavituximab  in the doses utilized 
in this study poses an increased risk of thrombosis in humans. Therefore, the Investigator should 
maintain a high degree of vigilance for thrombotic events in study patients.  
Should thrombotic or thromboembolic events be suspected a t any time after the start of 
bavituximab treatment, whether on the basis of clinical signs or symptoms, abnormalities of 
platelets, aPTT, PT, or d -dimer results, or some combination of abnormalities and/or clinical 
findings, additional diagnostic and/or t herapeutic measures shoul d be undertaken without delay. 
Evaluation and management of such events should include Doppler examination and 
consideration of additional coagulation studies, imaging studies as appropriate, as well as 
consideration of treatment w ith low -molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) and/or transfusion of 
blood products as appropriate. Events that meet seriousness criteria should be repo rted to and 
discussed with the medical m onitor (as with any other SAEs).  
6.3.2.  Management of Other Adverse Events  
For dose modifications of bavituximab based on the occurrence of related AEs, see Table 6. 
Table 6: Bavituximab Dose Reductions for Treatment -Related Adverse Events  
Severity of 
Event  Dose Adjustment for Bavituximab  
Grade 1  Maintain bavituximab dose level and provide treatment to control symptoms, if 
applicable.  
Grade 2 
(tolerable)  Maintain bavituximab dose level and provide treatment to control symptoms, if 
applicable.  
Grade 2 
(intolerable)  Hold administration of bavituximab until the AE recovers to Grade 0 -1 or to 
pretreatment baseline AE level, whichever is more abnormal. Then, resume treatment.  
Grade 3  Hold admin istration of bavituximab until the AE recovers to Grade 0 -1 or to 
pretreatment baseline AE level, whichever is more abnormal.  
Grade 4  Discontinue  
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event.  
6.4.  Dose modification and toxicity management for immune -related 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs ) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab  treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based 
on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab , administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. 
 
Amendment 4 Page 57 of 102 Confidential  
 Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as 
part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab  and administer corticosteroids . Dose modification and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab  are provided in Table 7 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 4 Page 58 of 102 Confidential  
 Table  7: Management of Potential Pembrolizumab Toxicities  
General instructions:  
1. Severe and life -threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_13215]. Other immunosuppressive treatment shou ld 
begin if the irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].  
2. Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10  mg/day within [ADDRESS_1246512] pembrolizumab treatme nt.  
3. The corticosteroid ta per should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1246513] 4 weeks.  
4. If pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤  Grade  1 after corticosteroid taper.

7.1.17.  Pregnancy Test  
A woman of child bearing potent ial must have a negative  urine pregnancy test (e.g. within 72 
hours) prior to treatment.  If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum 
pregnancy test will be required.  
A pregnancy test must be repeated prior to dosing on Day 1 of every cycle and at the end of 
treatment visit. Pregnancy tests (serum and/or urine tests) should be repeated prior to dosing on 
Day [ADDRESS_1246536]'s status until the pregnancy has been c ompleted or terminated. The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if 
the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complic ation to the mother or newborn). The study Investigator will 
make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the 
conditi on of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male patient impregnates his female 
partner the  study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported 
to the Sponsor and followed as described above and in Section  8.5. 
7.2. Efficacy Assessments  
7.2.1.  Tumor Assessments  
Tumor response and progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_890394], 
Version 1.1 ( Appendix A ). Tumor assessments, including tumor markers, will be performed at 
the time points specified in Table  8. 
Tumor assessments should consist of clinical examination and appropriate imaging techniques 
(preferably CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with appropriate slice thickness per 
RECIST); other studies (MRI, X -ray, positron emission tomography [PET] scan, and ultrasound) 
may be performed if required. The same methods used to detect lesions at baseline are to be used 
to follow the same les ions throughout the clinical study. Investigators should perform scans of 
the anatomical sites that, in their judgment, are appropriate to assess based on each patient’s 
tumor status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Baseline Tumor Imaging  
To meet screening criteria, baseline tumor imagin g must be performed within [ADDRESS_1246537] dose of study 
treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tumor Imaging During  Trial  
Tumor imaging  will be conducted every 6 weeks (± 7 days) after initiation of treatment . until one 
of the following occurs:  
• disease progression  
• start of new anti -cancer  treatment  
• withdrawal of  consent  
• death  
• end of study  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 74 of 102 Confidential  
 Imaging should follow calendar days and not be delayed for any dose interruptions that may 
occur.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Timing of Repeat Imaging  
In patients with PD, a confirmatory scan should be performed at least [ADDRESS_1246538] indication of response, or at the next 
scheduled scan (6 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated.  
7.3. Immunogenicity Assessments  
7.3.1.  Antidrug Antibody Assessments  
Venous blood samples for the assessment of ADA levels will be drawn at the time points 
presented in Table  9 for bavituximab .  
Blood samples should be collected from the arm opposite from the investigational drug 
infusion, or from another site if collected within 24 hours of dosing.   
Residual ADA se rum samples used for ADA analysis may also be used for exploratory PK 
and/or pharmacodynamic analyses related to bavituximab treatment. This could include using 
leftover serum for exploratory, alternative PK assay development and analysis.  
ADA samples will  also be collected in the event of a clinically significant AE (such as infusion 
reaction/anaphylaxis) or if ADA is suspected, at which time those samples could be used to 
measure any relevant biomarkers, to understand the infusion reaction/adverse event b etter. After 
the primary clinical study report data cut -off date is reached, no additional ADA samples will be 
collected for the patients still on -going on the study.  
In the event of an IRR, blood samples will  be collected for both PK and ADA  at the follow ing 
time points: (i) as soon as possible after the onset of the IRR, (ii) at the resolution of the IRR, and 
(iii) 30 days (±3 days) following the IRR.  
Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on collection and processing of blood ADA 
samples.  
7.4. Phar macokinetic Assessments  
7.4.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Venous blood samples for the PK analysis of bavituximab  will be drawn at the time points 
presented in Table  9. 
Blood samples should be collected from the arm opposite from the investigational drug 
infusion, or from another site if collected within 24 hours of dosing.

 Residual PK serum samples used f or PK analysis may also be used for exploratory PK and/or PD 
analyses related to bavituximab treatment. This could include using leftover serum for 
exploratory, alternative PK assay development and analysis.  
In the event of an IRR, blood samples will  be co llected for both PK and ADA  at the following 
time points: (i) as soon as possible after the onset of the IRR, (ii) at the resolution of the IRR, and 
(iii) 30 days (±3 days) following the IRR.  
7.4.2.  Sample Analysis  
PK parameters will be determined for bavituximab  and pembrolizumab using non -
compartmental methods. Possible compartmental analysis and possible relationships between PK 
and pharmacodynamic variables, efficacy and/or selected toxicities will be explored, as 
appropriate.  
PK profiles to assess PK properti es of single -agent bavituximab will be collected from all 
enrolled patients.  
PK and ADA samples will also be collected in the event of a clinically significant AE (such as 
infusion reaction/anaphylaxis) or if ADA is suspected, at which time those samples could be 
used to measure any relevant biomarkers, to understand the infusion reaction/adverse event 
better. After the primary clinical study report data cut -off date is reached, no additional PK and 
ADA samples will be collected for the patients still on -going on the study.  
Central laboratories will be used for bioanalysis of study drug in human serum. Please refer to 
the Laboratory Manual for details on collection and processing of blood PK samples.  
7.5. Biomarker Assessments  
7.5.1.  Tumor Biopsies  
Patients must be con sented for a mandatory fresh tissue biopsy to be performed in order to enroll 
in this trial. The fresh tumor biopsy must be prior to initial treatment (C1D1). If available, 
archival samples will also be collected. An optional fresh tumor biopsy is requested at the EOT 
for patients who discontinue due to PD  
The baseline fresh tumor tissu e will be used to investigate potential response -predictive 
biomarkers. Those biomarkers include immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as RNA 
signatures .The signatures g enerated will  have the potential to inform patient stratification 
strateg ies for future trials. See the Laboratory Manual for sample processing details.   
Patient tissue samples will be assessed to determine 4 unique  RNA signatures as well as whole 
exome sequencing for exploratory  analysi s. The putative RNA signatures will be analyzed  to 
determine whether any  correlate to response to the combination treatment.  Classifying patients 
to these  four putative signatures will be derived from an  expanded gene set  from that described 
in Uhlik et at  2016  and a unique classif ier algorithm . These four classification signatures 
encompass   immunological and angiogenic characteristics  in the tumor stroma.  If patients with  a  
particular signature /s  are more responsive to this combination treatment, future studies  may be 
planned to select patients .   .

8. ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT  
8.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
Patients will be monitored for all AEs from the time the first dose of study  treatment  is 
administered through [ADDRESS_1246540], whether or not 
considered causally related to the study treatment.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow -up), and at an y dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following:  
Results in death  
It is immediately life -threatening  
It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_890370] a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
8.2. Clarifica tions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Death is an outcome of an SAE and not an SAE in itself. When death is an outcome, report the 
event(s) resulting in death as the SAE term (e.g., “pulmonary embolism”). If the cause of death is 
unknown, report “Death,  unknown cause” as the SAE term.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 77 of 102 Confidential  
 Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128451]/or convenience situations (e.g. 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) are excluded from SAE reporting. In addition, emergency room visits and admission 
under 23 -hour observation are exc luded from SAE reporting; however, such events should still 
be reported on the appropriate AE eCRF page.  
Events of progression of the patient’s underlying cancer as well as events clearly related to 
progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms o f progression) should not be reported 
as a SAE unless the outcome is fatal during the study or within the safety reporting period. If the 
event has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event 
causing the death mus t be recorded as an AE and as a SAE with CTC Grade 5 (fatal outcome) 
indicated. The AE/SAE term of Disease Progression should only be used when the Investigator 
is not able to distinguish the actual event that caused the death.  
Serious adverse events speci fically related to subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_890371] 30 -day Safety Follow -up period are excluded from SAE reporting, as are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_890372].  If it is not known whether the SAE is 
related to the subsequent anticancer therapy, the SAE should be reported.  
8.3. Assessment of Causality  
The relationship of each AE to the study treatment (bavituximab and pembrolizumab) 
administration will be assessed by [CONTACT_890395] (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, 
concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to receipt of 
the study medication and de -challenge or re -challenge according  to the following guidelines:  
YES (possible, probably or definitely related): there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
The e vent could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, environment or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug.  
The eve nt disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. In some 
situations, an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of the study 
drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_128450].  
NO (not related or  definitely not related): There is no reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
The event could be  reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factor or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.  
The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug .  
The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and 
it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re -administered.

Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 78 of 102 Confidential  
 8.4. Assessment of Severity  
The severity rating of an AE refers to its intensity. The sev erity of each AE will be categorized 
using the NCI CTCAE v5.0. For any term that is not specifically listed in the CTCAE scale, 
intensity should be assigned a grade of 1 through 5 using the following CTCAE guidelines:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
It is important to distinguish b etween serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_890396] r Section  8.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity may 
not be considered serious.  
8.5. Pregnancy or Drug Exposure during Pregnancy  
If a participant inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with bavituximab and /or 
pembrolizumab, the participant will be immedi ately discontinued from study treatment. The site 
will contact [CONTACT_717014]’s status until the 
pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to 
the Sponsor without  delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to 
the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain per mission to 
follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
Sponsor. All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, must be collected and reported 
from the time of treatment through [ADDRESS_1246541] be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge using the 
pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not r egarded as an AE or SAE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_712660] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 79 of 102 Confidential  
 All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abor tions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
8.6. Laboratory Abnormalities  
To the extent possible, all laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of the study will 
be included under a reported AE term describing a clinical syndrome (e.g., elevated BUN and 
creatinine in the setting of an AE of “renal failure”). In these c ases (e.g., an AE of renal failure), 
the laboratory abnormality itself (e.g., elevated creatinine) does not need to be recorded as an 
AE.  
If a laboratory abnormality cannot be reported as a clinical syndrome, AND if the laboratory 
abnormality results in a  therapeutic intervention (i.e., concomitant medication or therapy), is a 
DLT, or is judged by [CONTACT_885132], then the 
laboratory abnormality should be reported as an AE.  
Patients experiencing AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be assessed and 
appropriate evaluations performed until all parameters have returned to baseline levels, or are 
consistent with the patient’s then -current physical condition.   
8.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs, serious and nonserious, will be fully documented on the appropriate eCRF. For each 
AE, the Investigator must provide its duration (start and end dates or ongoing), intensity, 
assessment of causality and whether specific action or therapy was required.  
All AEs that occur from the signing of the ICF until the first dose of study treatment should be 
recorded on the AE eCRF page only if the event was related to a study procedure. All other 
AEs/findings prior to first dose of study treatment should be recorded as medical history on the 
applicable eCRF page. All AEs occurring from the first dose of study treatment until [ADDRESS_1246542] be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
All AEs meeting serious criter ia, from the time of treatment/ allocation through [ADDRESS_1246543] be reported to the Sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge. This should be done by [CONTACT_890397]. 
Detailed instructions for reporting SAEs are provided in a study manual.  
Invest igators must follow patients with AEs/SAEs until the event has resolved, the condition has 
stabilized, withdrawal of consent, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, the patient is lost 
to follow up or death OR until the [ADDRESS_1246544] to follow up, this should be captured accordingly within the AE eCRF and on 
the follow up SAE report.

 The Sponsor or designe e is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
applicable suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as individual notifications 
or through periodic line listings. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to not ify the IRB 
or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all 
unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical 
trial. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB  or IEC of these additional SAEs as required by 
[CONTACT_890398]/IRB.  
8.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are required to be reported by [CONTACT_890399] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  8.7 for 
reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this st udy are as follows:  
An overdose of pembrolizumab as defined as any dose of 1000 mg or  ≥5 times the indicated 
dose, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event 
of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
An overdose of bavituximab is define as  any dose of 15mg/kg or ≥[ADDRESS_1246545] of p rotocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may 
require an addi tional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The trial site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be made available. It may also be 
appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the setting of 
abnormaliti es of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to 
proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study 
investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director. However, abnormalities of liver blood 
tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not AESIs  for this trial.

Amendment [ADDRESS_1246546] not previously been exposed to an anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 agent.  Detail on all 
planned statistical analyses will be presented in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
The minimum efficacy analysis  will be conducted [ADDRESS_1246547].   Conducting an analysis at 
approxima tely 40 patients  will limit patients risks if the combination is not trending towards an 
added benefit, as defined by a response rate of 15% or greater (6/40)  further exploration will be 
warranted before further  enrollment to 80 patients  (details provided  in interim analysis section) .  
9.1. Sample Size  
 
The primary efficacy objective of this Phase 2 study is the evaluation of ORR of bavituximab in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. The sample 
size of 80 patients across both Group 1 and Group 2 was chosen to all ow minimal enrollment 
within each  of our four putative biomarker signatures to allow for exploration of differential 
responses , more information about the biomarkers can be found in section 7.5.1 . As noted above, 
an ORR of <15% will be regarded as futile as it will be unlikely to exceed the activity of 
pembrolizumab as a single agent in this study population.  
The following sample sizes apply:  
DLT Observation: up to 10 DLT -evaluable patients in total  
Phase 2: Minimum efficacy analysis: 40 total patients  across both Group 1 and Group 2 ; Full 
enrollment: 8 0 patients  
For the CPI -naïve patient population  assumptions , the historical ORR of pembrolizumab in the 
2nd-line setting  was approximately 15 % and an ORR of  the b avituximab -pembrolizumab 
combination was set to 30%. Approximately 40 patients are needed to show a statistical 
superiority  of bavituximab -pembrolizumab with 80% statistical power at one -sided type I error 
rate of α=0.10. In the 3rd-line setting  if the historical ORR is assumed as  6%, if the true ORR 
of Bavituximab -Pembrolizumab combination is 15%, then approximately 40 patients are needed 
to show a statistical superiority  of Bavituximab -Pembrolizumab with 74% statistical power at 
one-sided type I error rate of α=0.10. In addition, PDL1 status was able to impact outcome s in all 
lines of treatment with PDL1+ patients having better outcomes than negative.  By [CONTACT_890400] , safety and efficacy information will be available for 
a total of 80 patients, assuming >6 responders are observed by 40.  Enrollment will not be 
controlled for the number of patients in each line nor PD -L1 status (2nd vs. 3rd line, positive vs. 
negative), these numbers could vary for each patient type ( e.g. 2nd line PDL1+ vs. Third line 
PDL1 negative). Tables 9.1.[ADDRESS_1246548] line

Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Oncologie, Inc. or its designee.  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other  change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described

analyses of the data will be conduct ed as deemed appropriate.  
9.3.1.  Safety Analyses  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of bavituximab or pembrolizumab will be evaluated for 
safety and toxicity. Data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_890401].   
Safety analyses will include summaries of the fo llowing:

determined by [CONTACT_737]. Corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) will also be provided.  
For planning purposes, ORR of <1 5% will be regarded as futile as the combination will be 
unlikely to exceed t he activity of pembrolizumab as a single agent.  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the full analysis set, and per protocol analysis set, 
including predefined biomarker subgroups ( Section  9.3.2 ). 
Duration of Response (D oR), defined as the interval from the date measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the earliest date of disease progression, as 
determined by [CONTACT_890405] 1.1 or death due to any cause if occurring sooner than progression. Only subjects who 
achieve an initial response will be evaluated for DOR.  
Stable disease (SD) at 6 weeks wil l also be used to derive the clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
consisting of ORR and SD.  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) will be defined as the interval from the date of first dose of 
investigational agent until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by [CONTACT_890406]1.1 or death due to 
any cause if occurring sooner than progression.  
Overall survival (OS) defined as the interval from the date of first dose of investigational agent 
until the date of death.  
Presentations of efficacy will include patients e nrolled in Part 1 as well as patients treated at the 
recommended dose. Individual changes in tumor burden over time will be presented graphically

Amendment [ADDRESS_1246554] ensure that patients’ anonymity is strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. The Investigator must keep logs on screened 
and enrolled patients. In addition, the Investig ator must have a list where the identity of all 
treated patients can be found.  
The Investigator agrees that all information received from the Sponsor, including, but not limited 
to, the IB, this protocol, eCRFs, the protocol -specified treatment, and any ot her study 
information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the Sponsor during the conduct of the 
study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees 
or agents directly involved in the conduct of the stud y or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior 
written consent from the Sponsor. The Investigator further agrees to take all reasonable 
precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_890410].  The Investigator shall be under additional obligations 
related to non -disclosure confidential information and the handling of intellectual property as set 
forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
10.3. Patient Informed Consent  
All information about the clinical study, including the patient information and the ICF, is 
prepared and used for the protection of the human rights of the patient according to ICH GCP 
guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations.  
It is the responsibility of the In vestigator to obtain signed ICFs from each patient participating in 
this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of 
the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures.  
The ICF, prepared by [CONTACT_890411], must be approved 
along with the study protocol by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and be acceptable to the Sponsor . 
The patient must be provided with the patient information and ICF consistent with the study 
protocol version used and approved by [CONTACT_56335]. The ICF must be in a language fully 
comprehensible to the prospective patient. Patients (and/or relatives, guardians, or legal 
representatives, if necessary) must be given sufficient time and opportunity to inquire about t he 
details of the study and to discuss and decide on their participation in the study with the 
Investigator concerned. The patient and the person explaining about the study and with whom 
they discuss the informed consent will sign and date the ICF. A copy of the signed ICF will be 
retained by [CONTACT_890412].  
10.4. Study Monitoring  
On behalf of the Sponsor, a clinical research organization monitor will contact [CONTACT_890413] s completed. The monitor will 
also perform a study closure visit.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Investigator must ensure provision of sufficient 
time, reasonable space, and adequate qualified personnel for the monitoring visits. The visits ar e 
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

Amendment 4 Page 89 of 102 Confidential  
 for the purpose of verifying adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, consistency, 
and accuracy of data entered on the eCRF and other documents.  
The Investigator will make all source data (i.e., the various study records, the eCRFs, laborato ry 
test reports, other  records, drug accountability forms, and other pertinent data) available for the 
monitor and allow access to them throughout the entire study period. Monitoring is done by 
[CONTACT_591047] (i.e., source data 
verification). It is the monitor’s responsibility to verify the adherence to the study protocol and 
the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data recorded on the eCRFs.  
By [CONTACT_890414] y, the Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to 
ensure that any problems detected in the course of the monitoring visits are resolved. Contact 
[CONTACT_427495]. Representatives from the 
Spons or may also contact [CONTACT_427496].  
10.5. Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  
The data will be collected using an electronic data capture (EDC) system. Sites will receive 
training on the EDC system. All users will be  supplied with unique login credentials.  
Before study start, the Investigator will prepare a list showing the signature [CONTACT_890426]. This “study center 
personnel and delegation l ist” must be kept current throughout the study.  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must be completed, reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Investigator within a reasonable time period (< 2 weeks) after data 
collection. This also applies to records for those patients who fail to complete the study. If a 
patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patient is 
withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made 
to clearly document the outcome.  
Full information regarding EDC and completing eCRFs is included in a study manual. All 
questions or comments related to electronic capture should be directed to the assigned monitor.  
10.6. Study Termination and Site Closure  
Both the Sponsor and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures. In terminating the study, 
the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection 
of the patients’ interests.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or administrative 
reasons. When feasible, a 30 -day written notification will be given.  
The entire study will be stopped if:  
The protocol -specified treatment is considered too toxic to continue the study;  
Evidence has emerged that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_427471](s), makes the 
continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical;  
The sta ted objectives of the study are achieved;  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment [ADDRESS_1246555] be documented. In terminating the study, the Investigator will ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests.  
10.7. Modification of the Study Protocol  
Protocol amendments,  except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients, must 
be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor. Agreement from the Investigator must be 
obtained for all protocol amendments and amendments to the informed consent document. The  
IEC/IRB must be informed of all amendments and give approval before their implementation. 
The Sponsor will submit any study protocol amendments to the concerned regulatory authorities 
for approval and keep the Investigator(s) updated as detailed in the IC H GCP guidelines.  
10.8. Retention of Study Documents  
The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the IB, the protocol 
and any amendments, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IRB and the 
Sponsor, and other study -related documents.  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) 
the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study -specific source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed a nd dated ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], query responses, and 
detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities 
and the Sponsor or its designees.  
The Investigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of [ADDRESS_1246556] 5 years after the investigation is discontinued. 
However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_40006](s) or if needed by [CONTACT_1034]. In addition, the Investigator must make 
provisio n for the patients’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
No data should be destroyed without the agreement of the Sponsor. Should the Investigator wish 
to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the Sp onsor must 
be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location. The Sponsor will 
inform the Investigator, in writing, when the study -related records are no longer needed.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be ar chived in accordance with the 
archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site.  
10.9. Clinical Study Report  
A clinical study report will be prepared under the responsibility and supervision of the Sponsor 
and signed by a Sponsor representative, th ereby [CONTACT_171373], 
results, and conclusions of the clinical study report.

 10.10.  Study Publication  
The conditions regulating dissemination of the information derived from this study are described 
in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
10.11.  Quality Assurance Audits  
Clinical centers may be audited by [CONTACT_1034]’s Quality Unit (QU) qualified auditor or designee 
as required per approved schedule. The purpose of an audit, which is independent of and separate 
from routine monitoring or Quality Uni t (QU) functions, is to evaluate study conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, ICH GCPs, and the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator and the Sponsor may also be subject to an inspection 
by [CONTACT_8415], European reg ulatory authorities, or other applicable regulatory authorities at any time.  
The auditor and regulatory authorities will require authority from the Investigator to have direct 
access to the patients’ medical records. It is important that the Investigator(s ) and their staff 
cooperate with the auditor or regulatory authorities during this audit or inspection.

 12 APPENDICES  
Appendix A: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version  1.[ADDRESS_1246566] guidelines (version 1.1) are described in Eisenhauer (2009) and at 
http://www.eortc.be/Recist/Default.htm. A short summary is given below.  
Measurable Disease:  
Tumor lesions: measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately meas ured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with the following:  
• A minimum size of [ADDRESS_1246567] scan (CT scan thickness no greater than 5 mm);  
• A minimum size of 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable);  
• A minimum size of [ADDRESS_1246568] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes: to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1246569] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be not greater than 5 mm). At bas eline and in follow up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as we ll as truly nonmeasurable 
lesions, are considered nonmeasurable disease. Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin and lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_87415].  
Bone Lesions  
Bone lesions, cystic lesion, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment. Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can 
be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as 
measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability de scribed 
above.  
Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 96 of 102 Confidential  
 Cystic Lesions  
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered 
as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) because they are, by [CONTACT_154020], 
simple cysts.  
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferre d as target lesions.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
Tumor lesions situated in a previous irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional 
therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesion.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1246570] ed on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and report ed as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by [CONTACT_890416].  
Non-target Lesions  
RECIST criteria require unequivocal quantification of the changes in tumor size for adequate 
interpretation of the sum of target lesions. Consequently, when the boundaries of the primary are 
difficult to delineate, this tumor should not be considered a target lesion.  
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
The same method of assessment and the same techniqu e should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_16688] a treatmen t.

Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 97 of 102 Confidential  
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <  [ADDRESS_1246571] a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD.  
Stable Disease  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, 
the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  
Stable Disease/Incomplete 
Response  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non -target lesions.  
  
If tumor markers are initially above the institutional ULN, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered a complete responder.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
Time Point Response  
A response assessment will occur at the protocol -specified time points. The tables below provide 
a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable and non -measurable disease (non -target disease only).

a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria 
relative to baseline, makes this disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response 
would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when 
subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time 
point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best r esponse is PR.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”. This is a 
reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374], but is NOT objective PD. Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is al so considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change 
the assigned time point response, which is most likely to occur in the case of PD; e.g., if only 2 
of 3 baseline target lesions are assessed and result in a > 20% increase in the sum, then the 
patient would be assessed as a PD regardless of the missing lesion.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
witho ut objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
symptomatic deterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  
In some circumstances, it may be  difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy) before confirming the CR status.  
Confirmatory  Measurement/Duration of Response  
Confirmation  
Radiographic tumor assessments are required. If an initial CR or PR is noted, confirmatory scans 
must be performed at least [ADDRESS_1246572] once after study entry at a minimum interval of no less than 4 weeks.

Amendment 4 Page 100 of 102 Confidential  
 Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first  date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

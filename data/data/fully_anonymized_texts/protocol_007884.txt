PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:   [INVESTIGATOR_192796], M.D. , FAAEM, FACEP  
  1.0 Background and Rationale  
Oral mucositis is a debilitating sequela of treatment in the cancer patient, one that affects oral 
intake, hygiene, treatment and quality of life.  Oral mucositis has been reported in 97% - 
100% of patients with head and neck cancer receiving fractionated radiation therapy, in 80% 
of patients receiving chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation and 50% of patients 
receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma or sol id tumors (1).  
Mucositis is caused by [CONTACT_192809][INVESTIGATOR_192797].  It is the product of a series of 
biological processes initiated by [CONTACT_192810] (in the fo rm of radiation and chemotherapy 
in the cancer population) causing the early release of an inflammatory cascade, which 
subsequently activates apoptosis.  Clinically, patients manifest early with erythema and 
discoloration, leading to ulceration in latter s tages with pain symptoms ranging from slight 
discomfort to allodynia preventing oral intake.  In chemotherapy patients, symptoms first 
begin 3 -5 days after initiation of treatment, with ulceration approximately two days later and 
resolution 2 weeks later.  In radiation patients with mucositis, escalation of doses beyond 
20Gy typi[INVESTIGATOR_192798] (erythema) and progressively worsen to ulceration 
as dose increases beyond 30Gy (2). These ulcerations may last up to 4 weeks after 
completion of tr eatment (3).  
In the cancer population, significant morbidity is associate with mucositis.  Infection rates 
double in patients with mucositis during chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma (4), 
and ulceration leading to systemic infection is a risk in the se immunocompromised patients. 
A reduction of next dose chemotherapy is twice as common after cycles where patients had 
mucositis, as well as a 50% longer duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  The estimated cost for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192799] $6,277, versus 
$3,893 without (5).  
Mucositis decreases oral intake secondary to pain, hastening the need for supplemental 
nutrition via TPN or gastronomy tube and thus increases the risk of malnourishment and 
infection.  
12/19/[ADDRESS_228922] been 
investigated; however, insufficient evidence prevents most from being recommended and 
used regularly (6, 7).   
Methylene blue (MB) has been described in the pain literature as an intradiscal injectate for 
discogenic low back pain (8), as a treatment o f oral lichen planus (9) and as a diagnostic tool 
for oral cancer and precancerous lesions (10).  A case series evaluated the intradermal 
injection of methylene blue for pruritis ani, and symptoms improved in 96% of the patients 
and resolved in 65% (11).  It is postulated that by [CONTACT_192811], methylene blue may be useful in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (12).   
Anecdotal experience of the use of MB in patients with acute and chronic pain associated to 
oral mucositis has shown very positive outcomes regarding symptom control and decreasing 
the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_192800].  The primary complaint of all patients has been oral 
pain compromising different structures including tongue and in ner lips, sublingual and oral 
mucosa. The majority had expressed difficulty wi th feeding se condary to pain. They also had 
reported weight loss as a result of decreased oral intak e. Multiple patients had been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192801], others had been seen a s a requested consultations 
in the Emergency Department, an d others had been outpatient clinic visits. They all had 
expressed suboptimal pain control despi[INVESTIGATOR_192802]. P atients had been 
instructed to take a mouth full of 0.025%, 0.05% or 0.1% MB diluted in normal saline. The 
mixture is to be kept in the painful site for five minutes then to gargle and spit.  The same 
steps had been to be reeated every 6 hours. The majority of patients had experience d a 
sustained decrease of more than 50% in their pain scores at 3 weeks follow up. The morphine 
equivalent daily dose on  those that apply significantly reduced or eliminated. The overall  
patient satisfaction has been very high and the treatment has been well -tolerated, with 
sustain ed analgesia. No alteration of taste or motor function reported; no sen sory changes or 
anesth esia of the healthy mucosa has been found.  About [ADDRESS_228923] been treated with 
MB w ith concentrations of 0.025%, 0.05% or 0.1%, and we haven’t observed any adverse 
event at any of concentrations.  
 
We propose a randomized controlled trial comparing 4 intervention arms, including 3 
concentrations of Methylene Blue (MB) oral rinse combined with conventional therapy and 
conventional therapy which includes mouth rinses with local anesthet ics and cleaning 
solutions and systemic analgesics given orally or intravenously. In patients with intractable 
pain associated with oral mucositis defined as the presence of pain or oral dysfunction 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_192803]. To the best of our knowledg e, no study of this kind has been 
performed.

     2.0 Study Objective  
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of MB in reducing the severity of mucositis -
related pain, measured by [CONTACT_192812] (NRS), in cancer patients who underwent or 
are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Patients will be randomized to one of 4 
intervention arms, including conventional therapy and conventional therapy plus MB with 
one of 3 concentrations (0.025%, 0.05% or 0.1%) oral rinse to swi sh and spit.  
2.1 Primary Outcomes:  
Oral mucositis pain reduction (measured by [CONTACT_192813] (NRS); from 0, 
representing no pain, to 10, representing the worst possible pain) from baseline to [ADDRESS_228924] 
treatment. The pain scale is includ ed in the Modified Harris mucositis -related pain 
assessment tool.  
2.2 Secondary Outcomes:  
1. Oral functioning (eat, swallow, talk: unable=2, difficulty=1, able=0. Oral functioning score 
is the total score of 3 categories, ranged 0 -6).  Scale is included in  the Modified Harris 
mucositis -related pain assessment tool. Measurements are obtained at day 0, 1, 2, and 7.  
2.  Presence of absence of pain and pain score measured by [CONTACT_192814] 0, 1, 2, and 7.  
3. Number of MB doses needed to achieve pain relief at 0, [ADDRESS_228925] MB 
administration  
4. Morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) used for oral mucositis pain at 2, and [ADDRESS_228926] mechanism of action of MB has not 
been established, it is known to metabolize to a colorless form, leukomethylene blue, forming 
a reversible oxidation -reduction system, which explains its utility in methemoglobinemia. It 
is also known to be neurolytic w hen injected intradermally (11), and as a result of this 
observation, it has been used intradiscally for the treatment of discogenic pain (8) and into 
pelvic fracture sites for associated pain (13). These properties may help explain the anti -
12/19/[ADDRESS_228927], but it has been prepared 
by [CONTACT_192815] 1%, 5 -10 mL of com mercially available 10mg/mL solution with 100 -200 mL 
of water (9, 14). Based on our anecdotal experience, at MD Anderson same dilution has been 
used in more than 80 patients with pain associated to oral mucositis with no adverse events.  
Patients be instru cted to take one mouth full (6 – 10 mL of the solution to be held at the 
painful sites for five minutes then to swish and spit. The same steps to be repeated every 6 
hours (the total mix of 100 mL will provide up to 6 -10 uses).  
3.2 Adverse Effects, Precau tions, and Contraindications  
If used systemically, MB administered intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) in large doses may 
cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, profuse sweating, dyspnea, 
mental confusion, and irritation at the infusion  site (only seen with IV). The most common 
side effects of oral administration are adverse gastrointestinal effects and dysuria. MB causes 
a blue -green discoloration to saliva, urine, feces, and skin. The skin stains may be removed 
by [CONTACT_192816]. MB is contraindicated in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to MB, women who are or may become pregnant (MB is a teratogen), 
patients with known or suspected glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, 
and those who are taking s erotonergic drugs. It should be used cautiously in patients with 
severe renal impairment. Subcutaneous, intrathecal, and intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_192804]. Long -term use of MB is also associated with anemia. Therefore, 
monitoring of com plete blood counts is advised (15). These adverse events have been studied 
in both large IV and PO administration and appear to be much more limited with oral 
administration (as above). In our study, the use of [ADDRESS_228928] will be done in females in child -bearing condition (non -
menopausal). This study requires women of child bearing potential to use contraception or 
abstinence from sex  during the treatment period and for [ADDRESS_228929] will be obtained within 48 hours of staring the study.    
3.3 Drug Interactions  
MB is an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), in full doses; serious central nervous 
system reactions (serotonin syndrome) have been reported with patients who are concurrently 
taking serotonin -modulating medications (16). Discontinuing the serotonergic medication 
prior to administration of MB can reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome. If given 
systemically, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends most serotonergic drugs 
to be discontinued for at least two weeks prior to MB treatment in non -emergency situations 
12/19/2019
(16). Most of the reported cases of serotonin syndrome occurred when M B was used as a 
diagnostic agent in the operative setting, in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRI) or selective serotonin -norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRI). Other 
drug interactions are similar to those with other drugs hav ing MAO -inhibiting properties, 
e.g., anticholinergics, alpha/beta -agonists, and tricyclic anti -depressants (15). These 
interactions have been studied in the IV route of administration and are likely more limited 
with oral administration of small dosages as  proposed in this study.  
3.4 Preparations, Stability, and Storage  
MB is a thiazine dye that is soluble in water and forms a deep blue solution. It is available as 
a 1%, 10 mg/mL solution that should be stored at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) but may be 
expo sed to temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_228930] four intervention arms - MB 0.025 arm, 
MB 0.05 arm, MB 0.1 arm and a control arm. MB arm will receive one of 0.025%, 0.05% or 
0.1% MB solution in addition to conventional therapy (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1% MB 
solution for MB 0.025, MB 0.05, and MB 0.1 arm, respectively), and the control arm will 
receive conventional therapy  for 2 days, then will receive one of 3 so lutions which will be 
randomly selected if they would like to receive MB solution .  
 
5.0 Study Population  
 
Patients will be randomized as described below.  Neither the physician nor the patient will be 
involved in the randomization process. Physician, patient, study coordinator and data 
collectors will be blinded to the concen tration of the medication used.  
5.1 Sample Size  
For the primary outcome (Oral mucositis pain reduction from baseline to 7 days  after 
entering the study), we expect the m ean pain reduction of 0, 2, 2.5, and [ADDRESS_228931] ANOVA study, sample 
sizes of 15, 15, 15, and 15 are obtained from the 4 arms whose means are to be compared. 
The total sample of 60  subjects achieves 83% power to detect differences among the means 
versus the alternative of equal means using an F test with a 0.[ADDRESS_228932] deviation which is 1.14 (means 
of 0, 2, 2.5, and 3 for control, MB 0.025, MB 0.05, and MB 0.1 arms, respectively). The 
common standard deviation within a group is assumed to be 2.5.  
 
 
12/19/[ADDRESS_228933] agree to use of contraception or abstinence from sex during the treatment 
period and for 30 days after patients' last dose  of study MB.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_228934] (if available).  
6. Patients with known history of G6PD deficiency.  
7. Patients undergoing any other experimental intervention for oral mucositis.  
8. Patients who have no pain or impairment in oral function, patients who are not 
symptomatic.  
9. Patients  with head and neck cancer.  
10. Patients on serotonergic drugs.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_228935] awal from the study at any time.  If the patient no longer wishes to 
participate, they will receive conventional care.  
5.5 Conventional Therapy Criteria  
 
The conventional therapy includes oral rinses and systemic therapy (oral, transdermal and 
intravenous analgesic.  No response to conventional therapy means using other treatments 
and still symptomatic.  
 
     6.0 Methods  
 
6.1 Patient enrollment and registr ation  
Patients will be recruited for the study through multiple care sites at MD Anderson Cancer 
Center. Patients arriving at the MDACC Emergency Center with complaints consistent with 
mucositis will be screened for eligibility for enrollment in the study . Other patients treated at 
12/19/[ADDRESS_228936] the informed consent (IC) 
explained to them by a research team member.  The study will use the electron ic informed 
consent in EPIC to consent each participant , however, in the event that an electron ic consent 
cannot be obtained, then the patient will sign, date, and put the time on the IC hard copy.  
The consenter will also sign, date and put time on the IC.   A copy of the IC will be mad e and 
given to the pati ent for their records.  The original copy will be sent to Health Informat ion 
Management for storage and another copy will be locked in secure location by [CONTACT_1961].   
6.3 Patient randomization and assignment to treatment arm  
The study will accrue up to 60 patients with a 1:1:1:1 ratio to include 4 intervention arms. 
Those include conventional therapy, conventional therapy + MB 0.025%, conventional 
therapy + MB 0.05%, and conventional therapy + MB 0.1%; each group will include [ADDRESS_228937] stratified randomization by [CONTACT_192817] (baseline NRS 0 -5 vs. 6 -
10) and oral functioning score (0 -3 vs. 4 -6). The primary endpoint is the reduction in pain 
score from baseline to [ADDRESS_228938] an option to cross over to one 
of 3 MB arms, which they will be randomly allocated to, after completing 2 day pain 
measurements.  
 
6.4 Administration of pharmacological agent  
Preparation and randomization of the study medication (MB) for each patient will be 
performed by a compound research pharmacy. The study medication will be available to the 
patient through the dispensing pharmacy at MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Patients will 
receive instructions on how to take study medications.  
12/19/[ADDRESS_228939] precision of the MB because patients’ mouth size are variable, usually takes 6 -10mL 
per rinse.   Those on the MB arm will be instructed to take one mouth full (6 – [ADDRESS_228940] 2 -3 days only if used regularly) of the solution to be held at 
the painful sites for five minutes then to swish and spit . The same steps to be repeated every 
6 hours (the total mix of 100 mL will provide up  to 6-10 uses). If needed, patients will be 
given the solution to complete the treatment at home. Patients are instructed to use it every [ADDRESS_228941] subsequent follow -up interviews  at 1, 2, 7 days  with repeat assessment of the 
Modified Harris mucosi tis-related pain assessment tool. Furthermore, on Baseline, Day 0, 
Day 1, Day 2, Day 7 and Day 30, adverse event will be assessed, and this maybe by 
[CONTACT_192818] -to-face in the clinic.  The patient’s medication use will also be assessed at 
follow -up, including morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) and other reported analgesics 
used for the treatment of their mucositis -related pain. Lastly, the research team will 
investigate if any patient reported any side effects from the treatment.  
All completed dat a will be stored electronically in the MD Anderson REDCap system, in a 
locked file, on password -protected computers. Only research team members will access the 
files.  Subject registration will be entered into CORe database.  
6.51 Modified Harris mucositis -related pain assessment tool (MHMPAT)  
Among the numerous scales utilized for assessment of mucositis, most do not incorporate 
pain. The original Harris mucositis -related pain assessment   tool was developed to fill the 
void of inadequate assessment of muco sitis associated pain in existing assessment tools (18). 
The scale includes the NRS, which is one of the most widely utilized pain assessment 
measures in research and clinical care (17). Its use is related to its ease of administration. It 
uses an 11 -point  scale for measuring pain intensity ([ADDRESS_228942] possible pain). It is also beneficial for the current study, as it can 
accurately assess pain during telephone interview (17).  
For this study we developed the Modifie d Harris mucositis -related pain assessment tool 
which has not yet been validated but incorporates aspects of many validated tools. It has been 
adapted with permission from the creator, Debra J. Harris, RN, MSN, and OCN.  
     7.0 Data Analysis  
 
12/19/[ADDRESS_228943] ANOVA study, sample sizes of 15, 15, 15, and 15 are obtained from the 4 
groups whose means are to be compared. The total sample of 60 subjects achieves 83% 
power to detect differences amo ng the means versus the alternative of equal means using an 
F test with a 0.[ADDRESS_228944] deviation which is 1.14 (means of 0, 2, 2.5, and 3 for conventional therapy, 
conventi onal therapy + MB 0.025, conventional therapy + MB 0.05, and conventional 
therapy + MB 0.1, respectively). The common standard deviation within a group is assumed 
to be 2.5.  We will conduct stratified randomization by [CONTACT_192817] (baseline NRS 0 -5 vs. 
6-10) and oral functioning score (0 -3 vs. 4 -6).  
7.2 Primary Outcome Analysis  
Descriptive statistics (means (SDs) or counts (percent)) will be used to summarize 
demographics, disease, and treatment variables according to the intervention arm. Potential 
differences between the arms based on demographic, disease, and treatment variables will be 
explored using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and ANOVA or 
Kruskal -Wallis test for continuous variables, depending upon the nature of the variables 
being investigated.  
Our primary endpoint is the reduction in pain scores assessed within the NRS component of 
the Modified Harris mucositis -related pain assessment tool from baseline to 7 days which is 
considered the end of the study. The me an change in scores will be compared among 4 arms, 
utilizing ANOVA. If there are significant differences between intervention arms in some 
covariates, a linear regression model will be utilized to compare arms by [CONTACT_192819].  The mean pain scores over time will be compared among study arms, 
utilizing linear mixed effects models. Covariates that showed significant differences among 
study arms will be adjusted in the linear mixed effects models. Two separate analyses, 
intention to treat and per protocol, will be conducted for primary analysis. Tukey’s pairwise 
comparison will be conducted if a significant difference is observed among [ADDRESS_228945] 7 day 
NRS will be replaced.  
Patients who were initially enrolled in conventional arm and crossed over to one of MB arms 
will be included in assigned MB arm.  
 
 
 
12/19/[ADDRESS_228946] (eat, swallow, talk: unable=2, 
difficulty=1, able=0. Oral functioning score is the total score of 3 categories, ranged 0 -6).  
We will also de termine if there are any differences between arms in presence or absence of 
pain, pain scores, overall analgesic use (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_192805]), and the incidence of untoward side effects utilizing 
ANOVA, Kruskal -Wallist, Chi -square test, or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. In addition, 
to obtain a measure of compliance with MB treatment, we will compare the dropout rate 
within the MB group to the dropout rate in the conventional therapy group utili zing Chi -
square test or Fisher’s exact test.  
The Investigator is responsible for completing an efficacy/safety summary report and 
submitting it to the IND office Medical Monitor for review.  This should be submitted after 
the first [ADDRESS_228947] of drug 
usage.  Duration of pain relief  corresponding to each drug use will be collected during the 
interview, in person for Day 0 and via telephone for Day 1, Day 2, and Day 7 .  The number 
of MB doses needed (during the last [ADDRESS_228948] follow -up) in order to achieve 
pain relief will be collected on Day 1, Day 2, and  Day 7.  
7.[ADDRESS_228949] -
protected MD Anderson REDCap system and accessed only by [CONTACT_92278]. Data will be entered electronically and analyzed.  
     8.0 Adverse Events Reporting 
8.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
All patients will be monitored through weekly in person or by [CONTACT_192820]. In addition, 
patients will be given a contact [CONTACT_192821] -related que stions.  
Research staff will collect toxicity, symptoms, and adherence to study medication schedule 
weekly. Treatment -related toxicities (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4) will be monitored by [CONTACT_16133].  
12/19/2019
Grade 1 and Gr ade 2 AEs will not be reported. AEs that are Grade 3 and above that meet the 
definition for serious adverse events (SAEs) in Section 8.2 will be considered to be serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and will be reported. SAEs that are unexpected and related (defi nitely, 
probably, or possibly related) to MB use will be reported promptly according to institutional 
policies (see below). SAEs that are either expected or unexpected but unrelated (unrelated or 
unlikely to be related) to MB use will be summarized on the continuing review report. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_192806].  
If in the course of assessing symptoms, the patient reports severe symptoms, the data 
collector will determine if the patient's healthcare provider is aware that the patient is 
experiencing this severe symptom. If the healthcare provider is not aware, the data collector 
will determine if the patient intends to inform the healthcare provider  of the symptom and its 
severity within [ADDRESS_228950] of adverse events known to be associated with primary treatment is listed in section 3.2 
of the protocol.

EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  8    Confidentiality  
This is a private do cument and the property of the Centre for Ocular Research & Education . It 
is therefore confidential to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_94619] D irector (or her/his 
designate) of the Centre for Ocular Research & Education . Release o f information from this 
document is governed by [CONTACT_94629] . 
 
Disclaimer  
This study will be conducted for research purposes only.  
 
  
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_104780] lenses (MF) provide correction for vision at near as well as in  the distance. This 
segment of the contact [CONTACT_94630]. 
CooperVision is interested in comparing  the performance of  two of their own multifocal  disposable 
contact [CONTACT_13276], clariti 1day multifocal  2-ADD design (CONTROL lens ) and MyDay  3-ADD design 
multifocal  (TEST lens ). Achieving acceptable vision  and comfort when transitioning from one lens 
to another is important  for successful multifocal lens wear  and will be the focus of this study . 
3 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of the study is to adapt existing multifocal soft lens wearers to a CONTROL lens 
(clariti 1day MF 2 -ADD design) for at least [ADDRESS_104781]  lens (MyDay  MF 3 -ADD design), with a review after [ADDRESS_104782] to c omfort, vision and overall performance using ratings, agreement 
questions and preferences.  
The prim ary outcome variable  for this study is: 
•After 2 weeks of study lens wear ( in office ):
o0-[ADDRESS_104783] 
period of 2 weeks (14 -21 days) and TEST for the second period of 2 weeks (14 -21 days).  
Both CLs will be fit according to fit guides, and the  prescriptions will be optimized after an initial 
wear period of [ADDRESS_104784] their subjective lens -wear experience remotely on three different 
days  (days 1,  6 and 13), using paper diaries . 
5.1.[ADDRESS_104785] 
lenses will not be over -labeled, instead the brand name [CONTACT_94668].   
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1  NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted  at several  optometry practice sites in the [LOCATION_002] . The site 
details wi ll be included in the study report.  
5.2.2  INVESTIGATOR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94620]:  
• Is a l icensed eye care professional  with at least two years of contact [CONTACT_94631].  
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  11 • Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by [CONTACT_94632].  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site.  
• Has i n-office email and document scanning capabilities.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co -operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for prompt lens 
ordering and timely data review, query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION  
5.3.1  SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size  was calculated using data of ‘lens comfort at insertion ’ collected in a previous 
study involving  clariti 1day (CooperVision, data on file).  In that study a 0 -100 scale was used, not 
the 0 -10 used in this study. A difference of 7 on that 0 -100 scale was targeted, which would be 
0.7 on the 0 -10 scale.  However , in this study, a  0-10 scale will be used with 0.5 steps,  and analysis 
is anticipated to be non -parametric , which relies on medians not means, thus a difference between 
medians can only be as low as 0.5. 
Using the 0 -100 scale data described above  for ‘lens comfort at insertion’ , the data show ed a 
standard deviation of paired differences of 16.5.  With an alpha 0.[ADDRESS_104786] , 
and power of 84%, a minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_104787] about research 
has been provided . Recruitment efforts will use an email script and  there will also be general 
advertising materials ( e.g., posters, social media posts) . All recruitment materials will be  
approved by [CONTACT_94633]. All ini tial individual -targeted recruitment activities, such as 
any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by [CONTACT_94634]. This separation will reduce any undue influence of the 
optome trist-patient relationship. This process will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator 
to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_94635].  
5.3.3  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  

EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_104788] 42 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter ; 
3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years;  
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week;  
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule ; 
6. Habitual ly wears  multifocal soft contact [CONTACT_94636], for the past 3 months minimum;  (NOTE: 
the habitual c ontact lens type is restricted such that no more than one third are to be the 
Clariti [ADDRESS_104789] are to be MyDay multifocal  (this 
includes  their equivalent private label brand name) ; 
7. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75D C in each eye ; 
8. Is presby[CONTACT_94637] a reading addition of at least +0.75D  and no more than 
+2.50D in each eye ; 
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen (or +0.20 
logMAR ) which participants also deem to be ‘acceptable’, with the available study lens 
parameters  (powers +4.00 to -6.00DS) (see Table 1).  
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Has any known active * ocular disease  and/or infection  that contraindicates contact [CONTACT_94638] ; 
3. Has a  systemic condition  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94621]  a study 
outcome variable ;  
4. Is using any systemic or topi[INVESTIGATOR_94622] a study outcome variable ; 
5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein  used in the study;  
6. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating  or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;  
7. Has und ergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild  (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  14 Age ≥42 years is an inclusion criterion  because presby[CONTACT_94639] < 42 
years and, if present, may not be due solely to presby[CONTACT_94640] w ider 
population.   
Pregnant and  lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety  concerns but 
due to fluctuations in refractive error , accommodation  and/ or visual acuity that  occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes. It has further b een shown  that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye  symptoms. Such fluctuations could affect data, thereby

allow participants to be fit with the lens powers available for this study ie. sphere +4.00D to -
6.00D , in 0.25D steps , in all ADD powers .  
The sites will use these inventories to both  fit and dispense the CONTROL and the TEST 
lenses . If additional inventory or participant lenses are required, this will be managed by [CONTACT_94642].  
CORE will provide all sites with the study pap erwork. This  will include participant informed 
consent letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the participant 
dispensing logs. CORE  will train site personnel to complete the forms correctly and provide 
continued support to  answer queries on correct form completion.  
 
  
  
  
5.4.[ADDRESS_104791] lenses are  cleared by [CONTACT_94643] (FDA) and are commercially available in the U.S. The lenses will be worn as daily 
wear and daily disposable, as per their approval s.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e.  subjective ratings) will be monitored by [CONTACT_94648]. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be  reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 
major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Instituti onal Review Board  
within 7 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board  guidelines) .  
[ADDRESS_104797] lens material 
used in this study is commercially available for daily wear. This study will investigate participants 
wearing the lenses in a  daily wear modality (NOT extended wear) , similar to  the average wearing 
time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
This study is considered to be a non -significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines , because the 
study contact [CONTACT_94649] (1) do  not represent a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of the subject, (2) are not implants, (3) are not used to 
support or sustain human life, and (4) are not of substant ial importance in diagnosing, curing, 
mitigating or treating disease or otherwise prevents impairment of human health .  
The CONTROL and TEST  lens types will be worn as per their approved use; on a daily wear , 
daily disposable  basis. When contact [CONTACT_94650] a daily wear basis there is a small risk 
of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. When contact [CONTACT_94651], there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared 
with wearing conta ct lenses on a daily wear basis.  

EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  28 Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact [CONTACT_94652]  (eg: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_94653], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and 
variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal 
edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are very infrequent, the 
possibility d oes exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by [ADDRESS_104798] lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although 
rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein.  
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_94654]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be conducted . 
Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of th e study to reduce the occurrence of adverse 
or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from their investigator regarding 
early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical  occurrence in a participant, whether it is 
considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non -significant 
adverse events, ’ as defined below , Table 4.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal 
infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal inject ion, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  31 for each adverse  event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed 
for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by [CONTACT_78269] 
(bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further 
change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate heal th care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE E VENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or po ssibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
The site’s Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94623] 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life-threatening  events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non -Significant Ad verse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study 
coordinator  and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the 
occurrence.  Each site’s Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94624]  (by [CONTACT_6791], mail/delivery, phone, or email).  
 
   
   
   
   
 
 
  
   
   
   
   
 
Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report.  

EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  32 9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed US$25 per hour for their active involvement in the 
study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a 
participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. 
The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion cr iteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condi tion and on the j udgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse  event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptom s they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non -compliance:  The parti cipant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect 
to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_94626] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94627]).  
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  33 • Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_94655] a final exit visit, and if the investigator has made a reason able effort to 
contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation  will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator  except where the participant is lost to 
follow -up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669] .   
When a participant ch ooses to discontinue f rom the study they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation 
form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFU NCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended . Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the spon sor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. The ORE would also be notified within 24 hours of any device 
malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as  possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as 
comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as com plaints or device malfunctions.  
[ADDRESS_104799] scheduled protocol visit a  study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a 
letter of appreciation .    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving 
feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation . 
Participant remuneration  will be  US$200 for completing the study.  This is calculated at $ 35 per 
in office scheduled visit (5) and $25 for completing of  at home ratings . The in -office visits are in 
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  34 total 7 hours per participant for scheduled visits , though if additional  fitting time is required , this 
may increase . Additional payment $25 per hour wil l be remunerated to participants if additional 
visits are required.  
12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_94657].  Data analysis will be 
conducted using Statistica 10, Statsoft or other suitable software .  Descriptive statistics will be 
provided on demographic data  (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table [ADDRESS_104800] will be used to analyze the results for the  count data of subjective 
preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “neither agree or 
disagree” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be 
equally likely to choose either.  
Any statistically significant differences of ratings will be judged as a clinically relevant difference 
if that difference is 0.7 or greater for parametric analyses (based on mean  data), or 1.0 or 
greater for non -parametric analyses ( based on median data). A p-value of 5% o r lower, (p ≤0.05), 
will be considered to be statistically significant.  
Because of the phenomenon of binocular summation, binocular visual acuity w ill be analysed, 
not right eye data. For other variables, such as lens fit, the right eye data will be reported and 
compared.  
Where appropriate, data may be presented as both mean and as counts by ‘bucket’ groups.  
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  35 12.2  DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be collected and written on paper forms which will be provided to each site by [CONTACT_94648]. 
Each site will be instructed to send completed study forms to CORE using a secure file share 
system operated by [CONTACT_94658] 128bit (or 256bit)  SSL 
encryption . The sites will receive their individual accounts and passwords.   
The site will endeavour to send the scanned forms to CORE on the same day as the study 
visit or a maximum  of two days after the study visit.  
Within CORE,  data will be entered into a REDCap database developed and tested specifically 
for this study and accessible only to trained, authorised users. A data management plan will be 
developed to describe the data handling in more detail, including the personnel i nvolved.  
Data from this study will be retained by [CONTACT_94659] a minimum of [ADDRESS_104801] been recorded in the source 
documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_94648]’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINI NG 
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by [CONTACT_94660] , study procedures, informed consent procedures , as well  as training for Good Clinical 
Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide to CooperVision a scan of their 
curriculum vitae, license to practice optometry , training on Good Clinical practice,  and evidence 
of professional indemnity insurance  as part of CooperVision’s investigator qualification 
procedure .  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enr olled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations , adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly status repor ts to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by [CONTACT_94648], the sponsor , or sponsor’s 
designate,  throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Princip al 
Investigator at each site . In addition study records may be inspected by [CONTACT_456], the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board , and by [CONTACT_94661], namely Health Canada and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA); howev er, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing 
identifiable  personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_94662]. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by [CONTACT_94663] a sec ond person will visually compare 
the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
EX-MKTG -140 GALAXY  Protocol v1. 1 08Aug2022  37 days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 
5 working days of rece ipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_94664]  [INVESTIGATOR_94628]’s Lead Coordinator . All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_94665]’s  Director and/or Head of Clinical 
Research .

Page 1 PROBLEM STATMENT  
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor s (AChE -I) comprise t he major class of drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_275653], the re is controversy about the usefulness of these medications1,2. Concern s have 
been modest respon se rates  of treated versus placebo groups, relatively small effect sizes with respect to 
efficacy , drug costs, and clinical relevance  of the effects . One p roblem is that measures of efficacy used may 
not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a true drug effe ct3. Another problem is that changes noted after [ADDRESS_336654] assessment s of 
treatment outcome , could provide necessary insight into early efficacy of cholinergic tr eatment . We are 
conducting a preliminary study that supports our hypotheses testing the value of such attentional measures .  
The r ational e for using attentional measures is as follows:  (1) Attentional deficit s are recognized as a 
critical cognitive change in the earliest phases of AD ; (2) Attentional function, particularly tasks that tax 
available attentional capacity, is mediated by [CONTACT_275659] ; and (3) Acetylcholine is depleted in AD. 
However, the link between attention  and cholinergic depletio n in AD has not been fully explored, particularly 
with regard to response to cholinergic treatment . Surprisingly, attentional measures have not been included in 
the evaluation of AChE -I in the treatment of AD . We propose that a ttentional performance could serve as a 
highly sensitive outcome measure and a marker of response.  
STUDY AIMS AND HYPOTH ESES : 
1.To determine that higher -order attentional measures are sensitive to the effect of cholinergic change early  in
the course of treatment. We predict that perfor mance on attentional tasks will improve in AChE -I treated
patients compared to placebo controls after  7±[ADDRESS_336655] that the relationships among attention and cognitive
domain measures will change with treatment .
3.To determine whether performance at 7±[ADDRESS_336656]  response at 6 months :
3a. Patient response to AChE -I may be influence d by [CONTACT_275660] , or influence performance in
one or more cognitive domains . The aim is to determine which cognitive domain or demographic
characteristic best predicts treatment  response at six months. It is hypothesized that attention and m emory
(both mediated by [CONTACT_275661]) will best predict treatment response seen at six months.
3b. To determine whether an attentional change seen in patients early in the treatment course  predicts drug
response. It is hypothesized that change i n attention measured between baseline and 7±[ADDRESS_336657] will facilitate and inform our decisions about individual patient s 
undergoing pharmacological treatment. The application of these goals can apply to current AChE -I treatment as 
well as other treatments, such as those now involving combined cholinergic and glutama nergic agents.

Background and significance  
Attention and Alzheimer’s disease ( AD): The vulnerability of higher -order attention tasks in AD occurs in 
tasks such as selective attention4,5, and covert orienting6. Attentional deficits are documented in patients with 
prodromal AD who later develop the dise ase7, suggesting potential sensitivity of attention to disease onset. 
Mechanisms of attention are mediated via anterior executive control (required in conjunctive search8,9 and  
inhibitory control9) and via posterior disengagement10. The deficits in AD may be explained by [CONTACT_275662], or by a disconnection11 between the frontal and posterior attentional network s12 that  
disrupt the feedback system13.  
Acetylcholine and attention : A primary modulator of attention is acetylcholin e (ACh)14. Decreased ACh 
impairs attentional function in animals and humans including vigilance in rat15, covert orienting in primate16 and 
AD17, and complex attention in human pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409]18. ACh functions in a dose related manner, with increased task 
load of h igher background noise19 correlating with increased ACh release20. Cholinergic antagonists (e.g., 
scopolamine ) slow  reaction time (RT) and increase omission errors on visual search21,22, and increase omission 
and commission errors on signal detection23. Higher scopolamine doses slow RT in covert orienting in primates 
involving inferoparietal regions16.  
AD, attention and cholinesterase inhibitors : The relationship between attention and acetylcholine has not 
been well demonstrated in the assessment of AChE -I. Efficacy studies of donepezil24, galantamine25 or 
rivastigmine26 show modest effect sizes3 ranging from 1.8 –4.[ADDRESS_336658] regions29 that mediate direc ted attention. In summary, if attentional 
function is intrinsically linked to the level of cholinergic activity, it should used be an outcome measure of 
AChE -I treatment in AD to improv e treatment sensitivity.  
Methods  
I. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   
The proposed stud y is a 6 -month longitudinal design assess ing 40 newly diagnosed patients with AD as they 
start donepezil treatment  (see Figure 1) . The brief first arm (between T1 -T2) is randomized, double -blind, 
placebo controlled, after which all patients are treated ope n label. Visual attentional measures will be contrasted 
with global and cognitive domain measures. The baseline assessment is before treatment, T1, after which 
patients will be randomized into treatment and placebo groups . The T2 assessment occurs at 7 ±1 w eeks, after 
appro ximately 2 weeks of optimum treatment dose  in the treated group.  After the T2 assessment, t he treatment 
assignment will be unblinded, and placebo patients will begin treatment.  In order to include all participants in 
the final 6 month anal yses, participants initially treated with placebo will undergo an additional testing ( T2-
pA). At T3 all participants will have been treated for a full 6 month period .  
Drug choice and placebo:  Donepezil has been chosen for this protocol: We have preliminar y data with this 
agent; effective dose can be achieved early  in the course of treatment; it requires only once -daily 
administration; it requires single dose titration step from 5mg to max. dose of 10 mg. Randomization, 
preparation, and treatment with drug vs. placebo will be managed by [CONTACT_275663][INVESTIGATOR_275654] d ouble -blind placebo design:  Our p reliminary data (see below) is based on a repeated measures, 
longitudinal design without a placebo group. Inclusion of the placebo arm , T1-T2, would allow us improve our  
ability to test our hypotheses and determine the validity of an early treatment effect. We are cognizant of the

short delay of treatment for 50% of the participants; however, given the current controversy of t he efficacy of  
the drug1, we feel that being able to answer whether effects are detectable early, and whether those effects occur 
in responders, outweighs this minimal risk.  
INSTRUMENTS – MEASURES  
Experimental t asks (‡) were developed and/or programmed i n our laboratory. Task s election was based on: 
avoidance of floor or ceiling effects  assuring that patients with a range from mild to moderate AD can perform 
tasks; availability of alternate forms. P atients with no computer  experience are allowed and sufficient practice . 
Global measures : 1.ADAS-Cog (70-point scale); standard pharmacological rating tool ; 2. DRS  (Dementia Rating 
Scale)  total score and subtest  profiles ; 3. MMSE  (MiniMental Status examination); standard cognitive measure; 
4. CDR  (Clinical Demen tia Rating  scale ) including  standard and sum of box-score s to measure function . 
Cognitive Domains  
Attention  Focused and sustained attention:  A. Digits Forward  - WAIS III;  
B. ‡ Simple Reaction Time: RT to a single stimulus presented on a computer screen at ra ndomized intervals.  
C. ‡Visual Selective Attention : This is a computer version of a paper and pencil cancellation t ask, developed by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_275655]. Participants indicate presence or absence of a target among an array of distractors, 
which vary in density (number of items on screen ). Outcome measures include RT, hits , and false alarms . 
D. ‡Visual covert orienting:  Posner’s paradigm assesses covert orienting by [CONTACT_275664] a target 
preceded by a valid or an invalid cue . Outcome measure  is RT to target detection. In valid conditions, the target 
(i.e., ‘X’)  follows a cue in the ipsilateral visual field and in invalid condition s the contralateral field. Valid and 
invalid tasks are equally frequent (50%) and presented random ly. On 80% of the tri als, the cue to target interval 
(Stimulus Onset Asynchrony, SOA) is 150 msec ; the remaining  20% of the  trials are catch trials (SOA= 700 
msec ), which are included in the task, but excluded from analyses.  
E. ‡Choice Reaction Time:  a computer task examines RT o n a same/different choice response of two stimuli. 
The task demonstrates participants’ ability to discriminate shapes in a non -search condition.  
Memory : 1) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test  (measures of total learning, delay, intrusions, serial position).  
Lang uage : 1) Fluency: Letter cue (FAS); 2) Semantic cue; 3) [LOCATION_011]  Naming  Test-15 item (multiple forms) . 
Visuospatial function  1) Clock drawing; 2) Benton - Visual Form Discrimination30. 
Frontal -executive function : 1) D-KEFS Trails31 (measures of set -switch; s peed; contrast)  
Psychiatric Status : 1) Geriatric Depression Scale32 (GDS);  2) Neuropsychiatric inventory33. 
II. PARTICIPANTS :  Recruitment : Patients will be recruited through the Memory and Cognitive Disorders 
Center at Winthrop -University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_16884]  a 12 year established network of geriatricians, psychiatrists 
and neurologists throughout the Long Island, NY area who refer patients for diagnostic determination. 
Additional resources will allow the current average of 5-8 weekly referrals to be screened.

Page 1  Patient characteristics : This is a particularly difficult patient population to access, as many patients entering 
primary research centers have already initiated medication prescribed by [CONTACT_275665].  A major 
strength of th is proposal is access t o patients who are being newly diagnosed, and are undergoing de novo 
treatment with AChE -I. Neuropsychological tests used for diagnosis will not overlap with tests used as study 
dependent measures. Inclusion criteria : Study inclusion criteria include sat isfying NINDS -ADRDA criteria for 
AD, with ruled out vascular, mixed or other etiology of dementia. Diagnosis will be reached by [CONTACT_275666] (NSF), geriatrics (JB and LO), neurology (LSH), and neuroradiology (LSH, OO). Stable 
concurrent thera py with non -cholinesterase inhibitors will be allowed including NSAIDS, Vitamin E, or SSRI 
antidepressants. Patients must be able to perform attention tasks (MMSE >15) and have corrected vision. If a 
patient meets criteria both patient and kin provide writ ten consent Exclusion criteria : any prior AChE -I use, or 
concurrent anticholinergic treatment (e.g., incontinence medication) or use of memantine.  
Sample size : 50 patients will be recruited . Power analysis tests the null hypothesis that an average yearly 
decline in unmedicated AD patients is 3 MMSE points. With criterion for significance (alpha) of 0.05, and a [ADDRESS_336659], a proposed sample size of 40 (drug = 20; placebo = 20) , will have power exceeding 80% to yield a 
statistically significant result on C overt orienting task (most stringent attention task). Current attrition rate of 
22% requires recruitment of additional 10 participants.  
IRB: A preliminary longitudinal study using only treated AD patients has been approved by [CONTACT_275667][INVESTIGATOR_39049] (#01 -06-05-03) through 5/1/05. All patients and a responsible kin (or legal guardian) will 
give written consent  in compliance with risk to vulnerable populations.  IRB a pplication for the proposed design 
(using treated and placebo groups ) is pending . All data will be managed in compliance with HIPAA and IRB 
regulations , including secure electronic transfer via encrypted SSL protocols.   
III. PROCEDURES  Neuropsychological and computer testing will be administered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_275656] -University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l, lasting 2½ hours with appropriate breaks. Patients will be paid $ 30 for each 
session at that visit. Compliance for multiple visits will be insured via phone and mail contacts with families.  
IV. DATA MANAGEMENT  Raw data and analyses will be managed with SPSS and S -PLUS. The heterogeneity of 
AD can result in wide variation, particularly on RT data . Data will be reviewed and undergo necessary 
transformation to insure normal distribution of error variance, reduced skew, and minimized effects of extreme 
values. When indicated, RT data will be treated in a two step procedure omitting individual trials of extreme 
outliers ( -3 < z > +3) and a logarithmic (log10) transformation . All analyses will be evaluated with and without 
transformations and be reported i f discre pancies arise.  
PRELIMINARY DATA 
Preliminary data from our laboratory support our hypothesis that attentional measures can detect effects of 
AChE -I treatment . 1) Effect of load: We first confirmed8 that higher load levels in selective cancellation 
affected 18 AD patients more than 18 age -matched controls, with higher commission errors and longer RTs as 
load increased. At high-load, the task was very sensitive in capturing attentional deficits even in high 
functioning patients. 2) Effect of drug: In subsequen t analys es34, subgroups of these patients (on donepezil, 
n=8; off donepezil, n=9) were matched on demographic variables of age, duration, or severity of illness . The 
ability to discriminate targets from distractors , d-prime  p=.058, and the likelihood of en dorsing a target 
correctly was better in treated compared to non-treated patients , beta p=.029 . Treated patients were better at 
discriminating targets  and rejecting non-salient stimuli correctly, implicating an attentional benefit of treatment.  
3) Prelimin ary results of lo ngitudinal study : 13 patients with AD (C DR 0.5 -1.0) treated with open -label 
donepezil have been evaluated on all tests pretreatment ( T1) and after a mean  of 7.75 weeks  (T2). Global 
measures fail to capture significant T1–T2 change (ADAS -Cog, DRS, CDR, CDR -Box score : p>.10) . However, 
our experimental attentional tasks are detecting change. On selective attention, accuracy of target detection is 
faster (p<.001)  at low density, while maintain ing accuracy ( p=.19) . On the more dense arrays, there is a small 
but significant drop in accuracy , but slower detection (p<.01) suggesting a speed -accuracy tradeoff. On covert 
orienting , validity effect changed over time ( p=.031; effect size=0.33). The degree of load interacts with

Page [ADDRESS_336660] that attentional functions (e.g., search, speed/accuracy tradeoff, disengagement) 
detect early cholinergic effects , while global measures do not. The study with increase d power and inclusion of 
a placebo group will permit more general conclusions.  
ANAL YSES  
Aim [ADDRESS_336661] of cholinergic change 
early  in the course of treatment, Ancovas  on Group ( treated, placebo) will be performed with measures of 
attention (e.g., simple RT, Covert ori enting, Choice RT and Selective Attention) at T2 as the dependent 
variables and measures of attention at T1 as covariates . 
Aim 2a . To determine the relative sensitivity of attention compared with other measures. The effect size of each 
attentional measure will be compared with the effect sizes of global and cognitive domain measures35.   
Aim 2b . To determine whether change of certain measures covary, change data from placebo and drug groups 
will be pooled, and Pearson correlations of the reliable change36 among measures T2 -T3 will be compared. To 
determine whether the relationships among measures differ between drug and placebo groups, measures at T2 
will be correlated with one another within each group, and individual differences multidimensional scaling wi ll 
be applied to each of the two matrices.  
Aim 3a.  To document which cognitive domains or demographic variables best account for treatment response at 
six months, a hierarchical, multiple regression will be performed. Reliable change scores of each cognit ive 
domain (T2 –drug group; T2-pA–placebo group) will be predictor variables, and ADAS -cog T3 -T1 difference 
scores serve as the dependent variable. DRS will be entered first into the regression to control for disease 
severity, followed by [CONTACT_275668], with frontal -executive, visuo -spatial and language variables 
following. The incremental -F tests will evaluate the unique variances contributed by [CONTACT_275669] -cog without the contribution of the remaining domains. We will conduct a dditio nal analyses using a 
dichotomous responder/non -responder dependent variable (defined by >4 point improvement on ADAS -Cog).  
Aim3b.  To determine whether the change on the experimental attentional measures seen in patients early in the 
treatment course predic ts treatment change at 6 months, a hierarchical regression analyses will be conducted 
with attention score change T2 -T1 (T2 for drug group; T2 -pA for placebo group) used as the predictor 
variables, and ADAS -cog score (difference T3 -T1)  used as the depende nt variable. Group membership 
(drug/placebo), DRS, and demographic variables will be entered into the regression to control for age, 
education, initial dementia severity.

Although the majority of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are receiving acetylcho linesterase inhibitor 
treatment, there are no objective measures to determine whether the drug is working. This has frustrated 
families and physicians, and resulted in more scrutiny about the medications’ efficacy, cost, and clinical utility. 
These medicat ions still remain part of standard treatment regimens, but we are remiss by [CONTACT_275673][INVESTIGATOR_275657], and by [CONTACT_275674].  
 
Surprisingly, important measures that should be used to assess cholinergic change are lacking: the measures 
omitted involve attention. Attention is very sensitive to level s of acetylcholine . Research shows that 
acetylcholine directly mediates attention, and that attention is one of the earliest cognitive change s that occurs 
in the course of the disease, even during the pre -clinical, MCI phase. Animal models show that attention 
improves with increased acetylcholine, and deteriorates when acetylcholine levels are lowered. Yet, the link 
between attention and acetyl choline depletion in AD has never been fully explored, especially with regard to 
response to cholinergic treatment.  To date, no study has investigated how acetylcholinesterase inhibitors affect 
attentional function in AD. We have preliminary data that now shows that measures of attention do change even 
after a few weeks of treatment, where traditional global measures do not show significant change. We predict 
that attentional measures will be excellent, more sensitive measures of response.  
 
We propose a [ADDRESS_336667] testing occurs after 6 months, to determine the degree of response as 
measured by [CONTACT_275675] (ADAS -Cog), and to determine whether the change at  the second 
testing can predict the performance at [ADDRESS_336668] 1) that measures of attention are more sensitive than s tandard global measures; 2) that 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment affects attentional function early in the course of treatment; 3) that 
attentional measures can serve as important outcome measures to differentiate and predict good versus poor 
responders.  
 
This project provides tools to help us decide whether cholinergic treatment is effective. Our findings are 
generalizable and apply to other cholinergic treatments, and treatments now involving combined cholinergic 
and glutamanergic agents.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor s (AChE -I) comprise t he major class of drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), but controversy about the usefulness of these medications1,[ADDRESS_336670] sizes.  
Surprisingly, attention has never been incl uded in the assessment of AChE -I drugs. The r ationale for 
using attentional measures is obvious: (1)  Attentional deficit s are recognized as a critical cognitive change in 
the earliest phases of AD ; (2) Attentional function is directly mediated by [CONTACT_275676], and responds

depletion in AD has not been fully explored, especially  with regard to response to cholinergic treatment. We 
propose that attentional performance could serve as a highly sensitive outcome measure and a marker of 
response  
The proposed 6 -month longitudinal study examines at tentional, cognitive and behavioral performance in 
40 de novo AD patients undergoing donepezil treatment. New visual attentional measures will be contrasted 
with global cognitive measures and cognitive domain scores on three occasions (T1: pre -treatment; T 2: 7 weeks 
(plus or minus 1 week); T3: post 6 months treatment). The T1 -to-T2 arm of the design includes a double -blind 
placebo control period, after which all patients undergo open -label treatment. The assessment at [ADDRESS_336671] response.  
We present our preliminary data that support our rationale. Attentional measures are showing significant 
change after 7 weeks, while g lobal measures are not.  
The proposed study predicts: 1) that measures of attention are more sensitive than standard global 
measures; 2) that AChE -I treatment affects attentional function early in the course of treatment. It is critical to 
determine efficac y before disease progresses.  
Knowledge gained from this project will facilitate and inform our decisions about individual patients 
undergoing pharmacological treatment. The application of these goals can apply to current AChE -I treatment as 
well as other t reatments, such as those now involving combined cholinergic and glutamanergic agents.

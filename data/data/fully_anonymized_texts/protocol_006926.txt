Pi[INVESTIGATOR_716099] / XL184 in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer to 
explore the changes in bone and tumor imaging related pathways 
 
 Primary Objective:  
  
To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_716100], physiology, and magnitude of changes 
in tumor imaging, and pharmacodynamic markers with XL184 treatment in metastatic 
castrate resistant prostate cancer.   
.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) To estimate the progression- free survival (PFS) achieved  with XL184 in metastatic 
CRPC patients. 2) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the therapy, a nd the toxicities associated. 
3) To evaluate OS in chemothera py naïve metastatic CRPC patients 
  
Study Treatment 
XL184 at a starting dose of [ADDRESS_975421] methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scan, sodium 18F-
fluoride (18F-fluoride) PET bone scan, and FMAU {[2’-18F]-1-(2’-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 7D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine} PET scan. Pretherapy bone biopsy and correlative 
pharmacodynamic sample collection (B lood and urine).  The FMAU and 18F-fluoride 
PET scans will be done under separately approved imaging protocols. 
Start XL184, monitor for toxicity every [ADDRESS_975422] therapy repeat 
18F-flouride PET / FMAU PET scans, bone scans and 
tumor biopsy. The timing of the scan maybe further changed depending on the optimal 
time to detect changes as determined from the first [ADDRESS_975423] 
and 99Tc-MDP bone scan will be done  to evaluate tumor status.  
The week 4 timepoint scan will be discontinue d for all present and future patients.    
We will also review each patients baseline scan to see if there is disease detectable.  If no 
readily visible cancer is found then the 2nd s can with FMAU PET will be eliminated for 
that patient.  So far of the 6 patients imaging, only patient 1 had no easily visible tumor on the baseline scan. Longer follow up of th e patients has revealed that it remains a 
challenge to determine if the patients are co ntinuing to derive clin ical benefit. The PSA 
level is frequently discordant with res ponse. Hence we will obtain an additional 
18F-
flouride PET scan and a FMAU scan (if the patient had <3 FMAU scans prior) at week 32 (+/- 10 weeks) for the patients continuing on study therapy at that timepoint. For the 
patients who discontinue therapy, prior to the 32 weeks timepoint,, the scan/s will be done at the time of treatment discontinuation (+ /- 2 weeks).  This timepoint was chosen to 
capture the maximum number of patients curren tly on the study for this scan, and since 
conventional CT scan and bone scan is al so conducted at the same timepoint for 
comparison. 
 
 
  Tissue, Blood and Urine collection:   
 Tumor tissue biopsy will be obtained within [ADDRESS_975424] 5 patients and will be correlated with 
the imaging schedule.  For instance if no change s are seen at a particul ar time point in all

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 85 patients, then that timepoint maybe ex cluded. Blood sample collection will be 
performed using Vacutainer CPT tubes. This  method will generate serum samples for the 
analysis of biochemical mark ers, and mononuclear cells for future analyses of DNA and 
RNA.  All isolated samples will be stored at -80° C until use. 
 
Clinical Monitoring and testing 
 Patients will be monitored for response (m easurable disease, PSA levels, clinical 
response and bone scans) progre ssion, survival and toxicity.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 131 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Hypothesis:  
XL-[ADDRESS_975429] activ ity. We hypothesize that 
XL-184 uniquely targets the cross talk be tween cMet and VEGFR axis, downstream 
cathepsin K driven pathways and novel recet or tyrosine kinases (such as DDR-[ADDRESS_975430]-2) in bone tumor microenvironment. He nce we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_716102]-184 
therapy. 
1.2 Study Objectives 
The objectives of this study are as follows: 
 Primary Objective:  
  
To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_716103], pathophysiology, and 
magnitude of changes in tumor imaging and pharmacodynamic markers with XL184 
treatment in metastatic castra te resistant prostate cancer.  
 
.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) To estimate the progression- free survival (PFS) achieved  with XL184 in metastatic 
CRPC patients.   2) To evaluate the feasibility of the therapy, and the toxicities associated. 
  3) To evaluate OS in metastatic CRPC patients post ADT treated with XL-184. 
 
1.3 Background: Prostate Cancer and Targeted Therapy 
Cancer is a worldwide clinical and econom ic problem. The American Cancer Society 
estimates that there will be nearly 1.[ADDRESS_975431] ates in 2008 (American Cancer Society 
2008). The estimated overall cost of cancer in 2006 (reflecting, for example, clinical 
treatment, lost work time and productivity fo r patients and families, and mortality) was 
$206.[ADDRESS_975432] also demonstrated clinical benefit. Further studies into the pathways and mechanisms of action of these novel agents will help guide patient selection for future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_716104]. 
Bone metastases in prostate cancer are prim arily osteoblastic with evidence of deposition 
of new bone. The increased osteoblastic activity  results in incorpor ation of Tc99-labeled 
methylene-diphosphonate allowing visualization of the lesions on bone scan. Met and its 
ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have  demonstrated increas ed expression after 
androgen ablation as well as with disease progression to lymph nodes and soft tissue. 
XL184 is a VEGF and c-met inhibitor that has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy 
in metastatic CRPC. Not only did the agent produce 89% aggregate re sponse and stable 
disease rate in measurable disease, but marked improvement of bone scans was noted 
(Smith DC et al. GU ASCO symposium 2011). This is an unusual phenomenon, not seen 
even with any of the other agents that produ ce high levels of anti-tumor efficacy such as 
ADT. The physiologic changes occurring with  the rapid normaliz ation of bone scans 
(within the first 6 weeks) are unknown to date. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_716105], with XL184 therapy. We hypothesize that XL184 uniquely targets the crosstalk 
between cMet and VEGFR axis, downstream cathepsin K-driven pathways and novel RTKs (e.g., DDR-1, DDR-2) in the bone tumor microenvironment. XL [ADDRESS_975433] function.   
1.3.1 Signal Pathways 
The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (receptor for hepatocy te growth factor [HGF]) 
has been implicated as a mediator in many important aspects of tumor pathobiology, 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 15including tumor survival, growth, angiogenesis,  invasion, and dissemina tion (Sattler et al. 
2004; Jiang et al. 2005), and se veral MET RTKs have been re ported to show activity in 
cell lines and animal models (Sattler et al . 2004). Recently, inhibitors of MET including 
XL880 and ARQ [ADDRESS_975434] shown signs of antitumo r activity in Phase 1 studies (Eder et 
al. 2007; Garcia et al. 2007; Ross et al. 2007). The vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor 2 (VEGFR2 [KDR]) is a central medi ator of tumor angiogenesis, and several 
small molecule and protein therapeutics targe ting this receptor are currently in clinical 
development. Recently, bevacizumab (Avastin®), a monoclonal antibody directed against 
VEGF, has been shown to improve overall  survival (OS) when combined with 
chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colo rectal cancer (Hurwitz  et al. 2004) and in 
lung cancer (Sandler et al. 2005). In addition to their i ndividual roles in tumor 
pathobiology, nonclinical data s uggest that Met and VEGFR2 play synergistic roles in 
promoting tumor angiogenesis and subsequent  dissemination (Bottaro and Liotta 2003).  
Compounds that simultaneously inhibit VEGF  and MET RTKs may be more effective 
anticancer agents than agents that target  each of these receptors individually 
(Pennacchietti et al. 2003). Th e investigational drug in this study, XL184, is a potent 
RTK inhibitor that targets primarily MET and VEGFR2 RTKs. XL184 has activity 
against other RTKs that have been impli cated in tumor pathobiology, including KIT, 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and Tie-2. In addition, XL184 is known to inhibit 
RET, a RTK known to be causative for malignanc y in the setting of hereditary medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC). 
1.4 XL184 Background 
A summary of XL184 clinical and nonclin ical experience is contained in the 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_151982] (or designee). The Investigator’s Brochure 
should be reviewed in conjuncti on with this study protocol. 
1.4.1 Spectrum of XL184 Activity 
XL184 is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple RTKs with growth-promoting and 
angiogenic properties. The primary bioche mical targets of XL184 are MET, VEGFR2, 
RET, and KIT (Table 1-1).

XL184 is orally bioavailable as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_133008] (PK) experiments in 
rodent and nonrodent models. Target modulation studies show  that the administration of 
XL184 in mouse models causes dose-depe ndent inhibition of MET, VEGFR2, a 
mutationally activated form of RET, and mu ltiple mutationally activated forms of KIT. 
Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate rapid effects on the tumor endothelium, 
resulting in breakdown of the vasculature and tumor cell death within 8 hours after 
administration of XL184. These effects transl ate into significant tumor growth inhibition 
after XL184 treatment in multiple  tumor models (Table 1-2). In addition, in all of the 
models examined (human breast cancer, human lung carcinoma, human MTC, and rat 
glioblastoma [GB]), marked tumor regression and excellent tolerability were observed .

Data from pharmacodynamic experiments show  that in vivo XL184 inhibits key RTKs 
that promote tumor cell proliferation and/or angiogenesis (MET , VEGFR2, and RET) 
(Table 1-3). XL184 inhibited RTKs MET in the liver, and xenograft tumors and 
VEGFR2 in lung tissue, with ED 50 (dose required for 50% inhibition of receptor 
phosphorylation) values of 5, 9, and 26 mg/ kg, respectively. Durations of action were 
sustained with > 50% inhi bition 10-[ADDRESS_975436]-dose at a dose level of 100 mg/kg. 
Immunohistochemical evaluations indicated th at XL184 inhibited angiogenesis and cell 
proliferation and stimulated necr osis in tumor tissue in vivo.

a 44% inhibition after 24h, no intermediate timepoint be tween 4h and 24h was tested. 
 
Nonclinical experiments in nude mice demons trated that XL184 crosses the blood-brain-
barrier in healthy animals. Four hours after drug administration at 10 mg/kg, XL184 brain 
exposure was approximately 16% (1.3 µM) of  the XL184 concentration in plasma (8.2 
µM).  
Overall, the data generated in vivo demonstrat e that the target prof ile of XL184 translates 
to potent anti-angiogenic activity and potent antitumor efficacy. The anti-VEGFR2 
activity of XL184, combined with additional gr owth-inhibitory properties mediated by [CONTACT_716129], may result in enhan ced antitumor activity in GB. Phase [ADDRESS_975437] clinical activity in several tumor types, 
including MTC and GB.

Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_151982] (or designee). This documen t should be reviewed in 
conjunction with this  study protocol. 
1.4.2 XL184 Nonclinical Toxicology 
In nonclinical toxicity studies in rodents and nonrodents, histopathological changes 
associated with XL184 administration were obser ved in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone 
marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adre nal and reproductiv e tract tissues. 
Histopathological changes present in bone and pancreas were considered secondary to 
XL184 administration. XL184 was negative in in vitro bacterial, in vitro mammalian cell, 
and in vivo mammalian genotoxicity bioassays. In reproductive toxicity studies, XL184 
was embryotoxic in rats, produced fetal soft  tissue changes in ra bbits, and decreased 
fertility in male and female rats. 
Safety pharmacology studies of XL184 admi nistration did not demonstrate adverse 
effects on neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-system function in rats; furthermore, no 
significant changes in electrocardiographic parameters (including corrected QT [QTc] interval) were observed in telemeterized dogs. 
XL184 was not an inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 in vitro and is not predicted 
to have significant effects on CYP3A4 induction. XL184 was shown to be  an inhibitor of 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19 isozymes in  vitro and was also a substrate of 
CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. The mean plas ma protein binding by [CONTACT_152068]184 in vitro was 
greater than 98%. Additional toxicology information may be found in the Investig ator’s Brochure. 
1.4.3 Clinical Experience (Detailed and current clinical information is available in 
current version of the Investigators brochure)

database as of 01 June 2010. The clinical studies with XL184 are ongoing, thus the AE 
data from the clinical database do not yet include all SAEs. Data  from double-blinded 
studies are not presented. The severity  of AEs was assessed using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_975439] been studied in open-la bel clinical trials 
with XL184, including treatment with XL184 as a single agent, as well as XL184 in combination with temozolomide and radia tion therapy, and XL184 in combination with 
erlotinib. The available pooled data in this database include  483 subjects who received 
open-label XL184 in Studies XL184-001, XL184-002, XL184-201, XL184-202, and XL184-203 (lead-in stage only). The most fre quently observed AEs (> 15%), regardless 
of the relationship to XL184, were fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, constipation, vomiting, dysphonia, hypertensi on, rash, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increased, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in creased, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(PPE) syndrome, headache, dyspnea, cough, and weight decrease. Some of these events, 
including fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, dysphoni a, hypertension, rash, AST increased, ALT 
increased, and PPE syndrome, resulted in permanent study drug discontinuation,. Effects that may be related to inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, thromboembolic 
events, GI perforation and hemorrhage, w ound dehiscence, and proteinuria, have been 
observed in clinical studies with XL184.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious Adverse Events 
Of the 561 subjects enrolled in open-label clinical trials with XL184, 223 subjects (40%) 
experienced one or more SAEs recorded in the Argus safety database, and [ADDRESS_975440] commonly reported SAEs assessed as drug related were pulmonary embolism 
(PE) (in 14 subjects), di arrhea (in nine subjects), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (in seven 
subjects), nausea (in seven s ubjects), hypertension (in five  subjects), th rombocytopenia 
(in five subjects), dehydration (i n four subjects), vomiting (i n four subjects), abdominal 
pain (in three subjects), and perirectal absc ess (in three subjects). In addition, one late-
breaking case of reve rsible posterior leukoencephal opathy syndrome (RPLS) was 
reported after the data cut-off in the d ouble-blind placebo-controlled Study XL184-301. 
Fifty-two deaths were reported within [ADDRESS_975441] dos e of study drug; the majority 
was due to disease progression, and five deat hs were assessed to be related to XL184. 
They were the result of GI hemorrhage (in on e subject), PE (in two subjects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518] (in one subject), and he moptysis (in one subject).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Activity 
Preliminary clinical activity data ar e available for Studies XL184-001, XL184-201, 
XL184-202, and XL184-203.  Eighty-five subjects with a dvanced solid tumors were en rolled in the XL184-001 study. 
Of the 85 subjects, 18 subjects experienced a tumor shrinkage of ≥ 30%, including 
17 (49%) of 35 subjects with MTC with measur able disease. In the response evaluable 
subset of subjects with MTC,  10 (29%) of 35 subjects had confirmed partial responses 
(cPRs). In addition, 15 subjects with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least [ADDRESS_975443] been enrolled. At the dose of 
125 mg qd, cPRs were observed in 11 of 37 (30%) subjects who had not received prior 
anti-angiogenic therapy, with a median durati on of response of 5.1 m onths (range, 0.9+ to 
6.7+). In subjects who had not received prio r anti-angiogenic ther apy, the 6-month PFS 
rate (PFS6) assessed by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier estimate was 25%, with a 30% ra te of censoring at 
the time of analysis. The median PFS wa s 16.0 and 7.9 weeks for anti-angiogenic naïve 
and anti-angiogenic pretreated subjects, re spectively. At the dose of 175 mg qd, cPRs 
were observed in 7 of 34 (21%) subjects w ithout prior anti-angi ogenic therapy, with a 
median duration of response of 2.9 months  (range,1.9 to12.8). In subjects who had not 
received prior anti-angiogeni c therapy, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of  PFS6 was 10%. 
The median PFS was 15.9 and 14.3 weeks for anti-angiogenic naïve and anti-angiogenic 
pretreated subjects, respectively.  
In Study XL184-202, 65 subjects with non-sma ll-cell lung cancer (N SCLC) have been 
enrolled. As of [ADDRESS_975444] experienced a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of tumor measurements as 
compared to baseline measurements. Confirme d partial response was achieved in 4 of 53 
(8%) evaluable subjects. 
In Study XL184-203, [ADDRESS_975445] been enrolled. Six 
subjects achieved a cPR dur ing the 12-week open-label lead-in stage, two with 
hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], two with  NSCLC, one with melanoma, one with 
prostate cancer). Of the 105 evaluable subj ects (with minimum 12 weeks of follow-up), 
43 achieved SD (11 with melanoma, eight with NSCLC, five with panc reatic cancer, five 
with prostate cancer, five with HCC, four with gastric/ gastroes ophageal junction [GEJ] 
adenocarcinoma, four with ovarian cancer, a nd one with small-cell lung cancer [SCLC]). 
The overall disease control ra tes (partial response [PR] + SD) at Week 12 were 88% in 
the HCC cohort, 86% in the ovarian cancer c ohort, 67% in the pros tate cancer cohort, 
50% in the melanoma cohort, and 50% in the NSCLC cohort.

Presence of disease progression by [CONTACT_43876], cl inical symptoms, or on scans, despi[INVESTIGATOR_716107] ( ADT), signals the onset of cas tration resistant prostate

chemotherapy is a worthy goal in the patient population with prostate  cancer, that is 
frequently elderly or with significant comorbidities (Oh W et al. Urology [ADDRESS_975447] et al. J Clin Oncol 2005). Give n the limited life expectancy and the

 Bone metastases in prostate cancer are prim arily osteoblastic with evidence of deposition 
of new bone. The increased osteoblastic activity  results in incorpor ation of Tc99-labeled 
methylene-diphosphonate allowing visualization of the lesions on bone scan. Met and its

XL184 is a VEGF and c-met inhibitor that ha s demonstrated promising clinical efficacy 
in metastatic CRPC. Not only does the ag ent produce promising response rates in 
measurable disease, but a marked change in  bone scans is noted (Smith D. et al. ASCO 
GU Symposium [ADDRESS_975448]). This is an unusual phenomenon, not seen even 
with any of the other ag ents that produce high le vels of anti-tumor efficacy such as ADT. 
The physiologic changes occurri ng with the rapid normalizati on of bone scans (within the 
first 6 weeks) are unknown to date. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_716114], 
with XL184 therapy. We hypothesize that XL184 uniquely targets the crosstalk between cMet/VEGFR2 axis, downstream cathepsin K- driven pathways a nd novel RTKs (e.g., 
DDR-1, DDR-2) in the bone tumor microenvi ronment. XL184 action leads to abrupt 
changes in bone metabolism and abrogation of 
99mTc-MDP uptake due to the inhibition of 
osteoclast activity and subsequent decrease in osteobl ast function.

skeletal metastases of prostate cancer.  The 99mTc-MDP accumulates in new (woven) 
bone and is an indicator of ch anges in bone metabolism associated with prostate cancer-
induced osteoblastic response. However, 99mTc-MDP scan findings are not specific in 
determining the cause of increased or decr eased uptake and are indirect markers of 
response to treatment [Schoder H,  et al. Semin Nucl Med 2004]. 18F-flouride PET scans 
have improved anatomic detail over 99mTc-MDP scans, a higher accuracy in detecting 
both osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases and allow quantification of the extent of 
metastatic lesion [Shreve PD et al. Radi ology 1996].  This imaging modality may be 
superior to 18F-FDG PET for pr ostate cancer, since the bone metastases in prostate 
cancer are primary osteoblastic. Osteoblastic me tastases tend to exhibit a high rate of 
fluoride incorporation (Schoder H, et al. Semin Nuc Med 2004) and may have low FDG 
uptake (Shreve PD et al. radiology 1996). Additionally, 18F-flouride PET has improved 
sensitivity and specificity when compared to standard 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy, and 
importantly, PET offers the ability for rigor ous quantification.(Heicappell R et al. Eur 
Urol 1999, Yeh SD, et al. Nuc Me d Biol 1996 and Schirrmeister H, et al. J Clin Oncol 
1999). It is currently being evaluated in association with other therapeutic trials in prostate cancer (American Co llege of Radiology Network, A CRIN Trial # 6687) to detect 
pharmacodynamic effects of novel agents. We will utilize the 
18F-flouride PET in this 
study to trace the absorption of fluoride ion by [CONTACT_716130].

measuring cellular metabolism. Measuremen ts of metabolism made during or after

detection of prostate cancer bone metastases  from a study conducted at our institution 
[Sun H et al. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Im aging 2005].  We will utilize the18F-FMAU PET to

99mTc-MDP bone scan, high resolution 18F-
flouride PET to measure effects of XL184 treatment on bone tissue, and 18F-FMAU PET 
to measure changes in tumor metabolism in response to therapy. Imaging will be 
performed using a gamma camera and PET/CT scanners. 99mTc-MDP bone scans, 18F-
flouride PET and 18F-FMAU PET is already approve d for NOMIC-funded study (C-
2335, Shields, AF; PI). We propose evaluating patients with 18F-flouride imaging pre and

[CONTACT_9661]. These samples offer unique opportun ity for analysis of changes in gene 
expression profiles in response to treatment.  Particularly, imaging-guided assessment of 
early bone/tumor responses can potentially lead  to identification of novel targets that 
distinguish responsive lesions fr om ones that progress.    
 
We will also examine the effects of XL184 tr eatment on bone turnover and tumor growth 
and survival via histological , immunohistochemical and seru m bone marker analyses in 
human bone biopsy samples. We will utilize established protocols and procedures for 
aCGH, expression profiling, as well as hi stological and serum marker analyses. 
Performing aCGH will allow us to identify genetic translocation such as TMPRSS2-
ERG.   In addition, archival tissue will be  collected and c-met a nd VEGF expression will 
be evaluated pre and post therapy. Pre and post therapy CTC counts and phenotype will 
be tested. Post therapy biopsies will be obtained for checking for VEGF and c-met expression, and pre and post therapy serum and urine bone markers to assess bone 
turnover will be examined.  Baseline tu mor tissue will be evaluated for oncogene 
mutations and correlated w ith response and clinical ou tcome. Although there are no 
common point mutations in oncogenes, we  have the capability (such as the 
pyrosequencer and sequenom) to perform mu tational assays on any gene discovered in 
the future.  
 
The clinical response and outcome will be correlated with changes noted in tumor 
imaging and tissue changes to explore the pathwa ys influencing antitumor efficacy of this 
novel agent.   Based on prior clinical tr ial enrollment, about 40% of  the patient population is 
expected to be of African American ancestry. This will enable evaluation of XL184 effects in a population where it has not been systematically studie d. Given the likely 
differences in prostate cancer disease c ourse and biology, and associated comorbidities 
such as hypertension, this experience would broaden the safety and efficacy data regarding XL184.

pharmacologically active in a patient  population with advanced CRPC.  
 
Retrospective review of Phase 2 XL184- 203 RDT: While the overall rate of dose 
reduction from 100 mg to 60 mg was 51%, only 14% required an additional reduction in 
dose from [ADDRESS_975456] dose of 40 mg, which is consistent with an overall 
improvement in tolerability profile at the 60-mg dose level. The majority (69%) of 
subjects with pain at baseline who experienced early dose reduction (before Week 6) to

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 37exception of water) for 2 hours, subjects will take study treatment da ily with a full glass 
of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and con tinue to fast for [ADDRESS_975471] dose of study treatment, and fo r any serious adverse ev ent (SAE) assessed as 
related to study treatment or study procedures, ev en if the SAE occurs more than [ADDRESS_975472] dose of study treatment. 
Subjects will be instructed to notify thei r physician immediately of any and all AEs.  
Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to the study treatment may require a dosing 
delay or reduction(s) in their dose in order to continue with study treatment.  
Re-escalating study treatment after a dose reduction: 
 Subjects who required a dose reduction for Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity 
should not be re-escalated 
 For other related AEs, subjects may be re -escalated to the previous dose at the 
discretion of the investigator but not sooner than 2 w eeks beyond the resolution to 
Grade ≤ 1 or to the baseline value of AEs. 
 If a subject has been dose-re duced more than once, dose re-escalation can only occur 
to the next higher dose level. Further dos e escalation to highe r well-tolerated dose 
levels is allowed only if c linically indicated per investigator’s judgment and dose 
escalation criteria are met w ith each escalation (e.g. a minimum 2 week interval 
between escalations)  
 If the AEs that previously led to dose reduction(s) recu r upon re-escalation, the dose 
should be reduced again and no furthe r dose escalation will be permitted.  
 Dose re-escalation is not allowed for dose reduction triggered by [CONTACT_152001].  
 
Discontinuation from study treatment: 
 If the subject does not recover from hi s or her toxicities to tolerable Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_975473] may 
be able to restart therapy with a dose reduction upon resolutio n of the toxicity. 
. 
 The minimum dose of study treatment will be 20 mg daily. Subjects who cannot 
tolerate 20 mg daily dose, will ha ve study treatment discontinued. 
 
Additional information for dose delays or dose reductions: 
 Dose delays for reason(s) other than AEs related to cabozantinib, such as surgical 
procedures with no anticancer  therapy intent, may be al lowed with investigator 
approval. The acceptable length of interruption will be determined by [CONTACT_1275]. 
 
2.8 Warnings, Precautions, and Management of Anticipated Adverse Events 
The general adverse event profile of cabozanti nib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) 
syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side effects associated w ith inhibition of VEGF signaling 
such as thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis 
[DVT]), hypertension, proteinuria,  hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of gast rointestinal 
[GI] perforation and rectal/p erirectal abscess. Arterial thromboembolism (transient 
ischemic attack [TIA], myocardial infarc tion [MI]) have been reported rarely.   
2.9 Management of Adverse Events 
In the absence of an unacceptable cabozantinib- related toxicity and/or clinical signs of 
disease progression, subjects may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects must be instructed to notify th eir physician immediately for any and all 
toxicities. 
Guidelines for the management of AEs (ie,  dose interruptions a nd dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections. Each dose re duction of cabozantinib s hould be to one dose 
level lower that the current dose.  Dose reductions of more than one dose level are 
acceptable if agreed to by [CONTACT_737]. If  study treatment of cabozantinib is restarted 
after being withheld or interrupted, the subj ect should be instructed not to make up the 
missed doses of cabozantinib.  
The reason for treatment delay and reduced dos e must be recorded on the case report 
form (CRF).

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 39Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs cons idered not related to cabozantinib if this 
is clinically indicated or if causality is  initially uncertain. Study treatment may be 
resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose pe r investigator judgment) if the AE is 
determined not to be related to cabozantinib once the investigator determines that 
retreatment is clinically appropriate and th e subject meets the protocol re-treatment 
criteria.

the reduced dose should be restarted. 
 If the AE does resolves to resolves to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline 
without a dose interruption, continue the reduced dose. 
Grade 3:  
Grade 3 AEs considered related to study treatment which occurred without optimal prophylaxis or 
which is easily managed by [CONTACT_716135]  Interrupt study treatment and add supportive care as indicated 
 For AEs that are easily mana ged (e.g., correction of 
electrolytes) with resolution to baseline or Grade ≤ 1 within 24 
hours,  treatment may be resumed at either the same dose or 
with a dose reduction at the discretion of the investigator 
unless this is a recurring event at which time the dose should be reduced 
 For AEs that require supportive car e, the dose should be held 
while supportive care is initiated and optimized.  Then upon resolution of the AE to baseline or Grade ≤  1, treatment 
should be restarted with a dose reduction.  Note: if the 
investigator believes the likelih ood of a reoccurrence of the

Diarrhea 
Subjects should be instructed to notify thei r physician immediately at the first signs of 
poorly formed or loose stool or an in creased frequency of bowel movements. 
Administration of antidiarrheal agents is re commended at the first sign of diarrhea as 
initial management. Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy.

subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above includ e deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_716115] (Benson et al. 2004). Some subjects may requi re concomitant therapy with 
loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , and deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342846]. 
When combination therapy with antidiarrheal agents does not contro l the diarrhea to 
tolerable levels, a dose reduction and/or dos e interruption of cabozantinib should be 
implemented as described.  In addition, general supportive meas ures should be 
implemented including continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte 
abnormalities, small frequent meals, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947]-containing products, high fat meals and alcohol.  
Nausea and Vomiting 
Anti-emetic agents along with supportive care are recommended as clinically appropriate 
at the first sign of nausea and vomiting.  A dose reductions and/or dose interruption of 
cabozantinib may be required as described in Table if antiemetic treatment and/or 
prophylaxis alone is not adequate.  Agents classified as having a high therapeutic  index (such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, 
or NK-1 receptor antagonists) per ASCO or MASCC/ESMO guidelines for anti-emetics 
in oncology or dexamethasone are reco mmended (Hesketh et al. 2008, ASCO 2006; 
Roila et al, Annals of Oncology, 2010). Ca ution is recommended with the use of 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_716116]3A4, and nabilone is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures may include a comprehe nsive dental examination to identify any 
potential complications before study treatment is initiated. Appropriate correction of local 
factors should be instituted as indicated, su ch as modification of ill-fitting dentures and 
appropriate care of gingivitis. During treatm ent with cabozantinib, good oral hygiene and 
standard local treatments such as non-trau matic cleansing, and oral rinses (eg, with a 
weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maintained. The oral cavity should be 
rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures  should be cleaned and brushed often to 
remove plaque. Local treatment should be inst ituted at the earliest onset of symptoms.

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 46Cabozantinib treatment should also be inte rrupted when transaminase increases are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_408251], and/or elevations of coagulation 
tests (eg, International Normalized Ratio [INR]). Monitoring of transaminases should be intensified (2–3 times per week) and cabozanti nib should be held until the etiology of the 
abnormalities is determined and these abnormalities  are corrected or stab ilize at clinically 
acceptable levels (INR < 1.5  ULN, total bilirubin < 1.5  ULN, aminotransferases < 2.5 
 ULN or baseline).  
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_528930] (bilirubin elevation >2xULN), in the absence of evidence of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), as the combined finding (i.e., Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver injury.

2.11.4 Skin Disorders 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand-foot syndrome), 
skin rash (including blister, erythematous ra sh, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis 
acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], and 
alopecia have been reported with cabozantini b. All subjects on study should be advised 
on prophylactic measures including the use of emollients, removal of  calluses, avoidance 
of exposure of hands and feet to hot wate r leading to vasodila tation, protection of 
pressure-sensitive areas of hands and feet, and use of cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and keep the palms and soles dry. 
The onset of PPE is variable with paraesthesia (tingling, numbness) being the 
characteristic initial manifestation, which can be accompanied by [CONTACT_716137]. PPE advances with symmetrical painful erythema and swollen areas (edema) on the palms and soles. The lateral si des of the fingers or periungual zones may 
also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to preven t worsening of skin 
symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ul cerations, or necrosis of affected areas. 
Aggressive management of symptoms is  recommended, including early dermatology 
referral. Subjects with skin di sorders should be carefully mon itored for signs of infection 
(eg, abscess, celluli tis, or impetigo). 
In the case of study treatment-related skin changes (eg, rash, hand-foot syndrome), the investigator may request that  additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s 
consent. These assessments may include digita l photographs of the skin changes and/or a 
biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

any time (eg, peeling, blisters, bleeding, edema, or hyperkeratosis or affects self-care) or if there is no improv ement after 2 weeks, proceed to the 
management guidelines for Grade 3 PPE.  If the dose was reduced, then upon resolution to Grade 0 or Grade 1, treatment may continue at the reduced dose.  If the dose was only interrupted but not reduced, then 
treatment may be restarted at one dose level lower.

2.11.5 Embolism and Thrombosis  
In clinical studies with cabozantinib, venous thrombotic events (DVT and PE) have been 
observed in less than 10% of s ubjects, and arterial thromboe mbolic events (MI and TIA) 
have been reported rarely. In addition, subjects with  cancer have a significantly increased 
likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_716117] (Agnelli et al, 2009).  
Subjects who develop a PE and/or DVT shoul d have study treatment interrupted until full 
anticoagulation is established with low mo lecular weight heparin (LMWH)  (Full 
anticoagulation with warfarin is not permitted) . Venous filters (e.g. vena cava filters) are 
not recommended due to the high incidence of co mplications associated with their use.  
Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, trea tment can be restarted per investigator 
judgment at one dose lower.  Subjects s hould permanently discontinue after a second 
thrombotic event. Although routine prophylactic  anticoagulation is not necessary for all

immediate therapy, the presence of new or worsened hypertension should be confirmed at 
a second visit before taking new therapeutic action. Blood pressure should be monitored 
in a constant position visit to visit, either sitting or supi [INVESTIGATOR_050]. Cabozantinib dosing should be 
interrupted in subjects with severe hypert ension (180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg 
diastolic; or sustained ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled 
with medical interventions and discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or

as well as with cabozantinib. As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for 
potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for 
bleeding events with serial complete bl ood counts and physical examination while on 
study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the 
following: 
 Tumor lesions of the lung with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or 
abut any major blood vessels; non-small ce ll lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous 
cell differentiation is known for significan t lung cavitations a nd centrally located

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 53tumors that may invade major blood vessels. The anatomic location and 
characteristics of tumor as well as the medical  history should be carefully reviewed in 
the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
 Recent or concurrent radiati on to the thoracic cavity  
 Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative co litis, and other inflammatory GI diseases 
 Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (eg, deficiencies in 
clotting factors and/or platelet  function, or thrombocytopenia) 
 Concomitant medication with anticoagulan ts or other drugs which affect normal 
hemostasis 
 
Based on the described predisposing risk f actors for hemoptysis, many studies with 
antiangiogenic drugs exclude subjects with NSCLC and squamous cell differentiation. 
Although enrollment of subject s with NSCLC with squamous cell differentiation has 
been allowed on cabozantinib studies, cabozanti nib studies exclude NSCLC subjects with 
any of the following: tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel; 
cavitating lesions; history of clinically significant hemoptysis; or recent (within 
3 months) radiation therapy to the thor acic cavity including brachytherapy unless 
radiation therapy targets bone metastasis. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subj ects with serious and life-threatening 
bleeding events or recent hemoptysis ( ≥ ½ tablespoon of red blood). Treatment with 
cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant 
hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after th e cause of hemorrhage has been identified 
and the risk of bleeding has subsided. Th erapy of bleeding events should include 
supportive care and standard  medical interventions.  
Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood 
vessel or who develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study treatment 
must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment. 
2.11.[ADDRESS_975507] been report ed with approved drugs that 
inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. To allow for early diagnosis, 
subjects should be monitored for epi[INVESTIGATOR_716118], especially if known risk 
factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_330302] (Turnage et al. 2008) are present. Such 
risk factors include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
 Intra-abdominal tumor/metast ases invading GI mucosa  
 Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory  bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, 
diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis  
 History of abdominal fistula,  GI perforation, bowel obstr uction, or intra-abdominal 
abscess 
 Prior GI surgery (particularly when associat ed with delayed or incomplete healing) 
  
Complete healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intr a-abdominal abscess 
must be confirmed prior to initia ting treatment with cabozantinib.  
Additional risk factors include concurrent use of steroid treatment or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (Rodriguez et al . 2001, Straube et al. 2009). Constipation, 
consistent with symptoms of bowel obstr uction, should be monitored and effectively 
managed. Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate  appropriate management in subjects who 
have been diagnosed with GI perforation or fistula.

2.11.13 Endocrine Disorders 
Prospective studies of markers of thyroid f unctions are currently ongoing in two single-
agent studies to characterize the effects of  cabozantinib on thyroi d function. Preliminary 
data indicate that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (TFTs) in a high number of 
subjects. In Study XL184-203, 17 of 34 (50 %) euthyroid subjects with castration-
resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) developed abnormal t hyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels 6 weeks after in itiation of cabozantinib treatment (6% showed TSH levels 
between 5 and 7 mU/L, 44% had TSH > 7 mU/L ). The median TSH level at week 6 was 
5.2 mU/L (range, 0.02-29.7 mU/L). In a Phase 1 combination study  of rosiglitazone and 
cabozantinib (XL184-008) to determine the pote ntial for a clinically  significant drug-drug 
interaction of cabozantinib on the CYP isoz yme CYP2C8, subjects with advanced solid 
tumors (particularly renal cel l carcinoma [RCC] and differen tiated thyroid cancer [DTC]) 
are enrolled. Among 11 evaluabl e subjects, the AE of hypot hyroidism was reported in 
55% of subjects. Currently available data ar e insufficient to determine the cause of TFT 
alterations and its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and 
assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated with cabozantinib.  Management of thyroid dysfunction 
(eg, symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines. 
Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated 
laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects. Monitoring with 
standard laboratory tests for endocrine di sorders and clinical examination prior to 
initiation and during treatment with cabozan tinib is recommended. Cabozantinib should 
be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-threatening en docrine dysfunction. 
2.11.14  Guidelines for Management of Treatment-Emergent Corrected QT (QTc) 
Prolongation 
In preclinical studies, high doses of cabo zantinib (up to 1000 mg/kg) in dogs had no 
effect on electrocardiographic parameters, including QT and QTc intervals. However, the 
current clinical safety profile of cabozantin ib indicates a mild to moderate prolongation 
effect upon QT and QTc interval s at clinically relevant e xposures. Other factors which 
may contribute to QTc prolongation include 
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 56 Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org) 
 Treatment with CyP3A4 inhibitors (whi ch may increase cabozantinib drug levels) 
 Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia) 
 Medical conditions which can  alter electrolyte status  e.g., severe or prolonged 
diarrhea 
 
Subjects having any of these additional risk  factors while on cabozantinib should have 
ECGs performed approximately one week  after the onset of these factors. 
A very recent analysis of ECG data fr om the XL184-[ADDRESS_975509] had a QTcF greater that 500 msec.   
If at any time on study there is an increas e in QTc interval to an absolute value > 500 
msec, two additional ECGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial ECG 
with intervals not less than 3 minutes apart.  If the average QTcF fr om the three ECGs is 
> [ADDRESS_975510] be withheld and the following actions should be taken: 
 Check electrolytes, especially potas sium, magnesium and calcium. Correct 
abnormalities as clinically indicated 
 If possible, discontinue any QTc- prolonging concomitant medications  
 Repeat ECG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ [ADDRESS_975511]  has been thoroughly evaluate d. If any additional study 
treatment is given (eg, after correction of electro lyte abnormalities and normalization of 
QTcF), it will be at a reduced dose per protocol dose levels.

(eg, palliative radiation) are allowed to c ontinue to receive study treatment at the 
investigator’s discretion. Subjects with prostate cancer currently receiving luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
agonists may be maintained on these agents. 
2.12.[ADDRESS_975513] be instructed to inform the inve stigators of the current or planned use or all 
other medications during the study (including prescription medications, vitamins, herbal 
and nutritional supplements, and over-the-counter medications).  It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are documented. 
Anti-emetics and anti-diarrheal medications s hould not be administered prophylactically 
prior to the first dose of cabozantinib. Af ter the first dose of st udy treatment, at the 
discretion of the investigator  or after the onset of symptoms, treatment (or prophylaxis) 
with anti-emetic and anti-diarrheal medications  may be undertaken per standard clinical 
practice. Bisphosphonates are allo wed if started prior to screening activities or may be 
initiated during the course of the study to control bone pain. 
Colony stimulating factors (eg, erythropoi etin and granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factors) and pain medications administered as dictated by [CONTACT_716139]. However, colony stimulating factors should not 
be administered prophylactically prior to  the first dose of study treatment.  
No concurrent investigational agents are permitted. 
2.12.3 Potential Drug Interactions 
Cytochrome P450: Preliminary data from a clinical drug inter action study (Study XL184-
008) show that clinically relevant steady-stat e concentrations of ca bozantinib appear to 
have no marked effect on the AUC of co -administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 
substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the 
clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated  to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes 
that have lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 (ie, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitr o data indicate that cabozan tinib is unlikely to induce 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 58Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not  a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on 
data from in vitro studies using CYP- isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies. 
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, 
resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposur e (AUC values) after 
a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-adm inistration of cabozantinib 
with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapenti n, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may 
significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations. The ch ronic use of strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided. Other drugs th at induce CYP3A4 should be used with 
caution because these drugs have the poten tial to decrease exposure (AUC) to 
cabozantinib. Selection of alternate conc omitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recomm ended. In addition, caution must be used 
when discontinuing treatment with a strong CY P3A4 inducer in a subject who has been 
concurrently receiving a stable  dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase 
the exposure to cabozantinib.  
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib  with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase  in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) 
after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co -administration of 
cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, in dinavir, nefazodone, nelf inavir, and ritonavir) may 
increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapef ruit / grapefruit juice and Seville oranges 
may also increase plasma concentrations of  cabozantinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have 
the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to  cabozantinib. Selection of alternate 
concomitant medications with no or minima l CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is 
recommended.  
Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathways, the potenti al for drugs that inhibit/induce other 
CYP450 pathways (eg, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CY P2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib 
exposure is not known. Therefore, these drugs  should be used with caution when given 
with cabozantinib.  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, 2012 Aug 16, 
2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 59Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction ta bles for lists of subs trates, inducers, and 
inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).  
Protein Binding: Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) to human 
plasma proteins. Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with 
cabozantinib because there is a potential displ acement interaction that could increase free 
concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-a dministered highly protein-bound drug (and a 
corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect ). Factors that influence plasma protein 
binding may affect individual tolerance to  cabozantinib. Therefore, concomitant 
medications that are highly protein bound (eg, diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and 
propranolol) should be used with caution. Because warfarin is a highly protein bound 
drug with a low therapeutic inde x, administration of warfarin at therapeutic doses should 
be avoided in subjects recei ving cabozantinib due to the po tential for a protein binding 
displacement interaction.  
Other Interactions: A relative bioavailability study in dogs suggests that cabozantinib is 
unlikely to be affected by [CONTACT_716140] r gastric pH. In vitro data suggest that 
cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P glycoprotein (P-gp), but it does appear to 
have the potential to inhibit the P-gp transport activity.

4 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
4.1 Pre-Treatment Period 
During the Pre-Treatment Period, subjects are co nsented and qualified (screened) for the 
study. Informed consent must be obtained befo re initiation of any clinical screening 
procedure that is performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for this 
study. Evaluations performed as part of routine care before informed consent can be 
considered as screening eval uations if done within the de fined screening period, and if 
permitted by [CONTACT_779]’s institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC) policies. Informed consent may be obtained within [ADDRESS_975535] a study a ssessment taken within the defined time window 
due to an event outside of his or her cont rol (eg, clinic closure, personal emergency, 
inclement weather, vacation), the assessment s hould be performed as close as possible to 
the required schedule.  Subjects should be instructed to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_716120]. Subjects experiencing 
dizziness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or other symptoms that  could influence aler tness or coordination 
should be advised not to drive or  operate other heavy machinery.

 The week 4 timepoint scan will be discontinue d for all present and future patients.    
We will also review each patients baseline scan to see if there is disease detectable.  If no 
readily visible cancer is found then the 2nd s can with FMAU PET will be eliminated for 
that patient.  So far of the 6 patients imaging, only patient 1 had no easily visible tumor 
on the baseline scan. Longer follow up of th e patients has revealed that it remains a 
challenge to determine if the patients are co ntinuing to derive clin ical benefit. The PSA 
level is frequently discordant with res ponse. Hence we will obtain an additional 18F-
flouride PET scan and a FMAU PET scan (if <3 lifetime FMAU scans done on the patient)  at week 32 (+/- 10 weeks) For the patients who discontinue therapy. prior to the 
32 weeks timepoint, the scan will be done at the time of treatment discontinuation (+/- 2 
weeks).  This timepoint was chosen to captu re the maximum number of patients currently 
on the study for this scan, and since conve ntional CT scan and bone scan is also 
conducted at the same timepoint for comparison.

Subjects will return to the study site 4 weeks (± 2 weeks) afte r the last dose of XL184 for 
an end-of-treatment assessment. Laborat ory and physical examinations will be 
performed. Remaining study treatment will be returned by [CONTACT_423], and treatment 
compliance will be documented. Additional fo llow-up will occur for subjects with AEs 
related to study treatment that are ongoing at the time of this visit, and for subjects with 
SAEs related to study treatment that occur after the time of this visit.

SAE (Section 5.1.2). 
4.5 Tumor Assessment 
4.5.1 Routine Tumor Assessment 
Tumor response should be assessed per the study schedule and until the medication is 
continuing to show benefit, (complete response [CR], PR, or SD) may continue on study. Subjects with disease progression should have their treatment di scontinued, and they 
should enter the post treatment phase of the study. The same method for tumor assessment should be employe d at every assessment.  
 
4.6 Response criteria:  
For measurable disease response RECIST criteri a 1.1 will be used [Eisenhauer E, et al. Eur 
J Cancer 2009]. The Prostate Cancer Clinical  Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria will 
be used to determine a response [Scher H, et al. J Clin Oncol 2008]. PCWG2 recommends 
a two-objective paradigm in metastatic CRPC:  (1) controlling, relieving, or eliminating 
disease manifestations that are present when treatment is initiated and (2) preventing or 
delaying disease manifestations expected to occur. PSA decline and changes in imaging will also be reported. The progression for measurable disease will be per RECIST criteria, 
and for bone metastases will be  defined as given below:

selected for response assessment. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations 
(e.g., for body scans but not for lung).Lesions  on a chest X-ray may be considered 
measurable lesions if they are clear ly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. 
However, CT is preferable. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calip ers. For the case of skin lesions,

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 68lesion, is recommended.Ultr asound (US) should not be used to measure tumor 
lesions. 
 
 Baseline Disease Assessment 
All baseline evaluations s hould be performed as clos ely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_975540] one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurem ent is to be recorded) with a minimum 
size of: • [ADDRESS_975541] scan (CT scan slice thic kness no greater than  5 mm; when CT 
scans have slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice 
thickness). • 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable). 
• [ADDRESS_975542] X-ray. • Malignant lymph nodes: To be cons idered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_975543] 
scan (CT scan slice thickness is recomme nded to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the shor t axis will be measured and followed. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic  lesions with identifiable soft tissue  
components that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI 
can be considered measurable if the soft  tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above. • ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered 
measurable if they meet the definiti on of measurability  described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Non-measurable lesions 
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathol ogical lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as 
well as truly non-measurable lesions.  • Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. • Lesions with prior local treatment, such  as those situated in a previously 
irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually 
not considered measurable unless there ha s been demonstrated progression in the 
lesion.  
Target Lesions 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximu m of two lesions per organ and five 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, shoul d be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
• Target lesions should be selected on th e basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and be representative of  all involved organs, as well as their 
suitability for reproducible repeated measurements.

clinically assessed. A sum of the diamet ers (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
Non-target Lesions 
All lesions (or sites of disease) not id entified as target lesions, including 
pathological lymph nodes and all non-measurab le lesions, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and be reco rded at baseline. Measurem ents of these lesions are 
not required and they should be followed as  ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, 
‘unequivocal progression’. 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR): 
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target 
or non-target) must have reducti on in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline  sum of diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolu te increase of at least 5 mm. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD.  
Confirmation 
In non-randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of 
PR and CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of 
measurement error. This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data wh ere response has traditionally required 
confirmation in such trials. However, in all other circumstances, (i.e., in randomized phase II or III trials or 
studies where stable disease or pr ogression are the primary endpoints), 
confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation may increase the impor tance of central review to protect 
against bias, in particular in studies which are not blinded. 
In the case of SD, measurements must have  met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in gene ral not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is 
defined in the study protocol.

whether or not the event is a ssessed as related to the inves tigational product.  Pre-existing 
medical conditions that worsen during a st udy should be recorded as AEs. Abnormal

The SAE definition and reporti ng requirements are in accordan ce with the International 
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A. 
An SAE is defined as any untoward me dical occurrence that at any dose: 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is immediately life-threate ning (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_144457], the AE 
places the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more seve re form, might have caused death). 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716121]. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
Note: The term “disability” refers to events that result in a substantial 
disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct norma l life function. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
6. Is an important medical event (IME).  Note: The term “important medical 
event” refers to an event that, base d upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
may jeopardize the subject or require inte rvention to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes listed under the defi nition of Serious Adverse Event. 
Examples of IMEs include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or devel opment of product dependency or product 
abuse.

As soon as an investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the definition of ‘serious,’ 
this should be documented to the extent that information is available. 
 This report must be submitted by [CONTACT_716145] 
24 hours, even if it is not felt to be drug related.  
 Email: [EMAIL_131] ; Fax [PHONE_154] 
 The investigator agrees to  provide supplementary information requested by [CONTACT_152030]. 
 Pregnancy, although not itself an SAE, shoul d also be reported on an SAE form or 
pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of birth, a nd the presence or absence of any birth 
defects or congenital abnormalities. 
 
5.1.4 Regulatory Reporting 
All serious unexpected adverse drug reacti ons (unexpected related SAEs) must be 
reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator as required by 
21 CFR 312.32. 
 These reports are to be filed utilizi ng the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form).

  6.0     CORRELATIVE STUDI ES/PHARMACODYNAMIC STUDIES:   
 Serum and urine markers 
Serum bone markers will be assessed pre and post XL184 therapy. These will include serum bone specific alkaline phos phatase (BSAP) and N-terminal  telopeptide of collagen 
type I (NTx). High levels of these mark ers (>146u/Lfor BSAP and > 100nmol/mmol for 
NTx) were noted to be si gnificantly predictive of hi gher incidence of skeletal 
complications (relative risk  of 3.32, p< 0.001), prostate cancer progression (RR 2.02, 
p<0.001) and death (RR of 4.59, p<0.001) [Lara PN  Jr et al. Clin Cancer Res 2006].  
 
Protocol version date Nov 17, 2011, Dec 29, 2011, Mar 19, 2012, June 28, 2012, Sept 6, [ADDRESS_975552] been implicated to  be predictive of therapeutic response. A 
study evaluating the efficacy of matrix metallopr oteinase inhibitors in prostate cancer 
reported that decline of the bone resorp tion markers including NTx, procollagen I
 NH 2-
terminal propeptide, osteocalcin and deoxypyridinoline correlated with improved 
progression free survival and ove rall survival outcome [Lara PN et al. Clin Cancer Res 
2006 and Coleman RE et al. J Clin Oncol 2005]. This supported the fact  that changes in 
bone turnover could act as surrogates of th erapeutic effect in prostate cancer bone 
metastases.  For the purposes of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we have  selected the serum NTx and BSAP and urine 
NTx as the bone turnover mark ers due to the validation of these markers in prior large 
studies specifically utilizing zoledronate therapy [Coleman RE et al. J Clin Oncol 2005]. 
Decline in the levels was predictive of lowe r incidence of skeletal events as well as 
progression free and overall survival. Hence the measurement of these markers (NTx and BSAP) pre and post therapy will be correlated with PET scan findings and clinical 
outcomes.   
Bone markers: Serum and urine (Timeline: Pretherapy, week 1, week 2 and week 4) 
 
Urine N-telopeptide will be assessed from 24-hour urine collection sample using the 
Vitros ECI Immunodiagnostic System competitive
 assay ([COMPANY_012] Ortho-
Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ). Urinary marker levels will  be normalized relative to 
urinary creatinine levels, and samples will be required to contain 
 5 mg/dL creatinine to 
ensure validity of the sample. This test will be performed at a local CLIA certified 
laboratory.  
Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels will be assessed using a chemical 
inhibition and differential inactivation assay (12).  4cc of blood will be collected in a tiger 
top tube pre and post therapy for assessment of serum BSAP. This test will be 
performed at a local CLIA certified laboratory.

performed using the 
PAXgene™ Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX). This method requires

sample (Universal Human Reference RNA, St ratagene) which will permit the comparison 
of our results to transcriptional profiles generated by [CONTACT_29091]. Alexa dyes 
(Alexa647-red and Alexa555-green) will be used  for fluorescent labeling since these dyes 
are more resistant to oxidation and do not que nch as easily as tr aditional Cy dyes.  
Labeled targets will be synthe sized from the purified RNA using linear amplification and 
indirect labeling by [CONTACT_716150]-labeled nucleotide, which will 
subsequently be modified by [CONTACT_716151] (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_716123]). The combined analysis of gene expression and chromosomal aberration 
will be performed as devised by [CONTACT_716152]. This 
statistical analysis will be carried out with two Bioconductor libraries, globalTest and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  These methods will be applied to multiple samples with similar amplicons and will provid e a basis for determining the fold change 
threshold required for an individual human tumor biopsy to indicate meaningful over-
expression harboring unique ge netic amplification events. 
 
Immunohistochemistry 
The immunohistochemical analyses will be pe rformed on bone on pre- and post treatment 
biopsy samples to assess: tumor cell prolifer ation (Ki67 staining), apoptosis (TUNEL), 
tumor vasculature (CD31, VEGFR2), cM et, DDR-[ADDRESS_975557] numbers, tart rate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) and 
cathepsin K staining will performed on multiple non-serial sections. Positively stained 
osteoclasts in each section will be counted and expresse d as osteoclast number/mm

Ki67, VEGFR2 and cMet, DDR-1, and -2 expr ession the specimens will be evaluated 
independently by [CONTACT_716153] s in a blind fashion and the results will be arbitrarily 
classified into four scores dependent  on the intensity of immunoreactivity: (a) −, negative 
immunostaining; (b) ±, very weak i mmunostaining; (c) +, medium positive 
immunostaining; and (d) ++, strongly positive immunostaining.  The CD31-positive blood vessels will be counted in multiple  fields and expressed as blood vessel

7.2.3 Correlative:  Serum markers, urinary ma rkers, bone markers, gene expression 
levels, IHC parameters.   A detailed desc ription of them is given in Section 6. 
 
7.3 Design:   This is a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_716124].   
Each patient will undergo up to [ADDRESS_975559] 
deviation (SD) with 80% confidence.   With N=15 patients, the mean SUV can be 
estimated to within 0.347 SD units of the true mean with 80% confidence.   These 
preliminary estimates will be of sufficient precision for use in designing a subsequent 
larger study.  Since not all patients will agr ee to undergo all  PET scans, the mean SUV 
may be less precisely estimated at some time points.   7.4 Analysis: 
7.4.1    For the 15 patients imaged on a common schedule (see Section 7.5.1), the 
continuous endpoints (e.g., SUV, bone scan measurements, and all continuously 
distributed correlatives) will be summarized  with standard descriptive statistics, 
separately at each measurement time point .     This will include point and 80% 
confidence interval (CI) estimates.   The mean SUV levels over time will be displayed 
graphically as a line plot (with separate curv es for the different radiotracers).   Gene 
expression levels will be transformed on a log  2 scale. 
 7.4.2  The categorical endpoints (e .g., toxicities, the 3 types of response, IHC expression 
levels, etc.) will be summarized via their frequency distribution, point estimate of the proportion, and the Wilson type 80%  CI.  7.4.3   The distribution of censored PFS will be  summarized via the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) 
survivorship estimate.   Summary statistics (e.g., median, 6-month and 12-month

2013, June 25, 2014, Aug 14, 2014 81progression-free rates, etc.) will be calculated from the K-M life table.   Similar analyses 
will be performed for OS as well. 
 
7.5 Expected accrual rate, accrua l duration, and study duration 
7.5.1    We seek to enroll 20 evaluable patients  (maximum of  25 screened to account for 
screen failures and non evaluable patients ) with clinical evidence  of metastases, and 
castrate-resistant di sease who will agree to undergo the various imaging studies, 
additional bone biopsy, and bone scans specified  in the Study Schema of Section 2.3.   To 
monitor early bone and tumor responses to  XL184 treatment, for the first 5 patients 
recruited we will perform imaging with Na18F PET as early as 2 da ys after beginning of 
XL184 regimen. Each patient will receive up to 4 scans.  The initial proposed timeline is: 
baseline, and 2-[ADDRESS_975560] start of therapy;   however, time points selected for imaging 
may be adjusted based on results of scans and the timing of changes noted in first 5 patients.  After the timeline in dicative of measurable chan ges in bone and/or tumor in 
response to treatment is established, an a dditional 15 patients will be recruited for the 
imaging/biopsy studies on a common schedule.   Those next [ADDRESS_975561] an accrual rate of 12 pati ents/year, but we also expect that up to one-
third of them would not comple te the trial due to the required number of PET scans, bone 
scans, and the additional bone biopsy.   Allowing for up to 33% attrition, we anticipate a net accrual rate of a bout 8 patients/year who complete th e trial.   Thus, it would take 
about 30 months (i.e., about 2.5 years) of accrual to enroll  the needed [ADDRESS_975562] patient(s) enrolled, hence the total study duration is expected to be 
32-[ADDRESS_975563] fully adhere to the principles outlined in “Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice” (GCP) ICH E6 Tripar tite Guideline (January 1997). The investigator will 
ensure that the conduct of the study complies wi th the basic principles of GCP as outlined 
in the current version of 21 Code of Federal Regulations, subpart D, Part 312,

PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with intermediate or high- risk 
disease. 
• Many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as curative strategies are often 
unsuccessful. 
• Treatment options typi[INVESTIGATOR_251650] (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
• Even when cancers are initially sensitive to ADT, resistance ultimately emerges either through clonal selection or through a variety of adaptive mechanisms (secondary resistance).  
• The recent introduction of novel androgen pathway inhibitors offers an opportunity to potentially improve the cure rate of men with intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer . 
• There remains a great need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of 
treatment response and resistance.  
Objectives:  
• To test the feasibility of multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI) for the 
localization and detection of focal prostate cancer both before and after pre -operative 
treatment with ADT and enzalutamide.  
Eligibility:  
• Patients with nonmetastatic castration sensitive  prostate cancer with intermediate or high-
risk features  
• Patients with testosterone levels  ≥ 100 ng/dL    
• ECOG 0 -1 
Design:  
• Patients will be treated with ADT and enzalutamide for 6 months 
• Two 3T mpMRI endorectal examinations (One at screening and after 6 month of 
treatment)  
• Screening  biopsy (MR/US guided) samples  
• Standard of care p rostatectomy  (RP) following post treatment mpMRI  
• All tumor specimens will undergo genomic analysis

TUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
• To test the feasibility of mpMRI for the localization and detection of focal prostate cancer 
both before and after pre- operative treatment with ADT and enzalutamide.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To perform parallel sequencing of each unique tumor focus in the prostate before and after treatment with ADT and enzalutamide to determine the genetic predictors of 
primary resistance. (This will be done both inter- patient and intra -patient.)  
• To determine the quantitative and qualitative mpMRI characteristics of response both before and after treatment, to predict resistance to intensive androgen targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_843227] c characterization of resistance.  
• To evaluate the pathological complete response rate after neoadjuvant treatment with ADT and enzalutamide.

ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
It is expected that 29, 480 men will die from p rostate cancer in the US in 2014.[ 1] The majority 
of these men will present with intermediate or high risk localized cancer. While some of these men are cured, many men (20 – 40% of those diagnosed) will ultimately develop castrate 
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and succumb to the disease.[ 2] Treatment options typi[INVESTIGATOR_843228] (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Following RP upwards of 50% of patients with high- risk disease will 
experience a biochemical recurrence at 5 years, [3] and approximately 20% will die of their 
disease in 10 -15 years.[ 4]

ADT interferes with androgen production or blocks androgen at the level of the androgen 
receptor (AR). [5] As a consequence prostate cancer growth is suppressed and apoptosis occurs.  
There is great variability in prostate cancers’ sensitivity to ADT and the mechanism of induction of apoptosis when it occurs is poorly understood. Some tumors appear to exhibit primary resistance, meaning the tumor persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_532144].  Even when cancers are initially sensitive to ADT, resistance ultimately emerges either through clonal selection or through a variety of adaptive mechanisms (secondary resistance). [6] Thus, the duration of long- term response to 
ADT is unpredictable. Due to the lack of in vivo  markers of tumor response it has not been 
possible to predict either the inherent cellular properties of r esistance (primary resistance) or the 
timing of conversion to castration resistance prostate cancer (secondary resistance).   
The recent introduction of novel androgen pathway inhibitors offers an opportunity to potentially improve the cure rate of men with intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer but has also creates a need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of treatment response and resistance. It is this challenge that we seek to address in this clinical trial by [CONTACT_843244] r response to both genomics and imaging to predict androgen resistance.  We will examine 
the response of tumors to goserelin  and enzalutamide in the preoperative setting.   
1.2.1 Preliminary experience with A DT prior to prostatectomy  
In a previous study, the 17 α -hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase inhibitor abiraterone +ADT prior to 
prostatectomy yielded rapid PSA declines (including near or complete responses), however approximately two- thirds of studied patients demonstrated little or no tumor shrinkage.[ 7] This 
suggests that primary resistance to even modern anti -androgen therapy remains a formidable 
challenge.  Several mechanisms of resistance to ADT have been identified, including persistent 
ligand and androgen receptor mutation.[ 6, 8] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the genomic determinants of 
resistance to ADT remain incompletely characterized. The extent to which such mechanisms might generalize across ADT regimens (such as ADT + Enzalutamide) or operate in specific therapeutic contexts also remains unknown.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1171854] 
emerging.  Given its ability to improve survival (in both chemotherapy- naïve patients and 
patients who have already received docetaxel), its relative lack of toxicity, and no requisite 
prednisone, there is increasing interest to use this treatment earlier in the disease process.  One possible therapeutic strategy could employ enzalutamide in the neoadjuvant setting.  It would be interesting to determine if enzalutamide can induce a complete pathologic response in some patients, or significantly shrink tumors ( identified via endo- rectal MRI) in other patients.  
Associations with these pathologic and/or radiographic changes and delayed recurrence or cure could drive additional studies in the future with clinical endpoints. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1171855] drives 
prostate cancer cellular proliferation .  Therefore AR over expression at baseline, via  amplified 
gene expression or  increased molecular stability, may be one mechanism of resistance. [9, 10]

Version Date:  01/25/2024  
 
Molecular changes in the AR  such as AR splice variants could enhance ligand- independent AR 
signaling and lead to primary drug resistance. [6] Enhanced efficacy of intranuclear steroid 
receptors functioning downstream from the AR could serve as coacti vators for transcription, 
promot ing treatment resistance . In addition, prostate cancer cells may utilize autocrine- or 
paracrine- mediated cellular growth, producing various androgens to drive these aberrant 
mechanisms through cytochrome P17 (CYP17) –mediated androgen synthesis .[11, 12] Additional 
possible mechanisms include AR signaling cascades that have been associated with cellular 
proliferation and decreased apoptotic activity .[13]  
1.2.4 Understanding Resistance Pattern s 
Broadly, several hypotheses may explain genetic resistance to ADT ( Table 1):  
I. Positive selection for intrinsic clonal or subclonal resistance effectors present within 
heterogeneous tumors, 
II.  Acquisition of new resistance effectors as a result of therapy, or  
III. Adaptive cellular responses (e.g., feedback mediated up -regulation of by[CONTACT_843245]).

A goal of this proposal is to systematically interrogate these potential resistance mechanisms by [CONTACT_843246].   Previous studies have utilized massively parallel sequencing technologies to define the spectrum of somatic events occurring in primary and metastatic prostate cancer .

[14-16] These studies have identified multiple genomic events that may contribute to prostate 
oncogenesis. 
1.2.5 Preliminary studies for prostate Multiparametric 3T prostate magnetic resonance 
imaging guided prostate biopsy  
Recent literature supports the contention that Multiparametric 3T prostate magnetic resonance imaging  (mpMRI) has high specificity for the detection of focal prostate cancer. [ 17] Multi-
parametric techniques are a combination of morphologic and functional sequences. These mpMR exams include diffusion (DWI), contrast enhanced (DCE) and T2W sequences. This combination allows for a detailed assessment of focal cancers, based upon cellularity (DWI), perfusion (DCE), neovascularity (DCE) and cell density (T2W).  Many studies have demonstrated the increased specificity for in vivo  cancer detection, diagnosis, tumor volume and most importantly 
the ability to differentiate aggressive (Gleason 4 or greater) from the indolent (Gleason 3 or less) cancer. [17, 18]  Each of the individual sequences T2W, diffusion (DWI) and dynamic contrast 
enhanced (DCE) have been tested and validated both individually and in combination. A recent study done here at the NCI reported positive predictive values of 98%, 98% and 100% for whole gland, peripheral zone and central gland lesions respectively and like other studies also suggest it is more accurate for focal lesions over 0.5 cm and for higher Gleason grade lesions.[ 17]  As 
Turkbey et al have also shown, using ROC analysis the AUC value for MRI volume estimates of tumors over 0.5cm
3 is 0.95. [ 19] 
1.2.6 MR-US prostate Biopsy 
The MR -US “fusion” approach pi[INVESTIGATOR_251670]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_251671].  Such targeted biopsies will be evaluated in the men prior to 
neoadjuvant anti -androgen therapy. All men will have a 3T MR examination and MR/US fusion 
guided biopsy will utilize custom biopsy probe with the embedded passive electromagnetic (EM) 
tracker that allows real -time tracking of the US image and needle location. 3D reconstructed US 
volume will be registered and fused with the pre -biopsy MRI dataset. Continuous correction of 
rigid motion between the reconstructed reference 3D US volume and real -time 2D US images 
will enable tracking of the target lesions over the course of the biopsy procedure. The technical 
aspects and validation of this approach have been described earlier .[20] B iopsy targets identified 
in the MRI and re -identified in TRUS by [CONTACT_843247] -time 
US guidance. The EM tracking and fusion technology we plan to use for this procedure has been 
developed and thoroughly validated by [CONTACT_6812], and has been applied in more than 195 cases.

ustom made patient –specific MR based prostate gland molds : A 3D model of the prostate 
can be created in a novel technique developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_843229] ( Figure 2), as 
described previously.[ 23] In brief it is a 3D model based upon MR images, which begins with 
manual segmentation of the MR T2W images.  The prostate is outlined and converted via 
software into a 3D object. This is then imported into SolidWorks (SolidWorks, Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corp., Concord, MA, [LOCATION_003]). There it is s ubtracted to create an internal 
cavity that precisely shapes the patients ’ gland. Slots for slicing the gland at 6mm intervals are 
designed and orientation markings (Superior/Inferior, Right/Left etc.) are added and it is then created using a 3D printer.  
 
 
 The mold approach has also been shown to allow for decision system support development [ 24] 
that provides a probability map of peripheral zone cancers based upon MRI.  This expertise will 
be critical to the imaging, allowing suspi[INVESTIGATOR_843230](s).  This unique tool allows for the most accurate alignment of the prostate specimen to MR images that is available today. This resource available here at the NCI will be essential for the success of this proposal allowing for precise validation of in vivo imaging studies by [CONTACT_843248].

Version Date:  01/25/[ADDRESS_1171856] for lethal prostate cancer is resistance to ADT, prediction and visualization of resistance to ADT through imaging and genomic markers would be a major advance for all men with this phenotype. It will allow quantification and characterization of the residual cancer burden (RCB) and this knowledge if predictive of long-term tumor response will allow real- time stratification of patients  to the most effective therapy.  
The advent of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], exemplified by [CONTACT_843249],  creates new 
complexities in the assessment of response. There is increasing need for imaging modalities which can accurately and reproducibly measure not just change in tumor size, but changes in relevant metabolic parameters, modulation of relevant signaling pathways, drug delivery to tumor, and differentiation of apoptotic cell death from other changes in the tumor volume.  Our studies here at the NCI have previously developed three unique contributions  to the imaging and 
image guided diagnosis of prostate cancer, namely validated quantitative mpMR, MR -ultrasound 
guided biopsy techniques and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_843232], by [CONTACT_843250] 3D molds.

1.9 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
1.9.1 Enzalutamide  
All patients will receive enzalutamide 160mg orally, daily  for 24 weeks . Enzalutamide may be 
administer ed with or without food. The study drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_218613].  
1.9.2 Goserelin  
Goserelin  will be administe red SC for a total of 24 weeks. The following are examples of 
acceptable regimens  (no dose modi fications will be permitted) : 
Goserelin 10.8mg administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks (2 doses). 
(Equivalent forms of ADT would also be acceptable including other GnRH agonists/antagonists) 
1.10 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
1.10.1 Enzalutamide  Dose Modification   
If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity (except hypertension)  attributable 
to enzalutamide or an intolerable side effect attributable to enzalutamide, withhold dosing for up 
to 1 month or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same dose if clinically 
appropriate. If toxicity recurs and or in the judgment of the investigator dose reduction is appropriate, lower dose levels (120 mg /DL -1 or 80 mg/DL -2), may be considered. Enzalutamide 
may be discontinued if toxicity recurs and dose modification is no longer clinically appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Enzalutamide Dose Delay  
Enzalutamide may be started within 7 days if a dose is missed due to scheduling or logistical 
issues (e.g., vacation, weather) during the treatment period .  If more than [ADDRESS_1171862] elapsed, 
patient s will need to be seen before further doses can be dispensed. Enzalutamide

1.10.2 Enzalutamide Dose Modification for H ypertension  
If a patient experiences hypertension attributable to enzalutamide, patients should be optimally 
managed prior to withholding enzalutamide dose. Clinical judgment should be used in deciding whether the new or worsened hypertension emerging during treatment with enzalutamide requires immediate therapy.  
 
Grade 2  
≥ 140 mmHg (systolic) and < 160 mmHg  
OR  
≥ 90 mmHg (diastolic) and < 100 mmHg   Maintain dose of enzalutamide  
 Increase antihypertensive therapy if clinically 
appropriate (consider increase dose of existing 
medications and/or add new antihypertensive 
medicat ions 
Grade 3  
≥ 160 mmHg (systolic)  
OR 
≥ 100 mmHg (diastolic)   Maintain dose of enzalutamide  
 Increase antihypertensive therapy (increase dose 
of existing medications and/or add new 
antihypertensive medications)  
 If optimal antihypertensive therapy does not result in a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure, enzalutamide should be held 
until blood pressure returns to baseline or < 140 
/ 90. 
Grade 4   Discontinue enzalutamide

Patients will undergo pre -therapy ecoil MRI at 3T  at screening . All MR data sets will be 
reviewed for quality and completeness. DCE PK analysis will be performed using commercially 
available iCAD software (http://www.icadmed.com). Post 6 months of preoperative therapy, a second ecoil MRI at 3T will be obtained. At both time points, quantitative T2, ADC values and DCE metrics will be extracted and recorded from all foci. DCE metrics to be collected include empi[INVESTIGATOR_843233] 90 seconds (AUC

1.16.3 General Guidelines  
All medications (other than study drug) and significant non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy and blood transfusions) taken within 28 days of starting study treatment through the  6 to 
10 week  safety follow up visit should be reported on the CRF. 
While patients on protocol treatment, all medications required for the health  of the patient are 
allowed with the following exceptions : 
• Concurrent chemotherapy  
• Concurrent radiation therapy 
• Concurrent immunotherapy 
• Concurrent anti-cancer radionuclides 
• Concurrent systemic corticosteroid use (daily or every other day for continued use  
>14 days ) 
• Concomitant use of secondary hormonal treatments 
• Concomitant use of herbal supplements 
1.16.4 Seizure threshold lowering drugs  
• Concomitant medications that can lower seizure threshold should be excluded during the 
course of this study, e.g., atypi[INVESTIGATOR_281101], phenothiazines, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 
aminophylline/theophylline, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, lithium, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], venlafaxine. 
1.16.5 Cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein 
• Co-administration of enzalutamide  with strong or moderate CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., 
rifampin) may alter the plasma exposure  of enzalutamide . Moderate CYP2C8 inducers 
may be used concomitantly with enzalutamide at the investigator’s discretion. If co -
administration of enzalutamide  with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, 
reduce the dose of enzalutamide to 80 mg per day. 
• Co-administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) may decrease the plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible. Selection of a concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 induction potential is recommended.  
• Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St. John’s Wort may also reduce the plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible. 
• Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) should be avoided, as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure.  
• Grapefruit , Seville oranges, and starfruit affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant use 
should be avoided.

1.17.[ADDRESS_1171870] treatment biopsy sites, one or two 
immediately adjacent tissue cores  will be obtained from the lesion.  One core will be placed in 
formalin (FFPE) for processing for histopathology, to confirm tumor diagnosis, Gleason grade and extent of tumor. The second core, if obtainable ( presumed to be nearly identical in features 
to the first core), will be reserved for molecular analyses  detection of androgen receptor variants. 
This analysis will be done only if there is sufficient tissue and after obtaining informed consent.  
 
Table 2: Clinical Protocol Procedures  
At prostatectomy, the fresh prostate gland will be processed.  The custom -made 3D mold, 
created for the individual patient with MRI data, will be used to guide placement of the “post 
treatment biopsy”, which is actually a sampling of the prostatectomy specimen in the exac t 
geometric location as the pre- treatment biopsy.  The fresh prostatectomy specimen will be placed 
in the mold and the one or two core samples obtained will be handled as described above. Documentation of precise location of the biopsy will be recorded with appropriate coordinates, and location will be correlated with the subsequent cutting of tissue cross sections. Then, the tissue will be processed by [CONTACT_843254] P athology staff for diagnosis and pathology report 
generation. The cross sections will be labeled and will be cut into halves or quadrants for routine histology processing, while documenting which cross section and quadrant (right anterior #1, left posterior #1, etc .) from which they originate d.  This will serve as a guide to the location of the 
post treatment biopsy, as that location will have been recorded keepi[INVESTIGATOR_843237]. After the prostatectomy specimen has been signed out by [CONTACT_843255]-treatment (MR 1):

If indicated, the block or blocks of the slides to be compared can be sectioned further for complete morphologic analysis of presence/absence of residual tumor, tumor grade, tumor extent, etc.  
MR 2 data will be performed  according to the specialized protocol reported previously. [ 17, 23] 
All tumor foci will be re -identified. The 3D mold will provide target localization and trajectory 
path for post prostatectomy core biopsies. 
Prior to prostatectomy we will use the MRI data and resulting 3D custom built molds of the 
entire prostate gland and foci of tumor within it. [29] Focal tumors and all prior biopsy targets 
will be re -identified where possible and mapped on MR imaging. This allows for image -based 
targets and/or regions registered from baseline MR exam to be re -identified for repeat biopsy. 
This second set of biopsies will be taken after gland removal. The core needle biopsies will be taken before specimen fixation and pathological analysis. These cores will be taken from the pre -
defined locations identified on MR and displayed in the 3D mold.  Most importantly this will provide tissue samples from the same locations both before and after therapy and allow for sampling of sub regions of activity within the lesion based upon the mpMRI appearances. The prostate specimen can be whole mount sectioned in a customized mold, allowing geometric alignment to magnetic resonance imaging and therefore precise comparison of MRI/pathologic response. The prostate specimen, after the core needle biopsy samples have been removed, the specimen will be processed in the routine way with full histo-pathological and genomic analysis.

Immunohistochemistry targets will include AR, AR -V7, 
PD-L1, PTEN, GR and MYC. Additional targets will be added upon evaluation of sequencing 
results (Section 5.1.3  below). Staining qualitative assessment and (semi- )quantitative

1.17.3 Next -Generation S equencing and Genomic A nalysis 
Prostate cancer genomics are markedly heterogeneous, even within an individual focus. Genomic 
heterogeneity is associated with therapy resistance in multiple studies, and it is hypothesized that existing subclones comprise subclonal resistance effectors. Alternatively, the acquisition of new genomic alterations may confer a resistance phenotype to tumor cell clones or subclones. The analysis of tumor genomics both before therapy and after completion of neoadjuvant therapy can elucidate molecular features of resistant effectors and indicate if they arose through enrichment of intrinsic heterogeneity or acquisition of new alterations. Whole genome and/or exome sequencing will be performed on DNA isolated from matched core biopsy samples (MR1.1a and MR 2.1a). DNA taken from the buffy coat (see section on ctDNA) or benign adjacent prostate tissue will be used for a reference sample from which somatic alterations are identified. Germline analysis of DNA for inherited alterations reveal valuable insight into mechanisms of disease and will only be used for this purpose. Additionally, DNA may be isolated from involved tissue in the prostatectomy specimen after completion of clinical diagnostic evaluation by [CONTACT_22662], as described above. DNA  sequencing and genomic analysis will be 
done using approved protocols under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_843238]. Sowalsky in the Laboratory for Genitourinary Cancer Pathogenesis, CCR. 
Sample Collection Pretreatment screening biopsy samples will be received by [CONTACT_843256]. Post -treatment 
biopsy samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_843257], as described above. Biopsy samples and, if appropriate, adjacent areas of the prostatectomy specimen, will be used for molecular studies after completion of clinical diagnostic evaluation. To enrich for tumor cell purity, it is expected tumor specimens will undergo microdissection prior to isolation of DNA and preparation of sequencing libraries. 
1.17.4 Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)  
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is shed into the bloodstream by [CONTACT_843258] a proportion of the fragmented DNA in circulation is derived directly from the tumor. In recent years, ctDNA  has shown promise as a non-invasive sensitive 
biomarker of tumor burden, and hence has potential as both a prognostic and surrogate response biomarker. In a study to detect ctDNA across 14 tumor types that had not yet metastasized or 
released detectable circulating tumor cells,  ctDNA was detected at relatively high concentrations 
in the patients with metastatic cancer and at lower but detectable concentrations in those with localized cancers .[30]  Together, these findings suggest that ctDNA could be a reliable 
biomarker for early detection as well as for determining optimal treatment, and monitoring resistance. ctDNA is abundant and readily detectable in most patients with advanced cancer; in cases with lower levels of ctDNA such as in early stage disease or minimal residual disease, detection is made possible with the use of advanced genomic methodologies. The analysis of ctDNA has considerable potential in the assessment of molecular heterogeneity, for monitoring

tumo r dynamics, identifying genetic determinants of therapy, and evaluating treatment response; 
as well as detecting acquired resistance and developi[INVESTIGATOR_843239].[31] A recent study found that genomic analysis of ctDNA in plasma of mCRPC patients 
treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide identified key aberrations that may be associated with therapeutic resistance.[ 32]  This data will be for research purposes only and will not be shared 
with patients.  
Sample Collection

1.17.8 Management of Results  
The results of molecular studies conducted using specimens collected on this protocol are for 
research purposes only and will not be disclosed to individual subjects.  The exception  to this is 
potential incidental findings that are deemed medically significant and actionable . The policy for 
this disclosure is outlined below and in the consent form for this study.  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_35114] a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is current at the time of primary analysis. (A list of current guidelines is maintained on the CCR intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ). Inherited 
alterations that may contribute to disease susceptibility in addition to prostate cancer may also be uncovered. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_148408] a request to provide a blood sample  to be 
sent to a CLIA certified laboratory. If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered the opportunity to come to NIH (at our expense)  to have genetic  
education and counseling to explain this result. If the subject does not want to come to NIH, a referral to a local genetic healthcare provider will be provided (at their expense).  
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.  
Subject’s genetic data may be deposited in a database such as dbGaP. Although there is 
controlled access to such a database, such a submission carries theoretical risks of revealing the identity of the subject. This is discussed in the consent.

1.17.9 Comparison of pathology to imaging 
The use of a patient -specific mold (as described in S ection 1.2.6.) allows the radical 
prostatectomy specimen will be sectioned in the same plane as the MRI scans (see Section 3.4.1 
and 3.4.2), and thus any immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed (see Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2) 
may help to inform analysis or interpretation of MRI in the post -treatment setting. There are no 
commercial software packages that specifically address the issue of automated quantification of 
post- treatment IHC and alignment with MRI. Drs. Choyke, Turkbey, and Harmon in the 
Molecular Imaging Program will collaborate with Drs. Sowalsky in the Laboratory of Genitourinary Cancer Pathogenesis to identify appropriate programs and tools for assessing correlation. As necessary, collaborations with third parties (including academic centers and commercial manufacturers of quantitative software) may be sought for finding the optimal solution. If a collaboration with an external party is to be sought, a personnel change amendment to this protocol will be made. All data shared with third parties will be coded, linked and covered 
under a human- materials MTA written specifically for each collaboration  (see S ection 9.1).

All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC)  will be barcoded, with data entered and 
stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix 
limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of 
Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password 
restricted login screen.  
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center

processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 
1.18.2 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either - 20 or -80°C 
according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922].  
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix . All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_239875] a manner consistent with IRB approval. 
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and  does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138703]

1.25 NIH  REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
1.25.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research tea m will meet weekly when patients are being actively treated on the trial 
to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if applicable 
will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1171880] multiple tumors within the prostate, it is anticipated that approximately 25% of the patients will experience minimal declines in tumor and still have significant residual disease, 25% may have complete disappearance of tumor, and the remainder will show substantial improvement (disappearance of some lesions, with others being much smaller). To guide sample size determination, it is estimated that for an exploratory investigation of the association of genomic information and its relationship to response, it would be useful to have at least a minimum of [ADDRESS_1171881] significant residual disease in order to form preliminary assessments of the relationships noted. As such, if 50 total evaluable patients were to enroll on the trial and if the probability of being in this category was 25%, there would be 83.6% probability of having at least 10 such patients. Thus, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_843241] 50 total evaluable patients who would all undergo primary treatment and mpMRI imaging to assess the role of imaging in this setting. The accrual ceiling will be 55  in order to accommodate a small 
number of patients who may be inevaluable .  Successful use of this imaging will lead to analyses 
related to the association with genomic traits at baseline and prostatectomy and whether there is disappearance of tumor or not. On this trial, all of these investigations will be performed with exploratory, hypothesis generating intent.

Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant ADT & Enzalutamide  
Version Date:  01/25/[ADDRESS_1171882] SELECTION  
1.26.1 Selection Based on Ethnicity, and Race  
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility 
criteria. To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or disease response would be expected in one group compared with another. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one hand and the need to explore ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow -up study may be written to 
investigate those differences more fully.  Women are not eligible for this protocol as this disease 
occurs only in men. 
1.27 P
ARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use enzalutamide in 
patients <[ADDRESS_1171883] benefit from research participation ( Section  9.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in 
their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or 
cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62494] (ACAT) for evaluation to assess ongoing capacity of the 
subjects and to identify an LAR, as needed .

VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
1.29.1 Alternative Approaches or Treatments  
Patients will be consented regarding the risks and benefits of this trial, the treatment 
requirements, and alternative approaches to entering on this trial.   
1.29.2 Identified Risks to Study Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sampling 
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.  [IP_ADDRESS] Urine Collection  
32 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant ADT & Enzalutamide  
Version Date:  01/25/2024  
 
No physical risks are associated with urine collection. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
Some skin irritation can occur where the ECG/EKG electrodes are placed. The test is completely 
painless, and generally takes less than a minute to perform. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Biopsy  
All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by [CONTACT_62564]. However, there 
are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral injury) that will be explained fully during informed consent. The patient will consent at the time of the procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] MR Imaging 
The risks of MR imaging are relatively small.  
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings that administration of gadolinium 
(updated September 9, 2010), the MRI contrast imaging agent used in this protocol, has been associated with development of a disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) . The 
syndrome is rare (approximately 600 cases reported worldwide as of September 2010, out of several million administrations of gadolinium), but disabling and in some cases, fatal. All cases to date have occurred in patients with severe renal disease, including patients on dialysis. NSF has been nearly eradicated secondary to careful screening of renal function and avoiding use of gadolinium in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_1171884] agents at lower doses. This protocol excludes patients with severe renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 BSA). The FDA has issued warnings in [ADDRESS_1171885] not been reported to date. In accordance with the FDA Drug Safety Communication of 05/16/2018, the Medication Guide for gadobutrol (or other macrocyclic gadolinium contrast agent if applicable) will be made available to all subjects with scans that will involve gadolinium- based contrast agent administratio n. 
1.29.3 Non-Physical Risks of Genetic Research  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk related to possibility that information may be released  
This includes the risk that data related to your genetic testing can be released to members of the public, insurers, employers, or law enforcement agencies.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of receiving unwanted information 
Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of the anticipation that unwanted information regarding 
disease related genetic analysis. Patients will be clearly informed that the data related to genetic analysis is coded, investigational and will not be shared with patients, family members or health care providers.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk to family or relatives  
Family members or relatives may or may not want to be aware of familial tendencies or genetic risks of disease which may cause anxiety about possible future health problems. As previously noted, patients will be notified of any medically significant and actionable incidental findings. Study results will not be shared with patients.  
33 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant ADT & Enzalutamide  
Version Date:  01/25/[ADDRESS_1171886] blood tests, examinations and scans as described in the protocol evaluation ( Section 
3.7, Study Calendar). Patients will also be required to have a local physician to provide long-
term care and to monitor for complications. If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the participation in this study, immediate medical treatment is available at the Clinical Center, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland . Although no compensation is available, any 
injury will be evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_362116]. 
1.29.5 Provisions for Monitoring Data Collection to Ensure Safety of Subjects 
As information is gathered from this trial, clinical results will be shared with patients as they 
become available. Laboratory and clinical data will be frequently gathered and any new significant finding(s) found during the course of the research, which may affect a patient’s willingness to participate further, will be explained. Confidentiality of information concerning 
participants will be maintained, including in all publications and presentations resulting from this study.  Names of participants and/ or material identifying participants will not be released without 
permission, except as such release is required by [CONTACT_2371]. Records at the National Cancer Institute are maintained according to current legal requirements, and are made available for review, as required by [CONTACT_345085], only under the guidelines established by [CONTACT_33842]. 
1.30 R
ISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
The risks of blood dra w, MR imaging, and biopsy are relatively small.  Because prostate biopsy 
is a clinically accepted intervention in patients with no evidence of metastatic disease, the risk of 
this study does not significantly differ from the risk of standard therapy with the exception that MR guided prostate biopsies typi[INVESTIGATOR_843242] a greater number of biopsies than a standard. In addition, the drug (dosage and formulation) being used in this study has been 
approved by [CONTACT_843265].  
1.31 C
ONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the participant or consent designee(s)  as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated 
study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study. 
The initial consent process as well as re- consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms  used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is 
34 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant ADT & Enzalutamide  
Version Date:  01/25/2024  
 
conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of 
the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed. 
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual (non- electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579]. When required, witness signature [CONTACT_62580]. 
Manual (non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62581]: 
When a manual signature [CONTACT_62582], this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:  
• Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or,  
• iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant) 
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_483438] (if remote consent); the same screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse.  Note: Refer to the CCR SOP PM -2, Obtaining and Documenting the Informed Consent Process 
for additional information (e.g., verification of participant identity when obtaining consent 
remotely) found at: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73203825.

I. PRECIS  
Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) infections have dramatically 
increased over the past decade with novel community -acquired isolates occurring 
worldwide [ 1, 2].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_864216] -acquired MRSA infections are 
skin or soft tissue infections occurring in young, otherwise healthy individuals, they have been associated with high hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864217] [1, 3-5].  The most common risk factors for community- acquired MRSA infections among 
the general population have been prior antibiotic use, prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], injection drug use, and contact w ith a person with MRSA- infection [ 6-10].   
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection is also a known risk factor for 
both MRSA colonization and infection [ 7, 8, 11].  To date, only retrospective studies have 
examined the incidence rates and the predictors for community -acquired MRSA among 
HIV-infected persons [7, 12, 13].  Furthermore, whether HIV patients should be screened 
routinely for MRSA carriage and whether decolonization proc edures, with 
hexachlorophene (also known as pHisoHex® soaps) soaps and nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], should be instituted remains unknown as  there are no formal guidelines or prospective studies 
addressing these questions.   
This study will prospectively evaluate the p revalence and incidence (over a two 
year period ) of MRSA colonization and infection among HIV -infected military 
beneficiaries to determine predictors for the development of MRSA colonization and infection.  This study will also investigate the utility of d ecolonization procedures for 
clearance of MRSA carriage and prevention of MRSA infections .  The molecular 
characteristics and the antimicrobial sensitivities of isolates in this population  will be 
determined. 
Additionally, medical records of HIV-infected p atients seen at the HIV clinic at 
NMCSD will be evaluated to determine the incidence and clinical features of MRSA infections among this population.  T his is an ongoing evaluation (IDCRP -049) since 2006  
(date of study initiation) that utilizes previously c ollected information (since 1993  until 
March 1, 2011) found within the patients’ medical records, and does not require contact [CONTACT_864256].  The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of MRSA among a total HIV population.  This ongoing chart review is merged  into this prospective study as both studies aim to evaluate the impact of 
MRSA infections in HIV- infected persons .

III. OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1 Primary Objectives  
 
To evaluate the effectiveness of decolonization procedures with application of 
hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soaps   and nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) compared to a 
placebo soap and nasal ointment which have no antibacterial activity  among patients found 
to be colonized with MRSA in the prevention of future colonization with MRSA.  As a secondary part of this objective, we will examine the impact of decolonization procedures on both infections with MRSA  and soft tissue infections.   In addition, as a sub -analysis to 
the primary objective, we will evaluate the impact of decolonization among unique randomizations (persons with first time MRSA colonization and randomization during the  
study).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1205054] several years, the number of community-
acqu ired MRSA cases has dramatically increased with incidence rates of 18 to 26 cases per 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 9 100,000 persons [1, 2].  In addition to individual cases, numerous outbreaks have occurred 
among prison inmates, athletes, military trainees, and men who have sex with me n (MSM) 
[14-18].  
Patients presenting with community -acquired MRSA infections typi[INVESTIGATOR_864218], furu ncles, carbuncles, abscesses, or 
cellulitis [ 1, 7].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_864219], otherwise healthy 
individuals, community-acquired MRSA infections have led to a high hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864220] 25% requiring admi ssion for the management of the MRSA infection [1].  
Severe, li fe-threatening cases have been described involving community- acquired 
MRSA infections including cases of necrotizing fasciitis; although there were no deaths in this series, significant morbidity was noted [ 3].  Cases of community -acquired MRSA soft 
tissue  infections complicated by [CONTACT_864257], as well as by [CONTACT_864258] –like syndrome [ 4-6].  Several cases of 
necrotizing pneumonia have also been reported, especially among children [ 19].  
The reasons that community -acquired MRSA strains cause severe infections remain 
unclear.  Type IV SCC mec type, Panton- Valentine leukocidin (PVL) -positive isolates are 
characteristic of community -acquired MRSA.  The presence of the PVL genes, which 
encode for a cytotoxin associated with polymorphonuclear leukocyte lysis and tissue 
necrosis, has been linked to cases of community -acquired MRSA soft tissue infections and 
pneumonia [19-21].  The most common clone of community acquired MRSA is [LOCATION_003] 300, and this its elf is likely a more virulent strain [ 22].  In addition, a study by [CONTACT_864259] -acquired MRSA isolates were more resistant to 
killing by [CONTACT_864260] .  This group is also examining a variety of genes that may help community-
acquired MRSA strains avoid destruction by [CONTACT_86461] [ 23].  Finally, studies have 
suggested that community-acquired MRSA may exhibit faster doubling times than nosocomial str ains [ 24].  
 The most common risk factors for community- acquired MRSA infections among 
the general population are  prior antibiotic use, prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], underlying medical 
conditions including HIV infection, injection drug use, and contact [CONTACT_4490] a person with MRSA -infection or colonization; similar risk factors are cited for those colonized with 
MRSA [ 7-10].  A study among military personnel, who resided in close proximity to one 
another, found that risk factors for MRSA were having a roommate with his tory of a soft 
tissue infection and having a family member or friend who worked in the healthcare setting [10].  A study among football players found that team members with frequent skin 
abrasions, such as linemen, were at highest risk of infection [18].  Finally, population-based studies have shown that young age and racial minorities may have a heightened risk [1, 20 ]. 
HIV infection is a known risk factor for both MRSA colonization and infection [7, 
8, 11].  A recent study showed that community- acquired M RSA increased six -fold among 
HIV-infected persons during the years 2000 to 2003 [7].  Risk factors for community-
acquired MRSA among HIV -infected patients cited in the literature include a history of 
MSM  or intravenous drug use as the patient’s HIV transmi ssion risk factor, a low current 
CD4 count, high HIV viral load, and the absence of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole 
(TMP/SMX) prophylaxis [ 7].  Other studies found an association with exposure to public 
hot tubs/saunas, having a sex partner with a skin infec tion, and prior beta -lactam 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 10 antibiotics [ 13, 25].  Colonization with MRSA among HIV infected persons has been 
linked to low CD4 count (<100 cells/mm3), lack of TMP/SMX prophylaxis, recent 
antibiotic use, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] [ 26, 27].  
A retrospective case- control study  was performed including the years of 1993 -2005 
among 425 HIV patients seen at the Naval Medical Center San Diego  (NMCSD) , of 
whom, 25 (5.9%) patients were found to be infected with  community- acquired MRSA.  All 
cases occurred after 2002, with a 17 -fold increase from 2003 to 2005 (Chi -square test of 
trend 15.7, p<0.001).  The annual incidence during the year  2005 among our HIV patients 
was 40 cases/1000 person- years compared to 2.28 cases/1000 person- years (or 741 
cases/325,000) among HIV- negative persons (18 -fold higher rate).  In the univariate 
analyses, lower  current CD4 count, CDC stage C vs. A, histor y of syphilis, and exposure to 
beta-lactam antibiotics in the past year were pre dictive of MRSA.  In the multivariate 
model, history of syphilis and exposure to beta -lactam antibiotics remained as significant 
predictors [12]. 
Most MRSA infections among HIV- infected patients involve the soft -tissues and 
present as folliculitis, furu ncles, carbuncles, abscesses, cellulitis, or necrotizing fasciitis 
[7].  HIV-infected persons presenting with a history of a “bug bite” or soft tissue infection 
should be evaluated for MRSA.  Treatment of MRSA infections has not been standardized 
and the opti mal therapeutic regimen remains unknown.  Of note, antibiotic resistance for 
community -acquired strains is typi[INVESTIGATOR_864221].  However, increasing 
resistance to antibiotics has been noted among community-acquired isolates, including 
rising rates of clindamycin resistance [ 28, 29].  
 Whether HIV patients should be screened routinely for MRSA carriage and 
whether decolonization procedures, with hexachlorop hene  (pHisoHex®) soaps  and nasal 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®), should be instituted remains unknown as there are no formal 
guidelines addressing these questions.  Regarding screening for MRSA carriage, studies among HIV patients have suggested that high risk sexual activities and potentially peri-rectal carriage of MRSA may be important in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_864222] -MRSA infections.  
Although, a recent study showed limited use of perianal cultures for MRSAs screening, this study was solely among patients at a reha bilitation unit [30 a], rather than HIV patients 
who likely have divergent risk factors and routes of MRSA transmission.  A recently presented abstract in HIV patients showed a poor correlation between MRSA nares carriage and MRSA infection [30b], hence we will evaluate the possible additive benefit of perianal  and throat cultures in this cohort.  Our study will examine nares, throat, axilla, 
groin , and perirectal surveillance cultures for MRSA among HIV patients.  
Although there are no formal recommendations for the use of TMP/SMX to 
prevent MRSA infections among HIV- infected patients, those patients requiring this 
antibiotic for other indications (e.g., Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia or Toxoplasma 
prophylaxis) have lower rates of MRSA infection.  Given the higher rates of community -
acquired MRSA among HIV -infected patients and that this group may have a propensity 
towards recurrent infections  [5], formulating preventive strategies would be useful. 
The use of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864223] (also known as Bactroban®) and 
hexachlorophene ( pHisoHex®) soaps  has been s tudied both during MRSA outbreaks and 
to decrease colonization and infection rates in the healthcare setting with favorable results [31-37].  The medications have a low rate of side effects and good efficacy  [38, 39].

 11 Although reported  in the literature, the risk for indu cing resistance to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864224] a study applying the medication for seven  
consecutive years [ 35, 40].  
 We propose to prospectively study the prevalence and incidence over a two year 
period of MRSA colonization and infection among HIV- infected military beneficiaries, to 
determine predictors among this population for the development of MRSA colonization 
and infection and t o investigate the utility of decolonization procedures in this group.  In 
addition, we will evaluate the molecular characteristics and the antimicrobial sensitivities of isolates in this population.  
  
We also propose to continue collecting retrospective data among HIV- infected  
patients at NMCSD, which has low risk and does not involve patient contact [CONTACT_864261].  The importance of this work is that more data regarding the risk factors of MRSA infections in this population may be useful for developi[INVESTIGATOR_864225].  This is an ongoing study (previously IDCRP -049) that has been following HIV patients at 
this site  since January 24, 2006 [45, 46].  Data collected on HIV patients will be 
retrospectively captured since [ADDRESS_1205055], whichever is 
later.  We will continue to evaluate the patients for MRSA events until March 1, 2011.  
Only existing data will be used for this study; no information collected after March 1, 2011 will be used for the retrospective study.  
  V. RESEARCH DESIGN  5.1 General Approach   
This i s a prospective, randomized, double -blind  study examining the incidence and 
risk factors for MRSA colonization and infection among HIV- infected persons and the 
efficacy of decolonization  procedures  of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) nasal ointment and 
hexachlorophene ( pHisoHex®) soaps  compared to a placebo nasal ointment and body 
soap.  Inclusion criteria include adult (>18 years) HIV-positive patients ; exclusion criteria 
include the presence of a known allergy to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) nasal ointment or 
hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soaps , pregnant or breastfeeding females, age <[ADDRESS_1205056], and inability to participate 
in study for its two year duration .  A history of MRSA infection or colonization is  not an 
exclusion criterion for this study.  Patients will be offered enrollment into the study at the time of presentation to the HIV clinic for routine care  by [CONTACT_864262]/or a study investigator.  General  Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
advertisement posters about the study will be posted in each clinic.  
 After signing the informed consent  which includes a HIPAA form , the patient will 
be registered with the D ata Coordination Center (DCC) and receive a participant 
identification number (PIN).  A patient will be assigned a PIN centrally once the patient agrees to participate in a Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP)  study.   If 
a patient agrees to  participate in other IDCRP  studies, this same PIN will be used to link 
that patient to these other studies.  The patient will also be assigned a subject identification 
number unique to the patient and this study.   Patients will then undergo swabs for  determining colonization of MRSA and will 
fill out a questionnaire containing data regarding demographics, sexual activities, 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 12 substance use, medication use, history of soft tissue infections, and potential risk factors 
for MRSA.  Study coordinators will re view the patient’s medical record for data regarding 
medical history.   Patients will have repeated swabs, questionnaires, and review of their 
medical records every six months (+/- 2 months) during the two year study enrollment.   
The trial will be a random ized, double -blinded study. Patients found to have a 
positive culture for MRSA colonization  will be randomized  in a 1:1 fashion to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  
(Bactroban ®) nasal ointment plus hexachlorophene (pH isoHex®) soap for seven  days or to  
a placebo nasal ointment (wh ite petroleum) and a placebo body soap with no antimicrobial 
activity for seven days; since there is no standard therapy recommended in the guidelines for MRSA management for MRSA colonization, patients in the latt er arm will receive 
placebos with no specific antimicrobial activity .  In this design, we will ascertain if 
treatment for MRSA decolonization of this patient population is warranted or not.  After completion of these topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], patient s will complete a questionnaire to ascertain 
their adherence to these medications.  Patients found to be colonized with MRSA and who 
reside local ly (within driving distance)  to the medical treatment facility will have repeat 
swabs ( five swabs  from sites lis ted above every four weeks (+/ - 7 days) after any positive 
colonization cultures over the subsequent  six month  time period .  These cultures will assist 
in determining if the decolonization medications were successful at eradicating the carriage of MRSA.  Patients will receive one treatment course of either mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban®) nasal ointment plus hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soap  for seven days or a placebo nasal 
ointment (white petroleum) and a placebo body soap  with no antimicrobial activity for 
seven days .  Patients who are initially found to be ne gative for MRSA on screening swabs 
will be re -evaluated in six months (+/- 2 mo nths).   
Patients who develop a soft tissue infection or any infection t hought to be 
secondary to MRSA will be evaluated in the HIV clinic and will undergo wound cultures and repe ated screening for MRSA colonization.  CD4 counts and an HIV viral load will be 
obtained at the time of infection.  Patient questionnaires and source documents will be 
completed for patients experiencing a soft tissue infection or MRSA infection .  
 Cultures (from colonization sampling and wound cultures) which are positive for 
MRSA or MSSA at the local medical treat ment facilities laboratories will be sent to the 
San Antonio Military  Medical Center ( SAMMC ) laboratory for confirmation of MRSA, 
antibioti c susceptibility testing, and molecular analysis.   
 We also propose to continue to review the charts ( IDCRP -049) of all  HIV -infected 
patients within the HIV clinic  at NMCSD .  We will review all patients’ demographics, 
CDC stage, current CD4 counts, CD4 na dir, current HIV viral loads and medication use 
including antiretroviral and antimicrobial medications.  We will also identify those patients 
who were diagnosed with MRSA infection during the time they were infected with HIV.  Patients c harts in the HIV clinic will be reviewed from  1 January 1993 (the beginning of 
CHCS) or the data of HIV positivity (whichever is later) through 1 March 2011 in an 
ongoing fashion.  Among patients with MRSA, the following data will be collected from the cha rts and from CHCS: age, sex, race, years of HIV infection, CDC stage, CD4 count 
nadir, CD4 current value, current HIV viral load, medication use including antiretroviral and antimicrobial medications, antibiotics for MRSA, time of MRSA infection, type of MRSA infection, CD4 and viral load counts around the  time of MRSA diagnosis, type of 
treatment, whether or not they were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864226], duration of the MRSA infection, any MRSA relapses, risk factors for MRSA, HSV2 serology, RPR serology,

be entered into a Microsoft Excel file without personal identifiers for analys es.  Datasets

hexachlorophene  (pHisoHex®) soaps), who are not healthcare workers with direct patient 
contact,  and who are not pregnant  or breastfeeding , over 9 5% of clinic patients will be 
eligible for enrollment .  A history of prior MRSA colonization and/or infection does not 
exclude entry into this study.  The total population of the study will be 550 participants.  If 
approximately 10-15% of participants carry  the bacteria MRSA, then approximately [ADDRESS_1205058] of all HIV patients who are 18 years or older and followed in the NMCSD HIV clinic.

July 2, 2014  
 
 14 6.1 Pre- enrollment  
 
During regularly scheduled medical visits, HIV-positive patients will be offered 
participation  in this research study .  Eligibility requirements will be assessed through 
verbal discussion.  IRB approved advertisement posters about the study will be posted in the clinic.  Supplies for the study and subsequent data collection will be organized.  Study staff jobs will be all ocated to allow for optimal study performance during enrollment and 
data collection.  The case report forms (CRFs) will be created to ensure consistent 
reporting and time efficiency.  
 
6.2 Enrollment 
 
The purpose of the trial, the entailed procedures, and the potential risks and benefits will be explained in person.  Those who agree to the study will complete an informed consent process with the study coordinator and/or study physician, at which time it will be verbally verified that the subject comprehends the purpose of the trial, and the risks and benefits of participating.  The subject will be provided adequate time to read the consent and to ask 
questions about the study.  The subj ect will be offered  a signed copy of the informed 
consent and a copy will be filed in the patient’s medical record.  The signed original consent form will be stored confidentially according to site IRB requirements.  P atients 
who meet the inclusion criteria will be consented, registered at DCC , assigned a PIN  and 
study identification number (refer to section 5.1) , and enrolled into the study.   
 
6.3 Active Surveillance & Clinic Assessments  
 
 Each study participant will be seen a minimum of five times over the 24-month study 
period by a study physician or study team member at the clinic (baseline visit and every six 
months (+/- 2 months) for a two year period) .  The maximum number of visits depends on 
if the patient has repeated infections or col onization for MRSA; this will likely not exceed 
[ADDRESS_1205060] with DCC (assigned a PIN) .  Women of childbearing age will undergo 
a urine pregnancy test to assure that she meets inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled 
patients will fill out questionnaires  including data on prior MRSA or soft tissue infections, 
recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], demographic information (age, race, sex), substance use (alcohol, tobacco an d illicit drugs), current and recent (within the past 12 months) antibiotics, 
current receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), contact [CONTACT_864263] a history of soft tissue infections and/or MRSA, relative or contact [CONTACT_864264], exercise habits, sexual activities, sexually transmitted diseases, and activities previously associated with MRSA including sports, use of public baths/saunas, and hygienic practices (refer to case report forms) .  Each participant will h ave swabs of 
their nares,  throat,  axilla , groin, and perirectal area  obtained  for determining  MRSA or 
MSSA colonization .  Study coordinators will examine the patient’s medical records and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864227], medical condition s including MRSA or 
soft tissue infections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV data including CD4 count, HIV viral loads, and CDC staging.   
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_1205061] which occurs every six months (+/- 2 
months). The study dur ation for each participant is [ADDRESS_1205062] colonization of M RSA or M SSA 
performed:  
• one swab of  both nares; 
• one swab of the throat  
• one swab of the bilateral groin areas;  
• one swab of the axilla areas; and 
• one swab of the perirectal area.   
 
 Patients will be evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 study months (± 2 months) for repeat 
swabs  (1. one swab of bo th nares; 2. one swab of  the throat; 3. one swab of  the bilateral 
groin areas; 4. one swab of the axilla areas ; and  5. one swab of the perirectal area).  
Patients will also complete questionnaires regarding recent antibiotic use, recent soft tissue 
infections, recent sexually transmitted diseases, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], substance use, sexual activities, and activities previously associated with MRSA  (refer to case report forms) .  
Study coo rdinators will search the patient’s medical records and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864228], medical conditions including MRSA or soft tissue infections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV data including CD4 count, viral loads, and CDC staging.    Culture results regarding MRSA carriage are to be finalized within [ADDRESS_1205063] a positive culture for MRSA  during the study period 
from the colonization swabs will be randomized in a 1:1 double -blinded fashion to 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) nasal ointment twice daily for seven  days plus hexachlorophene 
(pHisoHex® ) washes  with showering once daily for seven  days or to a placebo nasal 
ointment (white petroleum) and a placebo body soap  with no antimicrobial activity for 
seven days.   The patient will be randomized within [ADDRESS_1205064] to 
assure they are not pregnant before dispensing of these medications; women found to have 
a positive pregnancy will be terminated from the study.   
 Patients  who are colonized with MRSA and who reside local ly to the medical 
treatment facility and are able to return to the clinic will have repeat swabs ( five swabs  
from sites listed above) every month  (+/- 7 days).  A month will be specifically defined as 
[ADDRESS_1205065] 
these repeat swabs performed, but rather will be seen at the next scheduled 6 month study 
visit.   Adherence to the study medications will be assessed at the next scheduled study visit 
by a patient questionnaire (refer to case report forms ).  Each time a patient has a positive 
isolate for MRSA  or MSSA , this will be frozen and saved for molecular analys is to 
determine the most common molecular types colonizing HIV patients and to determine if patients acquire new strains or remain colonized with the same strain over time.  
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 16 All study patients  (both those initially found to be colonized with MRSA and those 
with negative colonization swabs) will be  re-evaluated in six month  interval s (+/- 2 
months)  until the end of the study.  Patients found to be positive at these subsequent [ADDRESS_1205066] study visit (at the 2 -year time period), patients will have swabs, but not 
undergo randomization.  Hence, every 6 months, patients positive during that visit for 
MRSA colonization will be re -randomized in a 1:1 double -blinded fashion to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban ®) nasal ointment twice daily for seven days plus hexachlorophene 
(pHisoHex®) washes  with showering once daily for seven days or to a placebo nasal 
ointment (white petroleum) and a placebo body soap  with no antimicrobial activity for 
seven days.  Repeat randomization will occur every 6 months for those carrying MRSA. 
For example, some patients initially random ized to receive Bactroban® and pHisoH ex®, 
may later be randomized to the placebo arm, and vice versa.

Patients will be asked to report to their enrolling HIV clinic for any soft tissue 
infections or any infection thought to be secondary to MRSA; if able, cultures of the 
wound site will be obtained.  Blood cultures will be obtained at the primary provider’s 
discretion depending on the presence of fevers, toxemia, and the extent of soft tissue 
involvement.  Patients will also have repeated screening for colonization including nares, throat, groin, axilla,  and peri rectal swabs ( 5 total swabs) a t this time.  CD4 counts and an 
HIV viral load will be obtained at the time of the soft tissue infection or with any MRSA infection for patients presenting to the enrolling site.  Patients with positive wound culture and/or blood cultures for MRSA will be classified as a “MRSA infection .”  Those with a 
soft tissue infection without positive cultures from these sites will be classified as a “S oft 
Tissue Infection NOS .”  The patient will be treated with intravenous or oral antibiotics 
and/or surgical procedur es at the discretion of the medical provider that the patient presents 
to for evaluation.  Patients  who have an infection while located remote ly from the HIV 
clinic  will be given a contact [CONTACT_864265] [INVESTIGATOR_864229].  The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_864230]; CD4 counts and HIV viral loads will not be performed for patie nts 
presenting remotely to the enrolling site.  In addition, coordinators will gather information on the tests and treatments performed.  Patient questionnaires will be completed for 
patients experiencing a soft tissue infection or MRSA infection  (refer to  case report forms ). 
 Patients experiencing an infection will be offered decolonization medications based 
on their most recent randomization  assignment ; those previously randomized will be 
maintained in their group, while those experiencing a soft tissue infection and having a positive colonization culture for the first time will be randomized to either mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban ®) nasal ointment twice daily for seven  days and hexachlorophene (p HisoHex®) 
washes  with showering once daily for seven  days or to a placebo nasal ointment (white 
petroleum) and a placebo soap  with no antimicrobial activity for seven days .  Patients with 
a positive soft tissue culture but no positive swab s from the nares, throat, groin , axilla, or 
perirectal areas , will not be randomi zed.  If the primary clinician caring for a patient who 
experienced a MRSA infection desires to decolonize a patient regardless of the patient’s randomization group, this is permitted, but must be documented and these participants will 
be removed from the “placebo  group ” for the analysis .  
 All c ultures (from colonization sampling , wound and blood cultures) which are 
positive for MRSA  or MSSA  at the local medical treatment facilities laboratories will be 
preserved by [CONTACT_864266] -70 degrees C; these samples will be batched (isolates 
will be held at the primary facility and sent on a periodic basis) and sent overnight with dry ice to the NMCSD .  This site will collect the specimen s and send them to the laboratory at 
SAMMC which  will perform testing on the isolates for confirmation of MRSA, antibiotic 
susceptibility testing  (including mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]) , and molecular analysis ( to include multilocus 
sequence testing , PVL  PCR, and other virulence factors ).  Some local laboratories (e.g. 
NMCSD) are also p erforming susceptibility testing on the isolates; this information will be 
collected if available.  SAMMC will also repeat all susceptibility testing on all isolates at 
their facility.  All samples sent to the laboratory at SAMMC  will be labeled only with a 
PIN number of the patient.  The staff at the SAMMC laboratory  will not have access to 
personal identifiers and will have no way of linking their results to a patient name.  Results

 18 will be reported to the study lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_864231], together with a SAMMC -
assigned identifier.   These data will be utilized to characterize the MRSA isolates 
colonizing and infecting HIV patients, understanding the relationship between colonizing 
and infection -related isolates, and to d etermine if HIV patients acquire new strains or 
remain colonized with the same strain over time.  
 The primary endpoint of the study is the effectiveness of decolonization procedures 
with application hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®)  soaps and nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  (Bactroban ®) 
compared to placebo  among patients found to be colonized with MRSA in the prevention 
of future colonization with MRSA .  As a secondary part of the study’s objectives, we will 
also examine the effectives of these decolonization procedures on  infections with MRSA  
and on soft tissue infections.  
   
The following assessments will be performed:

6.4 Details of Laboratory Studies 
 Testing  
 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 19 Swabs for MRSA:    Patients will have their nares, throat, groin, axilla, 
and perirectal areas swabbed for MRSA colonization 
and these swabs will be sent to the microbiology laboratory at  the clinical site  for determination of the 
presence of MRSA or MSSA at each of these si tes. 
     The laboratory will provide culture results within 3 -4 
days of swab collection.  
Wound and blood cultures:   Patients with an active skin or soft tissue  infection 
will have a culture of the wound performed and sent to the microbiology laboratory o f the clinical site for 
determination of the presence of MRSA or MSSA at each of these sites.  Blood cultures may be ordered 
based on the discretion of the primary physician.  
HIV studies :     CD4 count by [CONTACT_864267]’s lab . 
Pregnancy test :   Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test at baseline to assure she meets inclusion/exclusion criteria.  This test will be 
repeated if she is found to be colonized with MRSA  
before dispensing the d ecolonization medications; i f 
she is found to have a positive pregnancy test, her study participation will be terminated.  
 
 6.[ADDRESS_1205067]  of decolonization procedures will include the presence of MRSA on repeated swabs 
to assess the efficacy of these medications on clearing MRSA colonization.  In addition the effec t of MRSA infections  on the CD4 count and HIV viral  load will be assessed .  
 6.7 Randomization Procedures  
 Patients who are found to be colonized with MRSA will be randomized to receive eith er 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) nasal ointment plus hexachorophene  (pHisoHex® ) body washes  
for seven  days or a placebo nasal ointment (white petroleum) and a placebo body soap with 
no antimicrobial activity for seven days .  The patient will be randomized within [ADDRESS_1205068] will be generated by a computer program at one controlled location and 
administered by [CONTACT_864268] (IDCRP) , Data 
Coordination Center (DCC).  Assignments will be made at the time that a patient has a 
positive swab for MRSA colonization .  Patients with repeat positive colonization cultures 
at the 6 -month intervals will be re -randomized at these time periods.   Enrol lment will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_864269] .   
 6.8 Study Drug  
 
Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  (Bactroban ®) 2% nasal ointment and hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) 3% soap  
will be obtained through the pharmacy at the NMCSD .  In addition, we will obtain white 
petroleum as a placebo nasal ointment and a body soap without antibacterial activity as a 
placebo.  Upon receipt of these medications , the pharmacist at the NMCSD will initiate a 
drug accountability log entitled Investigation al Agent Accountability Record.  This record 
will be maintained as a perpetual inventory of both mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban® ) and 
hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®). 
 Once obtained from the NMCSD pharmacy , mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban ®) nasal ointment , 
hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soap , and the placebo ointment and soap  will be provided 
to each site following  a written  request via the Clinical Drug Request Form, written 
confirmation of protocol approval from the IRB of the site requesting the drug, and a copy of the curr ent Randomization Assignment List (if requesting additional drug).  The Clinical 
Drug Request Form and Randomization Assignment List (if applicable) will be faxed to 
the NMCSD pharmacist each time the drug is requested.  Once the above documentation is 
obtained, the NMCSD pharmacist will send the requested amount of these medications to 
the pharmacist at the requesting site.  The shipment will contain an Investigational Drug 
Shipment Form (Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_398546] ), which must be faxed to the NMCSD 
pharmacist  following receipt of each  medication shipment.  In addition, the drug shipment 
will contain a Study Agent Accountability Log and a Randomization Assignment List.  As 
each site differs in policy with regard to handling investigational medications, the Site  
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_864232] -specific procedures of drug accountability, storage and dispensing. 
 
6.9 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
An adverse event  will be defined as follows: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event (AE) 
can, therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) produc t” (ICH 1.2).   As the antibacterial topi[INVESTIGATOR_864233] a 7-day course, AEs will only be recorded temporarily near the time of 
medication administration  (within [ADDRESS_1205069] dose utilized ).  Adverse events will 
be identified by [CONTACT_864270]-up visits by a study investigator. 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 21 Since the study only utilizes topi[INVESTIGATOR_864234], abnormal lab oratory values will 
not be recorded a s AE’s.   
 
6.9.1 Grading Adverse Events for Severity  
All AEs will be graded for severity. Selected AEs will be graded in severity as defined in 
Attachment A.   Adverse events will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, 
or fatal.  Mild adverse events (grade 1) are often transient, do not interfere with subject’s usual function and no intervention may be required.  Moderate adverse events (grade 2) interfere to some extent with usual function; there may be some impairment of functioning 
without resulting in loss of work or cancellation of social activities .  Grade 2 adverse 
events are uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Severe adverse events (grade 3) significantly interfere with usual function , may require bed rest and/or result in loss of 
work or cancellation of social activities.   Grade 3 adverse events produce signifi cant 
impairment of functioning or incapacitation, and medical intervention is often required.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  adverse events result in extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance is required and immediate medical intervention or the rapy is required 
to prevent death.  
 
6.9.2 Relatedness of Adverse Events to the Study Drugs  
Any AE that occurs in a patient/study subject receiving study medications  will be assessed 
for relationship to the drug/investigational product.  A causal relationship means that the drug/ investigational product caused or is reasonably likely to have caused the AE.  This 
usually implies a relationship in time between the drug/ investigational product and the 
AEfor example, the AE occurred shortly after the patient/study subject received the 
drug/investigational product.  
 
The best estimate at the time of reporting of the causal relationship between the experimental interventio n and an adverse event and the degree of certainty about causality 
will be graded as follows:  
Definitely Related : The adverse event and administration of study agent are related in time, 
and a direct association can be demonstrated (e.g., disappears or decreases with reduction in dose or cessation of drug/investigational product and recurs with re -exposure). 
 
Probably Related : The adverse event and administration of study agent are reasonably 
related in time and/or follows a known pattern of response, and the adverse event is more likely explained by [CONTACT_33857]. 
 
Possibly Related : The adverse event and admini stration of study agent are reasonably 
related in time and/or follows a known pattern of response, and the adverse event can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_33858] (e.g., could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or could have been due to environmental or other interventions). 
 
Unlikely Related : A potential relationship between study agent and the adverse event could 
exist (i.e., the possibility cannot be excluded), but the adverse event is most likely 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 22 explained by  [CONTACT_864271] (e.g., could readily have been produced by 
[CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or could have been due to environmental or other interventions)  
                            
Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly due to extrane ous causes (e.g., underlying 
disease, environment) or exposure to the investigational product has not occurred.  Such 
events MUST have an alternative, definitive etiology documented in the patient’s medical record.  
 Serious adverse events (SAEs) are adver se events, whether related to the study agent or 
not, that result in: 1) death, 2) threat to life, 3) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], 4) persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 5) congenital anomaly or bir th defect, 6) overdose, or 7) any medical event which requires treatment to 
prevent one of the medical outcomes previously listed.  
 SAEs  and subject discontinuation s will be reported to the Medical Monitor.  Each subject 
will be carefully observed for sign s of intolerance or toxicity.  If any adverse reaction is 
noted, the subject will be treated as medically indicated.  The subject may be withdrawn from the study if it is felt by [CONTACT_864272].   
 The Site P rincipal Investigator will report any serious or unexpected adverse reactions 
immediately to the Medical Monitor.  Within 24-48 hours the Site P rincipal Investigator 
will also use telephone or fax transmission to notify the IRB at their site (timeframe 
depends on local IRB requirements) and Lead  Principal Investigator s at which time the 
Lead Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_864235].  The Medical Monitors and the P rincipal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for 
reviewing the cumulative safety data.  
 Any event, whether expected or unexpected, that is classified as a SAE which is fatal  or 
non-fatal will be reported within [ADDRESS_1205070]’s participation will be terminated if one of the following occurs:  
 
a. Subject voluntarily withdraws  
b. Subject fails to comply with study procedures  
c. Decision in the best interest of the patient  
d. Patient is no longer eligible for care at t he military HIV clinics  
e.  Patient becomes pregnant  or decides to become pregnant during the two-
 year study period  
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_1205071] who develops a rash or significant adverse event due to study medication will be discontinued from treatment but will be encouraged to continue to undergo follow up including study visits for completing questionnaires and swabs for MRSA colonization every 6 months (+/ - 2 months) until study  completion ; the patient will not be randomized 
to one of the treatment arms if he/she is found to be positive again for MRSA colonization .  
The subject may be withdrawn from the study if it is felt by [CONTACT_864273] u ndue risk from further participation.   
 The subject will require a termination visit if withdrawn from the study.  If a subject’s participation in this study is terminated, they will be offered medical standard of care and a medical evaluation, to include clinical laboratory studies as needed.  The investigator will 
complete the Completion/Discontinuation CRF . 
  VII. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
  There are four primary questions to be answered to address this study’s primary 
objective. These, and an analysis desi gned to answer the question, follow.  
(1) What i s the hexachlorophene/mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864236]?  We will also examine if these decolonization 
procedures are effective at reducing MRSA infections and skin/soft tissue infections compared to placebo.  We propose to pool the data at 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_1205072] a chi -square or Fisher’s exact test 
of contingency.  Th ese analyses  will be conducted for colonization and infection 
separ ately.  The proposed  pooling of this study design assumes that there is no 
persistent or repeated -treatment effect and that there is no patient -to-patient 
difference in susceptibility.  These effects will be investigated in the following questions.  
(2) Is the treatment effect different for repeat administrations of 
hexachlorophene/mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]?  The rate of MRSA positive versus negative for 
recolonization reoccurrence through the sequence [ADDRESS_1205073] of trend.  
(3) Is there a persistent or repeated -treatment effect?  The overall rates of MRSA 
recolonization at 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_1205074] of trend.  
(4) Is there an individual propensity for susceptibility  and what are the treatment 
differences between placebo and hexachlorophene/mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864237] c olonization on repeated testing ?  A Kaplan -
Meier long -rank test will be conducted on three groups: initially negative, initially 
positive treated with hexachlorophene/mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], and initially positive treated with placebo, where survival is defined as not having acquired MRSA. 
  For the secondary objectives, part (a) will be assessments of the rates in which  
prevalence is defined as the number of patients colonized with MRSA at the beginning of 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 24 the study divided by [CONTACT_864274], and the incidence as the number of new 
infections per calendar ti me divided by [CONTACT_864274].  For objective (b) 
examining for predictors of MRSA, we will create a multivariate logistic regression model and use a backward stepwise approach.  For part (c), to evaluate if there is a significant change in th e CD4 count and/or viral load pre - versus during a MRSA infection we will 
utilize a [ADDRESS_1205075] ANOVA.  We will also compare pre -MRSA infection with after MRSA 
resolution as well as the counts during the infection with those after resolution.  Finally, objective (d) will be a descriptive analysis of the molecular and microbiologic 
characteristics of the isolates.   The main statistical data from the retrospective chart review  
study of HIV patients at NMCSD will be presented by [CONTACT_195506].  We will compar e demographics and HIV clinical data between those with and without MRSA 
using rank sum tests and Fisher’s exact tests depending on the variable characteristics (categorical or continuous).  A multivariate logistic regression model for predictors of 
MRSA w ill then be developed using a backward stepwise approach using Stata software. 
The sample size calculation for this study is based on the  primary objective of the 
study which is to evaluate the effectiveness of decolonization procedures with application 
of nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban ®) and hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soaps  compared to 
placebos with no antibacterial activity  among patients found to be colonized with MRSA 
in the prevention of future colonization with MRSA .  We will also examine the number  of  
infections with MRSA and  soft tissue infections  as secondary measures of the primary 
objective. 
The rate of MRSA colonization of the nares was 1% in a recent study involving the 
general US population [ 41].  Among HIV-infected patients this rate is higher, with one 
study showing a carriage rate of 27.6% [11].  However, other studies had rates of 3 -9% 
among their HIV- infected patients [ 26, 27, 42].  The MRSA infection rate among HIV-
infected persons is approximately 13 cases/1000 person- years in one study th at examined 
3,455 patients over three  years with 94 MRSA infections [ 7]; our rate at NMCSD appears 
higher with 40 cases/1000 persons in the year 2005 [12].    In a study examining both MSSA and MRSA colonization rates, after treatment with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  
(Bactr oban ®), colonization was eradicated in 93%, whereas 85% who 
received placebo remained colonized (P<.001). At day 90 after study entry, 61% of the residents in the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864238] [ 36].  In a study by [CONTACT_864275] 812 soldiers over a 8 -10 week period of training, of those with MRSA 
colonization without treatment for decolonization, 38% developed a soft tissue infection [43].  
Using these data, assuming 10% of the HIV patients would be colonized, that half 
would be randomized to each treatment group, and that 85% in the non- treatment arm 
would remain colonized versus 7 -39% (mean 23%) of the treated would remain colonized, 
we calculated the following sample sizes:

Hence to show a statistically significant decline in colonization rates using mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  
(Bactroban ®) and hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) , up to [ADDRESS_1205076] to follow -up events and that the colonization rate or clearance rates 
may vary, we propose to enroll 550 participants, such that 500 participants are followed throughout the study period.  Given this sample size and the estimate of a 10% colonization rate over the study period, we would estimate that [ADDRESS_1205077] time MRSA  colonization a nd may differ in response to decolonization medications , 
we will also examine as a secondary analysis of the primary endpoint only those with unique randomizations.  
  For showing a significant difference in the number of infections between the two treatment groups, assuming 38% of the no specific treatment group and 10% of the treatment group 
will develop infection, a sample size of 860 would be needed; of note, this is a secondary objective and not the primary basis of the sample size calculation for this study .  For 
smaller changes in the difference in the rates between groups, larger sample size would be 
needed.   Of note,  the first rates (38 % vs. 10%)  were determined  during an 8- 10 w eek 
period and our study involves 6-month periods over a total two year period ; on the other  
hand, this military training population studied for these estimates may have a higher rate 
than our HIV patients .

 To account for the study design of patients being re -examined every 6 months over a two -
year period (a total of five visits) and re- randomized at each of these intervals with new 
infections being counted as separate events, the sample size required was notably smaller (last column in table) .  The calculations accounted for a progressive decrease in 
colonization and infection rates over the course of the study since patients would be given decolonization medications depending on their randomization assignment.  
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
 26 Using these data, we proposed a sample size o f 500 participants  to find statistically 
significant results; given the long duration of follow -up and the possibility for attrition, we 
will enroll [ADDRESS_1205078]’s initial randomization (not counting re -
randomizations) , as a sub -analysis of the primary endpoint.  Of note since the primary 
endpoint includes complet ion of the [ADDRESS_1205079] an interim examination ye arly ( after at least one -half of subjects are 
enrolled) to determine the adequacy of  the design assumptions and  sample size, given that 
there is little literature regarding the expected colonization and infection rate in this specific (HIV) population.  Al so, approximately every year w e will conduct an 
examination of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_864239] , as well as a safety assessment . 
 We also calculated a sample size for the secondary objective which was t o determine the 
predictors of MRSA colonization and infection among HIV -infected persons including 
examination of demographics, sexual activity, hygienic procedures, drug use, antibiotic and HAART medications, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV control.   Of note, the 
other secondary objectives do not lend themselves to sample size calculation due to the paucity of baseline data in the literature.  Predictors for MRSA were examined in three 
studies including Mathews et al, Lee et al, and our retrospective w ork [7, 12, 13].  For a 
power at 80%, alpha of 0.05, and examining 20 potential predictors with an R
2 of 0.10, we 
would need to enroll 205 patients in the study (sample power analysis, SPSS).  As we examined more predictors, a larger sample size (500  to 550) is preferred . 
 
VIII.  DATA ENTRY AND ANALYSES  
 
The IDCRP  Data Coordination Center (DCC) will enter completed CRF data and manage 
all study data.  In order to comply with requirements of maintaining subject confidentiality, 
only the subject’s participant identification number (PIN) will be used to identify the 
research information ( as detailed below  in section IX ).  A computer program generates the 
PIN number randomly.  The DCC Data Management Specialist will be the only one authorized to have access to view full identifying information within the database.  The individuals with access to the data will be study co ordinator s designated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_864240]. Regulatory 
staff from the Regulatory Compliance and Human Subjects Protection Branch (RCHSPB)/SAIC- Frederick, Inc. will also have access to vi ew full identifying information 
during monitoring visits and auditing.  After data entry, d ata will be analyzed using SPSS 
13.0 and SAS  8.0 for the purpose of publication of significant study findings; these 
publications will not disclose personal information such as patient names.  The data and CRFs will be maintained as per local IRB requirements . 
 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_1205080] will be assigned a unique participant identification number (PIN), which will include no patient identifiers.  A patient will be assigned a PIN centrally once the patient agrees to participate in a IDCRP  study. If a patient agrees to participate in 
other IDCRP  studies, this same PIN will be used to link that patient to these other studies. 
For instance, i f a patient is already enrolled into the Natural History Study, the same PIN 
will be used for all future IDCRP  studies.   This PIN and the data collected will be 
maintained in a secure password protected database at DCC.  The master link between  the 
new PIN for this study and the patient’s identifying information will be kept by [CONTACT_864276] a locked, secure location.  T he master link will be maintained 
at DCC after the study’s conclusion.   In addition, each participant will be assigned a 
unique study identification number designating the clinical site of enrollment and a nu mber 
assigned to that specific  individual.  
  During the study, CRFs from each patient will be stored in a locked file  cabinet in the 
office at each clinical site.  In order to comply with requirements of maintaining subject confidentiality, only the subject’s study number will be used to identify the research information.    It is expected that these data will be reporte d in both scientific journals and scientific 
meetings.  Confidentiality of subjects will be maintained in all forms of reporting.  Volunteers will be informed in general terms of the results as soon as practical.  The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and any applicable regulatory requirement(s).  Monitors under contract to the NIAID will visit the clinical 
research site to monitor all aspects  of the study in accordance with the appropriate 
regulations.   The objectives of  a monitoring visit are as follows :  
• To verify the prompt reporting of all data points, including reporting SAEs, 
checking availability of signed informed consent;  
• To compare  individual subjects records, Case Report Forms (CRFs) and the source 
documents (supporting data, laboratory specimen records and medical records to 
include physician progress notes, nurse' notes, subjects' hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]); and 
• To ensure protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy 
and completeness of records.  
 The monitors will also inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (OHRP/ICH -GCP) are being followed.  During the monitoring visits , the 
investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, CRFs ) 
and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864241] l records readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_1036],

X.  FACILITIES TO BE USED  
 
10.1 Laboratory 
 
Each of the clinical sites will utilize their own laboratory for the testing  of the presence of 
MRSA and MSSA in swabs or cultures, urine pregnancy tests, and for CD4 counts and 
HIV viral loads among those patients with a MRSA infection .  MRSA and MSSA isolates 
will be frozen at -70 degrees C at the clinical sites, batched,  and sent overnight on dry ice 
to the NMCSD ; these specimens will be shipped to the laboratory at SAMMC in [LOCATION_007] for 
MRSA confirmation, antibiotic susceptibility testing and molecular analysis for the SCC type and virulence factors such as the PVL genes.      
  1. Naval Medical Center San Diego  
 San Diego, CA [ADDRESS_1205081] of the individual laboratories participating in this study.  
 Isolates identified to be MRSA or MSSA at the individual participating sites will be 
stored at -70
oC in the local microbiology laboratory.  Periodically , these specimens will be 
mailed frozen via Federal Express using proper labeling for biological specimens to the Naval Medical Center San Diego.  Specimens will be shipped to the laboratory at SAMMC 
in [LOCATION_007]  for molecular characterization.  These specimen s do not contain any of the 
patients’ cells or genetic material, but rather our bacteria isolated from clinical specimens.  
 XI. TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE 
 
Enrollment will take approximately [ADDRESS_1205082] been enrolled.   Charts from a ll HIV -infected patients  in the HIV 
clinic at NMCSD will be reviewed for the retrospective cohort.  
 
XIV.  FUNDING IMPLICATIONS  
 Required resources from NIH/NIAID will be provided by [CONTACT_864277] M. Jackson Foundation (HJF) , through a cooperative agreement between the HJF and the NIH/NIAID.  
There will be no funding from outside resources.  See attached budget.

#Pregnancy test will only be performed  at the MRSA colonization and infection visits  among 
women who found to be colonized with MRSA; those with a positive pregnancy test will not 
receive the study medications and will be terminated from the study. 
*Randomization into the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban® ) and hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) soaps or to 
the placebo arm will only occur if a patient has a positive colonization swab for MRSA.  Patients 
will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1205088] repeat swabs fo r MRSA performed monthly (+/- 7 days) 
for six consecutive months.  For patients with repeat positive MRSA colonization swabs on the 6-
month visits, will be re -randomized during each of these events.  
**AE review will occur among patients given mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]

transfer will be done on coded data only, and no material with patient identifiers (such as name) will be transferred electronically.  
 The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_864251].  Each subject will be identified 
on study records with a six -digit participant identification number (PIN), to maintain 
confidentiality of study subject participation.  A computer program generates the study number randomly.  Only those directly involved in the conduct of the study will have access to subjects’ medical records.  In all publication and presentations resulting from this research study, all personal information will be kept in the strictest confidence and will not be released in any form identifiable to any subject.  However, authorized personnel from the National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Uniformed Services 
University of the Health  Sciences  (USUHS) , the Tri -Service Investigating Department, 
representatives from the sponsoring agencies, representatives from regulatory agencies, and from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where applicabl e, may have access to research files, 
but they are bound by [CONTACT_864283].

e. Review data security measures  
f. Have full access to study data  
 The M edical Monitor has the authority to recommend suspension or disenrollment or any other 
steps deemed necessary to protect the research experience.  
 
18.C.5 Experimental Procedure(s)  
 
Administration of the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban® ) nasal ointment and hexachlorophene 
(pHisoHex®) soap body washes  or a placebo ointment and soap  is the only part of the study that 
is experimental.  Patients will also have swabs taken of their nares, throat, axilla, groin and 
perirectal area us ing a soft q- tip like culture swab. The study may also involve a blood draw for 
CD4 counts  and HIV viral load , wound culture of a soft tissue infection, and possibly blood 
cultures if a patient has a MRSA infection or soft tissue infection ; when possible t he blood tests  
will be obtained at the same time that blood tests ordered by [CONTACT_864285].  
 
18.C.6 Risks  
 
Risks of the study include the administration of FDA -approved medication s mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban®) nasal ointment and hexachlorophene  (pHisoHex®) soaps  both applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ) 
for those who are colonized with MRSA and randomized to the treatment group, and a blood draw for those who experience a soft tissue or MRSA infection during the study. There are also the psychologi cal and legal risks if a subject’s information is accidentally revealed to an 
unauthorized source.  Bactroban® ( Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_864252] 2% ) is a n FDA -approved medication administered intranasally 
for elimination of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus .  Local  reactions, such as burning, 
stinging, soreness and pruritis have occurred in 1 -2% of patients, but are rarely severe enough to 
result in medication discontinuation.  Irritation of the nasal mucosa is believed to be due to the 
polyethylene glycol vehicle u tilized to deliver the drug, which, if applied to damaged skin, may 
result in systemic absorption and renal toxicity.   However, this is unlikely in situations, such as in this study, where the agent is applied to small, intact areas of the mucosa .  Avoida nce of 
ophthalmic exposure to the nasal formulation is of key importance, as it may result in burning and tearing that may take days to weeks to resolve.  Other effects, such as headache, taste perversion , rhinitis, pharyngitis, and cough may  occur with mu pi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] 
(Bactroban ®) nasal 
application  [39].  The Food and Drug Administration rates mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban ®) as a Category 
B drug, with no evidence of fetal harm in rats and rabbits; however, it has not been tested in 
pregnant women to date.   In addition, it is not known whether the drug is excreted in breast 
milk.  Hence, in this study both pregnant and breastfeeding  females are excluded.    
 pHisoHex® (hexachlorophene 3% w/w ) is a n FDA-approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_864253] a surgical hand scrub and for decolonization of patients  who carry gram- positive 
bacteria during outbreaks . The most common side effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_864254] 
(pHisoHex®) are local skin reactions such as dermatitis and photosensitivity.   Rare cases of photoallergy have occurred and use of this agent in patients with history of light sensitivity .  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_864255] n resul t in systemic absorption especially when applied to abraded skin; 
Prospective MRSA Study  
Version 7.0 
July 2, 2014  
 
44 patients will receive a medication information sheet recommending the avoidance of applying 
hexachlorophene ( pHisoHex®) to areas of abraded skin . This medication is category C in 
pregnancy as  large doses of hexachlorophene (pHisoHex®) given orally and intravaginally have 
proven embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies.  Although there have been inadequate studies in humans, one retrospective review found an increa sed incidence of fetal malformations 
and minor deformities of children born to nurses washing their hands with hexachlorop hene 
(pHisoHex®) 10- 60 times daily [ 38, 44].  The risk of toxicity in this study is low since the soap 
will be only used once daily fo r seven  days among patients found to carry MRSA.  All females 
who become pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant will be excluded from this study . 
 The placebo ointment which is a white petroleum jelly may cause local reactions, such as burning, stinging, so reness and pruritis.  The placebo body soap  will not have an antibacterial 
properties; it may cause a local skin reaction such as dermatitis.  
 The risk of phlebotomy is excess bleeding, bruising, discomfort at the site of puncture, infection, and rarely “f ainting” (vasovagal syncope).  Phlebotomy is generally considered a minimal risk 
procedure.  Blood draws will be obtained at the same time that laboratories ordered by [CONTACT_4677]’s primary physician are drawn when possible.  Patients will be closely monito red and 
have access to medical care 24 hours a day through the emergency room and Infectious Disease clinic.  
   
18.C.7 Benefits  
 
The benefit of the study includes the possibility of detecting MRSA colonization and clearing it 
to prevent infections from this organism .  The risks of blood draws and topi[INVESTIGATOR_115901] 
(Bactroban®) and hexachlorophen (pHisoHex®) soap or placebo ointment and soap  are low.  A 
study establishing guidelines on screening and decolonization of MRSA among HIV patients 
could lead to better healthcare and fewer soft tissue and MRSA infections in this population.  
 
18.C.[ADDRESS_1205092] be approved by [CONTACT_3799].  
 Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective candidate or the candidate’s legally authorized representative will be given a full explanation of the study and allowed to read the implications of participating in the study, the subject or the represen tative will be asked to give 
consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_1725].  The investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to the subject or the representative.

Emergency deviations or modifications may be initiated without the Sponsor or IRB/ERC approval, only in cases w here the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate apparent hazard.  
Emergency deviations or modifications must be reported to the Sponsor and the IRB or ERC within five business days of the occurrence.  
 
18.C.11 Monitoring of Study sites by [CONTACT_1034] ’s Representative  
 
The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and any applicable regulatory requirements(s).  Monitors under contract to the NIAI D will visit the clinical research site to 
monitor all aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate regulations.  The objectives of a monitoring visit will be:   
1. To verify the prompt reporting of all data points, including reporting SAEs, checking availability of signed informed consent; 
2. To compare individual subjects records, electronic data pulls and the source documents (supporting data, laboratory specimen records and medical records to include physician progress notes, nurse’ notes, subjects ’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]) ; and  
3. To ensure protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records.   
 
The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory 
requirements (OHRP ) and g uidances ( ICH-GCP) are being followed.  During the monitoring 
visits, the investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.   The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g. consent forms, electronic data pulls) and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43561], the FDA, the site monitors and the NIAID staff for confirmation of the study data.

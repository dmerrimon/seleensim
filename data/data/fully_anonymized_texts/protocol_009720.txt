To determine if treatment with alemtuzumab after natalizumab reduces the ARR in patients 
with R RMS.  The goal of this trial is to establish a disease-free state over a 24 months period in 
patients who received the natalizumab-alemtuzumab sequential therapy.  
Secondary objectives:  
To   evaluate the T cell, B cell, and autoreactivity characteristics of immune cells in RRMS 
patients before and after alemtuzumab treatment.  
 
Population :

 Key Efficacy Assessments:  
1. The primary endpoint is the annualized relapse rate (ARR)  from the time of cessation of 
natalizumab treatment . 
2. A key secondary endpoint is freedom of relapse  at 12 months .  
3. A key secondary endpoint is the number of new/enlarging T2 lesions on magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI). 
4. A secondary endpoint is the number of gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing lesions on MRI. 
5. An exploratory  endpoint is the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).  
6. An exploratory  endpoint is retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness assessment by [CONTACT_785776] (OCT).    
7. An exploratory  outcome will be the assessment of quality of life (Q oL) measures by a 
pre-defined, self-administered testing battery.  
 
Key Safety Assessments  
1. To minimize the risk of transitioning MS patients from natalizumab to alemtuzumab who 
already have progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML), all enrolled  patients will 
undergo a brain MRI within [ADDRESS_1080861] day of each treatment 
course and continued for a minimum of 2 months following treatment, or until the CD4 
lymphocyte count is > 200 cells/microliter, whichever occurs later.  
3. There may be an exaggerated cytokine response in some patients. Thus, patients will be monitored and management based on the treating physician’s best judgement from the 
final dose of natalizumab to the end of the first course of alemtuzumab treatment. 
4. Each relapse will be treated with pulse corticosteroids as per best clinical judgment.

6. Five or more Gd + lesions at the 6 month MRI assessment over the baseline assessment 
will result in a follow -up scan after 60 days and will count as one relapse. Should a 
confirmed clinical relapse occur within the 60 day period, it will still count as a single 
relapse.  
7. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using intent -to-treat (ITT) principles for efficacy to 
ensure that safety considerations and withdrawals have not altered results.  
8. Patients who withdraw from study treatment will be observed as mandated by [CONTACT_785777].   
 
Data analysis:  
The sample size of [ADDRESS_1080863] for repeated measures. We will analyze changes 
in T2- hyperintense lesion volume, and RNFL thickness with a ranked AN COVA model. We will 
analyze proportions of patients with new or enlarged T2- hyperintense or Gd
+ lesions with logic 
regression.

 1 Background  
Multiple sclerosis  is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). A pathological 
hallmark of this disorder is the infiltration of immune- competent leukocytes into the brain and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Natalizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha 
(α)4 chain of the integrin very late activation antigen (VLA) -4.  Natalizumab is currently considered the 
most effective approved therapy in reducing clinical and paraclinical MS disease activity. Our 
group has made several novel observations with regard to the pharmacodynamic properties of 
natalizumab:  (1) Compared to controls, natalizumab- treated MS patients had significantly fewer 
white blood cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and CD138 + plasma cells in 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF); (2) CD4 +:CD8 + ratios in the CSF of MS patients treated with 
natalizumab were reversed, and not statistically different from those in HIV -infected controls; (3) 
elevated serum anti -Human Herpesvirus (HHV) -[ADDRESS_1080864] approved in November 2004 for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) 
based on the results of two phase III trials (1 , 2).  Natalizumab blocks the egress of leukocytes 
from the peripheral blood into the CNS.  In the short term, the therapeutic benefits are likely due 
to its effect on lymphocytes as shown by [CONTACT_785778] (3-6 ).  Long-
term, the number of myeloid cells that serve as antigen presenting cells (APC) in perivascular spaces is likely also substantially reduced (7 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_785756], there are two 
observations that have limited the use of natalizumab in patients with MS.

 1.1.1 Opportunistic infections 
Approximately 1:250 patients with MS under natalizumab will develop progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalitis (PML), and infection with the human polyomavirus JC.  This potential side effect has substantially limited the use of an effective therapy.  An algorithm was recently developed to estimate PML incidence in MS patients considering or receiving natalizumab 
based on duration of natalizumab treatment (1-24 or 25-48 months), prior immunosuppr essant 
use (yes or no), and anti -JCV antibody status (positive or negative) (8 ).  Based upon the two 
established ri sk factors for PML, PML risk was lowest in patients treated with natalizumab for 1-
24 months without prior immunosuppressant use, (0.19 cases per 1000 patients), and greatest 
in those with both risk factors, natalizumab treatment for 25-48 months and prior  
immunosuppressant use (4.3 cases per 1000).  When anti -JCV antibody status was included as 
a third risk factor, PML risk was lowest in patients who were anti -JCV antibody negative (0.11 
per 1000), and highest in patients with all three factors, (11 per 1000).  The most recent data indicate that  MS patients on natalizumab with all three risk factors appear have a risk of 1:44 to 
develop PML (9 , 10). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1080865] were generated by O’Connor et al, who analyzed clinical relapses in 1,866 patients, and gadolinium 
(Gd)-enhancing lesions in 341 patients from the AFFIRM, SENTINEL, and GLANCE studies of 
natalizumab, and their respective safety extension studies ( 11).  Annualized relapse rates and 
Gd lesions both increased shortly after natalizumab interruption and peaked between 4 and 7 months.  A consistent return of disease activity was observed regardless of overall natalizumab 
exposure, whether or not patients received alternative MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and in patients with highly 
active MS disease.  
The return of disease activity may be explained by [CONTACT_785779].  Leukcoytes 
are sequestered out of the CNS into the peripheral blood, where they assume a more inflammatory phenotype.  Krumbholz et al. demonstrated that natalizumab therapy increased 
CD19
+ mature B cells in peripheral blood 2-3-fold more than that of other lymphocytes and 
monocytes compared to pre-treatment levels (12).  The increase of immature CD19+CD10+ pre-
B cells in peripheral blood was 7.4-fold.  This pattern remained stable during treatment for up to 
16 months.  Kivisakk et al showed that the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing interferon 
gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin (IL) -17 upon anti -CD3 stimulation 
increased 6 months after initiation of natalizumab treatment and remained elevated throughout

STU112016- 060, Stuve, Form A, Mod_10, 06 -14-19 (1)    11 
 the follow -up (13).  The frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing CD25, HLA -DR, and CCR6 ex 
vivo was increased at one or more time points during treatment.  Our lab showed in a cohort of 
23 patients that return of clinical disease activity in patients who stopped taking natalizumab 
correlated with the re-constitution of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (5 ). 
1.2 Alemtuzumab in RRMS  
Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal therapeutic antibody that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_785757]52+ 
cells.  Alemtuzumab is effective in ameliorating MS disease activity.  In the CARE- MS I phase III 
trial, a 55 % relapse rate reduction with alemtuzumab (12 mg/d) over interferon-beta (IFNβ) was 
observed for alemtuzumab treated patients after 24 months (14).  Significantly more (78 %) alemtuzumab treated patients remained relapse-free at month 24 compared with 59 % of 
IFNb1a-treated patients, which equates to a 55 % risk reduction.  In the CARE -MS II phase III 
trial a 49 % reduction in relapse rate was observed in patients treated with alemtuzumab (12 
mg/d) compared with those treated with IFNβ -1a over the two years (15).  Significantly more 
alemtuzumab treated patients remained relapse-free at month [ADDRESS_1080866] be inferred by [CONTACT_785780].   
Recent data from an Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) trial that tested autologous 
hematopoietic  stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with very aggressive MS (HALT trial) 
showed that the reconstitution of the T cell receptor repertoire predicts treatment responses: 
• Patients who failed treatment had a significantly less diverse TCR (CD4
+ and CD8+) 
at [ADDRESS_1080867]-transplant than “others”  
• Treatment effectively reduced dominant baseline CD4+ TCR clones, did not reduce 
dominant CD8 TCR clones  
• Patients who recovered CD8+ T cells at year 1 had a less diverse CD8+ TCR 
repertoire 
• The reconstituted CD8+ T cell repertoire was dominated by [CONTACT_785781] – alemtuzumab therapy trial  
Confidential Version 1.0  12 
 
STU112016- 060, Stuve, Form A, Mod_10, 06 -14-19 (1)    12 
 • There was up to a 100% “renewal” (ablated new) of the CD4+ T cell repertoire;  
there was less renewal within the CD8+ T cell repertoire 
• Treatment resulted in a “new” Top 100 CD4+ TCR repertoire at [ADDRESS_1080868] a 
complete re-constitution of the lymphocyte compartment that is driven by [CONTACT_419617]34+ 
bone marrow cells.  As stated above, alemtuzumab targets CD52, which is a 12-amino-acid glycosylated GPI-bound membrane protein (16, 17).  CD52 is  expressed on a number of cells 
derived from the lympho-monocytic cell lineage, including T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and most monocytes and macrophages.  By [CONTACT_22242], neutrophils and precursors 
cells of the hematopoietic  lineage do not express CD52 (18-20).  The exact biological function of 
CD52 is not fully understood; CD52 binding may induce T cell activation, and CD52 may be a 
stimulatory co -factor required for regulatory T cells (Treg) ( 18, 19).  Alemtuzumab depletes 
CD52
+ cells through ADCC and likely also through activation of the complement cascade (20-
23).  Cellular depletion is initiated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_785758]52+ 
cells from the circulation shortly after alemtuzumab administration.  Experimentally, complement -mediated cell lysis of leukemic B cells occurs within 1-4 hours after addition of 
alemtuzumab in vitro (24 ).  Lympho-monocytic cells in the periphery are eventually repopulated 
from pools of stem cells and certain progenitor cells that do not constitutively express CD52.  
Monocytes and B cells reach pre-alemtuzumab levels in the peripheral blood approximately 
three to six months after treatment, with B cell levels exceeding baseline levels by 124-165%  
(21, 22, 25, 26).  T cells repopulate considerably slower; CD8
+ T cells reach baseline levels only 
after a median of 30 months, and CD4+ T cells after a median of 61 months (21).  The lower 
limits of normal for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are reached earlier with medians of 12 and 11 
months, respectively (27 ).  It is particularly noteworthy that Tregs repopulate distinctly before 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in their specific enrichment in the peripheral blood (21 , 26). 
1.3 A potentiation of efficacy through sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy 
Natalizumab treatment sequesters leukocytes out of the CNS into the peripheral blood.  
Immediate sequential alemtuzumab therapy will deplete these cells more completely than alemtuzumab monotherapy, and prevent reactivation of disease activity previously treated with natalizumab. Thus, 
we hypothesize that sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy will 
prevent disease activation after cessation of natalizumab, and will provide sustained disease

used to collect, store, and report participant information.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1080869] patient safety will be reported within 7 days to the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616]. Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be minimized via eligibility criteria checks prior to initiation of alemtuzumab therapy . 
 
5.5 Premature patient withdrawal  
Patients may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of the informed consent  
• Lost to follow- up  
• Withdrawal at the investigator's discretion  
Patients should be withdrawn at any time if the investigator concludes that it would be in the 
patients' best interest for any reason. Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any 
reason at any time.  They may be considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, or 
fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow up for any other reason. Protocol violations should 
not lead to patient withdrawal unless they indicate a significant risk to t he patient's safety. If 
premature patient withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must determine the primary 
reason for a patient's premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on a CRF. 
For patients who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those patients whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdrawal), the investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_268295], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. In the case of death, a patient will be considered withdrawn. Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.

6.1 Patient numbering 
Patients will be assigned a unique study number upon signing the informed consent form 
(PID#1). The PID#1 is used during screening. The numbering will be designated based on the 
recruitment site and will follow the convention: ccc -pppp, where ccc represents center and pppp 
participant. The PID#1 is numeric for the center and alphanumeric for the participant.  Patients 
will retain their PID#1 regardless of whether they enter the treatment arm of the trial or 
subsequently withdrawal. PID#2 will be assigned at randomization and has the form ccc -
ppppp.  PID#2 is numeric for the center and 5 digit numeric field for the participant. Assignment 
of PID#1 will be performed by [CONTACT_785782]. Assignment of PID#2 will be performed by [CONTACT_785783].  
 
6.2 Investigational drug  
Alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada

consent document .  
6.4.11 Grading of adverse event  
Toxicity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_785785]. The principal investigator (PI) has adopted the use of the National Cancer 
Institute's manual  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE; published June 
10, 2003) for application in adverse event reporting. The purpose of using the CTCAE system is to 
provide a standard language to describe toxicities, to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data, and to facilitate the assessmen t of the clinical significance of all adverse events. The CTCAE 
provides the following grades and descriptions in the CTCAE manual (v3.0). Adverse events 
should be recorded and graded 1 to 5 according to the CTCAE grades provided below:  
Grade 1 = Mild adverse event  
Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event  
Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event  
Grade 4 = Life- threatening or disabling adverse event  
Grade 5 = Death  
Note: In contrast to the CTCAE guidelines provided the National Cancer I nstitute's Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (published June 10, 2003) all adverse events are to 
be reported and graded whether or not they are related to disease progression or treatment.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_1080878] is 
determined by [CONTACT_785786]/or SAE 
reporting form. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) provides the 
following descriptors and definitions (one category classified as unrelated [Code 1] and 4 categories classified as related [Codes 2- 5]) for assigning an attribution to each adverse event   
(for most recent update of terminology see 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-
06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf ). 
The investigator's determination of drug- relatedness (attribution) for each adverse event  
should be recorded in the source documentation.  
6.4.13 Serious adverse event reporting 
The following process for reporting a serious adverse event will ensure appropriate compliance with the ICH guidelines  (http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/quality/article/quality -
guidelines.html) .

STU112016- 060, Stuve, Form A, Mod_10, 06 -14-19 (1)    25 
 When an investigator identifies a serious adverse event (as defined above), he or she must notify 
the principal investigator, the IRB, and Genzyme pharmacovigilance.  In addition to telephone 
reporting, these events must be entered on the Serious Adverse Event Form (MedWatch) . 
6.4.14 Study drug discontinuation 
At the initial clinic visit, study patients will be made aware of potential side effects of alemtuzumab. At each patient visit, patients will be inquired about any of these side effects. Should it be felt by 
[CONTACT_785787], the offending therapeutic intervention will be terminated.  
6.4.15 Pregnancy (SAE reporting requirements)  
Any pregnancy that occurs during a clinical study with an investigational drug must be repor ted as 
an SAE for tracking purposes only. All pregnancies that are identified during this study need to be followed to conclusion and the outcome reported. Female participants should immediately 
inform the investigator of pregnancies and future treatment options should be discussed .  
The site investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours (as described above in 
SAE Reporting) using the SAE form. The site investigator should counsel the participant and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the participant should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, and a follow -up 
SAE reporting form should be submitted detailing the outcome.

This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practice (GCP), adopting the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_785788] (IRB). Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must also be approved before they are 
implemented.

become more sensitive to sunlight, the drops may cause a slight stinging sensation upon 
administration, and vision may be blurry for up to four hours after initial dilation.  
7.5.6 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The C -SSRS is used extensively across primary care, clinical practice, surveillance, research, 
and institutional settings. It is a suicidal ideation  rating scale  to evaluate suicidality in ages 12 
and up. It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from "wish to be 
dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent." This will be administered by 
[CONTACT_3647]. See Appendix 3.  
 7.5.7 Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL)  
This is a self -administered assessment of quality of life. It measures the pleasure one derives from 
being able to do their work well, feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in dealing with work or 
in doing their job effectively, and work -related, secondary exposure to extremely stressful 
events. See Appendix 4.

8 Data Analysis 
The sample size of 40 patients was chosen to obtain a result that would be seen as meaningful 
by [CONTACT_330455].  Disease activity is expected to be extremely low on natalizumab and subsequently on alemtuzumab.  Thus, it will be impossible to power a superiority or non-inferiority study. 
All outcome measures will be assessed in the 12 months prior to natalizumab, on 
natalizumab, and on alemtuzumab.  We will control secondary endpoints for multiple comparisons by [CONTACT_785793]-free patients, EDSS change, and T2-hyperintense lesion volume change. 
The analysis of the acquired standardized imaging data will include a qualitative 
assessment of structural features suggestive of progressive multi -focal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), T2 -weighted lesion volumes, T1-weighted lesion volumes, a determination of new or 
enlarging T2 foci, the presence of acute blood brain barrier compromise and number of identified contrast enhanced lesions, and an assessment of brain volumetric changes by [CONTACT_785794] [ADDRESS_1080891] for repeated measures.  We will 
analyze changes in T2-hyperintense lesion volume, and RNFL thickness with a rank ed 
ANCOVA model.  We will analyse proportions of patients with new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions or Gd+ lesions, and those who were free from disease activity, with logistic regression.

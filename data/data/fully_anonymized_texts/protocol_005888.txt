Study Title: Nighttime post ural care: Caregiver training program and outcome measure 
feasibility  
Researcher(s): Jennifer Hutson MS, OTR/L, ATP  
You are invited to participate in a research study called “Nighttime postural care: Caregiver 
training and outcome measure feasibility”. T he study is being done by [CONTACT_846396], an 
assistant professor of occupational therapy at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, MN along 
with select students in the Master of Arts in Occupational Therapy program (MAOT).  
The purpose of this research stu dy is to 1. Examine the feasibility of a sleep care 
positioning training program, 2. Understand if one type of training is better than another, and 
3. Understand the usefulness of an assessment that measures sleep issues. This study will 
allow researchers to understand if care providers (professional and non -professional) feel 
competent or capable in applying the sleep care positioning intervention to their child or 
client after receiving a specific training program. This study is important because it will help 
researchers determine if the training program and sleep assessment can be used in a future 
intervention study, ultimately having the potential to benefit postural care providers and 
clients. Approximately [ADDRESS_1176813] I been asked to be in this study?  
You have been chosen because you:  
• • Have a child or client with Cerebral Palsy or impaired movement (i.e. uses 
wheelchair)  
 
AND/OR  
• • Care for child whom might benefit from the sleep care positioning intervention  
 
AND/OR  
• • Care for a child whose position during lying might affect sleep, pain, body shape or 
quality of life  
 
If I decide to participate, what will I be asked to do?  
If you meet the criteria and agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following:  
• • Complete baseline questionnaire (15 minutes)  
• • Complete one of two different sleep care positioning training programs. Learn 
about how to care for a child using the nighttime postural care intervention. Communicate 
information about the sleep habits and  routines of your child or  
 
 
• client (2 -3 hours). Because we don’t know for sure which of the two trainings are 
better, you will be randomly assigned to one of the two trainings.  
• • Answer questions about the information to find out what you learned (10 mi nutes)  
• • Demonstrate positioning of a researcher in the sleep care positioning system (30 
minutes)  
• • Complete a post -training questionnaire where you will provide feedback about the 
training program (15 minutes)  
 
In total, we estimate the study will tak e up to 8 hours.  
What if I decide I don’t want to be in this study?  
Participation in this study is completely voluntary. If you decide you do not want to 
participate in this study, please say so, and do not sign this form. If you decide to participate 
in this study, but later change your mind and want to withdraw, simply notify Jennifer 
Hutson, and you will be removed immediately. Your decision of whether or not to participate 
will have no negative or positive impact on your relationship with St. Catherin e University, 
nor with any of the students or faculty involved in the research.  
What are the risks (dangers or harms) to me if I am in this study?  
Risks due to participation in this research study are unlikely. Potential for harm is no greater 
than what may occur when providing care to a child during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_846394].  
The information and feedback you provide in the questionnaires will be confidential and 
results will be presented in a way in which no one will be identifiable.  
You will only be asked to demonstrate tasks that are considered safe for a care provider to 
use in the home or workplace. Injury or discomfort during application of the intervention is 
unlikely. One aspect of the in -person session involves positioning one of the researc hers in 
the sleep system. Please let us know if you think the positioning task could present a 
physical risk for you.  
In the event that this research activity results in an injury, we will assist you by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_846395] (for ex ample, if you pull a muscle we will assist you in 
calling your medical professional). Any medical care for research -related injuries should be 
paid by [CONTACT_846397]. If you think you have suffered a research -related 
injury, please let us kn ow right away.  
What are the benefits (good things) that may happen if I am in this study?  
You will gain knowledge about the nighttime postural care intervention. This training may 
provide you with new ideas / ways to support your child or client during s leep.  
Will I receive any compensation for participating in this study?  
You will receive a $[ADDRESS_1176814] my

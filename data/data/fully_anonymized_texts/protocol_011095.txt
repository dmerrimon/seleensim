Page  | 1 Efficacy and Safety of H.P. Acthar gel for the treatment of refractory cutaneous 
manifestations of dermatomyositis

Introduction   
 
     Adult and juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) are systemic immune -mediated inflammatory diseases most 
commonly affecting the skin and musculoskeletal system.  Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a subtype of 
dermatomyositis that affects only the skin and lacks the characteristic muscle involvement.  Treatment of 
these conditions, in particular the cutaneous manifestations, is challenging and currently no universally 
effective single treatment exists.  Many patients have cutaneous manifestations that are refractory to 
numerous medications ( 1, 2). 
Background and Significance  
     H.P. Acthar gel (adrenocorticotropic hormone gel) received FDA approval for treatment of a variety of 
diseases, including dermatomyositis, in 1952.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_659503] a paucity of clinical data concerning 
the efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel for treating dermatomyositis.  Recently a small, retrospective case series 
describing significant improvement in both cutaneous and musculoskeletal symptoms in [ADDRESS_910751] 
in use of this medication in dermatomyositis patients ( 3).  The proposed efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel has 
been attributed to its unique ability to induce production of endogenous cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, and to bind melanocortin receptors on lymphocytes and other cells to modulate immunologic 
responses.  Our hypothesis is that H.P. Acthar gel will be safe and effective for treating the cutaneous 
manifestations of dermatomyositis in patients with refractory classic dermatomyositis, juvenile 
dermatomyositis, and amyopathic dermatomyositis.

Research Procedures   
 
1)  Upon enrollment patients will undergo a thorough history (including assessing time of diagnosis), 
review of systems, and a complete physical examination. 
2) A detailed examination of the skin and mucous membranes will be performed, noting for 
presence/absence of the following: scalp erythema and atrophy, heliotrope rash, typi[INVESTIGATOR_673871]-exposed areas on the neck, upper chest and upper back (shawl sign), erythema +/- scaling 
of the elbows and/or knees (Gottron’s sign), gottron’s papules, periungual erythema, ragged cuticles, 
proximal nailfold capi[INVESTIGATOR_434473], palmar scaling and hyperkeratosis (mechanic’s hands), a rash involving 
the hips (holster sign), oral ulcerations, cutaneous ulcerations, purpura. 
3)  Objective cutaneous dermatomyositis scoring by [CONTACT_673875] (CDASI) score and Abbreviated 
Cutaneous Assessment Tool  (aCAT) will be performed at each visit ( 8-13). 
4)  Objective general cutaneous disease scoring by [CONTACT_673876] (a) overall skin  (b) skin activity  (c) skin damage  will be performed at each visit ( each 
assessed using both VAS-0-10 visual analog scale and Likert scale- 0- 4 for each ) (9).  
5)  Objective scoring tools to be completed by [CONTACT_673877]:  Patient Global 
Assessment  (Skin) Score (0-10 visual analog scale ), Patient Global ( Itch) Score (0-10 visual analog 
scale),  and the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( validated quality of life assessment) (8-12).  
6) Photographs of all cutaneous lesions will be performed at baseline and at each follow-up visit.  
7) Evaluation for current presence of myositis will be performed using the Manual Muscle Testing 8 
(MMT -8) scoring tool by [CONTACT_34351], as well as with serologic studies below ( 11, 12).  
8) Completion of the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool  (MDAAT) by [CONTACT_673878] ( 12). 
9) Serologic studies at baseline will include an AM cortisol level, CBC w/ diff, CMP, CK, aldolase, LDH, comprehensive myositis panel (ARUP labs), C3, C4, and HbA1c.  The above serologic studies (except for 
the comprehensive myositis panel) will be repeated at the final visit.

Page  | 5 10) Patients may continue their current immunosuppressive treatment regimens at the time of starting 
H.P. Acthar.  If it is felt that patients should taper off of medications they will require a washout period:  
- corticosteroids - 2weeks  
- methotrexate/azathioprine/mycophenolate/cyclosporine/sirolimus - 4 weeks  
- adalimumab/infliximab/IVIG/chlorambucil/cyclophosphamide - 8 weeks  
- rituximab - 6 months.   
They will be instructed to continue topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], moisturizers, and sunscreen based on their current practice, which will be recorded at baseline and during subsequent visits. 
11) All patients will receive 80 U (1  mL) of H.P. Acthar gel via subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 
24 weeks (approximately 6 months).  12) Patients will require follow -up visits in person at 1mo  (+/- 5 days ), 3mo  (+/- 5 days ), and 6mo ( +/- 
5 days ) after initiation of the H.P. Acthar, at which time examinations and clinical scoring tool 
assessments will be repeated.   
13)  If corticosteroids are continued in patients receiving H.P. Acthar gel they will be tapered at the 
primary investigator’s discretion based on clinical evaluation at follow -up appointments. 
14)  H.P. Acthar will be discontinued in any given patient at the primary investigator’s discretion if deemed necessary for the patient’s overall health and well -being at any point during the study.

Data Analysis 
Access to Data will be limited to the P.I., research coordinator, and research nurse. Approval from the 
IRB to allow access to data will be sought via an IRB amendment application if any additional research 
personnel are added to the study. 
Confidentiality of patients will be protected by [CONTACT_673879]. 
Results of the study will be reported in aggregate and anonymously 
Statistical analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_673880]: 
Statistical Methods  
Patient and disease characteristics will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians and 
other percentiles of interest for continuous measures and frequencies and percentages for categorical 
factors.  Changes in scoring tool measures from baseline to six months will be calculated and compared 
using paired t-tests.  If necessary, transformations of the data will be performed prior to analysis to meet 
distributional assumptions.   If proper transformations cannot be found, then nonparametric Wilcoxon 
Protocol Version Date 7/30/14  
 
Page  | [ADDRESS_910754] models will be 
fit and estimates of the average change per month will be calculated.  Analysis will be performed using 
SAS software (The SAS Institute ; Cary, NC).  A significance level of 0.05 will be assumed for all tests. 
 
Sample Size Considerations  
The primary assessment tool will be the CDASI.  Scores for the modified CDASI range from 0 to 100 for 
activity, 0 to 32 for damage, and 0 to132 for the total score.  In the paper by [CONTACT_673881] (2010), investigators 
found a mean (SD) activity score of 17.83 (10.14), a mean (SD) damage score of 2.27 (2.73), and a mean 
(SD) total score of 20.10 (10.25).  Given the apparent skewed distributions for these scores, a log- normal 
distribution for the scores was assumed.  In these distributions, a coefficient of variation (CV = SD/Mean) of 0.6 appears appropriate for activity and total scores, while a CV of 1.25 was assumed for comparisons 
of total score.  The  required sample size for each scale to achieve 80% power to detect 25%, 50%, and 
75% decreases in CDASI scores, based on the assumptions above, and assuming use of two-sided paired t-tests on log-transformed values.  These calculations further assume that a small positive correlation 
(r=0.25) between baseline and 6-month scores within person, and use of a 0.[ADDRESS_910755] a 50% decrease in the mean CDASI activity score 
or CDASI total score with 80% power.  This sample size would allow adequate power to detect decreases 
of at least 70% in the mean damage score.  Eight patients would be required to detect a 75% decrease in 
the mean damage score.   
Adverse Events and Data Monitoring Committee(DMC)  
• Patients will be instructed to call immediately with any adverse events.  All adverse events will be recorded during the administration of H.P. Acthar.  Any serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the appropriate contact [CONTACT_673882], as well as to the IRB  in accordance with 
their policy. 
• A DMC will not be used because H.P. Acthar is an approved drug for treatment of dermatomyositis.  
Protocol Version Date 7/30/14  
 
Page  | 9 • A DRC is not planned given that Acthar is currently used in clinical medicine to treat multiple 
sclerosis and has a well -known adverse effect profile with low risk of significa nt adverse 
events.  
• An interim analysis is not planned . 
Consent  
Consent will be obtained in a clinical setting by a member of the study team at the time of planned enrollment.  Children under the age of 18 and non-English speaking subjects will not be enrolled in this 
clinical study.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Visit 1 (Day  1): Screening/Baseline.  The following will be obtained at this 
visit: signed written informed consent/assent (or re -consent/assent if 
washout period exceeds 45 days), c onfirmation of eligibility, medical 
history, demographics, review of concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], dermatologic exam, vital signs (with height and 
weight), a UPT for WOCBP, clinical evaluations (IGA and lesion counts), 
local skin reacti on (LSR) assessment, and standardized photography of the 
face. Qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment 
groups (GDC 268, Reference Product, or GDC Vehicle). Randomization will 
be blocked from a centralized schedule and stratif ied by [CONTACT_154562] -
inflammatory lesions (≤70 / > 70) present at the Baseline visit. Subject kits 
will be dispensed according to the kit number assigned by [CONTACT_538679] (IWRS) as subjects are enrolled. Test article application 
will be demonstrated using the non -medicated samples provided to the site 
and, as part of training, the subject will apply the non -medicated sample in 
the clinic under staff supervision to ensure proper application. The subject 
will be instructed not to open  study supplies at the site. Test article will be 
dispensed along with application instructions, and a Subject Diary will be 
provided to document applied or missed doses. Subjects will be instructed to 
apply the test article twice daily, once in the mornin g and once in the 
evening, for [ADDRESS_701891] will be scheduled for a follow -up telephone call.  
 
Visit 2 (Week 2): Follow -Up Telephone Call. The site staff will contact [CONTACT_538680], review the Subject Diary and 
test article compliance, review of concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and query the subject about AEs. The site staff will 
remind the subject to continue to apply test ar ticle twice daily, once in the 
morning and once in the evening and to bring all bottles (used and unused) 
of test article with him/her to the next clinic visit and to not apply test article 
or other products to the face within 4 hours of the next clinic vi sit. Subjects 
with tolerability issues or a material AE concern of any type may be seen for 
an in -office follow -up as an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
Visits 3 and 4 (Weeks 4 and 8): Follow -Up. The subject will return to the 
clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
LSRs, and AEs. Clinical evaluations (IGA and lesion counts) will be 
performed. The Subject Diary will be reviewed/collected/distributed as 
necessary and test article compliance will be rev iewed; the site staff will 
remind the subject to continue to apply test article twice daily, once in the 
morning and once in the evening, until the next clinic visit and to not apply 
test article or other products to the face within [ADDRESS_701892] will be scheduled for 
the next visit.

be collected. The subject will exit the study.  
 
Unscheduled Visit.  The investigator may see the subject at an unscheduled 
visit to manage any AEs or LSRs  (if applicable). The subject will return to 
the clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
LSRs, and AEs. The Subject Diary and test article compliance will be 
reviewed. The subject’s next appointment will be confirmed.  
Study Measurements  Dosing Compliance:  
Measures of test article compliance will include the duration (days) of 
treatment (defined as last dose date – first dose date +1), the total number of 
applications applied and missed (determined from the doses reported in t he 
Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied . A subject will be 
considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
75% and no more than 125% of the expected test article applications for the 
specified duration of t he study and does not miss the scheduled applications 
for more than 3 consecutive days.  
 
Efficacy and safety measurements will be assessed according to the schedule 
of events.  
 
Efficacy : 
Investigator’s Global Assessment  
Overall severity of acne will be ass essed using a five -point scale where 
0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, and 4=Severe. This is a 
static morphological scale that refers to a point in time and not a comparison 
to Baseline.  
 
Acne Lesion Counts  
The number of non -inflammatory lesions  (open and closed comedones) and 
inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) on the face (including those 
present on the nose) will be counted. Counts of nodules and cysts will be 
reported separately and are not to be included in the inflammatory or non -
inflammatory lesion counts.  
 
Safety:  
Adverse Events  
All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will 
also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs. 
Untoward events that occur prior to the first dose of test ar ticle will be 
captured in the Medical History section of the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) unless they are related to a study -specific procedure.  
 
Local Skin Reactions  
At each visit, LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, 
pruritus, erosion, and pain) will be assessed. Erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, and erosion will be assessed by [CONTACT_538681]/burning, pain, and pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_423]. 
Assessments will be made using a 4 -point ordinal scale where 0 =absent, 
1=mild (slight, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 
3=severe (marked, intense). Only LSRs that require medical intervention

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding or discontinuation of the 
application of the test  article, or extend 2  cm beyond the Treatment Area will 
be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded 
as an AE.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] r ate will be measured at Visit  1/Baseline. Assessments 
will be made after the subject has rested in a seated position for at least 5 
minutes. Height and weight will also be measured at Visit  1/Baseline.  
 
Urine Pregnancy Tests  
A UPT will be performed at Visi t 1/Baseline and at Visit 5/Week 12/EOS 
for WOCBP.  
Study Endpoints  Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory 
(papules and pustules) lesion count.  
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non -inflammat ory 
(open and closed comedones) lesion count.  
 
Safety Endpoints:  
 Incidence (severity and causality) of any reported or observed 
treatment emergent AEs, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the test article.  
 Number of subjects with improved/ same versus worsened 
severities compared to Baseline of the following LSRs: erythema, 
edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, pruritus, erosion, and 
pain at each onsite treatment visit.  
Sample Size 
Calculations  Based on the assumption of a 40% reduction  in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions counts for the Reference Product and a 38% reduction 
for GDC 268, 346 PP subjects per active arm will provide 85% probability 
of demonstrating therapeutic equivalence between the two active treatments 
at an alp ha=0.05 (two one -sided tests) with 90% confidence interval bounds 
of the ratio of means being 0.08 and 1.25. Assuming a 25% reduction in 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesions counts for the VEH, [ADDRESS_701893] an 85% probability of demonstrating that 
each active treatment is statistically superior to vehicle treatment at a two -
sided alpha of 0.05. Therefore, approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled 
using a 2:2:1 randomization ratio (GDC 268:Reference Product:VEH) to 
obtain a total of 1155 mITT subjects and 865 PP subjects.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 unless 
otherwise stated.  
 
Study Population s: 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least 
one dose of test article.

Page 11 of 66 
 
CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  The mITT population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least 
one dose of test article.  
 
The PP population will include all mITT subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with the assigned test articles 
based on the subject diaries  (applied at least 75% and no more than 125% of 
the expected test article applications for the specified duration of the study), 
did not miss the scheduled test article applications for more than 3 consecutive 
days (i.e., [ADDRESS_701894] article application), have no other 
evidence of material dosing noncompliance,  and completed the primary 
endpoint evaluation at Week  12 within the designated visit window (Day 85 ± 
4 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation 
including use of the prohibited medications .  
 
Subject randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_154562] -inflammatory 
lesion s (≤70 / >70) present at the Baseline Visit in order to ensure balanced 
enrollment of subjects across the treatment groups by [CONTACT_105] -inflammatory 
lesion count. No subset analyses are planned based on baseline non -
inflammatory lesion counts.  
 
Dosing Compliance : 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance for 
each analysis population. Compliant subjects are defined as those who apply 
at least 75% and no more than 125% of the expected test article applications, 
and did not miss schedu led applications for more than 3 consecutive days. 
The percentage of compliant subjects will be also presented.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the mITT and PP populations.  
 
Primary Endpoints  
For each of the co -primary endpoi nts (percent change from Baseline at Week 
12 in the inflammatory lesion counts and in the non -inflammatory lesion 
counts), the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the mean percent 
reduction in lesion counts between the GDC [ADDRESS_701895] group will be assessed in the PP population. If the 90% confidence 
intervals are contained within the interval [0.8, 1.25] for both inflammatory 
and non -inflammatory lesions, bioequivalence between GDC [ADDRESS_701896] VEH group at an 
alpha=0.05 (p<0.05) in the mITT population u sing last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) imputation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
factor of treatment in the statistical model using original percent change 
values.  
 
If the distribution of percent change from Baseline in the lesion counts ar e 
significantly skewed, the analyses will be performed based on rank 
transformed data.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  1. BACKGROUND 
Acne vulgaris (AV) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis notable for open or closed 
comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory lesions, including papules, 
pustules, or nodules (also known as cysts). Lesions are most common on the face, but the 
neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders may also be affected. Acne is a common skin 
disease, especially in adolescents and young adults. Approximately [ADDRESS_701908] AV [ 1]. Acne affects approximately 89% of teenagers, but can occur 
in m
ost age groups [ 2]  and can persist into adulthood.  
 
Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease affecting the pi[INVESTIGATOR_538651]. The current understanding of acne pathogenesis is continuously evolving. Key 
pathogenic factors that play an important role in the development of acne are follicular 
hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization with Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , sebum 
production, and complex inflammatory mechanisms involving both innate and acquired 
immunity. In addition, studies have suggested that neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms, 
diet, and genetic and nongenetic factors all may contribute to the multifactorial process of 
acne pathogenesis [ 3]. 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538652]. Clindamycin belongs to a class of 
medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_538653]. Clindamycin has a primarily 
bacteriostatic effect. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor that inhibits ribosomal 
translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by [CONTACT_53167] 50S rRNA of the 
large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_538654], 
pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538655]: a foam, a gel, a solution (liquid), a lotion, and a pledget (swab) to

C
lindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% (Cleocin T) was approved by [CONTACT_34033] [ADDRESS_701909] (GREENSTONE® BRAND). The FDA-approved regimen 
for the treatment of acne vulgaris is application of clindamycin phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_42968], 
1% twice daily to the affected area. A generic clindamycin phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_42968], 1% 
(GDC 268) has been developed by [CONTACT_538684], LLC for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_538656]. 
2. RA TIONALE 
Gage Development Company, LLC has developed GDC 268, a generic clindamycin 
phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_42968], 1% formulation, and the current clinical study is designed to 
evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of this formulation with the currently marketed 
Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% (GREENSTONE® BRAND), the reference 
product. The dosage form, dosing frequency, treatment duration, and study design are

Drugs recommendation for a bioequivalence study with a clinical endpoint in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris with topi[INVESTIGATOR_538657], 1% [ 4]. 
3. OB JECTIVE 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic equivalence 
of GDC 268 to Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% and to compare the efficacy of 
these two products to the GDC vehicle lotion (i.e., placebo) in the treatment of acne 
vulgaris. 
4. S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
comparison study of GDC 268 and Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% 
(GREEENSTONE® BRAND) in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female 
subjects 12 to 40 years of age (inclusive) with facial acne vulgaris. Eligible subjects must 
have a clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris with an Investigator’s Global Assessment 
(IGA) score of at least 2 (mild), a minimum of 25 but no more than 100 non-inflammatory 
lesions (open and closed comedones), a minimum of 20 but no more than 70 inflammatory 
lesions (papules and pustules) and ≤2 nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the face 
a
t Baseline. Approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 50 study sites. 
Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups on a 2:2:1 basis as follows:  
 
1. GD C 268 (Gage) (generic clindamycin phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_42968]) 
2. C lindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% (GREEENSTONE® BRAND) 
(Reference Product) 
3. GD C Vehicle (Gage) 
 
All subjects will be instructed to apply the assigned test article twice daily to the entire 
face, once in the morning and once in the evening, for [ADDRESS_701910] of 
a Screening/Baseline Visit, a follow-up telephone call at Week 2, and follow-up visits at 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12/End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET). An unscheduled in-
office follow-up visit may be completed at the discretion of the investigator for subjects 
with tolerability issues or a material adverse event (AE) concern. At EOS, safety and 
efficacy outcome measures will be compared to a) determine if treatment with GDC 268 i s 
clinically equivalent to the currently marketed Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% 
and b) both clindamycin phosphate 1% topi[INVESTIGATOR_538658].

6.3 War nings, Precautions, and Contraindications 
The safety information in this section is derived from the US Prescribing Information for 
Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_538646], 1% reference product (GREEENSTONE® 
BRAND). 
6.3.1 Contraindications 
Clindamycin phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_538661] a history of 
hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin, a history of 
regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis. 
6.3.2 Warnings 
Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis 
which may result in patient death. Use of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_538662]. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis 
(including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_538663]. 
 
Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by [CONTACT_538687]-
associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by [CONTACT_538688]. 
Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. Stool culture for 
Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   
When significant diarrhea occurs, the test article should be discontinued. Large bowel 
endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe 
diarrhea. 
 
Antiperistaltic agents such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_538664]/or 
worsen the condition. Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of 
antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C . difficile . The usual adult 
dosage is [ADDRESS_701926] milk. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse 
effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is 
required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate 
drug may be preferred. Monitor the infant for possible adverse effects on the 
gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in 
the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.

d according to the kit number assigned by [CONTACT_53804] 
(IWRS) as subjects are enrolled. Treatment group designation will remain blinded until the 
final database is locked (see Section 15).  
 
A 
sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study site and should 
be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of 
the treatment identity of each subject. 
8. P RIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_538666] 30 days prior to the start of the study 
(Baseline) will be recorded as prior/concomitant medications with the dose (in source

14. AD VERSE EVENT REPORTING 
14.[ADDRESS_701936] article related.  
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of 
the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. For the purposes of 
prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, 
reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological 
action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Reference Product package insert or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by 
[CONTACT_14213]) if the IB Reference Product package insert referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Reference Product 
package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
Reference Product package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  14.[ADDRESS_701937] article or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in 
the study should receive follow-up as appropriate. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible) and, if they become serious, reported as serious adverse events 
(SAEs, see Section 14.3 ). If possible, the outcome of any AEs that caused permanent 
discontinuation or that were present at the end of the study, especially those considered by 
[CONTACT_28259], should be reported. 
 
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s 
written informed consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be 
taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of 
subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless an event occurred as a 
result of a study-related procedure and is unanticipated; in such cases, the event should be 
recorded as an AE and reported to the IRB as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance 
with local procedures. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when 
the subject begins dosing with the test article; therefore AE data should be collected from 
the date of the first dose of test article until the date of the final study visit. These data are 
considered treatment-emergent AEs. 
 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. 
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall health status since the previous visit. 
 
The severity of each AE, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be recorded on the appropriate 
AE eCRF and will be graded according to the following scale: 
 
Mild - The AE is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living. 
 
Moderate - The AE is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant. 
 
Severe  - The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories: 
 
Related  – There is a strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to 
test article usage.

The investigator should categorize the outcome of the AE according to the following 
categories: 
 
Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE. 
 
Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
 
Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_538675], it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath; the event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
 Life-threatening event; an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event and not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had 
been more severe.

judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
 Hospit alizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen; and

related or unrelated to test article, must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than [ADDRESS_701939] Manager (see contact 
[CONTACT_31307]).  Written notification of all SAEs should be sent to the Project

is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to TI, if available. 
 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Reference Product package insert and promptly submit a copy of this information to the 
responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if 
the informed consent/assent require revision. The investigator should also comply with the 
IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of 
safety updates by [CONTACT_538694]. 
 
The Sponsor or designee may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities 
(e.g., [LOCATION_002] FDA) within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; 
therefore, it is important that investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_538695]. 
14.[ADDRESS_701941] Abnormalities 
There are no specific laboratory tests, other than UPT, required in this study.  
14.5 Pregnancy 
WOCBP (see Schedule of Events  for definition of WOCBP) must have a UPT prior to 
study enrollment. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance 
of avoiding pregnancy during the study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent/assent (if applicable) form 
documenting this discussion. 
 
WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_119112] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) during the study and for [ADDRESS_701942] unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x-ray studies).

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_538696] (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to TI, on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy 
itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs or SAEs 
(if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Offspring should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks. 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test 
article(s) should be recorded as an SAE with details documented in the pregnancy 
surveillance form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be 
reported as an SAE. Elective abortions are generally not reported as an SAE unless an AE 
occurs that meets the criteria for an SAE. 
15. B LINDING/UNBLINDING 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Blinding is important for the 
integrity of this clinical study. Test article will be packaged in identical bottles so that 
neither the subject, investigator nor site staff will know the identity of the contents. 
However, the blind may be broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in 
which knowledge of the test article identity is critical to the subject’s management. Before 
breaking the blind for a subject, the investigator should determine that the information is 
necessary (i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, 
particularly when the emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be 
effectively managed by [CONTACT_538697]. The need to break the blind should first be discussed with the 
responsible Medical Monitor if possible prior to breaking the blind and the best method to 
do this will be determined. 
 
A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study site and should 
be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of 
the treatment identity of each subject.

17. S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
17.1 S ample Size 
Based on the assumption of a 40% reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory 
lesions counts for the Reference Product and a 38% reduction for GDC 268, 346 PP 
subjects per active arm will provide 85% probability of demonstrating therapeutic 
equivalence between the two active treatments at an alpha=0.05 (two one-sided tests) with 
90% confidence interval bounds of the ratio of means being 0.08 and 1.25. Assuming a 
25% reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions counts for the VEH, [ADDRESS_701944] an 85% probability of demonstrating that each active treatment is 
statistically superior to vehicle treatment at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Therefore, 
approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled using a 2:2:1 randomization ratio (GDC 268: 
Reference Product: VEH) to obtain a total of 1155 mITT subjects and 865 PP subjects.  
17.2 E ndpoints 
17.2.1  Efficacy Endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints will include: 
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules) lesion count. 
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non-inflammatory (open and 
closed comedones) lesion count. 
17.2.2  Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will include: 
 I
ncidence (severity and causality) of any reported or observed treatment emergent 
AEs, whether or not they are considered to be related to the test article.

did not miss the scheduled test article applications for more than 3 consecutive days (i.e., [ADDRESS_701946] article application), have no other evidence of material dosing 
noncompliance, and completed the primary endpoint evaluation at Week 12 within the 
designated visit window (Day 85 ± 4 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the 
treatment evaluation including use of the prohibited medications. 
 
Subject randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_154562]-inflammatory lesions (≤70 /

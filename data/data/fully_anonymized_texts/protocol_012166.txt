1.1 Overview of Non -Clinical Studies  
Previous work from Larson, et al. [1] suggests that using an AI model as a diagnostic aid 
could improve the quality of skeletal age assessment.

Skeletal Maturity on Pediatric Hand Radiographs ” (2017).

2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Though the AI model from Larson, et al. [1] performs as well as human radiologists  in 
controlled settings , it remains uncertain whether use of an AI model as a diagnostic aid 
can improve the quality of skeletal age assessment  in true clinical settings .

This is a prospective, multi- center, randomized contr olled trial.   1600 interpretations by

Each of the interpreted studies will be assigned at random to one of two arms: Experiment

assig ned to the Experiment arm.  The AI model will not populate the radiologists’ report 
templates for studies assigned to the Control arm.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associ ated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  
The device is not a pharmaceutical product . 
Since the device does not pose greater than minimal risk, an adverse event (AE) is not 
expected.   Unanticipated risks will be reported to the IRB, in accordance with IRB 
standards.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed . 
The device is not a pharmaceutical product.  
Since the device does not pose greater than minimal risk, a  serious adverse experience 
(SAE) is not expected.  Unanticipated risks will be reported to the IRB, in accordance 
with IRB standards.

Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated.

15.6 Monitoring  
The study does not involve m onitoring by [CONTACT_1779] a Sponso r. 
16 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHI CAL, REGULATORY CONS IDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Insti tutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312).  
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other 
records will be identified by a coded number and initials only.  All stud y records will be 
kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name [CONTACT_1639] a patient 
identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  Clinical 
information will not be released without written permission of t he subject, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1622].  The Investigator must also comply with all 
applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).  
16.1 Protocol Amend ments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by [CONTACT_093] .  Protocol amendments 
cannot  be implemented without prior written IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment intended  to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, 
provided the IRBs are notified within five working days.  
16.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol  amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study  protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator

Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative as pects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents originally su bmitted for

IRB NUMBER:  2019 -9925  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/17/[ADDRESS_361249] painful procedures performed in US 
emergency departments. It has historically accounted for 2.5% of all visits and nearly 30% of 
procedures performed in this setting[1, 2]. The incidence of abscesses is increasing at 11% 
annually, more than any other ED diagnosis.[3] Delayed and inadequate treatment of pain for this 
and other procedures is an established and pervasive problem [4 -6]. Different ED providers’ 
analgesic practices vary with some  using opi[INVESTIGATOR_295860] a field  block.[7]  There is scant  literature on proper  analgesia during  I&D  with  only small 
trials[8] or textbooks with varying and non -consistent recommendations. [9, 10]  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_295861][11,  12]. 
The reasons for their underutilization are multifactorial. Often providers have a tendency to 
underestimate the patient’s level of pain compared to the patient’s own perception of pain as 
reflected by [CONTACT_295876]-reported  0-10 Numerical Rating  Scale  (NRS)[13].  This is further  complicated 
by [CONTACT_295877][INVESTIGATOR_2438][14]. Additionally, many providers have an 
unfounded bias that opi[INVESTIGATOR_295862] -term addiction, especially in 
certain socioeconomic and age grou ps[5, 15, 16]. It is imperative that the emergency medicine 
community continues to improve analgesic practice by [CONTACT_295878].  
 
This trial  will investigate  the efficacy  of intranasal  fentanyl  (INF)  as an analgesic  adjunct  for abscess 
incision and drainage.  
 
2 - Background  
2.1 Background/prevalence  of research  topic  
 
Bioavailability  and Pharmacokinetics  
Fentanyl is a synthetic, short -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] 50 -100 times more potent than morphine, with highly 
lipophilic properties suitable for intranasal administration. Low molecular weight, lipophilic drugs are highly conducive to rapid -transport via the nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].[17] The efficacy may be further 
enhanced due to direct entrance into the CNS via the olfactory mucosa, rather than the blood brain 
barrier. Fentanyl’s intranasal bioavailability varies between 71 -89%.[17, 18] INF has an onset of 
action  of approximately  7 (4-11 min,  median)  minutes  and no difference in levels of pain  compared 
to IV fentanyl up to 120 minutes (duration at least 60 -120 minutes). [18, 19] Due to its 
pharmacokinetics and rapid- onset of action, INF will be ideal for abscess incision and drainage, a 
short- duration procedure. 
 
INF in post -operative setting  
 
INF has been  studied  in the post -operative setting.  
 
In a randomized placebo controlled study by [CONTACT_295879] -Janssen 2010, 36 women (mean age 39.2) 
post -op from  breast  reduction  where  given a single  dose pre-mixed  solution  of 0.05mg/0.1mL  nasal 
spray fentanyl for a total mean dose of [ADDRESS_361250] relief than placebo.[20]  
IRB NUMBER:  2019 -9925  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/17/[ADDRESS_361251]  (n=48)  in orthopedic, thyroid  or abdominal 
surgical patients showed similar efficacy of INF compared to IV fentanyl PCA with 21/23 (91%) 
patients in the IN fentanyl group achieving excellent pain relief in 21 min, compared to 24/25 
(96%) patients in the PCA fentanyl group in 22 min.[21]  
 
In a single  dose  cross -over  study  of [ADDRESS_361252] -operative  pain  treated  with 
IV vs INF separated by 2 hours, analgesia onset was rapid (5 min) in both groups and no difference in outcomes was found. Side -effects were not different with 4 patients in the intranasal group 
experiencing “nasal stinging.”[19]  
 
INF in pediatrics  
 
INF has gained broad acceptance in pediatric emergency medicine. INF is particularly useful in pediatric  patients  who  often  require  short -duration  procedural analgesia and are less amenable  to 
intravenous catheter placement.  
 
In a randomized study, 47 pediatric patients presenting for long -bone fractures given 1mcg/kg of 
50mcg/mL  of INF vs 0.2mg/kg  of 10mg/mL  of intramuscular  morphine  (IMM)  demonstrated  fewer 
side  effects  with  INF than  IMM (p<0.001).  This study  also showed  no difference in reduction in pain 
scores and no serious adverse events. One patient in the INF group required rescue analgesia.[22]  
 
When comparing INF (1.4mcg/kg equivalent to 1mcg/kg calculated at 71% bioavailability) to 
intravenous morphine  (0.1mg/kg) in 67 children < 18 years of age presenting to the emergency 
department  for long  bone  fractures, VAS  pain  scores  at 30 minutes decreased  from  67 to 33 in the 
morphine group and 68 to 37 in the INF group (time=30 min difference 95% CI - 4(-16 to 8)). 
Neither group had any cases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], hypotension, or decreased level of consciousness.  Mean  INF dose was  1.7mcg/kg  due to additional doses  of 15mcg,  given  as necessary. 
In the INF group 3 patients reported “bad taste” and one had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_254962] 20 minutes after intervention. One patient in each group required additional doses of analgesia. [17]  
 
In a study of 189 pediatric patients (3 to 15 years old) presenting for long bone fractures treated 
with  1.5mcg/kg  of standard  (50mcg/mL)  vs high  concentration (300mcg/mL)  INF,  both  arms  had 
substantial reduction in pain scores. Of these patients, 42(43%) in the standard concentration group required rescue medication compared with 25(28%) in the high concentration group.[17]  
 
Fentanyl in the emergency  department  
 
The brief  duration of action,  potency and ease of administration,  make  fentanyl  an optimal  choice  of 
analgesia in the emergency department. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], fentanyl is used merely 10% as often as hydromorphone despi[INVESTIGATOR_295863]. [23] 
 
A study by [CONTACT_295880]. looking at 115 adult patients receiving INF vs IV fentanyl (n=115) for renal colic, showed effective analgesia by [CONTACT_295881] 15 and 30 min with rescue pain 
medication requirements of 55% in the IN group and 37% in the IV group (n=0.058). Adverse 
events  occurred in 22% of patients  in the IV group  and only 9% in the IN group.  None  of these  were 
serious.[24]  
 
In a retrospective  study  of 841  patients  looking  at fentanyl  for pre-procedural analgesia: 6 patients 
(0.7%) had mild side effects: nausea (1), vomiting (2), urticaria (1) and pruritis (2). Nine (1.1%) 
had more serious side effects including: respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (6), hypotension (3), both

 hypotension and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (1). Four of 6 of the patients who developed respi[INVESTIGATOR_184810] 2 of 3 of patients who developed hypotension had alcohol levels > 160mg%. [2] Placebo.  Administration  of sterile  water  via the intranasal route  could  conceivably cause  analgesia 
through a placebo effect.[25] As an inert sterile fluid it poses no infectious or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498].  
 
4 - Study  Objectives  
4.1 Hypothesis  
2 mcg/kg of INF will provide better pain control than placebo when used as an adjunct to 
conventional local anesthes ia to reduce overall pain of the procedure in adult ED patients 
undergoing lidocaine  infiltration  and subsequent  abscess incision  and drainage, as measured  on a 
0-[ADDRESS_361253] to conventional local 
anesthesia for the treatment of pain of the overall procedure in adult ED patients undergoing 
lidocaine  infiltration  and subsequent  abscess incision  and drainage, as measured  on a 0- 10 pain 
scale.  
 
 
4.3 Secondary  Objectives  
A) To compare  pain  scores immediately  after  local  analgesic  infiltration  and after  abscess incision, 
instrumentation and packing  
B) To compare  patient  satisfaction  with  treatment  and provider perception  of study  medication 
efficacy compared to usual care 
C) To compare  side  effect  profiles  and adverse events  associated  with  the administration  of INF and 
placebo. 
 
 
5 - Study  Design  
5.1 General  Design  
 
This will be a randomized, double blind study of 2 mcg/kg INF versus 0.04 mL/kg IN of sterile 
water  used  adjunctively to local anesthetic  in patients  18-64 years  of age undergoing  abscess I&D  in 
two Montefiore EDs.  
 
5.2 Outcome  Variables  
5.2.1  Primary  Outcome  Variables  
The primary  outcome  is the between  group  difference  in numerical  rating  scale  (NRS)  pain  scores 
for overall pain of the procedure, defined as anesthetic infiltration plus abscess incision and drainage, including breaking up of adhesions, irrigation, and packing as indicated. The time for 
obtaining  this primary NRS  endpoint  will be standardized  as the time  of completion  of application 
of the bandage.  The NRS is a reliable and validated measure of pain intensity ranging from 0 – no 
pain, to 10 – worst pain imaginable.  
 
5.2.2  Secondary  Outcome  Variables  
Secondary efficacy outcomes: difference between groups in NRS pain score immediately after infiltration  with  local  anesthetic  and difference  between  groups  in NRS  scores  immediately  after  the 
completion of incision and drainage procedure, including breaking up adhesions, irrigation, and packin g as indicated. Additional secondary outcomes include: patient satisfaction with treatment

 described by [CONTACT_7939] “How satisfied are you with the pain medication you received for the 
procedure? (Satisfied, Neutral, Not Satisfied). Provider perce ption of treatment efficacy compared 
to usual  care  described  categorically  as (Better,  Same,  Worse).  The incidence  of adverse events  and 
side  effects  in the two groups  will be compared  as will the frequency  of medication  use to treat  side 
effects/adverse effects in each group.

 • Difference in proportion  of providers’  perceived  efficacy  of study  protocol  analgesia  versus 
standard of care  
• Difference in proportion  of patients  who  have  one or more  side  effects  in the [ADDRESS_361255] -procedure  
• Incidence  of adverse events  between  groups  
Incidence  of nausea, vomiting and  pruritis,  and adverse events  will be measured and  recorded at 
120  minutes  after  the administration  of intranasal medication.  Pulse  oximetry  will be continuous 
and vital signs will be recorded every 15 minutes after INF administration until 120 minutes.  
 
6.2.2  Safety  
• The Research Associate will remain at the patient's bedside for the first 10 minutes after 
medication  administration,  during  local  infiltration  and from  the time  of initial  incision  until 
dressing application  
• At [ADDRESS_361256] vital signs (including SaO2 by [CONTACT_7852]). 
• No further  monitoring  will be performed  after  120  minutes.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  Definition  and  Reporting  
Any adverse  events  will be managed  at the discretion  of the treating  provider.  
All vital signs that fall below the thresholds described above will be reported to the Data Safety 
Monitoring (DSM) individual and included in the annual progress report to the IRB.  The DSM 
monitoring will consist of [CONTACT_295889], MD, the director of the Moses ED and [CONTACT_6859], 
Ph.D, head  of the Division  of Research  of the Department  of Emergency  Medicine.  They  will meet 
every month with the  PI [CONTACT_1639] 1) monitor adverse events and develop strategies to minimize these; 
and 2) monitor recruitment and enrollment.  
 
6.3 Study  Procedures  
• The RAs  and attending  physicians will identify  eligible  patients. To participate,  patients  must  have 
capacity to provide  informed consent.  
• The healthcare provider  and the RA will describe  the study  to eligible  patients  and obtain patient 
consent.  
• The RA will weigh  patient,  obtain a baseline  NRS  pain  score  and initial  vital  sign  information.  
• The RA will have  the nurse  remove  the next  study  packet  from  the PYXIS,  which  will be either  4 ml 
vial containing either fentanyl 50mcg/mL or sterile water. The contents will be concealed by [CONTACT_295885].  
• Patients  will receive the blinded  study  medication  either  2 mcg/kg  of fentanyl  or 0.04  mL/kg  of 
sterile water (max 4mL) weight based and rounded to the nearest 10kg (excluding patients > 
100kg  to prevent  excessive  opi[INVESTIGATOR_295872])  via an atomizer  syringe  (half  of total  volume  in each 
nostril) 15 minutes prior to loca l infiltration  
• The RA will prompt the treating provider 15 minutes after local infiltration to ensure prompt 
treatment during an optimal systemic and local analgesic window. If the I&D has not been 
initiated within  30 minutes  of INF administration  the patient  will not be included  in the analyses 
due to concern for considerable tapering of INF analgesia (accounted for in sample size 
calculation).  
• At 15 minute  intervals  following  the intranasal  medication  administration,  the RA will obtain vital 
signs (including SaO2 by [CONTACT_7852]), and record incidence of side effects and adverse 
events.  
• The RA will record  all medications administered  in the ED and the time  of their  administration 
from the chart and the treating attending physician.  
IRB NUMBER:  2019 -9925

• RAs will record the time of each pertinent procedural step: Initial NRS collection time, 
location  of abscess,  size  of abscess (cm),  complexity  of procedure  (simple:  requires  minimal 
blunt instrumentation, moderate: requires more than minimal blunt instrumentation, 
complex: requires more than moderate instrumentation), use of packing (yes/no), study 
medication administration time, local infiltration time, incision/instrumentation/packing  
/irrigation  time,  dressing  application  time  and discharge  time.  
 
 
6.4 Statistical  Method  
6.4.1  Statistical  Design  
The statistical  design  is parallel  group  design  with  patients  randomly  allocated  to the two 
treatments.  
 
 
6.4.2  Sample  Size  Considerations  
A sample size of 49 patients will support the primary outcome, based on the observed SD of 3.2, if 
the between group difference is no less than 2.8. This  was  calculated  based  on the following 
parameters:  alpha = 0.05  and power = 0.[ADDRESS_361257] difference.  
 
We used  nQuery Advisor  version  7.0 (Los  Angeles,  CA) to calculate  the sample  size.  
 
6.4.3  Planned  Analyses 
The planned analyses include: a comparison of the characteristics of the two treatment groups at 
baseline including NRS pain scores at baseline, immediately after infiltration with local anesthetic, 
immediately after abscess incision, overall NRS pain scor e throughout the procedure assessed at  
the time of dressing application. We will also compare the proportion of patients satisfied with 
treatment, comparison of proportion of providers’ perception of efficacy of treatment compared to 
usual  care, adverse events  and side  effects  in the 120  minute  period  and graphical representation  of 
pain over all time points.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary  Analyses 
We will calculate the NRS scores between the two treatment arms as overall procedure pain 
collected at the time of dressing application. An independent group t -test will be used to assess 
whether the NRS scores differ between the groups. Descriptive data will be calculated for all variables.  The characteristics of patients in the two groups will be compared in order to confirm 
adequac y of randomization. If there is unequal distribution of background variables with p values 
of 0.15  or less,  we will include  them  in a multivariable  analysis  of the outcomes.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary  Objectives  Analyses 
A similar  analysis  to the primary  outcome  analysis  will be performed  for NRS  pain  immediately 
after local analgesic infiltration, for NRS pain score after abscess incision and (instrumentation  
IRB NUMBER:  2019 -9925  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/17/2021  
9  
 and/or packing if completed) between the two treatment arms. We will calculate the difference i n 
the proportion  of patients  in each  group  who  are satisfied  with  treatment based  upon  a categorical 
patient -centered question answered as “Satisfied, Neutral, Not Satisfied.” A chi -square test will be 
used to compare the proportions of patients who are satisfied with treatment. The same analyses 
will be done to determine provider perception of efficacy of analgesia of study medications 
compared to usual care.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
Vital sign data and side -effects, including adverse events, will be obtained and recorded at 15 
minute  intervals  after  medication  administration  to ensure  patient  safety. Chi-square  tests  will be 
used to assess whether the proportion of patients with one or more side effects differs between 
treatment groups. The individual side effects will b e described in tables. If there are marked 
differences between the distributions of background characteristics, a multi -variable regression 
will be performed to control for possible confounding.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis  of Subject  Characteristics  
• Background characteristics: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, initial pain intensity, nausea and vomiting 
before  administration  of analgesics.  Means  and standard  deviations,  medians  and interquartile 
ranges, and proportions will be used to describe the sample as appropriate.  
 
 
7 - Trial  Administration

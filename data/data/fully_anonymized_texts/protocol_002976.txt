 Brief Summary:  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of surufatinib and to confirm the safety 
and efficacy results of clinical studies performed in China  in a Western patient population.  Accordingly, 
this is an open -label trial of surufatinib, which consists of 2  phases: a dose escalation phase in patients 
with advanced solid tumors of any type, and a dose expansion phase in patients with advanced BTC (Arm 
A), advanced pNETs (Arm  B), advanced epNET s (Arm C), or STSs (Arm D). Study details are outlined 
below.  
Condition/Disease  Dose escalation phase  will enroll patients with advanced solid 
tumors of any type . 
Dose expansion phase will enroll patients with advanced BTC 
(Arm A), advanced pNETs (Arm  B), advanced epNET s (Arm 
C), and STSs (Arm D).  
Study Duration  Study duration for patients in the dose escalation is up to 
approximately 1 year and 2 months , including:  
• Screening period of up to 28 days  
• Treatment period until disease progression, death, end of 
study, or early discontinuation as specified in the protocol , 
or up to 1 year  
• Dose Completion visit at 30 (±7) days after the last dose of 
study drug  
Study duration for patients in the dose expansion  consists of:  
• Screening period of up to 28 days  
• Treatment period until disease progression, death, end of 
study, or early discontinuation as specified in the protocol  
• Dose Completion visit at 30 (±7) days after the last dose of 
study drug  
Treatment Duration  Treatment duration is:  
• Up to 1 year for patients in the dose escalation phase  
• Approximately 16 weeks for Arm A  
• Approximately 11 months  for Arms B and C  
• Approximately  4 months for Arm D  
Health Measurement/  Observation  The dose escalat ion phase will evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of surufatinib in patients with advanced solid 
tumors of any type and determine the MTD and/or RP2D by 
[CONTACT_454760].  
The expansion phase evalua tes the anticancer activity of 
surufatinib at the RP2D determined in the dose escalation phase 
as determined from the PFS.   
Visit Frequency  All enrolled patients undergo screening, which may be up to [ADDRESS_581389] dose of study drug.   
Each treatment cycle is 28 days.  Patients are assessed at day 
1, day 8 (±1), day 15 (±1), and day 22 (±1) in cycle 1, day 1 
and day 15 (±1) in cycle 2, and then day 1 (±3) of cycle [ADDRESS_581390] Version  1.1 criteria at 
screening, cycle 2 day 1 and every 8 (±1) weeks thereafter.   
After receiving the last dose of study drug, patients undergo a 
Treatment Completion visit at 30 ( ±7 days) after receiving the 
last dose of surufatinib.  
The safety of all enrolled patients will be closely  monitored 
from the time of the initial dose of investigational treatment 
until [ADDRESS_581391] treatment dose.

 Numb er of Participants  In the dose escalation phase, approximately 35 patients will be 
enrolled . 
In the dose expansion phase, approximately 115 patients will be 
enrolled into the 4 open -label treatment arms: at least 
[ADDRESS_581392] cycle ( Day 1  to Day 28).  Patients who 
complete the DLT observation window and are deemed, in the 
Investigator’s judgment, to have benefited from surufatinib 
treatment could be permitted, at the Investigator’s discretion, to 
continue with surufatinib treatment until disease progression, 
death, intolerable toxicity, pregnancy, or loss of benefit from 
the study drug .  Patients with acceptable toxicity and ongoing 
clinical benefit were to be permitted to receive surufatinib for 
up to 1 year.  
In the dose expansion phase, patients receive treatment until 
disease progression, death, end of study, or early 
discontinuation as specified in the protocol.  
Patients in both the dose escalation and dose expansion 
portions undergo a Treatment  Completion visit at 30  days ( ±7) 
after receiving the last dose of surufatinib.   
Data Monitoring/Other Committee  Safety monitoring and evaluation for dose escalation will be  
carried out by [CONTACT_7244] (SRC) upon 
completion of the DLT observation period of each cohort in 
dose escalation.  The SRC is chaired by [CONTACT_1034]’s Clinical 
Program Leader of the surufatinib program, and members will 
include the principa l investigators (PIs), the Sponsor’s PK 
scientist, medical monitor, safety scientist, and the contract 
research organization ’s medical monitor.  
For the dose expansion phase of the trial, a separate, specific 
SRC will be  established to ensure the safety of all patients 
treated with study drug in the STS cohort (STS -SCR).  
Review of available safety lab oratorie s, adverse events, and any 
other pertinent data available will be  reviewed after the first [ADDRESS_581393] 1 cycle 
of treatment.

• The melting point of the active ingredient is 162 to170°C. 
2.2 Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
2.2.1 Nonclinical Pharmaco logy 
Surufatinib is an anti -angiogenesis agent .  It selectively targets tyrosine kinases involved 
in vascular formation, mainly on the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family 
(VEGFR1, 2, and 3) , fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1 ) and colony stimulating 
factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) . In the  [32p -ATP] incorporation assay,  the IC50s of surufatinib 
on VEGFR1, 2, 3 (also known as Flt1, KDR, and Flt4) were found to be 2 nM, 24 nM, and 
1 nM, respectively. The IC50s of the kinase activity of  FGFR1, 2, 3 were determined as 15 
nM, 236 nM and 181 nM, respectively.  The IC50 for CSF1R (FMS) was [ADDRESS_581394] s, incl uding the PI3K/AKT pathway, 
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway , and p38 were also inhibited dose -dependently.  
Furthermore, in functional assays using HUVECs  (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), 
surufatinib demonstrated inhibition of VEGF -dependent cell proliferation with an IC 50 of 
16 nM and HUVEC tube formation with an inhibition of 75% at 0.[ADDRESS_581395] on cell survival with IC 50≥5 µM,  which was 
about 300 -fold less potent than the IC 50 of surufatinib in a VEGF - dependent anti -
proliferation assay in HUVEC (16 nM), consistent with its good kinase selectivity.  
The inhibitory effect of surufatin ib on the phosphorylation of KDR, angiogenesis and tumor 
growth were evaluated in vivo.  The results indicated that upon s timulation with VEGF 
(i.v., 0.5 g/mouse), KDR phosphorylation (p -KDR) in the mouse lung tissue was 
significantly induced.  Surufatinib  orally dosed at 20 and 40 mg/kg completely inhibited 
VEGF -stimulated KDR phosphorylation for 4 hours and at 80 mg/kg for 8 hours, suggesting 

Clinical Study Protocol 2015 -012-00US1  Surufatinib   
Amendment 11  
 
Hutchison MediPharma   Page 35 
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 a dose dependent inhibition. In this experiment, the drug exposure was determined.  For 
instance, at 4 hr after or al administration of 20 mg/kg of surufatinib , the drug concentration 
in plasma reached 181 ng/mL (AUC for 20 mg/kg was 2720 ng∙h/mL).  These data 
provided pharmacokinetic ( PK)/PD correlation and the effective concentration for complete 
p-KDR inhibition (EC100=181 ng/mL) useful to guide clinical dose selection.  
Surufatinib was further evaluated for anti -tumor activity and demonstrated high potency on 
inhibiting tumor growth in multiple human tumor xenografts, such as gastric cancer BGC -
823, non -small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI -H460, human renal cell carcinoma Caki -1 
and colon cancer HT -29.  Surufatinib  was orally dosed at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg twice daily 
and there appeared to be good dose response in these studies.  Among the four models, 
gastric cancer BGC -[ADDRESS_581396] sensitivity to surufatinib .  The tumor growth 
inhibition (TGI) achieved 68%, 90% and 103% at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, respectively.  
The anti -angiogenesis effect of surufatinib in the anti -tumor efficacy studies was 
investigated by d etecting the changes of endothelial cell marker CD31 (PECAM -1) in 
tumor tissue by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) technology.  Surufatinib  significantly  
decreased the vascular vessel density (CD31) significantly in both NCI -H460 and Caki -[ADDRESS_581397] dosing.  AUC increased with the 
increase of dose from 20 to 80 mg/kg. The minimum efficacious dose was 20 mg/kg twice 
daily (TGI≥58%,  P<0.05) in BGC -823 model (TGI=68%) , and the corresponding 
minimum efficacious exposure, AUC 0-24h, in plasma was 4712 ng∙h/mL.  Surufatinib 
given orally at 80 mg/kg twice daily resulted in tumor regression with an AUC 0-24h of [ZIP_CODE] 
ng∙h/mL.  PK/PD analysis indicated that at this dose comple te p-KDR inhibition was 
maintained for more than 16 hours/day.  
2.2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic s 
After a single intravenous dose of 10mg/kg surufatinib in rat s, the plasma elimination half -
life of surufatinib was measure d as 2.8 hours, and plasma clearance and apparent volume 
of distribution were 3.53 L/h/kg and 13.1 L/kg , respectively.  Following dosing via oral 
gavage at low, medium and high dose level s, the mean value of time to reach maximum 
concentration was 3.0~4.2 h ours.  The o ral bio availability was observed to be dose

dose was increase d to 40 mg/ml or above, the bioavailability  exceeded 50%.  The low 
bioavailability observed at the low dose level  might  be associated with the efflux by P-
glycoprotein in intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231] s. 
After a single intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg in dog s, the plasma elimination half -life was 3.3 
hours, and plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 3.94 L/h /kg and 18.5 
L/kg , respectively.  Following a single oral dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg , the mean value of 
time to reach maximum concentration was 3.5~4.5 h ours.  In the dose range of 5~20 
mg/kg, surufatinib exposure ( Cmax and AUC 0-t) increase d dose -proportionally .  Feeding 
had no obvious effect on the extent and speed of surufatinib absorption.  At the oral dose 
level of 10 mg/ kg, the absolute bioavailability was 30.5%.

The result s of [14C] -surufatinib excretion study revealed  that surufatinib was mostly 
excreted via faece s (approximately 80% of the dose, including 40% for bile excretion ), and 
a small amou nt was excreted via urine ( approximately 10%  of the dose ). 
In-vitro liver microsomal metabolic stability assay s in various species showed  high liver 
extraction of surufatinib .  The clearance of surufatinib in liver microsomes was higher in 
male rats than in female rats .  No significant gender difference  was observed in other 
species.  In an in-vitro liver microsome s incubation  study , phase 1 enzymes mediating  the 
metabolism of surufatinib include d CYP3A4/5  (dehydrogenation, N -demethylation) , 
CYP2C8 (dehydrogenation, N -demethylation), CYP2E1 (mono -oxidization) , and FMO.  
Surufatinib showed weak  reversible inhibition against CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 with the 
IC50 of 13 µM and 14 µM, respectively .  Time -dependent inhibition study of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_581399] [2] of 0.73 min -1 and K I [2] of 163 µM . The results of 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 induction assay in primary human hepatocyte s revealed  that 
surufatinib did not significantly induce  CYP1A2 at a concentration of 10 µM or CYP3A4 
at a concentratio n of 2 µM.   In an in-vitro permeability and efflux transportation  assay 
using Caco -2 cells, it was found  that surufatinib might be a substrate of P -gp.  
The protein binding rates of surufatinib were found to be 93~96% in plasma of various 
species, indicating a moderate to high extent of protein binding in plasma.  
2.2.3 Nonclinical Toxicology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Pharmacology  
The effect of surufatinib  on hERG tail currents was evaluated in CHO cells using a patch 
clamp technique.  The effect on the cardiovascular syste m was evaluated in anesthetized 
Beagle dogs and no adverse effects were found at the doses evaluated.  No adverse effect 
was observed on behaviors in mice and respi[INVESTIGATOR_454737].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Toxicology  
In single dose toxicity studies in ra t and dog, no deaths were found up to the highest dose 
tested at 2000 mg/kg, suggesting good tolerability following single oral dosing.  Repeated 
dose toxicity studies were carried out for surufatinib in rat (1 -month, 3 -months and 6 -
months) and dog (1 -, 3-, and 9 -months), respectively .  The NOAEL (No -observed -
adverse -effect -level) of surufatinib in 28 -day repeated dose toxicity was 20 and 6  mg/kg in 
rats and dogs , respectively .  The toxicokinetic  results indicated that the exposures of 
surufatinib in rats a t the NOAEL dose were higher than the exposures at the efficacious 
dose in mice (40  mg/kg/day).  According to the results of toxicity studies, the digestive 
system (GI, liver), lymphatic system (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes), kidney, 
hemapoietic system,  reproductive system, endocrine system and skeletal muscle were 
considered to be the target organs.  The toxic responses were found to be completely or 
nearly completely recovered after a 28 -day recovery phase.

 The key findings included kidney changes at h igh doses (60 mg/kg or higher) in rats in the 
28-day study.  At lower doses, with extended duration of treatment, changes in lymphatic 
system were found in the rats.  In addition, injury to teeth was a consistent finding possibly 
related to the target inhi bition.  In the dog, findings in the GI tract were noted in all 3 
repeated dose studies.  Changes in  the lymphatic system were also present in the 9 -month 
study.  Taken together, it is worthwhile to note that at high doses surufatinib might cause 
kidney an d GI toxicities.  In addition, with extended dosing at lower/tolerated doses, the 
lymphatic system might be affected.  Therefore, during initial dose escalation phase in 
humans, attention should be paid to kidney and GI side effects.  Adverse effects relat ed to 
lymphatic system should also be monitored for long term use of surufatinib .  Most adverse 
events (AEs) may be reduced or resolved by [CONTACT_454761].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reproductive and Development Toxicology  
In fertility and early embryonic development to implantation study, the NOAEL of 
surufatinib  was 15 mg/kg for parental male rats, and 10 mg/kg for parental female rats.  
The NOAEL for fertility and early embryonic development in male and female rats was 
found to be 45 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.  In the embryo -fetal development study, 
the NOAEL for maternal effects and the embryo -fetotoxic dose was found to be 5 and 3 
mg/kg in rats, respectively.  In rabbits, the NOAEL of surufatinib  for maternal effe cts and 
embryo -fetotoxic effects was found to be 48mg/kg and 24 mg/kg, respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Genetic toxicology  
No potential genetic toxicity  was found in  the bacterial reverse mutation test, the 
chromosome aberration test in Chinese Hamster Lung Cell, or the  micronucleus test in 
mice.  
2.3 Clinical Experience  
As of 11 February 2020, the safety database includes 717 patients (714 in monotherapy and 
3 in combination therapy) and [ADDRESS_581400] 1 dose of monotherapy of surufatinib, 693 (97.1%) 
reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 675 (94.5%) reported treatment -
related TEAEs.  Treatment -related TEAEs reported in ≥20% of patients included 
proteinuria, hypertension, diarrhea, blood bilirubin increased, blood thyroid stimulating 
hormone increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and hypertriglyceridemia.  
A total of 476 (66.7%) patients reported TEAEs of Grade  ≥3 regardless of causality, of 
which hypertension and proteinuria occurred in >10% of patients.  Approximately one -
third of patients experienced a serious adverse event ( SAE ), and the most common 
(frequency ≥1%) were gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestina l obstruction, hepatic function 
abnormal, proteinuria, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, jaundice cholestatic, abdominal 
pain, and anemia.  The reported fatal SAEs that were considered related to study drug (9 
patients) included hypovolemic shock, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation and hepatic encephalopathy, liver injury, cerebral hemorrhage, 
and death.  A total of 113 (15.8%) patients reported TEAEs leading to drug 
discontinuation.  The TEAEs leading to drug discon tinuation reported in ≥1% of patients 
included proteinuria (2.0%) and hepatic function abnormal (1.1%).

 Surufatinib has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy in 
2 completed phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -contr olled studies in China in 
patients with advanced epNET (SANET -ep) and patients with advanced pNET (SANET -
p).  The SANET -ep study met its primary endpoint at the planned interim analysis, with 
significantly improved progression -free survival ( PFS) in surufa tinib treated patients 
compared with placebo -treated patients (median PFS of 9.2 months in surufatinib treated 
patients versus 3.8 months in placebo -treated patients; hazard ratio [HR] 0.334; p<0.0001).  
Similarly, surufatinib -treated patients in the SANET -p study showed a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS compared with placebo -treated patients (median PFS of 
10.9 months in surufatinib -treated patients versus 3.7 months in placebo -treated patients; 
HR 0.491; p=0.0011).  In addition to the primary  PFS endpoint, SANET -ep and SANET -
p demonstrated meaningful improvements in other important efficacy measures such as 
overall response rate ( ORR ), disease control rate ( DCR ), duration of response (DoR), and 
time to response (TTR).

 3 STUDY RATIONALE  
During the pathogenesis of cancer, tumors can secret e a variety of f actors to stimulate the 
formation of tumor vasculatures in order to increase their supply of nutrients and oxygen.  
Such tumor vasculatures are often formed by [CONTACT_454762], leading to increased permeability and tumor cell leakage into the circulation  [3].  
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast cell growth factor (FGF) 
play key roles in tumor angiogenesis and have become two molecular targets of intense 
research for anti -angiogenesis therap ies [4-5].  
Highly selective antibodies against VEGF or its receptor VEGFR have demonstrated 
significant clinical benefit and have been widely used for the treatment of certain cancers  
[6].  Small molecule drugs, including sunitinib and sorafenib, targetin g the VEGF receptor 
(VEGFR) tyrosine kinase signaling pathway have also contributed significantly in treating 
cancer  [7,8].  However, most of the early generation small molecule VEGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inhibit many kinases (multi -kinase inh ibitors) in addition  to 
VEGFR, resulting in “off -target” toxicities  [9]. Improving kinase selectivity has become a 
key focus for newer generation TKIs.  
Surufatinib , discovered by [CONTACT_454763] , primarily inhibits 
VEGFR , fibroblast gro wth factor receptor (FGFR),  and CSF -1R, sparing many other 
kinases.  Preclinical safety evaluation results supported a good safety profile for 
surufatinib . 
3.[ADDRESS_581401] growth factor 
receptor (FGFR) and colony stimulating factor -1 receptor (CSF -1R). 
Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling plays important roles in tumor cell 
proliferatio n, angiogenesis, migration , and survival [ 10].  Inhibition of FGF and/or its 
receptor are therefore attractive targets in cancer therapy.  A recent finding is that 
approximately 10 -16% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a type of BTC, 
have F GFR genetic aberrations; the most common of these are gene fusions of FGFR -2 
[11].  This raises the possibility that the FGFR is a potential target in the treatment of a 
subset of patients with BTC.  There is an intensive ongoing research effort to address  this 
question. It is possible that surufatinib could have an anti -tumor effect through FGFR in 
patients with gene fusions or other genetic aberrations of FGFR -2. 
CSF-1 is produced by [CONTACT_454764]/or other cells in the tumor microenvironment to 
stimulat e tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which result in local suppression of the 
immune response to malignant tumor cells [ 12].  Drugs that inhibit CSF -[ADDRESS_581402] of  
TAMs that protects tumor cells.  Inhibition of CSF -1 signaling can change TAMs from an 
immunosuppressive to a pro -inflammatory state with tumoricidal activity [ 12]. Surufatinib 
may exert such an action on TAMs through inhibition of CSF -1R. 
The results of completed and ongoing clinical studies of surufatinib in China are reviewed 
in Section 2.3.  The most encouraging preliminary results are in patients  with BTC, pNET , 
and epNET , and this is the rationale for including patients with these malignancies in the

 expansion phase of this study.  Soft tissue sarcomas  (STSs)  have also been chosen as an 
expansion cohort based upon anti-tumor activity of multitargeted kinase inhibitors for the 
indication.  Information about these malignancies and how surufatinib, if approved, would 
fit into current practice guidelines, is discussed below.  
3.[ADDRESS_581403] Cancers (BTCs)  include the following malignancies: gallbladder carcinoma, 
intrahepatic and extrahepatic cho langiocarcino ma, and cancer of the Ampulla of Vater.  
According to current NCCN practice guidelines [ 13], standard first -line therapy for locally 
advanced or metastatic BTC is cytotoxic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin; for 
patients with microsatellite -insta bility high (MSI -H) tumors, immunotherapy with 
pembrolizumab is also indicated [ 13].  However, there is no established second -line 
therapy, so patients who have failed first -line therapy have an unmet medical need, and will 
be investigated in the expansion  phase of the current study.  
Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs):  Neuroendocrine cells are widely distributed throughout 
the body, and neuroendocrine tumors arise from almost any part of the gastrointestinal tract, 
lungs, and other sites  [14].  These tumors are b roadly divided into well differentiated, 
relatively slow -growing tumors, and poorly differentiated, aggressively growing tumors 
termed neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Well -differentiated tumors that arise from the digestive system or lungs have traditionally 
been called carcinoid tumors, but now are called gastrointestinal NETs or extrapancreatic 
(EP) -NETs.   Those that arise  from the pancreas were traditionally called pancreatic islet 
cell tumors, but are now called pancreatic NETs, or pNETs.  Collectively, the well 
differentiated tumors are called Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.  In considering the 
distribution of GEP -NET s by [CONTACT_454766], Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], 
and End Result s (SEER ) database ( Table 1), it is evident that pNETs comprise 
approximat ely 8.9% of all NETs [ 13].

 Function ing NETs:  GEP -NETs can also be defined by [CONTACT_454767].  
Functioning epNET s are characterized by [CONTACT_454768] (carcinoid 
syndrome ) due to excess secretion of a variety of substances by [CONTACT_7879] (polypeptides, 
biogenic amines, and prostaglandins).  The most common symptoms of carcinoid 
syndrome are flushing and diarrhea. Carcinoid syndrome is treated with somatostatin 
analog ues (SSA s), octreotide and lanreotide, both of which are effective in relieving 
symptoms [ 16-19]. 
Functioning (hormone -secreting) pancreatic NETs are classified according to the 
predominant hormone  they secrete and the resulting clinical syndrome (eg, insulinoma, 
gastrinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma).  
Treatment of NETs:  The names, route s of administration , and indications of FDA -
approved drugs for the treatment of patients with well -differentiated, low to intermediate 
grade NETs are summarized in Table 2.  The somatostatin analogues (SSAs) octreotide 
[17] and octreotide LAR [ 18] are approved for the symptomatic treatment of patients with 
functioning metastatic carcinoid tumors (diarrhea, flushing) and functioning VIPomas 
(profuse watery diarrhea).  The SSA lanreotide depot [ 19] is approved for the treatment of 
patients with unre sectable, well - or moderately -differentiated, locally advanced or 
metastatic GEP -NETs to improve PFS . 
When there is disease progression ( during treatment with SSAs, where applicable) in 
patients with pNETs, the oral kinase inhibitors everolimus [ 20] and su nitinib [ 21] are 
indicated to improve PFS.   Everolimus is also approved for the treatment of patients with 
progressing, well -differentiated, non -functioning, epNET s (carcinoid tumors) of GI tract or 
lung origin, to improve PFS [ 20], but is not approved for  functioning carcinoid tumors.  
Patients with a clinically high disease burden are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 22].  
A recently approved option for patients with somatostatin receptor -positive 
gastroenteropancreatic  (GEP -NETs) is Peptide Receptor R adioligand therapy (PRRT) with 
Lutathera® (177Lu-Dotatate) [ 23].  Current limitations of 177Lu-Dotatate include the 
complexity of its administrat ion, lack of widespread availab ility, and uncertainty of its 
efficacy relative to more established therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_581407] systemic therapy in the management of metastatic sarcomas for several years  
[27], [28].  Gemcitabine and docetaxel were  found to have similar outcomes as 
doxorubicin alone  [29].  Other drugs that may have clinical activity as single agents  are 
ifosfamide, and paclitaxel  (depending on histology ) [30],[31],[32],[33]. 
Since 2012, three drugs have been approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas after 
failure of a first -line chemotherapy: pazopanib for all soft tissue sarcomas except adi pocytic 
subtypes, eribulin for liposarcoma, and trabectedin for leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma  
[34],[35],[36],[37].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_454740], treatment for advanced STS remain paliative 
only, and remains an unmet medical need.  
Pazopanib is a multitargeted, ora l, small molecule inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases 
including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors -1, -2, and -3; platelet -derived growth 
factor receptor alpha and beta; and fibroblast growth factor receptor -1, and -3.  The phase 
3 randomized, double -blind PALETTE  study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) from the European 
Organization for Research and Treatmen t of Cance r compared pazopanib  to placebo in [ADDRESS_581408] -line anthracycline -based regimen  [38].  The median 
PFS was 4.6 months for patients who received pazopanib versus 1.6 months for patients 
who received placebo.  Overall survival ( OS) difference was not statistically significant at 
12.5 months for patients who received pazopanib versus 10.7 months for patients who 
received placebo (HR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.67 –1.1).  Overall response 
rate was 6% for patients who receive d pazopanib versus 0% for patients who received 
placebo.  The most common grade 3/4 toxicities associated with pazopanib were fatigue, 
hypertension, diarrhea, anorexia, and transient liver function tests abnormalities.  Based 
on the above data, pazopanib w as approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in [ADDRESS_581409] been added, Arm 
A (BTC cohort ), Arm B (pNET cohort) , Arm C ( epNET  cohort) , and Arm D (STS) .  
Preliminary data from the cohort of patients with a dvanced BTC in the Expansion Cohort 
of the present study have shown encouraging results.  In order to characterize further the 
safety and efficacy of surufatinib in this patient population, an additional 15 patients will 
be enrolled into Arm A (BTC ) of th e expansion phase, for a total enrollment of at least 30 
patients.  Arm B (pNET) and Arm C ( epNET ) will enroll no less than 15 patients each.  
If needed, Arm B and Arm C could also enroll additional patients to characterize further 
the safety and efficacy of surufatinib in these patient populations.   Arm D (STS) will enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_581410] signs, symptoms , or history that may put them at risk in the context 
of the identified and potential risks of surufatinib including abnormal serum total bilirubin 
or ALT/AST or other signs of hepatic damage; urine protein ≥2+; unco ntrolled 
hypertension; abnormal neutrophil count, platelet count, or haemoglobin  level ; signs of risk 
of haemorrhage; creatinine clearance <60 mL/min; conditions that could possibly result in 
gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage or perforation; clinically sig nificant cardiovascular 
disease; history of thromboembolic events; and posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES).  Patients with other disease, metabolic disorder, physical examination 
abnormality, abnormal laboratory result, or any other conditi on that investigators suspect 
may prohibit use of the investigational product, affect interpretation of study results, or put 
the patient at high risk are also excluded.  
Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_581411] subjects are included in Section  7.2.2 .  Thus , the identified and 
potential risks of treatment with surufatinib are appropriately mitigated by [CONTACT_454769].  
There remains an unmet need for patients with advanced BTC, NETs , and STS.  Evidence 
to date suggests that surufatinib may potentially be efficacious in the treatment of various 
cancers, including those to be included in the proposed trial.  Based on the preclin ical 
toxicology data, the safety profile from clinical trials, the proposed safety management 
actions, the limited life expectancy of patients with advanced malignancies, the lack of 
effective alternative treatments and the scientific design of clinical tr ial protocol, and the 
overall benefit/risk assessment support the administration of surufatinib to patients with 
advanced cancer as an investigational treatment in this clinical trial.

 5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Description of the Study  
This is an open -label trial of surufatinib taken orally once daily (QD), and it consist s of 
two phases: a dose escalation phase in patients with advanced solid tumors of any type, and 
a dose expansion phase in patients with advance d BTC (Arm  A), advanced  pNET s (Arm  B), 
advanced epNET s (Arm C) , or STSs (Arm D) . The two phases will be conducted as 
described below.  
5.1.1 Dose Escalation  Phase  
A 3+[ADDRESS_581412] been enrolled in the dose escalation phase and the MTD/RP2D has 
been declared at 300 mg QD.  
The trial was to evaluate  5 dose levels of surufatinib 50 mg, 100 mg, 200  mg, 300  mg and 
400 mg on a QD dosing schedule.  
A minimum of 3 patients were to be enrolled and observed for toxicity at each dose level.  
If the 3 patients initially enrolled in a dose cohort complete d the DLT assessment window 
(Cycle 1, Days 1 -28) without experiencing a DLT, another 3 patients were to be  enrolled at 
the next  higher dose level.  If 1 of the initial 3 patients enrolled at any dose level 
experience d a DLT during the DLT assessment window, additional patients were to  be 
enrolled at that dose level for a minimum of 6 evaluable patients for the DLT  evaluation .  
If 1 DLT was observed in  1 of the 6 evaluable patients at this dose level, dose escalation 
was to  proceed to the next pre -defined dose level.  If 2 or more DLTs were  observed in 
the 6  evaluable patients at a given dose level, the dose escalation was to  be halted.  If this 
dose level was ≥50% higher than the previous dose level, an intermediate dose level was to  
be evaluated for toxicity in the same manner as described above.  If the dose level was 
<50% higher than the previous dose level, additional pat ients were to  be enrolled at the 
previous dose level, if necessary, to form a dose cohort of minimum [ADDRESS_581413] dose reached with no more than 1 DLT among 6 evaluable patients.  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected  as specified in Table 12.  
Safety monitoring and evaluation for dose escalation will be carried out by [CONTACT_317380] (SRC) upon completion of  the DLT observation period of each cohort.  
Dose escalation decisions are based on safety and PK data from this ongoing trial, as well 
as consideration of safety and PK data at comparable drug exposures from patients in 
previously conducted clinical trial s in China.  
If a patient  meets any DLT non -evaluable criteri a during the DLT assessment period, the 
patient  will be replaced.  
Patient s who complete  the DLT observation window (Cycle 1, Day 1-28) and are deemed , 
in the investigator’s judgment,  to have benefit ed from surufatinib treatment could  be 
permitted , at the i nvestigator’s discretion , to continue with surufatinib treatment until 
disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, pregnancy , or loss of benefit  from the study 
drug .  Patient s with acceptable toxicity and ongoing clinical benefit were  to be  permitted 
to receive surufatinib for up to 1 year  at the investigator’s discretion and with the sponsor’s 
agreement.  Intra -patient dose escalation to a higher dose that ha s been cleared ( ie, no DLT 

Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_581414] 6 patients) was to be allowed if the sponsor and 
investigator both agree d.  
Please see the flowchart for  dose escalation in Table 3 and Section 7.2 for dose modification 
instructions .

higher 3-6 per cohort  Follow the same rules as above  
An improved  surufatinib formulation in 50 mg and 200  mg capsules  (formulation No. PD -
012-042) was introduced while the dose escalation phase of the study was ongoing.  The 
improved  surufatinib capsules have replaced  the older surufatinib capsules (formulation 
No. PD -012-023) , and will be used for the rest of the trial .  Improved  formulation (PD-
012-042) showed improved consistency of production capability compared to the prior 
formulation (PD-012-023), including content uniformity with comparable quality 
attributes .  The dose  escalation of the new surufatinib capsules will follow the same rules 
as described above.   
After considering the safety, tolerability, and PK data in the 300 mg QD (n=9) and initial 
400 mg QD (n=7) cohorts, the SRC members agreed to enroll another 6 patie nts in the 400 
mg QD cohort of the dose escalation phase.  A total of 13 patients were enrolled in 400 
mg QD dose escalation cohorts : Cohort 6 (n=4) , Cohort 6+ (n=3), and Cohort 7 (n=6).  
However, the MTD and RP2D were declared at 300 mg QD on 30 November 2018, when 
2 of 6 DLT -evaluable patients reported DLTs in Cohort 7 (400 mg QD) of the dose 
escalation phase (see subheading d. below for additional information).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -Limiting Toxicity Assessment Window  
The DLT assessment window is the [ADDRESS_581415]  cycle (Days 1 -28).  Any patient 
considered to be non-evaluable for DLT as defined below was to be replaced by [CONTACT_454770].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of DLT Evaluable Patients  
A patient will be DLT evaluable if the patient : 
• Has not received any preventive treatment during the DLT period ; AND  
• Has completed the first [ADDRESS_581416] 75% of the assigned surufatinib dose;  
OR 
• Has a confirmed DLT during the first 28 -day treatment cycle.

 CONFIDENTIAL   
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Dose -Limiting Toxicity  (DLT)  
All AEs, including  DLTs, are to be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v. 4.03. A DLT 
is defined as one of the following toxicities occurring during the DLT assessment window 
(Cycle 1, Days 1 -28) and determined by [CONTACT_8127] a reasonable possibility of 
being related to surufatinib . 
• Any Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity;  
• Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity except for n ausea/vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation , electrolyte imbalances , or transient hypertension  downgraded within 
3 days with appropriate supportive treatment ; 
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days ; 
• Grade 3 f ebrile  neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count <1.0  × 109/L with a single 
temperature of >38.3 °C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one 
hour ; 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with 
tendency to bleed ;  
• Dose interruption or delay for >14 days due to toxicity ;  
• Any life -threatening complication or abnormality not covered in the NCI CTCAE 
v. 4.03. 
In the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to 
confirm significant laborator y findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which no more than 1  out of 6 patient s in a 
single dose group experiences a DLT in Cycle 1 (Days 1 -28). 
5.1.2 Dose Expansion Phase  
The expansion phase will evaluate the anti -cancer activity of surufatinib , and confirm the 
safety and tolerability of surufatinib at the RP2D determined at the end of the dose 
escalation phase.  
Under amendment 7 of this protocol, t he MTD was declared when 2 of the 6 DLT evaluable 
patients in Cohort 7 (400 mg QD dose) of the dose escalation phase reported DLTs.  There 
was an ad hoc meeting of the SRC on [ADDRESS_581417].  The minutes of this ad hoc SRC meeting were distributed 
to all investigative sites on the same day.  It was also agreed that patients who were already 
receiving 400 mg QD could remain on this dose, pr ovided that 1) there was no major 
toxicity and 2) the affected patients gave informed consent not to reduce the dose to [ADDRESS_581418] treatment dose.  Any SAEs that 
occur after the informed consent form ( ICF) is signed, but before the first dose of study 
drug is taken, should also be reported.  All AEs will be graded in accordance with the NCI 
CTCAE v. 4.03.  Tumor assessment s will be conducted according to RECIST Version  1.1 
criteria at scre ening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and every 8 (±1) weeks thereafter.  Confirmation of

 CR and PR is required at no less than 4 -week intervals between the date of initial 
response/progression and the confirmation assessment date.  
5.2 Sample Size  
Approximately 95 to 150 patie nts will be enrolled in this two -phase study : 35 patients in 
the dose escalation  phase and approximately 115 additional patients in the dose expansion 
phase .  The actual enrollment number may vary, depending on the number of dose levels 
evaluated and the number of DLTs observed in each cohort , as well as the potential need to 
further characterize individual cohorts in the dose expansion phase . 
As of Amendment 7, an additional 15 patients will be enrolled into Arm A (BTC) of the 
Expansion phase, for a total  enrollment of at least 30 advanced BTC patients.  The reason 
for increasing enrollment into Arm A (advanced BTC) is that preliminary data from the 
ongoing patients in this cohort have shown encouraging results.  The additional patients 
will allow further characterization of the safety and efficacy of surufatinib in this patient 
population.  Arm B (pNET) and Arm C ( epNET ) will enroll at least 15 patients each.   If 
needed, Arm B and Arm C could enroll additional patients in order to characterize further 
the safety and efficacy of surufatinib in these patient populations.  
As of Amendment 8, approximately 45 additional patients with STS will be enrolled to Arm 
D. 
As of Amendment 10, an additional 10 patients will be added to the arm D (STS) for a total 
enrollme nt of 55 patients.  
5.3 Investigational Site  
The study plans to enroll patients at a pproximately 8 to 15 sites. 
5.4 Safety Review Committee  
Safety moni toring and evaluation for dose escalation will be carried out by [CONTACT_317380] (SRC) upon completion  of the DLT observation period of each cohort  
in dose escalation .  The SRC is chaired by [CONTACT_1034]’s Clinical Program Leader of the 
surufatinib program, and members will include the principal investigators (PIs), the 
Sponsor’s PK scientist, medical monit or, safety scientist, and the contract research 
organization’s ( CRO’s ) medical monitor.  Dose escalation decisions are based on safety 
and PK data from this ongoing trial, as well as consideration of safety and PK data at 
comparable drug exposures from pat ients in previously conducted clinical trials in China.  
For the dose expansion phase of the trial, a s eparate , specific SRC will be established to 
ensure the safety of all patient s treated with study drug  in the STS cohort (STS -SCR) .  
Review of available s afety lab oratories , adverse events, and any other pertinent data 
available will be reviewed after the first [ADDRESS_581419] 1 cycle of treatment.  The recommendations of the STS-SRC will be based on the 
members’ cl inical assessment of the cumulative safety data provided for review.  The SRC 
will not be charged with the application of formal statistical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106].

 CONFIDENTIAL   
 The investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from the study for any medical 
condition that the investigator determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she 
continues in the study and for reasons of non -compliance ( eg, missed doses, visits) or 
pregnancy or if the investigator determines it is in the best interest of the patient.   
Any patient who discontinues treatment  but does not withdraw informed consent  should be 
encouraged to return to the study site for a treatment completion visit.  See Appendix  [ADDRESS_581421] dose of study drug until the 
date of patient death (any cause).  Investigators and/or delegated site staff  should foll ow 
patients  enrolled to the BTC and STS expansion cohort s, who have signed informed consent 
under sponsor Amendment 8 (or later), until death or until the patient  is lost to follow up.  
Follow up for OS will begin a fter the end of treatment (EOT) visi t has  been completed.   
Patients  should be followed every 8  weeks (± 2 week s) via telephone or in a manner that 
follows local site SOPs.  Site staff should attempt to contact a patient  3 times and consult 
with authorized family members for the status of the patient (when applicable) before 
considering a patient lost to follow up.  Data to be collected should include the date the 
patient  was last known to be alive, the date of death, and the cause of death.  
Treatment completion of patients will occur if any of the following 3 criteria is met:  
1. Disease progression (according to RECIST Version  1.1), unless there is reasonable 
evidence of clinical benefit to justify continuation on  the study drug . The 
continuation decision should be made by [CONTACT_454771] . The disease progression date is the date when radiological disease 
progression is first reported according to RECIST Version  1.1 criteria;  
2. Death;  
3. End of this study.  
Early discontinuation of study drug  will occur if any of the f ollowing criteria is met:  
1. Patient withdrawal of informed consent ;  
2. Intolerable toxicity;  
3. Poor patient compliance;  
4. Use of other antitumor  treatment during the study;

the lung or th ymus (including unknown origins), with a mitotic rate of ≤ 
20/10 high powered field (HPF) and/or a Ki -67 prolife rative inde x of ≤ 
20%; if the mitotic rate and Ki -67 index indicated different grades, the 
higher grade is used to assign classification; or  
b. NETs of the lung or thymus with a mitotic rate of ≤10/10 HPF ;

8. Patients must have radiological documentation of progression of disease in the last 
12 months prior to the initiation of study drug ; 
9. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 ; 
10. Expected survival of more than 12 weeks;  
11. For female patients of childbearing potential and male  patients with partners of 
childbearing potential, agreement (by [CONTACT_454772]) to use a highly effective 
form(s) of contraception, that results in a low failure rate (<1% per year) when 
used consistently and correctly, starting during the screening period, continuing 
throughout the entire study period, and for [ADDRESS_581425] dose of 
study drug.  Such methods include: oral hormonal contraception (combined 
estrogen/progestogen, or progestogen -only), associated with inhibition of 
ovulation together with another additional barrier method (e.g., diaphragm, always 
conta ining a spermicide), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone -
releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner (on the 
understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study duration), or 
sexual abstinence.  Oral contraception should always be combined with an 
additional contraceptive method (i.e., barrier method) because of a potential 
interaction with the study drug.  The same rules are valid for male patients 
involved in this clinical trial if they have a part ner of childb earing  potential.  
Male patients must always use a condom.  A woman is considered to be of 
childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal 
state (ie, ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified caus e other than 
menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of the ovaries 
and/or uterus).

Capsule  200 mg  Oral Shanghai STA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  
 
7.1.3 Packaging and Drug Labeling  
The investigational drug is packaged in white HDPE bottle with 50  capsules per bottle  (old 
formulation, PD -012-023) or 30 capsules per bottle (new formulation, PD -012-042).  
The following information will appear on the label affixed to either the bottle or carton; 
additional information  may be added as required:  
• Sponsor  identification  
• Protocol number  
• Drug identification  
• Quantity  of contents  
• Storage conditions  
• Dosing instructions  
• Route of administration  
• Blank spaces to  write the patient ’s identification number  
• Finishing lot #  
7.1.4 Drug Storage  
Study drugs should be sealed and  stored in a secure, limited access area between 10 °C to 
30°C, protected  from light and moisture .  Surufatinib capsule should not be used beyond 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_454743].  
The temperature log should be recorded and filed in the study bin der. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_581439] ing to the study site’s 
institutional standard operating procedure or returned to Hutchison MediPharma with the 
appropriate documentation, as determined by [CONTACT_3452].  If the study site chooses to 
destroy study drug, the method of destruction must be documented.  
7.1.6 Dose and Administration  
If baseline (pre -dose) PK blood samples need to be collected on the day s of PK sample 
collection, patients must take the investigational product after sampling.  
It is recommended that surufatinib be taken with [ADDRESS_581440].   
The administration time should be accurately recorded on the day of PK sampling.  
For patient s treated with surufatinib under new formulation , the minimum number of 
capsules will be administrated  in combination of two str engths (50  mg and 200  mg), eg for 
300 mg QD  dose , one 200  mg capsule and two 50  mg capsules will be administrated;  for 
400 mg QD  dose , two 200  mg capsule s will be administrated , etc.  For patients enrolled 
in the European Union, only 50 mg capsules will be  available .  
On the day of PK sampling, patients should avoid high -fat, high -calorie meals for the entire 
day.  No caffeine containing foods or drinks, no grapefruit or grapefruit juice, tobacco and 
tobacco containing products, or alcohol or recreational drugs will be allowed during the PK 
assessment period (Cycle 1).  
If patients miss a dose in the morning, a repla cement dose can be taken before [ADDRESS_581441] received surufatinib  may be 
found in  the current  version of the surufatinib IB.  
7.1.8 Important Potential Risks  
The important potential risks of surufatinib include the follow ing: infection, intestinal 
obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, myocardial ischaemia, cardiac failure, venous 
thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, and pancreatitis.   One patient in the 2015 -
012-00US1  trial experienced grade 3 PRES,  which was deemed related  to study drug  and 
was considered  resolved.   For more information, please see  surufatinib IB. 
7.2 Dose Modification  
7.2.1 General Dose Adjustment  Note  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v . 4.03.   Reasons for 
dose m odifications or delays, the supportive measures taken, and the outcome will be 
documented in the patient's chart and recorded in the CRF . 
• For any concomitant conditions already apparent at baseline, the dose 
modifications will apply according to the corres ponding shift in toxicity grade, if 

Clinical Study Protocol 2015 -012-00US1  Surufatinib   
Amendment 11  
 
Hutchison MediPharma   Page 60 
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 the investigator feels it is appropriate.  For example, if a patient has Grade 1 
asthenia at baseline that increases to Grade 2 during treatment, this will be 
considered a shift of one grade and treated as Grade 1 toxici ty for dose -
modification purposes.  
• For toxicities that are considered by [CONTACT_150083] -threatening events, treatment will be continued at the same dose 
without reduction or interruption.  In addition, no do se reductions or interruptions 
will be required for anaemia (non -haemolytic) because it can be satisf actorily 
managed . 
• To recover from acute toxicity, unless otherwise indicated, the treat ment can be 
delayed for up to 21  days.  If a treatment delay longer than 21  days is required, 
the patient should be discontinued from the study drug .  Continuation/resumption 
of surufatinib treatm ent after a n interruption  of more than [ADDRESS_581442] be 
discussed with the  medical monitor  or his or her designee.  
• Where several toxicities with different grades or severity occur at the same time, 
the dose modifications should be according to the highest grade observed.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_581443] dose reduction s no more than twice , e.g. dose reductions from 
300 mg QD to 250 mg QD and  then 200 mg QD or from 400 mg QD to 300 mg QD and 
then 200  mg QD is allowed.   However, if the investigator judges that  a dose lower than 
200 mg QD is required for safety reasons, and that the patient could still benefit from  study 
drug treatment  at such a lower dose , then the dose may be further  lowered to 200 mg QD, 
3 weeks on and 1 week off, during each subsequent 4-week cycle.

Dose reduction guidelines for hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities other than 
hypertension, proteinuria, liver function impairment and hemorrhage are shown in  Table  6.  
In princ iple, treatment should be held until AE/toxicity resolves or improves to ≥Grade 1.   
If a patient has a Grade 3 toxicity that is expected to be manageable and reversible with a 
dose reduction, treatment should be held until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 1.  Patients with 
Grade 3 non -haematologic toxicity that does not resolve to ≤Grade 1 within 3 weeks should 
permanently discontinue the study drug.

CYP2C8 (dehydrogenation, N -demethylation),  CYP2E1 (mono -oxidization) and FMO.   
Surufatinib showed weak and reversible inhibition against CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 with 
the IC50 of 13 µM and 14 µM, respectively.  Time -dependen t inhibition study of 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_581452] s of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in primary human hepatocyte s indicated that 
surufatinib had no obvious i nduction to CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 at  10 µM and 2 µM, 
respectively.  Caco -2 in-vitro permeability and efflux transportation tests indicate d that 
surufatinib was a substrate of the P -gp efflux transporter.  
Although the overall risk of a drug interaction between surufatinib and other drugs is not 
significan t, the use of surufatinib should be with caution when combined with certain drugs.   
Patient s receivi ng a CYP3A4 strong inhibitor or  inducer within 2 weeks (3 weeks for 
hyperforin perforatum) prior to receiving the study drug treatment should be excluded from 
the study.  CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers should be avoided throughout the stu dy.  
The list of CYP3A4 substrates, strong inhibitors or inducers is provided in Appendix  4.  If 
investigators consider  necessary, CYP3A4 substrates, strong inhib itors or inducers can be 
used with close monitoring  of potential drug - drug interaction.

 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D METHODS  
8.1 Safety  Assessment s 
8.1.1 Vital Signs Assessment  
Vital signs will include measurements of body temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position.  The patient 
should be seated for approximately 5 minutes before the measurement of th e blood pressure.  
For patients receiving anti -hypertensive medications, with either a baseline history of 
hypertension or new onset of hypertension during the study, blood pressure should be 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_44126].  Affected patients will be provided with home 
blood pressure monitoring equipment, educated on how to measure blood pressure, take 
their own blood pressure daily at 3 hours (±2 hours) after the daily doses of anti -
hypertensive medication.  The patient will keep a record of home b lood pressure readings 
in a Blood Pressure Diary, and bring this to each study visit.  
8.1.2 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination at screening should include the evaluation of head, eye, 
ear, nose, and throat; and cardiovascular, dermatological, m usculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  
At subsequent visits, a limited physical examination will be performed to assess changes 
from baseline abnormalities, any new abnormalities, and to evaluate patient -reported 
symptoms.   New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events if 
appropriate.   In order to assess changes from baseline and screen for new abnormalities, 
the limited physical examination should assess for new or changed skin lesions, enlarged 
lymph nodes, palpable masses, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.  Patient -reported 
symptoms require a physical examination directed to address the symptoms.  
As part of tumor assessment, physical examinations should also include the evaluation of 
the presence and deg ree of enlarged lymph nodes, skin lesions, hepatomegaly, and 
splenomegaly.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_581453] Evaluations  
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis and pregnancy testing will be 
analyzed at the study site’s local laboratory.  Laboratory assessments w ill include the 
following:  
Hematology : complete blood count [CBC], including red blood cell [RBC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and other cells], and platelet count) , INR, 
PT and aPTT.  
Serum chemistry : blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosph ate, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALT, 
AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehyd rogenase [LDH], amylase, total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, total protein , albumin , and uric acid . 
Serum pregnancy test at screening and within [ADDRESS_581454] had a tubal ligation .  In

 addition, urine pregnancy tests will be performed on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and continue on Day 
1 at each 28 -day cycle thereafter.  
Urinalysis (pH, glucose, protein, and blood) ; if there is ≥2+ protein on urinalysis, then a 24 -
hour urine protein should be done  within in one week .  For urinalysis results conversions, 
please refer to Appendix H  
Thyroid function: TSH, free T3, free T4 ； 
Stool blood test  (as per the instit utions standard practice) ; 
Plasma surufatinib concentrations (for PK evaluations)  will be assessed using a validated 
assay.  
8.1.4 Cardiac Monitoring  
Left ventricular ejectio n fraction (LVEF) assessed via echo cardiogram  or MUGA  at 
Screening -Baseline and every 12 (± 1) weeks thereafter and at the end of study treatment.   
The modality of the ca rdiac function assessments must be consistent within a patient i.e. if 
echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment then echocardiogram should also be 
used for subsequent scans if required.  The patients should also be examined using the 
same machin e and operator whenever possible.  
The 12-lead ECGs should be performed at screening, pre-dose and at 2 hours ± 15minutes 
post surufatinib dose on Days [ADDRESS_581455]  and at the end of study treatment .  The QTcF interval will be closely 
monitored  (See Appendix  1).   
Test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_454777].   
Additional test and other cardiac monitoring will be provided as clinically indicated during 
the study.  
8.2 Efficacy Assessments  
8.2.1 Tumor Assessment  
All measura ble lesions should be assessed and documented at screening and re -assessed at 
each subsequent tumor evaluation  (see Appendix  1).  Response assessments will be 
performed by [CONTACT_454778] -based eva luation.  
Screening assessments include CT scans with oral or IV contrast (unless contraindicated) 
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  MRI scans are allowed if CT contrast is 
contraindicated.  Bone scans and CT scan of neck should also be performed if clini cally 
indicated.  The same radiographic procedure used to define measurable or non -measurable 
lesions at baseline must be used throughout the study for each patient.  At the 
investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive dis ease is 
suspected.  
Disease status will be assessed using RECIST  Version 1.1 (see Appendix  3).  At the 
investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per 
RECIST Version 1.1 may be used.   Confirmation of CR and PR  is required at no less than 
4-week intervals between the date of initial response/progression and the conf irmation 
assessment date.

 CONFIDENTIAL   
 8.2.2 Assessment of Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers assessment will be performed at each tumor assessment  visit.  Tumor 
markers may include, but are not be limited to, serum CEA and CA 19 -9 (patients with 
BTC) serum chromogranin A (CgA) and neuron -specific enolase (NSE) for patients with 
pNET and epNET ; and VEGF for all 3 disease cohorts.  Assessment of tumor markers will 
be performed within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with study drug (C1D1) and at 
each tumor assessment visit.  
8.[ADDRESS_581456] of 
care tests performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days  prior to study 
entry may be used (except hematology, coagulation test, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and 
stool  blood  test results); such tests do not ne ed to be repeated for screening.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_581457] occur within ± 3 days (± 1 day du ring the DLT observation window ) from 
the scheduled date, unless otherwise noted (see Appendix  1).  All assessments will be 
performed on the day of the specified visit unless a time window is specified.  
Please see the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix  [ADDRESS_581458] following date is within 
7 days of other, regularly scheduled study assessments.  
If during the DLT assessment window, 2 or more patients in a single cohort experience the 
same study drug -related Grade 3 toxicity that does not  otherwise qualify as a DLT, the 
patients subsequently enrolled to this dose level and to the subsequent dose level will 
undergo increased monitoring during Cycle 1, as clinically indicated.  
8.3.3 Study Completion/Early Termination Visit  
Patients who complete  the study or discontinue study drug  will be asked to return to the 
clinic at 30  ± [ADDRESS_581459] signed informed 
consent under sponsor Amendment 8 (or later), will enter into OS follow up at the 
completion of their Study Completion/Early Termination Visit.  
Please see the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix  1 for assessment s to be performed at 
the study completion or early termination visit.  
8.4 Assay  Method s 
8.4.1 Bioanalysis Assay Methods  
Concentrations of the surufatinib in plasma will be measured using a pre -validated liquid 
chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) by a qualified central laboratory.  
All plasma samples from patient s having received suruf atinib will be analyzed.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_581460] time and dates of blood sampling are to be recorded in the CRFs.  
Blood sample ( 2.5 mL) for surufatinib pharmacokinetics will be collected into Sodium 
Heparinate vacutainers .  The tubes will be immediately inverted gently at least 5 times to 
mix the blood  and then placed in ice bath  prior to centrifugation .  The tubes will be 
centrifuged at approximately 1000g  and 4 °C for 10 min and then the plasma will be 
transfer red into 2 clean prelabelled  tubes  immediately .  About 0.5mL plasma will be 
placed in each tube ( Tube A and Tube B ).  After tightly cappi[INVESTIGATOR_454746], the samples 
should be stored at -20°C or -80°C immediately .  The whole process of plasma collection 
should be completed within 2 hours  of the blood sampling .  According to p lasma stability 
results, surufatinib can be stored at -20°C for 317 days and at -80°C for 716 days.  It is 
recommended that the plasma samples are stored at -80°C for the long-term storage.   
Each sample will be identified by [CONTACT_454779], study number, patient  number and 
initials, and sample time point identifier ( ie, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hour etc.).  Tube B 
samples must be labeled as “duplicate”.  
All plasma samples will be shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory within 30 days of 
sample collection .  The dry ice should be sufficient to keep the samples frozen during the 
whole shipment period.  The samples of Tube B are shipped out after the prior batch of 
Tube A has been received safely by [CONTACT_6626].  Tube A samples will be used for 
bioanalysis. Tube B samples will be stored in -80°C freezer for future use.  The laboratory 
should be notified at least 1 day prior to the arrival of the sample  and be provided shippi[INVESTIGATOR_454747].  
Prior to shipment, a PK sample requisition form (containing the details of each sample / 
label identification included in the shipment) will be prepared.  All sample correspondence 
must contain the Study Number , Study Drug, and Site references (including emergency 
contact [CONTACT_454780]).  All of the sample details on this 
log must correspond with the details included on the individual sample labels, as each 
sample label will be che cked against the list by [CONTACT_454781]’ sample coordination 
personnel.  The log should be reviewed by [CONTACT_454782] a second individual for 
accuracy and signed/dated by [CONTACT_454783].  (An example sample transfer sheet is used 
to document the g eneral information regarding the shipment).  To avoid sample mix -ups

An SAE  is defined as any life -threatening AE resulting in death, persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or any other important medical 
event requiring  intervention, in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
A SAE  is any AE that is any of the following:  
• Fatal ( ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death)  
• Life threatening ( ie, the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death)  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• A con genital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a female patient or 
female partner of a male patient exposed to the investigational product(s)  
• Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] ( eg, may jeopardize the 
patient or may requir e medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above)  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
AEs.  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intens ity of 
an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).   “Serious” is a regulatory definition and 
is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually assoc iated with events that 
pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAE s 
on the CRF.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_581464] (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication  by [CONTACT_35348] .  
Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand 
it.  Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_454785] ( eg, regulators) might also be warranted.   

Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_581465] include an email that describes the event and 
indicates which DLT criterion was met (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Definition of a Dose -Limiting 
Toxicity).   The Sponsor’s medical monitor must confirm that the event meets the DLT 
definition and communicate this back to the investigator by [CONTACT_6968].  A notification of each 
DLT event will be distributed by [CONTACT_454786].  DLT  
events are again reviewed together with other safety data and PK data, at the dose escalation 
SRC meeting upon completion of the DLT window of each dose cohort.  
9.3 Adverse Events  Reporting Period  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study medic ations, only SAEs caused by 
a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected ( eg, SAEs related to invasive procedures 
such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run -in). 
After initiation of study medications, all AEs and SAEs regardless of att ribution will be 
collected until [ADDRESS_581466] administration of study drug  or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is later.  After this period, investigators should 
report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior study drug . 
9.4 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient 
evaluation time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you  had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
9.[ADDRESS_581467].  All AEs and 
SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_454787] , will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the appropriate AE/SAE form.  
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable CRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality.  
• Grade refers to the severity of th e AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general 
guideline:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic    
observations only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; d isabling; limiting self 
care ADL**.  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.

Amendment 11  
 
Hutchison MediPharma   Page 73 
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL s refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL s refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
NOTE : The NCI CTCAE v 4.03 shows specific criteria for a large number of commonly 
reported specific AEs by [CONTACT_6213].  If a specific AE cannot be found in 
the NCI CTCAE v 4.03, then the investigator should name [CONTACT_454814].  
9.6 Causality of Adverse Events  
The investigator will asses s a causal relationship between  the IP and each AE, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
even t may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198] ?’ 
For SAEs a causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study 
procedures and additional study drug.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with 
any study proc edure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide line to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix  5 to the 
Clinical Study Protocol.  
9.7 Documenting  Adverse Events  
When  documenting  an AE or SAE, the preferred medical terminology or concept should be 
used. Abbreviations and spoken language should be avoided.  All AEs (including SAEs) 
should be recorded in the CRF on the AE page.  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the CRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
All AEs (including SAEs) would be recorded on the AE CRF, and the check box for  
“Serious” would be ticked for entries that fit the criteria of serious.  The investigator would 
also complete an SAE report and submit this to the sponsor or its designee within [ADDRESS_581468] ed in the event field on the CRF.  
9.8 Diagnosis vs Symptom and Signs  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and 
symptoms ( eg, record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transam inases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.   If a diagnosis is 
subsequentl y established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
9.9 Adverse Event Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to 
have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the 
CRF.  

Clinical Study Protocol 2015 -012-00US1  Surufatinib   
Amendment 11  
 
Hutchison MediPharma   Page 74 
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated from the initiatin g event in time should be recorded as independent events on the 
CRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both 
events should be recorded separately on the CRF.  
9.10 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient 
evaluation time point s.  Such events should only be recorded once in the CRF unless their 
severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded again 
on an AE /SAE CRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time point s and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an AE/SAE CRF.  
9.11 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF ( eg, abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study drug , more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc) . 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome ( eg, 
alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis ( eg, cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the AE/SAE CRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term sh ould be 
recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0  mmol/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly record ed as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
9.12 Death  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period,  regardless of 
attribution, should  be recorded on an AE/SAE CRF and expeditiously reported to the 
sponsor or its designee.  This includes death attributed to tumor progression . 
When recording a death event, the underlying condition that caused or primarily contributed 
to the fatal outcome should be reported as AE and death being the outcome of the event on 
the AE/SAE CRF.  If the primary cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at 
the time of reporting, record “Unknown Death” on the AE/SAE CRF.  
If the death is attributed to progr ession of cancer, reco rd “Cancer Progression” as the AE 
term on the CRF.  
9.13 Previously Existing Medical Condition  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgica l History CRF.  

Clinical Study Protocol 2015 -012-00US1  Surufatinib   
Amendment 11  
 
Hutchison MediPharma   Page 75 
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such 
events on an AE/SAE CRF, it is important to convey the concept t hat the preexisting 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] ( eg, “more frequent headaches”).  
9.14 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95932].  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342084].   These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p rolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362734]:  
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study  
9.[ADDRESS_581469] be instructed to stop taking the study medication and immediately 
inform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.   The investigator should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor or its designee.  The i nvestigator 
should counsel the patient ; discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus.   Monitoring of the patient  should continue until conclusion 
of the pregnancy.  Pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_581470] also be reported to the investigator.  
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious (as 
the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an AE/SAE CRF, and 
expedit iously reported to spon sor its designee.  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient or female partner 
of a male patient exposed to the investigational product should be recorded and reported as 
an SAE.  
9.[ADDRESS_581471] (>3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( >2 × ULN)  or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of sev ere liver injury ; 
these findings meet the definition for Hy’s Law, and are associated with an increased risk 
of drug -induced liver injury (DILI) .  Therefore, investigators must report as an AE the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin)  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if  a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF and reported to the sponsor

 or its designee within 1 working day after learning of the event as an SAE.   See 
Appendix  7 for important additional information.  
9.17 Worsening of Solid Tumor  
Worsening and/or progression of the patient’s solid tumor should not be recorded  as an AE 
or SAE  unless resulted in death within the AE reporting period .  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  
9.[ADDRESS_581472] all case details that can be gathered on 
the SAE repor t form .  Relevant follow -up information should be submitted to the sponsor 
or its designee as soon as it becomes available and/or upon request.  
Any life -threatening ( ie, imminent risk of death) or fatal AE that is attributed by [CONTACT_454788], followed by [CONTACT_454789] 
[ADDRESS_581473] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug  
or participation is not the cause of the AE/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the appropriate AE/ SAE CRF and in the patient’s medical record 
to facilitate source data verification (SDV).   For SAEs, if, after follow -up, return to 
baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded in 
the additional case details sec tion of the Adverse Event CRF.  
For some SAEs, additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE 
report ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report) may be 
followed -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a mon itoring visit to obtain.

The investigator should notify the sponsor or its designee of any death or other SAE 
occurring at any time after a patient has discontinued or terminated study participation if 
felt to be related to prior study drug .  The sponsor or its designee sho uld also be notified 
if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a patient that participated in this study.

summaries may be provi ded by [CONTACT_454793]: LMS, UPS, epi[INVESTIGATOR_12311] , 
angiosarcoma , SS, and PVNS . 
A patient listing of all treated patients will be generated to describe site, patient number, 
screening date, first dosing date, duration of study treatment, analysis set in wh ich the 
patient included and disposition.  In the patient disposition listing, reason for study drug 
discontinuation will be included.  A table will be created to summarize these categories in 
terms of number and percent for each of the analysis set define d above.  
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight,

performance status, will be listed and summarized.  All summarie s will be presented by 
[CONTACT_454794] . 
Major protocol deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the 
trial, patient management, or patient assessment wi ll be listed.  
Study drug administration data will be listed by [CONTACT_454795] , and any 
dose modifications will be flagged.  Descriptive information will be provided regarding 
number of cycles, total duration of study drug exposure, actual  duration of study drug taken, 
cumulative dose of study drug, dose intensity and relative dose intensity and the number 
and timing of prescribed dose reductions and interruptions.  
The study endpoints are described in Section  4.  The planned analyses are described in  
detail in Sections  10.[ADDRESS_581483] results, 
changes in ECG/echocardiograms results and changes in vital signs.  All patients who 
receive at least one dose  of surufatinib will be included in the safety analysis ( ie, the Safety 
Analysis Set - All Treated Population ).

10.5 Pharmacokinetic A nalysis  
All patient s whose plasma samples are collected for analysis of the plasma surufatinib 
concentration and derivation of PK parameters will be included in the Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Set (PKAS).  
A non -compartmental model analysis will be performed for plasma concentra tion data by 
[CONTACT_454799] (enterprise version).  The following statistic data will also be 
reported: mean value, standard deviation, median value, minimum value, maximum value, 
geometric mean value, and geometric mean coefficient of variatio n. 
The individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters determined following analysis of the 
surufatinib concentration versus time data, will include, but not be limited to total plasma 
exposure (AUC 0-∞), Cmax , CL /F, and Vz/F .  The t1/[ADDRESS_581484] deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) will be presented.  The actual 
times of plasma sample collection will be used in the determination of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
The methods for calculating pharmacokinetic parameters  of surufatinib : 
• Cmax: the maximum observed plasma concentration over the sampling period, 
taken directly from the data.  
• Tmax: time at which C max occurred, taken directly from the data.  
• Kel: the first -order rate constant associated with the negative slope of the terminal 
portion of the log -linear concentration -time curve.  A minimum of three points 
will be used.  
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) to be determined 
by [CONTACT_24390], where AUC last is the AUC from time zero until the 
last concentration point and AUC 0-∞ is the AUC last + last concentration point 
divided by K el. 
• Half-life (t 1/2) to be determined according to t1/2 =0.693/K el where possible.  
• CL/F: systemic clearance to be determined according to Dose/AUC∞ 
• Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution, determined according to CL /F/Kel 
• Dose Proportionality: to be evaluated by [CONTACT_454800], and C max and dose. 
• Accumulation ratio: AUC Day15/AUC Day1 or AUC Day29/AUC Day1 
Where the concentration data are missing, or listed as less than Lower Limit of 
Quantification, they will be regarded as zero (0) if occurring before C max.  After C max, zero 
points will not be included in calculations.  
Individual and mean surufatinib concentrations will be plotted by [CONTACT_15994].

Censoring rea sons will also be summarized.  
10.6.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• ORR , defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of 
complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per RECIST Version 1.1.  To 
be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in  tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_74324] [ADDRESS_581485] met.  
• DCR , defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, 
or SD per RECIST Version 1.1.  
• TTR, de fined as the time between the start date of study drug until first 
documented response (CR or PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1.  
• DoR, defined as the time from the first time that the objective response reaches 
CR or PR, whiche ver comes first, until the o ccurrence of PD or death ( if the death 
of the patient occurs before recording the PD).  
• Percent changes of tumor size from baseline of target lesion will be calculated at 
each visit, and the maximum percent per patient will be selected.  Waterfall plots 
will be used to depi[INVESTIGATOR_454748].  These plots will 
display the best percentage change in target lesion size.  
ORR and DCR will be estimated and 95% exact CIs based on the Clopper -Pearson method 
will be presented.  The time to event endpoints,  TTR  and DoR will be described in tabular 
and graphical f ormat using Kaplan -Meier method , including estimated median (in months)

make an important contribution to the study implementation and management and 
personnel who make an important contribution to the study design, analysis, and 
interpretation (such as the sponsor’s staff or consul tants) will be listed in the publication.  
The sponsor will provide the article to investigators for review prior to publishing any study 
results.  Investigators must obtain approval from the sponsor before contributing to any 
related articles or abstracts . 
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support 
publication of multi -center studies only in their entirety and not as individu al site data.  In 
this case, a principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].

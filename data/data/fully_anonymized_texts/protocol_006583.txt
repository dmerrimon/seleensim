3.0 Summary of Research:  
3.1 We propose to examine the efficacy of monthly financial incentives contingent on observed 
breastfeeding (BF), supplemental to existing support from the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and home -based individual BF 
support, among low -income mothers. Low -income racial/ethnic- minority women breastfeed for 
an average duration of four months despi[INVESTIGATOR_45373] -based recommendations by [CONTACT_211203]. Insufficient duration of any BF is related to multiple maternal and child health problems, and increases in BF duration could be cost saving medically and societally.  Though peer support has been effective in prolonging BF duration, the effect has 
not been as strong for WIC -eligible, low -income mothers. An incentive -based intervention was 
tested among low -income Puerto Rican mothers in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( R03HD077057) resulting in 
promising outcomes of monthly financial incentives contingent on observed BF for 6 months combined with WIC BF usual care, compared to WIC BF usual care only (BF rates: 89% vs. 44% at 1- month; p = 0.01; 89% vs. 17% at 3- month; p<0.01; 72% vs. 0% at 6- month; p<0.01; N 
= 36). We propose a 2- group parallel randomized controlled trial in which half of the 168 WIC -
eligible mothers recruited to the trial will be allocated into each of the two study groups: (1) Standard Care BF Support ( WIC support + home -based individual support;  Standard Care 
(SC)) and (2) Incentives contingent on demonstrating successful BF ( SC + Breastfeeding 
Incentives;  SC+BFI ). Participants randomized into SC  will receive standard breastfeeding 
services from WIC and home visitations for individual support and problem -solving. Participants 
randomized into SC+BFI  will receive the same services as Control except that monthly financial 
incentives are contingent on observed BF and delivered at the end of each month. The study will be conducted in two regional sites with high concentrations of low -income racial/ethnic minority 
mothers, Philadelphia, PA and Newark , DE. The primary outcome will be the BF rate for 6-
month postpartum, the exploratory outcome will be the BF rate at 12- month postpartum, and the 
secondary outcomes will be infant outcomes (i.e., weight gain and emergency room visits). We hypothesize that SC+BFI will increase the BF rate by 25% at [ADDRESS_253075] interviews with corporate representatives and insurance companies to explore community-  and policy -level support to

 sustain the incentive -based intervention for WIC mothers. The aims of the proposal are guided 
by [CONTACT_211204]’s Pregnancy and 
Perinatology Branch to improve the long- term maternal and infant health of lo w-income 
populations via encouraging breastfeeding in the translational research context.  
4.0 Purpose of the Study:  
4.[ADDRESS_253076] is to address the public health priority of low rates of continued 
breastfeeding (BF) among low -income racial/ethnic minority women, a population known to 
wean BF early despi[INVESTIGATOR_211173]. Low -income 
racial/ethnic -minority women breastfeed for an average dur ation of [ADDRESS_253077] year. Low -income Puerto Rican 
and African American/Black mothers are especially at risk for low rates of continued BF. Low -
income African American/Black mothers have the poorest BF outcomes with lowest exclusive BF rates; and over 30% provide infant formulas as early as 2 days postpartum, much higher than the Healthy People (HP) 2020 threshold of 14%.

other Hispanic mothers and low -income mothers.2,[ADDRESS_253079] maternal and child 
health and inform practices in other high- risk groups . For example, suboptimal breastfeeding 
increases the risk for infant mortality5 and a variety of pediatric infectious diseases,6–13 and 
childhood overweight and obesity,14–17 as well as a number of maternal postpartum health 
issues.18–21 Improving BF rates to those endorsed by [CONTACT_25553]2020 would translate to >$3.6 billion in 
healthcare costs annually in U.S.8 and up to $118 per mother -infant dyad at the system level 
(Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]).[ADDRESS_253080] an extra out -of-pocket $46/month by 4-
month postpartum without having to buy formula,23 saving a total of $2800/year.[ADDRESS_253081] shown greater efficacy in increasing BF duration than those with structured education or professional support.
25 However, 
the effects are not as strong for low -income mothers.26 Improvements over existing methods are 
needed to increase BF rates at 3, 6, and 12- month postpartum2 in low -income mothers . A 
preliminary study with low -income Puerto Rican mothers (Washio; R03HD077057)27 showed 
that, compared to usual WIC BF support only, an intervention that combined usual WIC support 
with monthly financial incentives contingent upon observed BF prolonged BF duration (44% vs. 
89% at 1- month; p = 0.01; 17% vs. 89% at 3- month; p <0.01; and 0% vs. 72% at 6- month; p 
<0.01; N = 36). Further investigation is required to establish the efficacy and test the 
generalizability of the [ADDRESS_253082] on BF duration over 12- month postpartum. We will randomize 168 WIC -eligible mothers 
to be allocated into each o f the two study groups: (1) Standard Care BF Support (WIC support + 
home -based individual support; Standard Care (SC))  and (2) Incentives contingent on 
demonstrating s uccessful BF (SC + Breastfeeding Incentives; SC+BFI ). All participants receive 
usual WIC BF support and individual home -based support. The study will be conducted in two 
regional sites with low BF rates due to high concentrations of WIC -eligible, Black and Puerto 
Rican mothers (Philadelphia, PA and Newark , DE). The current proposal will track the costs for

insurance companies to explore community-  and policy- level support to sustain the incentive -
based intervention for WIC mothers.  
 
Aim 1 : To examine the efficacy of SC+BFI  compared to SC  on BF continuation rates at 6-  and 
12-month follow -up.  
 
Aim 2 : To examine the efficacy of SC+BFI  compared to SC on infant outcomes as the secondary 
outcomes  over a 12 -month follow -up.  
 
Aim 3 : To explore the effect of changes in theoretically important variables that may either 
moderate or mediate the effect of SC+BFI on BF and infant outcomes. We include hypothesized 
non-program factors (see Figure 1) that may moderate treatment efforts.  
 
Aim 4 : To explore community-  and policy- level factors that may impact the sustainability of an 
incentive -based intervention with corporate representatives and insurance companies. 
 
Aim 5 : To track the intervention and medical costs for cost -effectiveness analyses.   
4.[ADDRESS_253084] of monthly incentives contingent on BF in SC+BFI will increase BF rates by 25% at 6- month compared to SC . The exploratory outcome  is the BF continuation rate at 12 -
month postpartum. We will hypothesize that SC+BFI will increase the BF rate at 12 -month, 
compared to SC.  
We hypothesize that compared to the SC condition, the SC+BFI condition will have significantly lower infant weight gain and incidents of ER visits for infants at 3- month postpartum. We 
hypothesize that participants in SC+BFI  would evidence greater increases in the motivation and 
self-efficacy, which, in turn, will account for between- group differences in outcomes.   
5.0 Background/Literature Review/Rationale for the S tudy:  
5.1 Background : Disparities in the health outcomes for mothers and their children exist due to low 
BF rates. WIC -eligible mothers are identified as at risk for early cessation of BF. Early cessation 
of BF leads to multiple health risks including increase in mortality and infectious diseases among 
infants and postpartum health issues. Several promising approaches exist to increase BF 
duration, including home -based professional and peer lactation support and financial incentives 
contingent on BF. However, the se approaches have never established their efficacy to increase 
BF duration among low -income mothers.   
Breastfeeding (BF) compared to formula saves money and benefits mothers and infants health. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends mothers to exclusively breastfeed for the first [ADDRESS_253085] year.20 The 6-  and 12- month BF 
continuation rates of 49.4% and 26.7% in U.S. are still lower than the goals of 60.6% and 34.1% endorsed by [CONTACT_25553]2020, despi[INVESTIGATOR_211174] 79.2% close to the 81.9% goal.1 In the Pennsylvania state, BF rates at 6 - and 12- month were 45.7% and 26.1%, and in the Delaware 
state, the rates were 34.4% and 16.8%.1 Low BF rates among low -income mothers contribute to 
the overall BF rates in U.S. with an average duration of 4 months.21 In Philadelphia, the BF continuation rates are low among Medicaid- eligible mothers, non- Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanic

 mothers with an average duration of only 11.3±11.0 weeks.22,23 In the Delaware state, 20% of 
Medicaid -eligible mothers continue BF at [ADDRESS_253086] rates closer to HP2020 goals are necessary.  
5.2 Innovation : The proposed research represents an innovative, substantive departure from the 
status quo in five ways. Primary innovations of this study include: contingent incentives on observed breastfeeding; contingent BF incentives on infant outcomes; theoretically- based factors 
that mediate the intervention effect; exploration of sustainability of the incentive -based 
approach; cost -tracking for interventions, formula supplementation, and infant medical issues.  
5.3 Preliminary Study and Results : A pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (R03HD077057) of the proposed intervention 
was conducted from February [ADDRESS_253087] in the study were referred to research staff by a social worker at Temple University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
research staff met them either at a WIC office or their home for enrollment.  Of the 61 women 
screened, 36 (59%) were enrolled: 5 (8%) st opped breastfeeding before enrollment; 7 (12%) 
declined to participate; and 13 (21%) expressed an interest but failed to complete the enrollment process.  
The study employed a randomized, two- arm parallel -group design. Half of the participants (n = 
18) were randomized into the WIC Usual Care (WIC -only) condition, and the other half (n = 18) 
into the WIC+Incentive condition. All participants were eligible to receive WIC BF support. 
Those randomized to receive incentives received monthly financial incentives in cash for the first 
[ADDRESS_253088] 
intervention entry either at a WIC office  or participant’s home. One participant moved out -of-
state and was lost to follow -up at 3- month postpartum. All enrolled participants were included in 
the intent -to-treat analysis that examined outcomes over a 6 -month period. All participants in 
WIC+Incent ive and 94% (17/18) of the participants in WIC -only completed all postpartum 
assessments (97% follow -up rate).

characteristics, and no significant differences were observed. Significantly more mothers in the 
WIC+Incentive group breastfed at each time point compared to those in the WIC -only group (1-
month: p = 0.01; 3- month: p < 0.0001; 6- month: p < 0.0001; Figure 1). Mothers who breastfed at 
1-month postpartum in the WIC+Incentive group notably continued BF, without any significant 
subsequent decline (p = 0.19). Breastfeeding s ignificantly declined over time in the WIC -only 
group (p < 0.01). Only 1 WIC+Incentive participant and no WIC -only participants exclusively 
breastfed for 6 months. The mean duration of breastfeeding was 149±54 days in the incentive 
group and 49±44 days in the control group (p < 0.001). The participants in the incentive group 
earned on average a total of $199±106 for contingent monthly financial incentives during 6-
month postpartum. Seventy- two percent of WIC+Incentive and 89% of WIC -only mothers 
started pro viding formula supplementation by 1- month postpartum (p = 0.40), and 89% in the 
WIC+Incentive and 100% in the WIC -only groups had introduced supplementation by 3- months 
postpartum (p=0.49).

Excessive infant weight gain increases the risk of childhood overweight and obesity especially 
among low income racial/ethnic minority groups.102 WIC+Incentive infants weighed considerably less, though not significantly, than WIC -only infants at 1- month (3772.0±767.2 vs. 
4223.3±1150.7, p = 0.13; - 0.46[95%CI: - 1.16,0.24]), and continued to weigh slightly less at 3-

9.0 Study Design:  
9.[ADDRESS_253094] initiated BF postpartum will be identified and contact[CONTACT_211208]’s doctor either in person or phone call to tell them about the study. If interested, they will then be referred to a Research As sistant (RA) for invitatio n to the study. 
Eligibility screening will be conducted during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The participants will be assured that all study data will be kept strictly confidential and will not affect the status of their treatment or services at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211182]. El igible mothers will be provided with the 
informed consent and HIPAA forms for mothers and babies. The RA will discuss the content of the study to ensure understanding of procedures, risks and benefits, human subject protections, and participants' autonomy. Mothers reporting current suicidal thoughts or attempts will be referred for psychosocial care at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211183].  
If the mother is not interested in participating in the study, staff will say “that’s okay, we 
understand that all happening to you right now can be overwhelming. Thank you very much for your time! Congratulations again and let me know if you need any imme diate assistance from the 
staff.” If there is need for immediate breastfeeding and other support, staff will refer the mother immediately to the postpartum floor staff or a lactation consultant.

Infants: A n infant  of the parent will be included in the study: trained RAs will collect 
length and weight measurements of the child, and collect anal swabs for microbiome 
analysis . The permission of one parent is sufficient even if both parents are alive, 
known, competent, reasonably available, and shares legal responsibility for the care 
and custody of the child. Assent of the child will not be obtained because their 
capability is  so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted.  
Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_211184] – one for study staff and one for mom to keep for her records.  
9.4 Study Timelines  
 Subjects agree to participate for one year.  
We propose a 5 -year (60 month) timeline: formative evaluation, hiring and training, study setup 
(months 1- 6); recruitment (months 7 -42); trial implementation (months 7 -55); data collection, 
cost tracking (months 7- 55); stakeholder interviews, dissemination of efforts, analyses, 
presentations, and manuscripts (months 56- 60). 
9.5 Study Endpoints  
 The primary outcome  is the BF continuation rate at 6- month postpartum. This is determined by 
[CONTACT_211210]: audible swallowing, regular suck/swallow/breath patters, 
visible milk in the infant’s mouth after the infant is not latched anymore. Or, in the  case of 
pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_211185], pumped milk and successful feeding to the infant. We hypothesize that the isolated effect of monthly incentives contingent on BF in SC+BFI will increase BF rates by 25% at 6-month compared to SC.  
The exploratory outcome  is the BF continuation rate at 12- month postpartum. We will 
hypothesize that SC+BFI will increase the BF rate at 12 -month, compared to SC.  
10.0 Study Procedures Involved:  
10.1 We will use a randomized, two -group design (Standard Care+Breastfeeding Support vs.Standard 
Care+Breastfeeding Incentives).  
10.2 We will use a permuted block random assignment (with block size = 6), assigning participants to 
one of 2 groups: Standard Care or Standard Care + BFI . This will allow us to keep group sizes 
approximately equivalent during the study maintaining an approximately equal size for the [ADDRESS_253098]. Zhang (Co- I) who will

support and problem -solving in addition to WIC services. At each monthly home visit, blinded 
RA will ask participants to demonstrate BF, praise participants’ efforts to continue BF, problem -
solve issues around BF, pr ovide local BF resources, and identify any issues with BF and other 
medical and psychosocial needs. Signs to verify ongoing BF include audible swallowing of 
breastmilk, regular suck/swallow/breathing patter ns, visible milk in an infant’s mouth, and (in 
case of pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_211185]) pumped milk and successful feeding of an infant. When a participant has trouble with BF, she will be referred to a certified lactation consultant (CLC). Should a participant report any ad verse maternal and infant outcome during the study period, blinded RA 
will document the event, report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_211186], and make referrals as needed. Participants in SC will be asked to monitor their nutritional habit each month and to complete 24- hour r ecalls 
for each month. Research staff will mark a tally on a checklist at each monthly visit, and completion of nutritional monitoring will lead to a lump sum compensation for a total potential earning of $240 with $40 per completed monthly nutritional monitoring. Participants will also receive diapers and wipes at every home visit. This is comparable to the SC+BFI group to control for the incentive amount. However, in SC , this payment is tied to monitoring the 
nutritional habit and paid in a lump sum – not to observed BF at each month as in the SC+BFI 
group.  
If a participant misses an appointment, this will be counted as incompliance with monthly 
nutritional monitoring. The participant will be given an opportunity to make up for the missed 
appointment within one -week timeframe from a due date. Blinded RA will contact a participant a 
week prior to the due date and make an appointment. After 3 attempts to reach a participant by

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_211172], Ph.D.   DATE: 4/3/[ADDRESS_253102] Care + Breastfeeding Incentives (SC+BFI). Participants in SC+BFI will receive all 
WIC usual care elements the SC group receives, plus (the only element that is different between groups) an escalating amount of monthly financial incentives contingent on observed BF and that incentives will be delivered immediately upon verified BF at each month. This will isolate the component of contingent incentives on BF which is hypothesized to produce the largest effect on continued BF rates. Blinded RA will as k participants to demonstrate BF and provide individual 
support to praise efforts to continue BF and problem -solve BF issues.  
Contingent incentive component: The incentive amount was $20.[ADDRESS_253103] month and increased by $10.00 every month until the end of 6 months. The maximum potential earning is $270.00. The initial incentive value of $20 was determined in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_211187] -receiving Puerto Rican mothers as the minimum amount of monthly incentives that 
would motivate them to breastfeed (not to substitute for compensation from work outside of home). An escalating schedule of monthly incenti ves was employed based on previous incentive -
based interventions to encourage continuous abstinence from substance use. A participant who successfully demonstrates BF receives the incentive amount on a pre -paid credit card at the end 
of each month. If a pa rticipant misses an appointment or does not demonstrate BF, she will not 
receive the incentive. The rest of the procedure will be the same as for SC. We will also provide bonus incentives of $50 to mothers who selected full BF food package from WIC  at baseline, 3 
months and 6 months postpartum . Selection of the WIC food package will be verified through 
WIC.  
10.4 Assessment. All participants in both groups will be asked to complete periodic assessments at 1 -, 
3-, 6-, 9-, and 12 -month postpartum intervals either at home or by [CONTACT_648]. Assessments at 1, 3, 
and 6- month postpartum will be conducted by [CONTACT_211213] 9 and 12- month postpartum will be conducted in person. An RA will call a 
participant and make an appointment a week prior to the scheduled assessment date. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_211188] 97% follow -up rate at [ADDRESS_253104] policy on pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and lack of social support. Appointment cards will be given to participants for future appointments.  
10.5 Payments. Participants in SC+BFI will receive dollar amount incentives on a pre -paid credit 
card for breastfeeding. This type of system functions just like a Master Card and allows remote 
reloading. This system has been feasibly and effectively used by [CONTACT_211214]. Un- blinded 
Project Coordinator will credit a dollar amount remotely on a Master Card for each participant.  
Participants in SC will receive a lump sum payment in form of retail gift cards at the end of 6 
months based on the number of completed home visitations. The lump sum will be calculated after 6
th month home visitation, and unblinded staff will notify the participant that the payment is 
ready for pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up at the Temple University College of Public Health.  
All participants will receive retail gift cards for completing periodic assessments. Gift cards will be delivered in person on the day of in- person assessments, and at the next home visitation for 
phone -based assessments that are completed prior to the upc oming home visitation appointment.  
All participants will receive a gift basket at the 12 -month visit as well.

11.0 Risks to Participants:  
11.1     Anticipated potential risks for participants who are enrolled in this study are 1) participants may 
be exposed to psychological by [CONTACT_211219]; 2) participants may feel hesitance or concern completing research measures including breastfeeding observation; and 3) participants may be at risk of harm resulting from breach of confidentiality. They are considered minimal because they are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life.

 1. Participants may be exposed to psychological or physical coercion by [CONTACT_211220].  
Protections: If research staff detects such psychological and physical coercion through direct and 
indirect observations during the study period, they will remind mothers that it is their choice to be in the study and that research staff will not tell anybody about the status of study participation. If a participant reports any psychological concern or shows 13 or greater score or endorsement in suicidal ideation in the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, then staff will refer the participant 
to nearby [CONTACT_211221][INVESTIGATOR_307]- based mental health treatment programs.  
2. Participants may feel hesitance or concern completing research measures including breastfeeding observation.  
Protections:  Participants will be informed of potential hesitance or concern from completing 
research measures before signing the consent form and will be allowed to refuse to answer any question, provide biological samples, or let research staff observe BF or pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_211193]. All research staff will be females. In the event of refusing to let research staff observe BF or pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], mothers will not be eligible for receiving monthly financial incentives 
contingent on observed BF; however, they receive  compensations for monthly nutritional 
monitoring and periodic assessments as those in the control condition. Their data will not be used 
for analyses. Direct observation of BF in a home setting has been acceptable to pi[INVESTIGATOR_172165], and no parti cipants refused to demonstrate BF in front of research staff that they 
built rapport with. Research staff will be trained in how to address hesitance or concern among participants and how to ask observing BF or pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a non- invasive manner.     
3. Harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality: Breach of confidentiality could include unauthorized persons accessing information contained in their study files.   
Protections:  Every effort will be made to protect confidentiality of the information that 
participants provide. We will adhere to all applicable state and federal confidentiality regulations. All participants will be informed of all anticipated risks prior to giving t heir 
informed consent to participate in the research study. They will be told that they can discontinue participation at any time without penalty. Research materials will be encoded with a research number and will contain no other identifying i nformation in order to protect participant 
confidentiality. The majority of the data associated with the study will be entered directly by [CONTACT_211222] a secured web -based data entry system (RedCap) via WiFi -connected laptop. 
Materials that need to be completed in paper -and-pencil format (only in case of equipment 
failure or lack of access to the internet) will be secured in locked filing cabinets in the research office located at Temple University College of Public Health  and transported by [CONTACT_211223]. Any 
information containing client identifiers will be kept in locked filing cabinets  at Temple 
University College of Public Health or in a password- protected electronic file on a secure online 
database, separate from the data management security will be monitored by [CONTACT_211224] (PC) and the PI.  
12.0 Withdrawal of Subjects   
12.1 If women are incarcerated during 6 months of study participation, and if participants fail to attend 
scheduled visits during 6 months of study participation for more than 3 months, participants may 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Individual Breastfeeding Support with Contingent Incentives for Low -Income Mothers  
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_211172], Ph.D.   DATE: 4/3/[ADDRESS_253114] to study withdrawal without their consent. Participants deemed eligible for study 
withdrawal by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_211194].   
Participants who were terminated on their study participation will not be followed up for periodic 
assessments or monthly home visitations. However, if participants need assistance in 
breastfeeding and other psychosocial issues, research staff provides ref errals to appropriate 
community and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71089].  
13.0 Potential Benefits to Participants:   
13.[ADDRESS_253115] benefits from participating in the study to increase access to existing breastfeeding support available in t he community. 
Participants in the SC+BFI group may also experience increased motivation and confidence to continue breastfeeding for [ADDRESS_253116] therapeutic benefits to subjects and new scientific information to be gained in the proposed studies outweigh any risks involved.  
14.0 Financial Compensation:  
14.1 There are three kinds of financial compensations involved in the study.  
1) Contingent incentives on breastfeeding for participants in SC+BFI: This will be 
paid immediately and remotely on a Master Card as soon as breastfeeding is 
confirmed. The amount in the first month home visitation will be $20, increasing by $10 every month, for a total potential earning of $270. Participants in this group will also be eligible to receive $50 per selection of full breastfeeding food package at WIC at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. Thus, a potential total earning in this group is $420.  
2) Incentives on home visitations for participants in SC: This will be paid at the end of 6 months based on the number of completed home visitations. The amount per home visit will be $40  for a total potential earning of $240. This will be paid in 
form of retail gift cards.  
3) Assessment compensations for all participants: This will be paid after each completed assessment in form of retail gift cards. After phone assessments one week prior to home visitation appointments, $20 gift cards will be delivered at the next home visitation appointment. At baseline, 9, and 12- month, $40 will be 
paid in person at their home after in- person assessments.  
14.2 Contingent incentives on breastfeeding in SC+BFI will be provided immediately upon each monthly home visitation. Incentives on home visitations in SC will be prorated at the end of 6 months based on the number of completed home visitations. Payments for completing assessments will be provided after each assessment in person.   
Participants in SC+BFI will receive dollar amount incentives on a pre -paid credit 
card for breastfeeding . This type of system functions just like a Master Card and 
allows remote reloading. This system has been feasibly and effectively used by 
[CONTACT_5301]: Individual Breastfeeding Support with Contingent Incentives for Low -Income Mothers  
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_211172], Ph.D.   DATE: 4/3/[ADDRESS_253117] for each participant.  
Payments for home visitations for participants in SC and for assessments for all 
participants will be provided in form of retail gift cards  in person.  
14.3 Payments for assessments for all participants and contingent incentives for breastfeeding in SC+BFI will be provided immediately after each completion. If participants in SC withdraw before study completion, incentives will be paid based on the number of completed home 
visitations prior to withdrawal.  
14.4     Since interventions and assessments occur in their homes or over the phone, we do not anticipate 
any costs incurring on the participants’ side. Depending on the participants’ calling plan of their   
phones and whether they choose to use their phone minutes or Wifi connections, phone minutes 
may be consumed during phone assessments at 1, 3, and 6- month postpartum.  
15.[ADDRESS_253118] the Privacy Interests of Participants:  
15.1 Following screening and consenting during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], all in- person home visitations and 
assessments will occur in participants’ home setting where participants can ensure privacy during data collection according to their standard.  
15.2 All data collection after screening and consenting during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], except for three phone -based assessments, will occur in participants’ home setting, where adequate privacy will 
be provided according to the participants’ standard.

17.0 Data Monitoring Plan to Ensure the Safety of Participants:  
17.1 A data safety monitoring (DSM) plan will be developed for this project  with six  experts in 
biostatistics/epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], biobehavioral ethics, and obstetric  and pediatric  clinical care (John 
Cacciola from Public Health Management Cooperation, Esther Chung at  University of 
Washington (Chair), and Barry Bodt at University of Delaware ), and the data safety monitoring 
board (DSMB) will review the plan and determine whether the project requires on- going review 
by [CONTACT_211225] [CONTACT_23588]. This decision will be completed prior to the commencement of data collection .   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_211195], executing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), complying with any reporting requirements, and consulting with the DSMB when the study needs to be terminated f or

addition to the required IRB monitoring), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a summary of the DSM reports to 
NICHD on an annual basis (along with IRB reports). The DSM report will include the 
participants’ socio -demographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, 
retention rates, quality assurance, or regulatory issues that occurred during the past year, a summary of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol. The DSM report will also include, when available, the results of any interim outcome analyses. In addition to the annual DSM report, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_211196].

will maintain all approved documents, and signed contracts/data sharing agreements both at a 
Temple University shared folder ( OneDrive  or TempleOwl secure server ) and RTI password -
protected computer.    
Each institution will develop a reliance agreement with Advarra IRB as the IRB of record to  ensure monitoring of human subject protection as well as training records 
of each study staff and investigator. Weekly staff meeting will ensure general 
compliance with the study protocol. [CONTACT_211242] will be available any time by [CONTACT_211232]. The project coordinator will supervise and monitor study 
compliance with regard to phone -based assessments, and [CONTACT_211242] will 
occasionally make compliance checks by [CONTACT_211233], enrollment, intervention, a nd follow -up period. The Project 
Coordinator makes unannounced checks to ensure that all cabinets containing 
confidential materials are locked, and no identifying forms are left visible and 
unattended. Documentation of these visits is kept in the project binder. Any breaches 
of participant confidentiality that occur during the course of the study will be 
reported to the IRB of record . Protocol deviation will be reported to the IRB of 
record when noncompliance with the study protocol occurs.

Statistical Design and Power  
Data Analyses  
Data cleaning.  All data will be reviewed for valid values/data entry errors, outliers, and the extent and 
pattern of missing data. Consistency and logic checks that constitute standard review/cleaning procedures will 
be applied. Internal validity (how well the randomization worked to create similar study groups) will be checked 
by [CONTACT_211234]- linear models for discrete or ordinal responses.  
Missing values . We will use an intent -to-treat analysis treating missing values for breastfeeding ( BF) 
status as non- BF status. In addition, the mixed effect models will provide valid estimates of efficacy if the 
proportion of missing values is less than 10%.1 
Interim analyses . Three interim analyses will be conducted to formally monitor the accumulating data in 
the study, at 2  month s, 4 month s, and 6 months,  with expected increase of BF rate by 25% as a significant 
increase at 6 -month postpartum.   With the overall proposed recruitment number of 168 participants, the α-
levels are 0.012, 0.016 , and 0.022 for 2 -month, 4 -month, and 6 -month postpartum , based on the standardized 
Z-values for the two groups from the O’Brien- Fleming function with cumulative α=0.05 with power of 85%.  If we 
do not see significant increases (at pre -required α -level) either at 2 or  4 months, we will increase the number of 
participants to recruit to sustain the power.  
Logistic regression will be used to compare groups on the primary binary outcomes of point -prevalence 
of BF status at 1 -, 3-, 6-, and 12- month postpartum; survival analyses will also be used to assess continuation. 
The models will include terms for study group, time, and the group by [CONTACT_6491]. Although propensity 
score -matched randomization will minimize the need for covariate adjustment, theoretically important 
covariates and differences will be considered for inclusion in adjusted analyses to impr ove their precision.

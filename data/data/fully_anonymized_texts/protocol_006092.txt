STUDY OBJECTIVES :  
Primary  Objectives : 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal administration of  twice -daily  doses of 
186 and 372 μg of OPN -375 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) with placebo in subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis  (CRS) 
using the following co- primary endpoints:  
• change from baseline in symptoms as measured by a composite score of nasal symptoms (CSNS): 
congestion, facial pain or pressure sensation, and nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior)  at the end of 
Week 4  
and 
• change from baseline to Week 24/ET  in the average percent of opacified volume  (APOV) in the ethmoid and 
maxillary sinuses  
Key Secondary  Objectives :  
The following key secondary objectives will compare the efficacy of twice daily doses of 186 and 372 µg of 
OPN -375 with placebo by [CONTACT_445963] -FLU -CS-3206 and OPN -FLU -CS-3205, 
which is a separate study being conducted in parallel to this study.  
• change from baseline to Week 4 on CSNS  (AM, Instantaneous)  score in subjects who were symptomatic at 
trial entry desp ite reported use of an intranasal steroid for treatment of CRS within 30 days of Visit 1  
• Frequency of acute exacerbations of CRS over the 24- week treatment period, defined as a worsening of 
symptoms that requires an escalation of treatment  
The following key secondary objective will compare the efficacy of twice daily doses of 186 and 372 µg of OPN -
375 with placebo by [CONTACT_445964], from studies OPN -FLU -CS-
3206 and OPN -FLU -CS-3205, which is a separate study being conducted in parallel to this study.  
• Frequency of acute exacerbations of CRS over the 24- week treatment period, defined as a worsening of 
symptoms that requires an escalation of treatment  
The following key secondary objective s of this study  will compare the efficacy twice- daily doses of 186 and 372 
μg of OPN -375 with placebo on:  
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in four separate cardinal CRS symptoms, as measured by a CSNS  
(AM, Instantaneous): congestion, facial pain or pressure sensation, nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior), and sense of smell  
• time to first acute exacerbation of CRS, defined as a worsening of symptoms that requires escalation of treatment  
Safety Objective:  
• 
to evaluate the safety of OPN -375 by [CONTACT_12902] (AEs) throughout the study; results of nasal 
examination , vital signs measurements (ie,  blood pressure, pulse ), and weight;  and monitoring concomitant 
medication usage  
STUDY DESIGN:  24-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study to 
evaluat e the efficacy and s afety of i ntranasal administration of 186 and 372  μg of OPN -375 BID in subjec ts with 
CRS  without nasal polyps.  
STUDY POPULATION:  Approximately 210 subjects will be randomly assigned  to receive OPN -375 186 μg or 
372 μg, or placebo  (70 subjects  in each  treatment  group); subjects will be randomized using a 1:1: 1 ratio.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May [ADDRESS_566985], DOSE AND MODE  OF ADMINISTRATION : Twice  daily doses of 186 
and 37 2 μg of OPN -375. Subjects will be instructed to administer 2 spray s per nostril approximately every 12 
hours  for 24 weeks . The active treatment will contain a formulation of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_324258] 93 µg 
per spray.  
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE, AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION : Placebo twice daily delivered 
intranasally by [CONTACT_324311] 7- to up  to 21-day single -blind placebo run -in period and the 24 -week 
double -blind treatment phase.  
ASSESSMENTS : 
Efficacy  Assessments: During the double -blind phase, electronic diaries will be completed twice daily by [CONTACT_324312] (ie, symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal discharge [ anterior 
and/or posterior ], facial pain or pressure sensation, and sense of smell ), and use of approved rescue medication 
after the Week [ADDRESS_566986] -completed questionnaires will be used to measure the symptoms and 
social/emotional consequences  of the subject’s nasal disorder (SNOT -22), health- related quality of life 
(EuroQol -5 D [ EQ-5D] SF-36v2, and Short Form -6 dimension [SF -6D]) , sleep quality and disturbances 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] [ PSQI ]), depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 
[QIDS] ), work productivity, and objective smell test ( Smell Identification Test [ SIT]). Subjects will assess their 
global impression of change since starting the study drug using the Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGIC ) 
scale. Health economic information related to CRS  will also be collected  using the Health and Work Performance 
Questionnaire (H PQ). Objective changes in disease severity will be assessed via sinus CT  scan. 
Safety  Assessments : Safety will be assessed  by [CONTACT_324313], nasal examination,  vital 
signs measurements (ie, blood pressure, pulse), weight, and through collection of information for concomitant 
medications . 
ENDPOINTS:  
Efficacy  
Primary:  
Co-Primary Endpoints : 
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in average instantaneous morning ( AM) scores (evaluation of 
symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) of:  
o nasal congestion  
o nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior)  
o facial pain/p ressure sensation  
The b aseline  CSNS  is the average of the  total instantaneous AM scores over the last 7  days of the single  
blind  run-in period, and at the end of Week  4, scores are averaged over 7 days before Week 4. 
• change from baseline to Week 24 in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses  
Key Secondary Endpoints:  
• change from baseline to Week 4 on CSNS score (AM, Instantaneous) in subjects who were symptomatic at 
trial entry despi[INVESTIGATOR_324252] 30 days of  Visit 1 in 
subjects from studies OPN -FLU -CS-3206 and OPN -FLU -CS-3205 (pooled data)  
• Frequency of acute exacerbations of CRS over the 24- week treatment period, defined as a worsening of 
symptoms that requires an escalation of treatment, in subjects from studies OPN -FLU -CS-3206 and OPN -
FLU -CS-3205 (pooled data)  
• Frequency of acute exacerbations of CRS over the 24- week treatment period, defined as a worsening of 
symptoms that requires an escalation of treatment in subjects with CRS without NP, from studies OPN -FLU -
CS-3206 and OPN -FLU -CS-3205 (pooled data)  
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in four separate cardinal CRS symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_445966]  
(AM, Instantaneous): congestion, facial pain or pressure sensation, nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior), and sense of smell  for 3206 alone  
• time to first acute exacerbation of CRS, defined as a worsening of symptoms that requires escalation of treatment  for 3206 alone  
Safety  Endpoints:  
• monitoring AEs throughout the study; results of nasal examination , vital signs measurements (ie,  blood 
pressure, pulse) , and weight ; and monitoring concomitant medication usage  
DURATION OF THE STUDY:  
The duration of each subject’s enrollment is expected to be approximately 26 weeks.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

Protocol Number OPN -FLU -CS-3206   
 
Page 16 of 81 
Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  Sample Size Determination : Sample size requirements  were based on a previous Phase  3 studies of OPN -375 in 
subjects with nasal polyposis and data from a study evaluating the change in maxillary and ethm oid opacification 
in CRS  patients treated with a n intramuscular  dose of triamcinolone. Based on the results for changes from 
baseline in morning symptoms among subjects with nasal polyps in the previous studies conducted with OPN -
375, a sample of 70 subjects per group ( 210 total subjects) is sufficient to detect a 0. 9 scale difference in morning 
symptoms score between treatments ( OPN -375 vs placebo) using a 2- sided test at the 5% significance level with 
88% power, and assuming a standard deviation (SD)  of 1.7. This sample size is also adequate to detect a 9% 
difference between treatment  groups in average percent opacification using a 2- sided test at the 5%  significance 
level with 88% power, and assuming a SD  of 17%.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  For the co -primary endpoint CSNS, the estimator is the mean difference between 
treatments (active versus placebo) in change from baseline to the end of Week  4 in the 7- day average total CSNS  
(instantaneous AM ). Estimation is based on a mixed mode l for repeated measures (MMRM), where changes from 
baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the 7- day average total CSNS  (instantaneous AM ), respectively, are the 
repeated measures, including categorical effects for previous sinus surgery (Y,N), treatment (OPN -375 186 µg, 
OPN -375 372 µg, placebo), week (2, 4) treatment -by-week interaction, and the continuous covariate baseline 7 -
day average t otal CSNS ( instantaneous AM ) with baseline -by-week interaction. For the co -primary endpoint 
APOV, the estimator is the mean difference between treatments (active versus placebo) in the change from baseline to Week  24/ET APOV. Estimation is based on an ANCO VA model including categorical effects for 
previous sinus surgery (Y,N), treatment (OPN -375 186 µg, OPN -375 372 µg, placebo), and baseline APOV.  
 Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_566987] term 
for protocol ( OPN -FLU -CS-3205, OPN -FLU -CS-3206). The same model will be used for the analysis of CSNS 
component scores and sense of smell in the CRS without n asal polyps population.  
The frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks will be compared between OPN -375 dose groups and 
placebo using generalized linear model (GLM) for data from the negative binomial distribution that is commonly 
referred to as the negative binomial (NB) r egression model. The NB model will include the same model terms as 
the primary models; in additional, the model will include a categorical effect for protocol ( OPN -FLU -CS-3205, 
OPN -FLU -CS-3206), and the logarithm of follow -up time as an offset variable. Th e same model will be used for 
the pooled analysis of  the frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks  in the CRS without n asal polyps 
population.  
 The analysis of the following key secondary endpoints are based on the data from Study OPN -FLU -CS-3206 
only:  
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in four separate cardinal CRS symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_445966]  
(AM, Instantaneous) : congestion, facial pain or pressure sensation, nasal discharge (anterior and/or 
posterior), and sense of smell will be analyzed using the same MMRM model described above.  
• The Kaplan -Meier method and log -rank test will be used to estimate and compare the distributions of time to 
first acute CRS exacerbation between each OPN -375 dose and placebo.  
 
Safety Analysis:  
All safety summ aries will be descriptive; no statistical inference procedures will be applied . All safety summaries 
will be presented by [CONTACT_324314] -375 dose level (186 μg  and 372 μg ) and total  OPN -375, and placebo .

OptiNose has developed OPN- 375 (proprietary name [CONTACT_324365]®) as an intranasal drug delivery 
system with the intention to improve the performance of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_445946] . Delivery of drug using an  Exhalation Delivery System (EDS ) is intended to  
improve reproducibility of nasal delivery, parti cularly deposition of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_324261] (ostiomeatal complex  [OMC] ). OPN- 375 is 
also intended to address user preference associated with reduced drip- out (posterior and anterior) 
and taste, and t o improve tolerability and efficiency by [CONTACT_445968] (GI) tract and lungs.

dermatosis (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), rhinitis (intranasal), and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (inhaled)  and is one of the most well studied and characterized glucocorticoids in clinical 
use today.  
Information  available  on OPN- 375 for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis  (CRS)  with and 
without nasal polyposis is summarized in the following sections. For the most comprehensive

1.1 Background  
A clinical development program for OPN- 375 (XHANCE) in adults with nasal polyposis has been 
completed . XHANCE  is currently approved for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients [ADDRESS_567007] of this protocol , OptiNose intends  to study the efficacy 
and safety of OPN- 375 in subjec ts with CRS .  
Sinusitis is defined  as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. If the 
duration of sinusitis is more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations, it is deemed to 
be CRS  (Bachert et al, 2014 ; Fokkens et al, 2012). It is variously estimated that approximately 4% 
of patients with CRS  have concurrent nasal polyps (with estimated prevalence in the low, single 
digits for  the population as a whole). Chronic rhinosinusitis affects approximately 5% to 15% of 
the general population in Europe and the [LOCATION_002]  (US) (Hamilos, 2011), and the prevalence 
of physic ian-diagnosed CRS  was found to be 2% to 4% ( Chen et al, 2003; Shashy et al, 2004). 
Chronic rhinosinusitis has significant impac t on healthcare resource utilization  and work 
productivity, with approximately [ADDRESS_567008] productivity in 2016 ( Rudmik 2017) . Chronic rhinosinusitis also has a significant impact on 
health -related quality of life, and patients with this condition scored lower on measures of bodily 
pain and social functioning than those with serious chronic conditions including angina, back pain, congestive heart failure, and COPD ( Gliklich and Metson, 1995).  
The etiology and pathogenesis of CRS  is multifactorial. Although a number of factors have  been 
found to be associated with CRS , including ciliary impairment, allergy, asthma, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_79948],

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May [ADDRESS_567009] or 
single antecedent trigger that leads to the development of  CRS . Nevertheless, persistent 
inflammation of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses, progressing from mucosal injury to tissue change, is sine qua non in the pathophysiology of CRS  with or without nasal polyps ( Akdis 
et al, 2013). Evidence of inflammation is generally present throughout the nasal cavity, including around the OMC , where the sinuses ventilate and drain into the nasal cavity.  
Consistent with the location of the inflammatio n, the most common symptom associated with CRS  
is nasal obstruction, followed by [CONTACT_324319]- pressure/pain -fullness, discolored anterior and 
posterior nasal discharge , and hypos omia. The presence of 2  or more symptoms, 1 of which should 
be nasal obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, persisting beyond 12 weeks, is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of CRS  (Meltzer et al, 2004 ). Howeve r, diagnosis based on symptoms alone is 
relatively nonspecific. Visualization of discharge from the OMC  by [CONTACT_445969], the presence of polyps in the nasal cavity, or radiographic imaging showing inflammation of the paranasal sin uses is typi[INVESTIGATOR_445947] ( Bhattacharyya 
and Lee, 2010 ). 
Intranasal topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], though not formally indicated, are first -line pharmacotherapy for 
CRS  with or without nasal polyps ( Bachert et al, 2014 ; Fokkens et al, 2012; Rosenfeld et al, 2015). 
Qualitative syntheses and meta -analyses have been performed on the reported clinical trials in 
patients without nasal polyps (10 and 7 trials for qualitative synthesis and meta -analysis, 
respectively) and in patients with nasa l polyps (38 and 26 trials for qualitative synthesis and meta -
analysis, respectively) ( Fokkens et al, 2012). The studies included patients with prior sinus surgery, 
without sinus surgery, or a mixed population with regard to sinus surgery. The meta -analyses 
demonstrated that treatment with intranasal corticosteroids improved symptoms to a greater extent than placebo in CRS  patients both with and without nasal polyps. However, the efficacy of 
intranasal corticosteroids in CRS  patients without nasal polyps was modest, with several of the 
trials failing to demonstrate a significant treatment effect compared with placebo. It is  also notable 
that among the CRS  patients without nasal polyps only those who had prior sinus surgery showed 
symptomatic improvement. Adverse events associated with intranasal corticosteroids generally were local at the site of administration, not serious,  and consisted mainly of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nasal 
irritation and headache ( Fokkens et al, 2012).  
Clinical guidelines suggest that for patients who do not respond to intranasal corticosteroids after 3 months of treatment, a course of systemic antibiotic treatment may be considered.  
Endoscopic sinus surgery is generally effective in reducing the symptoms of CRS with or without 
nasal polyps ( Chester et al, 2009); however, the 5 -year revision rate for su rgery approaches 20%, 
with the revision rate generally being higher for patients with CRS with nasal polyps (21% vs 
16%) than for those without nasal polyps ( Hopkins et al, 2009). Furthermore,  although surgery is 
effective, the insufficiency of symptomatic relief with surgery is strongly suggested by [CONTACT_324321] ( Bhattacharyya and Lee, 2010 ).  
Clinical guidelines notwithstanding, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_324264], it is notable that in the US , no intranasal corticosteroid has been approved for the treatm ent of CRS . 
Oral steroids may reduce the need for surgery but there are concerns about significant side effects with long- term oral steroid use.  
OPN- 375 contains a liquid suspension of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_445948] a drug delivery system designed to deposit the drug aerosol high and deep into the nasal

spray pump, and plastic casework with an asymmetrically shaped se aling nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_235712] a flexible 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The casework defines the drug delivery system’s outer shape and includes the 
moveable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_324266] . The user inserts the sealing nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_445949] 1 nostril,  
so it seals well with the flexible nas al tissues, and inserts the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_445950]. After 
taking a deep breath, the user blows into the OPN -375 mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Static positive pressure is 
created and subsequently released through the actuation of the spray by [CONTACT_324322], which concurrently releases the orally -generated pressure/airflow . Blowing through the mouth against a 
resistance also causes the soft palate to seal closed, separating the oral cavity from the nasal cavities. A nasal spray applicator extends from the metering pump to the tip of the nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Upon 
actuation, the design of the EDS allows for air to be channeled from the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_445951] . Under these conditions, exhaled air creates a positive 
intranasal pressure, accompan ies the aerosol expelled by [CONTACT_445970], and places at least 50% of the initially deposited metered spray beyond the head of the inferior turbinate and at least 30% of the initially deposited dose in the upper posterior  region 
of the nasal cavity beyond the head of the inferior turbinate and above the inferior meatus, including the OMC  (middle meatus) . This pattern of delivery produced by [CONTACT_324314]-[ADDRESS_567011] topi[INVESTIGATOR_445952] .

1.2 Clinical Experience 
There were two Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, 
multicenter studies (OPN -FLU -NP-3101 and OPN -FLU -NP-3102) designed to assess the efficacy 
and safety of 3 doses of OPN-375 (93, 186, and 372 μg twice a day  [BID]) compared with placebo 
in adult subjects with bilateral nasal polyposis followed by [CONTACT_1629] 8- week , open -label  extension phase 
(372 μg BID) t o assess safety. Both clinical studies were identical in design. 
In these  studies, all 3 dos es of OPN-375 produced statistically significant greater reductions than 
placebo on the co -primary measures of nasal congestion/obstruction and total polyp grade . 
Sensitivity analyses conducted on the co- primary outcome variables, including a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30350], indicated that the results obtained were robust. The 186- µg and 372- µg groups had 
numerically larger magnitudes of effect compared with the 93-µg group.  Results obtained from secondary measures in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_324272] . In the open- label phases of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518], the improvements from 
baseline in efficacy assessments seen at the end of the double-blind phases generally continued to increase through W eek 24. Data from responder analyses demonstrate  that OPN-375 substantially 
reduces polyp grade and the magnitude of reduction continues to increase with longer -term 
treatment within the period studied.  
Clinically meaningful improvements with OPN-375 treatment were also observed broadly in other 
signs and symptoms of the disease and in physical , mood, and social  parameters relevant to quality 
of life . Analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) indicated that treatment with

Protocol Number OPN- FLU -CS-3206   
 
Page 31 of 81 
Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May [ADDRESS_567013] was clinically meaningful.  
There were two  Phase 3, open- label, multicenter studies (OP N-FLU -CS-3203, 12- month; OP N-
FLU -CS-3204, 3 -month) designed to assess the safety and efficacy of OPN- 375 372 μg  BID in 
subjects with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. 
Subjects in the open- label studies also had considerable improvement in symptoms and in 
objectively observed local signs of disease . A substantial proportion of subjects with intranasal 
edema at study entry no longer had evidence of edema on examination at study completion, a 
finding consistent with an intranasal deposition profile that places topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -acting flu ticasone 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_324273]/ OMC . In 
subjects with polyps, extensive reductions in polyp grade were observed and polyps were eliminated from at least 1 side of the nose in approximately 50%  of subjects . In the 12- month study 
the improvement in polyp grade , polyp elimination, and edema  increased over time, suggesting 
benefit with continued treatment over the observed period.  
The most commonly reported adverse events ( AEs) in the active treat ment groups were associated 
with local effects at the site of administration in the nasal cavity (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nasal congestion, nasal 
mucosal disorder [primarily erythema], and nasal septum ulceration) or associated with the underlying disease (acute sinusi tis or nasopharyngitis) . Most local AEs were identified as a result 
of intensive active monitoring of all subjects at scheduled intervals by [CONTACT_324324]. The majority of these AEs w ere 
mild and importantly, are known to have resolved with continued use of study drug. No deaths 
were reported, 18 subjects receiving OPN- 375 reported serious adverse events ( SAE s) during the 
placebo controlled and open- label studies . One placebo -treated subject reported treatment -related 
SAEs, and the overall rate of discontinuations due to AEs was approximately 4% among all 
subjects who received OPN −375.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_567014] limited medical option s for treatment. While some symptoms 
may be reduced, patients are often left with symptoms due to the suboptimal delivery method of 
current treatments ( Fokkens et al, 2012).  Standard nasal spray pumps suffer from a number of 
drawbacks and are considered su boptimal for reliable drug delivery to target sites beyond the nasal 
valve (Aggarwal et al, 2004). OPN- 375, with its breath assisted mechanism of delivery, provides 
specific benefits over current nasal drug delivery systems including increased reliability of delivery of topi[INVESTIGATOR_324274] , which are central to the pathology of CRS .

designed to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal administration of OPN- 375 (186 and  372 μg 
twice daily ) in subjects with CRS  without the presence of nasal polyps .  
Subjects must sign an i nformed consent before any study- related procedure is performed. Subjects 
who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a 7-  to 21-day -single -blind placebo 
run-in period to determine disease status and to ensure that they can comply with study procedures. 
At Visit 1 (Screening), nasoendoscopy- related (nasal examination  and assessment of nasal cavity 
for presence of edema, polypoid tissue/polyps [ <Grade 1 ], or mucopurulence ) procedures will be 
performed  for all subjects . During the single -blind-  run-in period, subjects will administer morning 
and evening doses of the study drug (placebo) and will complete a daily diary (electronic) 
immediately before the morning and evening doses including recording of both instantaneous 
(evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for nasal symptoms.  
Subjects determined to meet  diary eligibility criteria over a [ADDRESS_567017] a sinus computed tomography ( CT) scan performed . 
The CT scan should be performed  after diary eligibility is confirmed and prior to Day  [ADDRESS_567018] s meeting disease severity eligibility criteria (symptom severity and sinus 
opacification) will be randomly assigned through an interactive web response system (IWRS) to 
receive 1  of 2 active treatments  or placebo : [ADDRESS_567019] to capture symptom scores for  nasal 
congestion, nasal discharge, (anterior and/or posterior), facial pain or pressure sensation, and sense of smell, as well as use of approved rescue m edication after the Week [ADDRESS_567020] -completed 
questionnaires will be used to measure the symptoms and social/emotional consequences of the subject’s nasal disorder (SNOT -22), health -related quality of life (EQ -5D, SF-36v2, and SF -6D), 
sleep quality a nd disturbances ( PSQI ), depressive symptoms (QID), work productivity, and 
objective smell test (SIT) . Subjects will assess their global impression of change since starting the 
study drug using the PGIC scale. Health economic information related to CRS  will also be 
collected  (HPQ). Objective changes in disease severity will be assessed via  sinus CT  scan . 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_324332], performing nasal examination, measuring vital signs 
(ie, blood pressure, pulse ) and weight, and through collection of information for concomitant 
medications.  
Refer to the Schedul e of Study Procedures and Evaluations , for the timing of all tests, procedures, 
and assessments that will be performed during the study.

3.3 Method of Treatment Assignment or Randomization  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment according to a computer -generated  randomization 
code. Randomization will be coordinated centrally through an IWRS. The system will provide 
subjec t identification numbers at Visit 1 (Screening), which are subsequently linked to the 
treatment a ssignments at randomization. Following completion of all baseline evaluations on Day 
1, subjects who meet all eligibility requirements will be randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 treatment 
groups using a 1:1: 1 ratio:  
• OPN- 375 186 μg BID  
• OPN- 375 372 μg BID   
• Placebo  BID

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_445973] (Yes vs No ) (previous sinus surgery is 
defined as evidence of ethmoidectomy [partial or total], or maxillary antrostomy) . An IWRS will 
be used in this study to track enrollment, randoml y assign subjects to treatment groups, and manage 
study drug supplies. At Visit 1 (Screening) and at each double -blind  treatment phase study visit 
through Week  24, site staff will contact [CONTACT_445974]. The IWRS will then provide the identifier (kit number) for the single -blind 
placebo kit at Visit 1 (Screening) . The IWRS will then provide  the identifier (kit number) for the 
double -blind  study drug kit(s) to be dispensed at the respective double -blind visit.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_567022], investigator and study 
personnel at each center, and the Sponsor  and/or its designated personnel directly involved in the 
clinical study will remain blinded to study treatment. The  investigator will not be provided with 
the randomization code. The randomization codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which will 
allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject , if necessary.  The investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_445975].  
If a medical emergency occurs and a decision regarding the subject's condition/treatment requires 
knowledge of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken for the specific subject via the IWRS; the investigator will immediately notify the Medical Monitor of the situation. The date, time, and reason for unblinding must be documented in the source document and in the appropriate section of the case report form  (CR F). Additionally, the documentation received from the IWRS 
indicating the code break must be retained, in a secure manner, in the subject’s source documents.

Procedures to be performed at each study visit, and the visit time windows, are indicated in the 
Schedule of Study Procedures and Evaluations . Additional information related to the individual 
study visits is presented belo w: 
• CT scans are required at Baseline and Week 24/ ET to evaluate eligibility criteria and primary 
and secondary endpoints. All CT scans will be sent to a central imaging core lab for review 
and analysis. The b aseline CT scan should be performed after all other screening assessments 
are completed  for subjects who remain eligible  (unless utilizing CT scan performed within 14-
days prior to Visit 1). 
• Subjects who develop an acute uppe r respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] , acute sinusitis , influenza, or 
SARS -CoV -2 (COVID -19) during the study must be symptom free for at least 28 days prior 
to undergoing the Week  24/EOS  CT scan . Subjects should continue treatment with study 
medication until EOS C T scan can be completed.  
• For the Week  [ADDRESS_567040] scan , cannot be performed on the 
same day as the study visit, they should be performed before the on- site study visit . 
 
6.1 Visit  1 (Screening/Single -Blind Placebo Run -in) 
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will undergo all Visit 1 (Screening) procedures 
to determine study eligibility.  
Subjects will be instructed on the use of OPN- 375. They will then be provided with a n EDS  to 
practice administration of a dose and to assure that they can correctly use OPN- 375 (eg, able to 
obtain a seal, sequence). The assignment of a kit number for the practice EDS  is not performed by 
[CONTACT_10966];  rather, the study staff will dispense a practice EDS  kit and record the kit number in the 
drug dispensing log. This kit is only to be used  at the site at Visit 1 (Screening) and is not to be 
sent home with the subject. 
Subjects who meet eligibility criter ia at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a 7-  to 21-day, single -blind, 
placebo run -in period to confirm symptom severity and to ensure that they can comply with study 
procedures. Subjects will be given a single -blind-  placebo drug kit (containing 2 placebo  units) 
assigned through the IWRS and an electronic diary and will be instructed on their use.  
During the single -blind run-in period, subjects will administer morning and evening doses of the 
study drug (placebo) as described in Section  5.1. Subjects will be required to keep a daily diary of 
nasal symptoms. The electronic diary will be completed immediately before the morning and 
evening doses and will include recording of both instantaneous (evaluation of symptom severity 
immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for nasal symptoms (see Section  7.2). Subjects will be instructed that the 
use of rescue medication  for CRS symptoms  is not allowed. Subjects will be instructed to bring 
the single -blind placebo drug kit and the diary with them to their next visit (Visit 2, Day 1 
[Baseline]).  
The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to ensure that subjects are 
recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and that the data are being transmitted to the 
data base. Site staff should follow -up with subjects as necessary to counsel them on completion of 
the electronic diaries . The site staff will evaluate the subject’s severity scores , entered  remotely  
into the electronic diaries , and will be notified  when the subject meets eligibility criteria pertaining

protocol. 
 
6.2 Visit 2 (Day 1, Baseline; Randomization)  
Once it is confirmed that the eligibility criteria based on the CT  scan are met, the remainder of 
study procedures should be performed.  
Subjects who then meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 2, Day 1 (Baseline) will be randomly assigned 
through the IWRS to 1 of  3 arms : 186 or 372 μg of  OPN- 375 BID, or placebo BID . Study drug 
will be administered as described in Section  5.1. Subjects will be given 1 double -blind - study drug 
kit (containing 2 devices) assigned through the IWRS and an electronic diary and will be instructed on their use. Subjects will be instructed to bring the study drug kits and diary with them to their next visit.  
Subjects will be required to ke ep an electronic daily diary of nasal symptoms. The diary will be 
completed immediately before the morning and evening doses and will include recording of both instantaneous and reflective scores for nasal symptoms (see Section  7.2). Subjects will be 
instructed that the use rescue medication for CRS symptoms is not allowed.  
The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to ensu re that subjects are 
recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and that the data are being transmitted to the data base. Site staff should follow -up with subjects as necessary to counsel them on completion of 
the electronic diaries.  
 
6.3 Visits 3, 4, and 5 (Weeks 4, 8, and 12)  
During the 24- week double -blind treatment phase, subjects will return to the study site at Week s 
4, [ADDRESS_567042] efficacy and safety assessment s performed.  
At all visits during the double -blind treatment phase, treatment compliance will be monitored as 
described in Section  5.7. Subjects will be given a  double -blind - study drug kit (containing 
2 devices) assigned through the IWRS at Visit 3/Week 4 and Visit 4/Week 8. Subjects will receive 
3 kits at Visit 5/Week 12 . Subjects will be instructed to bring the study drug kits with them to each 
visit.  
Subjects  will be required to keep a daily diary of nasal symptoms through Week 12. The diary will 
be completed immediately before the morning and evening doses and will include recording of both instantaneous and reflective scores for nasal symptoms (see Section  7.2). Subjects will also 
be instructed that the use of rescue medication  for CRS symptoms  is not allowed until after the 
Week 4 visit; starting at the Week [ADDRESS_567043] 12 weeks of double -blind treatment to ensure that subjects are recording both morning and evening

Demographic information will include age, sex, race, and ethnicity. 
 
7.2 Efficacy A ssessment s 
Electronic diaries will be used by [CONTACT_324344] -blind placebo - run-in period and 
double -blind treatment phase  in this study to capture daily nasal symptoms  (ie, symptom scores 
for nasal congestion, nasal discharge [anterior and/or posterior], facial pain or pressure sensation, 
and sense of smell) and the use of approved rescue medication after the Week  4 visit through W eek 
12 of the double -blind phase . The Schedule of Study Procedures and Evaluations  indicates the 
timing of all assessments; further information on each evaluation is provided below.  
The electronic d iaries will be preprogrammed to transmit subject- entered data daily to the 
electronic diary data base. The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to 
ensure that subjects are recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and r escue 
medication use and that the data are being transmitted to the data base. Site staff should follow -up 
with subjects as necessary to counsel them on completion of the electronic diaries.  
Additional information on the nasal examination can be found in S ection  7.4.2. 
The following efficacy evaluations will be performed:  
• At Visit 1 (Screening), study personnel should provide each subject with the 
description for each symptom severity (ie, mild, moderate, severe) using the definitions provided in Table [ADDRESS_567049] 
moderate severity of nasal symptoms  to enter the study. 
• An electronic diary will be provided to each subject. Subjects will be instructed to complete the electronic diary twice daily immedia tely before dosing (morning and 
evening) during the single -blind placebo run -in period (for eligibility) and during the 
first 12  weeks of the  double -blind treatment phase. Subjects will report both 
instantaneous (evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for:  
• nasal congestion symptoms, nasal discharge ( anterior and/or posterior ) symptoms, and facial 
pain or pressure sensation symptoms, scored on the scale in Table 2

Note: Sense of smell, scored as 0=normal, 1=slightly impaired, 2=moderately impaired, 3=absent.  
 
• SNOT -[ADDRESS_567050] -completed questionnaire that consists of 22 symptoms and 
social/emotional consequences of their nasal disorder. Each item is rated as follows: 0=no 
problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=mild or slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe 
problem, 5=problem as bad as it can be. The SNOT -22 is validated in CRS  (Hopkins 2009). 
The recall period is the past 2 weeks. The SNOT -22 takes approximately 5 minutes to 
complete.  
• Recording of each dose of approved rescue medication after the Week 4 visit through Week 
12 
• The EQ -5D consists of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS) . The descriptive system comprises  5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. 
The subjec t is asked to indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_445978] 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1- digit number 
that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the  5 dimensions can be 
combined into a 5- digit number that describes the subjec t’s health state.  The EQ VAS 
records t he subjec t’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS , where the endpoints  are labelled 
‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. The VAS can 
be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the subjec t’s own 
judgement . The EQ -5D takes 1 -2 minutes to complete . 
• SF-36v2 is a multipurpose, 36- item subject- completed validated questionnaire that 
measures 8  domains of health: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, 
bodily pain, general health perce ptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to 
emotional problems, and mental health. The SF -36v2 survey with a 4- week  recall  will be 
used. It yields scale scores for each of these 8 health domains, and 2 summary measures of physical and mental health: the PCS and MCS. The SF -36v2 takes approximately 
10 minutes to complete. ( Optum.com  Web site)  
• SF-6D is a single health state index derived from the 8  domains from the SF -36v2 (using 
all but the general health domain and combining role  physical and role  emotional)  
• PSQI is a validated, self -rated questionnaire , which assesses sleep quality and disturbances 
over a 1 -month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate  7 "component" scores: 
subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88794], and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these 7 components yields  1 global score. The PSQI takes approx imately 3 -5 minutes to 
complete

symptoms. The QIDS is available in a self -rated version and assesses all the criterion 
symptom domains designated by [CONTACT_445979] -  5th Edition  to diagnose a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The 7-day period prior to assessment is the usual time frame for assessing symptom 
severity. The psychometric properties of the QIDS, has  been established in various study 
samples . The time required to complete the QIDS is approximately 2 -4 minutes.  
• SIT is a t est comprised of 4 booklets each containing 10 microencapsulated (scratch and 
sniff) odors . Forced choice response alternatives accompany each test item . The test 
provides an absolute indication of smell loss (anosmia; mild, moderate or severe hyposomia ) as well as an index to detect malingering . The test is self -administered and 
takes 10 -15 minutes. 
• Acute e xacerbations of CRS  are defined as worsening of symptoms requiring antibiotic or 
corticosteroid use , specifically: 
• an event characterized by [CONTACT_324348]  (listed below), lasting at least 3 days , that cause the subjec t to seek 
medical care:  
− facial pain or pressure  
− nasal congestion/blockage  
− rhinorrhea  
− reduction in sense of smell  
AND  
− escalation of treatment, defined as either initiation of antibiotics or oral steroids, 
or the escalation of treatment involving an unscheduled acute care visit ( eg, 
emergency room or acute care outpatient clinic) or inpatient care, for increased 
symptoms of CRS  or for acute sinusitis. 
*If an exacerbation start date is less than 7 days after the end date of a previous 
exacerbation, the entire period will be treated as a single exacerbation.  
• Antibiotic use for acute sinusitis during study participation will be captured . 
• Assessments from CT scan  will be performed for both the baseline CT scan  and the 
Week  24/ET (Visit 6) CT scan  
• Lund- Mackay  Staging System : Lund- Mackay system ( Lund and Mackay,  1993) assigns to each 
of 10 sinus cavities (left and right maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal) a score of 0 (no opacification), 1 (partial opa cification), or 2 (total opacification) 
based on the extent of mucosal thickening within that sinus, plus a 0- [ADDRESS_567051] scan ranges from  0-24.

7.3 Health Economic Assessments  
Health economic information related to bilateral CRS  will be collected during the study and will 
include information on criteria for surgical intervention (independent of actual surgery performed) , 
subjects approved for surgery, who no longer elect to undergo surgery, and missed work or school 
days/lost productivity. The investigator will ask the subject if he/she would consider surgery and 
the subject will complete the HPQ (1 -2 minutes to complete) . 
Objective criteria for surgical intervention  are as follows:  
• used topi[INVESTIGATOR_324292] (≥8 weeks duration)  
• used either a short course of broad- spectrum/culture -directed systemic antibiotic (2 to 3 weeks 
duration) or a prolonged course of systemic low -dose -anti-inflammatory  antibiotic (ie, 
macrolide or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) (≥12 weeks duration)  
• SNOT -22 total score ≥20  
• Lund- Mackay CT score ≥ 1  
• subjects who enter the study approved for surgery with a scheduled surgery date, who no longer 
elect to undergo surger y 
• The work productivity questionnaire asks about employment status, work absences, and on-the-
job productivit y. Subjects will also be asked to provide annual salary and postal code 
information at screening which will be used to inform overall cost to employers from lost work 
productivity.

determined by [CONTACT_445981] A Es spontaneously or in response to general, non -directed 
questioning. All non- serious A Es are to be followed until the subject completes the study or is lost 
to follow -up. 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies 
is crucial for the protection of subjects, is the responsibilit y of the investigators and the Sponsor , 
and is mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. 
Each AE is to be documented on the CRF with reference to intensity, date of occurrence, duration, 
frequency, treatment, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome . Furthermore, each AE is to 
be classified as being serious or non- serious. Additionally, the investigator has to assess whether 
the AE is drug related (adverse drug reaction) or not. Changes of A Es and dates of ending have to 
be documented on the CRF. 
Surgical procedures, planned before enrollment of the subject in the study, are not considered AEs 
if the condition(s) was (were) known before study inclusion. In the latter case, the medical 
condition should be reported in the subject’s medical history. 
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of A Es extends from the 
time the subject gives informed consent until completion of the end- of-study visit or an early 
termination visit. SAEs will be reported  through [ADDRESS_567058] dose of s tudy drug 
administration.

An AE is considered  related to study drug (adverse reaction) if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the treatment and the AE.  
 8.3 Suspected Adverse Reactions  
“Suspected adverse reactions” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A “suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction” which means any AE  caused by a drug.  
An AE is considered to be a suspected adverse reaction if:  
• The AE is a single occurrence of an uncommon AE that is known to be strongly associated with drug exposure ( eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome).  
• The AE occurs  1 or more times and is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( eg, tendon rupture). 
• The AE is part of an aggregate analysis of specific AEs observed in a clinical trial (such 
as kn own consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or 
other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those  AEs occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a 
concur rent or historical control group.  
Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the event. Inherent in this definition and in the requirement to report them , is 
the need for the Sponsor  to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the 
likelihood that the drug actually caused the AE .  
 
8.4 Unexpected Adverse Reactions or Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the  IB or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “ Unexpected, ” as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from t he pharmacological properties of the drug, 
but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
The suspected adverse reactions listed in the IB ( ie, “expected”) are those observed with the 
investigational drug and for which a causal relationship between the event and the drug is 
suspected or confirmed. Thus, A Es that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process 
are considered unexpect ed for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the IB. 
Additionally, AEs that are listed in the IB as occurring with the same class of drugs, or as

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May [ADDRESS_567060] been 
observed with the drug under investigation.  
 
8.5 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if at any dosage, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor , it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• is fatal  
• is life -threatening  
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE. Since SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety proble ms, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the Sponsor ’s 
assessment. If either the Sponsor  or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must 
be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_445983]. 
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor  or their designee within 24 hours after the investigator 
becomes aware of the event, along with a determination as to whether it is associated with the 
study drug, device, or procedure.  
8.5.1 Life-Threatening Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. As with the definition of serious, the determination of whether an AE is life -
threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28216] . Thus, if either 
believes that it me ets the definition of life -threatening, it must be considered life -threatening for 
reporting purposes.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  It is imperative that [COMPANY_003] be informed within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of a 
SAE so that reporting to the Regulatory Agencies can be met within the required time frame 
(7 or 15 calendar days).  
Because of the need to report to health authorities all SAEs in a timely manner, it is vitally important that an investigator report any AEs that would be considered serious within 24 hours, 
even if the investigator does not consider the AE to be clinicall y significant or drug- related.  
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of relationship to study drug) that occurs within [ADDRESS_567062]’s participation in the study, are to be followed until either: the AE 
resolves, the AE stabilizes, the AE returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or it is shown that the AE is not attributable to the study drug or study conduct. 
Medical and scientific judgment is to be  exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as for important medical events that were not immediately 
life-threatening or did not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445962].

an SAE; however, the investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and 
must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion 
of the pregnancy. The investigator should notify the Sponsor  or their designee of the pregnancy 
outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification of an SAE ( eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed SAE fo rm to the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is app roved. This 
document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives. Statistical analysis principles to address all study 
objectives  are provided below . 
 
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size assumptions were originally generated based on previous Phase  3 studies of OPN -375 
in subjects with nasal polyposis and data from a study evaluating the change in maxillary and 
ethmoid opacification in CRS patients treated with an  intramuscular dose of triamcinolone 
(Pallanch 2013) . Updated standard deviation estimates for both co- primary endpoints in this 
amendment are based on a blinded interim analysis of Protocol O PN-FLU -CS-3205. Based on the 
results for changes from baseline in morning symptoms among subjects with nasal polyps in the previous studies conducted with OPN -375, a sample of 70 subjects per group (210 total subjects) 
is sufficient to detect a 0.9  scale d ifference in 7 -day average CSNS  (AM instantaneous ) between 
treatments (OPN -375 vs placebo) using a 2- sided test at the 5% significance level with 88%  power, 
and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of  1.7. This sample size is also adequate to detect a 9% 
difference between treatments in average percent opacification (APOV) using a [ADDRESS_567064] at the 
5% significance level with 88% power, and assuming a SD of 17%. The sample size was estimated 
for the co -primary efficacy endpoints using Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (PASS 15)  
(NCSS, 2017).  
 
9.2 Analysis Sets  
9.2.1 Intent -to-treat Analysis Set  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all subjects who are randomized  regardless of 
whether they received double -blind treatment.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_567065] one  dose of 
randomized study drug. The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by [CONTACT_314391]. The safety population will be used for the analysis of safety.  
9.2.3 Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The FAS will include all subjects in the ITT set who receive at least one dose of randomized 
study drug during the double -blinded treatment phase, and have at least one baseline efficacy 
measure for APOV endpoint, and also have a baseline value  and at least one post -baseline value 
(7-day average AM instantaneous CSNS score) for the CS NS endpoint . Subjects will be included 
in the  treatment group to which they were randomized.  
The FAS population will be the primary study population for all efficacy analyses in this study.  
9.2.4  Per- Protocol Analysis Set (PPS)  
The PPS analysis set excludes subjects from the FAS population that may substantially affect  the 
results of the primary efficacy analysis . The PPS population will be used for a sensitivity analysis 
for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May [ADDRESS_567066] s excluded from the PPS  will be made prior to unblinding treatment 
codes of the database and documented in a separate report.  
 
9.3 Primary E stimand , Inte rcurrent Events, and Estimation  
Primary Objective and Population: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of intranasal 
administration of twice -daily doses of 186 and 372 µg of OPN -375 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) with 
placebo in subjects with documented CRS without nasal polyps. 
9.3.1 Co-primary Endpoints  
• Change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in 7- day average instantaneous AM  CSNS  
(evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring)  
− nasal congestion  
− nasal discharge (anterior and/or  posterior)  
− facial pain or pressure sensation  
The baseline CSNS will be the average of the CSNS over the last 7  days of the placebo run- in 
period prior to randomization. The CSNS at Week 4 will be the average of the CSNS over the 
7 days prior to Day 28.  
AND  
• The change from baseline to Week 24 /ET in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses  
(APOV is the average percentage of  volume opacified across both maxillary and ethmoid 
sinuses (all 4 sinuses) at each timepoint ) 
9.3.2 Potential Intercurrent Events  
The potential intercurrent events are as follows:  
1. Need for systemic corticosteroids  for CRS exacerbation or worsening of CRS nasal/sinus 
symptoms  
2. Need for nasal surgery  
3. Discontinuation from study treatment  
9.3.3 Primary Estimand  
The primary efficacy estimand is  the difference between each active treatment of twice -daily 
doses of 186 µg and 372 µg of OPN -375 and placebo for each of the co- primary endpoints.  
For the primary estimand, intercurrent events will be addressed as follows:  
1. Systemic corticosteroids use f or CRS exacerbation or worsening of CRS nasal/sinus 
symptoms: a composite strategy will be employed with a poor score assigned to this event.  
For CSNS, a value of ‘9’ will be assigned. For APOV, a poor score is defined as follows: for a subject with a bas eline APOV ≥ 75%, a value of ‘100%’ will be assigned; if 
baseline APOV < 75%, a poor score is defined as baseline APOV + 25%. Further detail regarding the definition of a poor score and the handling of a missing within- instrument 
data in these endpoints is  provided in the SAP.  
Systemic corticosteroid use for other indications will be considered a treatment and study discontinuation event (Reference criteria 3) .

Page 64 of 81 
Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  2. Nasal surgery: composite strategy with worst scores assigned as above.  
3. Treatment D iscontinuation: treatment policy strategy ; subjects may continue in the study 
until one of the following three mutually exclusive outcomes :  
a) Subject completes Week 24/ET CT scan. In the absence of an intercurrent event 
(systemic corticosteroids, nasal surgery) use the endpoint value;  
b) An intercurrent event (systemic corticosteroids for CRS exacerbation or 
worsening of CRS nasal/sinus symptoms, nasal surgery) occurs: Use composite strategy and assign worse score as described above (reference criteria 1,  2); 
c) Subject discontinues the study. Missing data due to study discontinuation 
following treatment discontinuation will be imputed; further detail on the imputation method is provided in the estimation section for each of the co-prima ry endpoints. 
9.3.4 Estimator and Estimation Method – Primary Analysis  
Estimator and estimation method (CSNS) : For the co- primary endpoint CSNS, the estimator is 
the mean difference between treatments (active versus placebo) in change from baseline to the 
end of  Week  4 in the 7- day average total CSNS  (instantaneous AM ). Estimation is based on a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) where changes from baseline to Weeks 2, 4 in the 7-day average total CSNS  (instantaneous AM ), respectively, are the repeated measu res. The 
MMRM model will employ  Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) for parameter estimation 
and the Kenward -Roger method for calculating the denominator degrees of freedom. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to estimate within -subject error. For the treatment 
policy estimand, (reference Section 9.3.3, criteria 3c), missing data due to study discontinuation will be estimated within the MMRM model under the assumption that the mis sing data are 
missing at random (MAR) and that early discontinuation from the study (prior to Week 4) is 
unlikely to reflect a treatment effect.  
The MMRM model will include categorical effects for previous sinus surgery (Y,N), treatment (OPN -375 186 µg, OP N-375 372 µg , placebo), week (2, 4) treatment- by-week interaction, and 
the continuous covariate baseline 7- day average total CSNS  (instantaneous AM ) with baseline -
by-week interaction.  
Estimator and estimation method (APOV) : For the co -primary endpoint APOV, the estimator is 
the mean difference between treatments (active versus placebo) in the change from baseline to Week  24/ET APOV. Estimation is based on an ANCOVA model including categorical effects 
for previous sinus surge ry (Y,N), treatment (OPN -375 186 µg, OPN -375 372 µg, placebo), and 
baseline APOV.  
For the treatment policy estimand, (reference Section 9.3.3, criteria 3,c), missing data due to study discontinuation will be imputed with a pattern mixture model (PMM) multiple imputation (MI) using the Jump–to -Control (J2C) method. The PMM assumes that the missing 
data at Week 24/ET on the control arm (placebo) is MAR, and the missing data on the active treatm ent arms have the profile of the control arm at Week 24/ET.  
Multiple imputation using a PMM with J2C method will be conducted using the sequential modeling method as described in ( O’Kelly et al, 2014). Further detail on the MI implementation, 
and statistical analysis and inference is provided in the SAP.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  9.3.5 Supplementary Analysis  
A supplementary analysis of the primary estimand will be performed.  
Supplementary estimand:  A supplementary eff icacy estimand is the difference between each 
active treatment of twice -daily doses of 186 µg and 372 µg of OPN -375 and placebo in each of 
the co -primary endpoints, irrespective of systemic corticosteroid use.  
That is, for the supplemental estimand, interc urrent events will be addressed as follows:  
1. Systemic corticosteroids use for all indications: treatment policy strategy; consider outcomes 
irrespective of systemic corticosteroid use; subjects may continue in the study until one of the following two mutually exclusive outcomes:  
a. Subject completes th e study, use the endpoint value;  
b. Subject discontinues the study. Missing data due to study discontinuation following treatment discontinuation will be imputed; further detail on the imputation method is provided in the estimation section for each of the co- primary endpoints. 
2. Nasal surgery : composite strategy with worst scores assigned.  
3. Treatment discontinuation: composite strategy with poor scores assigned.  
The estimator and estimation  methods for the co- primary endpoints are the same as for the 
primary estimand described above.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_567067] sc ore of 100% is assigned; for the treatment policy strategy, baseline 
APOV is assigned (BOCF). Baseline and endpoint APOV values are then ranked. Ranked APOV 
values will be analyzed with an ANCOVA model including categorical effects for previous sinus surge ry and treatment. Further detail is provided in the SAP. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_567068] an observed value for that endpoint, irrespective of an intercurrent event, and the observed value is used in the analysis. For both co- primary endpoints, the estimator 
and estimation methods are the same as des cribed in Section 9.3.4, with the exception that in the 
observed cases population there are no missing data; consequently, no imputation is required.

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  9.5 Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The analysis of the following key secondary endpoints are based on pooling the data from Study 
OPN- FLU -CS-3205 and Study OPN -FLU -CS-3206 (pooled data) : 
• Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_567070] term for protocol (CS -3205, CS -3206). 
• The frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks will be compared between OPN- 375 dose groups and placebo using generalized linear model (GLM) for  data from the 
negative binomial distribution that is commonly referred to as the negative binomial (NB) 
regression model. The NB model will include the same model terms as the primary models; 
in additional, the model will include a categorical effect for protocol ( OPN -FLU -CS-3205, 
OPN- FLU -CS-3206), and the logarithm of follow -up time as an offset variable. The same 
model will be used for the pooled analysis of the frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks in the CRS without Nasal Polyps populati on. 
The analysis of the following key secondary endpoints are based on the data from Study OPN -
FLU -CS-3206 only:  
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in four separate cardinal CRS symptoms, as 
measured by (AM, Instantaneous) CSNS: congestion, facial pain or pressure sensation, nasal 
discharge (anterior and/or posterior), and sense of smell will be analyzed using the same MMRM model described above.  
• The Kaplan -Meier method and log- rank test will be used  to estimate and compare the 
distributions of time to first acute CRS exacerbation between each OPN -375 dose and 
placebo.  
 
9.6 Other Secondary Efficacy  Analyses  
All statistical analyses in this section that reference the primary MMRM and ANCOVA models 
described in Section 9.3.4 will include the same factors as their respective primary models, except for the baseline covariate. The baseline covariate for the specific endpoint will be used, unless otherwise specified. 
In addition, a combined dose group (OPN -375 186 μg, OPN -375 372 μg) is defined in all models 
of primary and secondary endpoints by [CONTACT_324358], assigning equal 
weight to each dose, to obtain the inferential statistics for combined doses, and for the comparison: combined dose  versus placebo.  
Intercurrent events for secondary endpoints will be addressed as described in Section 9.3.3 for the primary estimand, unless otherwise indicated, and poor scores assigned to secondary endpoints are defined in the SAP. For the treatment pol icy estimand, missing data due to study 
discontinuation will be handled as described in Section 9.3.4 for the primary MMRM and ANCOVA models, respectively.  
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed with MMRM models; further details will be 
provided in the SAP:

9.8 Type I Error Control for Multiplicity  
9.8.1 Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary hypothesis of this trial is that  OPN- 375 high dose (372 μg) group will be superior to 
the placebo group in both co -primary endpoints.  
The familywise Type [ADDRESS_567072] of the primary hypothesis is α=0.05. The 
strategy for strong, familywise control of the Type I error is based on closed testing procedure as 
follows.  
1. Test each co -primary endpoint for OPN -375 high dose (372 μg) vs placebo : If p < 0.05 for both 
endpoints, then proceed to key secondary endpoints; otherwise, stop. The order of the testing is 
as follows:  
a. OPN-375 372 μg versus placebo in the change from baseline in the 7 -day average CSNS  
(instantaneous AM) at the end of Week 4  
b. OPN-375 372 μg versus placebo in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses 
change from baseline to Week  24/ET

Protocol Amendment 4.0/ dated 11May 2022 FINAL  9.9 Safety Analysis  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistica l inference procedures will be applied. All 
safety summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_324314] -375 dose level 186 μg, 372 μg, and OPN -375 
combined doses  and placebo. 
9.9.1 Adverse Events  (AEs)  
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 20 or higher. Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with onset dates on or 
after the start of double -blind study drug. The incidence of TE AEs during the study period will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_262192] (or System Organ Class [SOC] and preferred term) 
overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_324359] . Those AEs 
with missing onset dates or missing severity will be includ ed as treatment -emergent. If an AE is 
reported more than once during the double -blind study phase, the greatest severity and the worst -
case attribution will be used for presentation in tables.  
Deaths, SAEs, and AEs causing discontinuation of study participation and/or study treatment will be tabulated by [CONTACT_324360]. Adverse events for individual subjects will be listed, along with information regarding onset, duration, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
9.9.[ADDRESS_567075] s with values outside limits of the normal range 
at each time point.  
Prior/ concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary (WHODrug), Version December [ADDRESS_567076] counts and percent. 
9.10 Interim Analysis  
A blinded interim analysis is planned for both co- primary endpoints in this study to evaluate the 
sample size assumptions as follows:  
1. Co-primary endpoint change from baseline in the 7- day average CSNS (instantaneous AM) 
to assess the variance.  
2.  Co-primary endpoint change from baseline to Week 24/ET APOV to assess variance. 
 
This interim analysis is planned to occur when at least 50% of subjects have reached Week 24/ET 
endpoint for APOV . At this time it is anticipated that at least 75% of subjects will have reached 
the Week 4 endpoint for CSNS. The complete details of this interim analysis is provided in the IA-SAP.

CT scans are required at Baseline and Week 24/ ET to evaluate eligibility criteria and primary and 
secondary endpoints. All CT scans will be sent to a central imaging core lab for review and 
analysis.  
Radiation due to the CT scans required for this study is a risk to the subjects enrolled in this study.  
The expected dosing for each modality/view is shown below.

Thin -Slice CT  2.[ADDRESS_567092] that undergoes all study- required imaging is 
expected to be approximately 4 millisievert (mSv)  (American Nuclear Society ). Based on a large 
study of cancer risk associated with exposure to radiation, it was estimated that the excess relative 
risk for cancer is 0.97 per Sv ( Cardis et al, 2005). The excess relative risk of the radiation that each 
subject would receive from participation in this study is therefore 0.97/Sv * 4 mSv * 1 Sv/  
1000 mSv=0.0039. To help place the radiation risk estimate for this study into perspective, a 
person will be exposed to 0.[ADDRESS_567093] 
flight ( Radiologyinfo.org), and the public is exposed to approximately 3 - 6.2 mSv / year from 
background radiation ( Huda et al, 2005 and United  States Environmental Protection Agency ).

Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
The use of intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_472598]. Currently, two opi[INVESTIGATOR_472599]. These opi[INVESTIGATOR_472600] (Duramorph). Intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_472601]. 
Currently, most obstetric anesthesiologists use intrathecal morphine for analgesia after 
cesarean delivery. Morphine provides excellent analgesia for cesarean section. 
However, use of this medication is associated with side effects such as pruritus and 
nausea and vomiting.  
Recently, there was a shortage of preservative free morphine. As a result, alternative 
forms of analgesia had to be utilized for multiple operations, including cesarean 
delivery. Multiple obstetric anesthesia groups began to use intrathecal hydromorphone 
for cesarean delivery when morphine was unavailable. Unfortunately, there was very 
little data regarding its use for cesarean section at that time. As groups began to use 
hydromorphone, retrospective data became available that demonstrated its safety and 
efficacy for use during cesarean section.  
In order to fully elucidate the analgesic and side effect properties of hydromorphone for 
cesarean delivery, a prospective randomized, double blind study comparing morphine 
and hydromorphone is necessary. We need to understand whether hydromorphone is 
as effective as morphine for analgesia after cesarean section, and whether it is 
associated with fewer or more side effects. The results of the study will allow providers 
to make educated decisions to better care for their patient.

1) Objectives 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in analgesic 
effect of intrathecal morphine and hydromorphone for cesarean section.  
 
2) Background 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_472602]-operative 
analgesia. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_472603]. When activated, these receptors inhibit the release of excitatory 
neurotransmitters within the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The most important factor to consider 
when administering intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_472604]. 
 
Lipophilic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], such as fentanyl, enter the spi[INVESTIGATOR_472605], quickly diffuse 
across the dura and into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_472606]. Due to the rapid distribution, lipophilic opi[INVESTIGATOR_472607] (CSF). As a result of these features, lipophilic opi[INVESTIGATOR_472608] a rapid onset and short duration of action. Fentanyl, for example, has an 
onset of action of 5-[ADDRESS_605844] hydrophilic of the frequently used 
intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Intrathecal morphine has a relatively slow onset (30-60 min) and 
lasts approximately 24 hours. Morphine has a small intrathecal volume of 
distribution and slower clearance than lipophilic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Morphine metabolism 
results in active metabolites. Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and Morphine-3-
glucuronide (M3G) are the primary active metabolites. M6G is thought to be 
responsible for analgesic properties of morphine, but also contributes to the side 
effect of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. The intrathecal potency of M6G is approximately 
10-45 times greater than that of morphine. ( 1) 
 
Hydromorphone, another hydrophilic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], is a semi-synthetic ketone of 
morphine. Hydromorphone is slightly more lipophilic than morphine and therefore 
has a faster onset of action and shorter duration of action. Hydromorphone is 
approximately five times more potent than morphine when administered 
intrathecally. Furthermore, hydromorphone appears to have a more favorable side

Revised  7/20/1211/21/[ADDRESS_605845] obstetric anesthesiologists use intrathecal morphine for analgesia 
after cesarean delivery. Based on the pharmacokinetics of morphine and 
hydromorphone, it would appear that the use of intrathecal hydromorphone for 
cesarean delivery may result in a similar analgesic profile with fewer side effects. A 
retrospective study by [CONTACT_472628] (2013) sought to compare the analgesic and side effect 
profile of intrathecal hydromorphone with local anesthetic vs. intrathecal fentanyl 
with local anesthetic vs. local anesthetic alone for cesarean section. Pain scores 
were gathered retrospectively from self- report in response to a nurse’s questions. In 
this study, hydromorphone significantly reduced pain scores in the 0-4 hour range 
and the 24 hour range as compared to local anesthetic alone or in conjunction with 
fentanyl. This is the only study in the literature that investigated that role of  
intrathecal hydromorphone and showed that it provides effective analgesia for 
cesarean section. There was also a study by [CONTACT_472629]. (1996) that compared 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_472609]. This study 
found no difference in analgesic effect between the two groups. The Halpern study 
did identify an earlier peak of pruritus in the hydromorphone group and a later peak 
in the morphine group. There are, however, no studies that compared intrathecal 
hydromorphone with intrathecal morphine for cesarean delivery. In order to further 
characterize the analgesic and side effect profile of intrathecal hydromorphone and 
determine its future role in obstetric anesthesia, a prospective randomized double 
blind trial is necessary.  
 
 
3) Setting of the Human Research 
This study will take place at the Mt Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472610]. Patients 
eligible for the trial will be approached by a member of the investigating team after 
admission to the labor and delivery unit for primary elective cesarean section. These 
patients will be informed about the trial and consent will be obtained. If the patient 
does not wish to take place in the trial, she will receive standard anesthetic care. 
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research 
The study will involve 50 patients scheduled for primary elective cesarean section. 
The Mt Sinai labor and delivery unit is a very busy unit that performs between 4 and 
6 elective cases daily. The obstetricians and nurses on this unit are very cooperative

5) Study Design 
This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind study. Patients presenting for 
primary elective cesarean section will be randomized into two groups. Consent for 
the study will be obtained in the pre-op area before the patient receives any  
medication.  Group [ADDRESS_605847] morphine group. In this group, the 
patient’s will receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_472611] 1.5cc of 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_472612] 250mcg of preservative free morphine. Group 2 will be the experimental 
hydromorphone group. In this group, the patient’s will receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_472613] 1.5cc of 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110754] [ADDRESS_605848] 10 minutes and then every 3 minutes for the 
remainder of the case. A decrease in BP > 30% of baseline along with a heart rate > 
60 or if the patient has symptoms of hypotension (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or 
lightheadedness) will be treated with phenylephrine 100 mcg IV boluses and 
repeated every 1 minute until BP returns to normal. If the HR is below 60, ephedrine 
will be used in 10mg increments as stated above. Additionally, a bolus of 100cc IV 
fluid will be given during each hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. After the spi[INVESTIGATOR_472614] a rate of 150cc/hr. 
 
The presence of nausea and vomiting, and pruritus will also be recorded in 5 minute 
intervals.

The dermatomal level of anesthesia will be assessed every 2 minutes until the 
anesthetic level reaches thoracic level 4 (t-4).  We will test for adequate level of 
anesthesia with a needle testing for the sensation of a pin prick. . 
 
 
Patient satisfaction will be recorded at the end of the procedure. Patients will be 
asked to rate their experience on a 1-[ADDRESS_605849] on the labor floor. 
These include ketorolac 30mg IV every 6 hours. In addition to this, every patient in 
this study will be given an IV fentanyl PCA (patient controlled analgesia) pump. The 
settings of the pump will be basal rate of 0, bolus rate of 15mcg, and a lock out of 
every [ADDRESS_605850] 4 hours by [CONTACT_472630]. Pain scores will be obtained using the verbal response scale (VRS). The VRS 
scale is measured using a score of [ADDRESS_605851] pain. The 
presence of nausea and pruritus will also be assessed at these time points. The 
patients will then be visited again at 6hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs. At these time points, 
the patients will be asked for pain scores, presence of nausea, vomiting and pruritus. 
 
At 24 hrs, the patients will be evaluated for overall satisfaction with pain control and 
their anesthetic experience.   
 
 
a) Recruitment Methods 
Every patient that presents for primary elective cesarean section will be a potential 
candidate for this study. After admission to the labor and delivery floor, the patient 
will be approached by a member of the investigating team. These patients will be 
informed about the trial and consent will be obtained.  If the patient does not wish 
to take place in the trial, she will receive standard anesthetic care.

b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Inclusion Criteria for this study: 
Elective primary cesarean section; Females age 18- 40 
 
Exclusion Criteria: 
Emergency cesarean section; Anesthetic other than spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]; History of chronic pain or 
pre-op opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; Allergy to morphine or hydromorphone; BMI>40 
 
c) Number of Subjects 
Since there are no prior studies comparing Duramorph to hydromorphone for 
postoperative analgesia we cannot perform a power analysis to determine the 
number of patients required.   We propose to enroll [ADDRESS_605852] after analyzing the data.  
 
 
d) Study Timelines 
Each individual subject will be followed for 24 hours after cesarean section. 
We anticipate that we will enroll all subjects within 1year. 
We estimate that this study will be completed 6 months after enrollment of all 
subjects.  
 
 
e) Study Endpoints 
Each patient will receive a fentanyl pca (patient controlled analgesia) pump in the 
post anesthesia care unit (pacu). The primary outcome is total dose of fentanyl pca 
used in 24 hours. This will be a marker for supplemental analgesia needed after the 
cesarean delivery. 
Secondary outcomes include: 
1. Time to initial use of pca. We want to understand when the hydromorphone 
and morphine group will require the first supplemental analgesic.

4.  Patient satisfaction scores in the above time frames. 
5. Assessment of nausea and vomiting and pruritus in the above time frames. This 
will help us understand the onset and incidence of these side effects among the 
two groups. 
 
 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research 
T
he study design was described above. Every patient will receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163], 
as is standard of care for primary elective cesarean section. All standard anesthetic 
safety protocols and all standard nursing protocols will be followed. The only 
difference is the use of the study drug. 
 
Every patient in this study will be given a pca for post-operative analgesia. The 
nurses in the post anesthesia care unit and post-partum unit are familiar with pca 
use and are capable of assessing the patients for sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826]. All cesarean section patients already have to be monitored for

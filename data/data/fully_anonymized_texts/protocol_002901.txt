Protocol MNEMONIC and Title: MIND - Melatonin Intervention for Neurocognitive 
Deficits in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort  
Principal Investigat or: Tara Brinkman, Ph.D.  
IND Holder:  N/A 
Brief Overview:  This study is  a randomized double -blind placebo controlled trial of 
time release melatonin for adult survivors of childhood cancer who demonstrate 
impaired neurocognitive functioning and/or delayed  sleep onset latency. The sample 
will be stratified to generate three mutually exclusive cohorts . Cohort  1: 
neurocognitive impairment without delayed sleep onset latency ; Cohort  2: 
neurocognitive impairment with delayed sleep onset latency ; Cohort  3: delay ed sleep 
onset without neurocognitive impairment. Within each group, participants will be 
randomly allocated to either melatonin or placebo for a 6 -month trial. Participants will 
take 3mg of time release melatonin or placebo orally each night prior to init iating sleep 
onset. Baseline and follow -up evaluations will be completed to determine the effects 
of melatonin on specific neurocognitive processes  and sleep parameters.  
Intervention:  Survivors who previously underwent neurocognitive evaluation as part 
of the SJLIFE study, as well as survivors who are eligible for future neurocognitive 
evaluation through SJLIFE will be recruited. Initial eligibility will be determined via 
review of previous neurocognitive assessment data and telephone screening. Interested  
survivors meeting the pre -screen criteria will complete standardized sleep measures at 
their baseline visit . Baseline neurocognitive assessments will occur as part of the 
SJLIFE study.  Neurocognitive assessments will be administered again at 6 months. 
Subjective and objective sleep measures including actigraphy  will be assessed at 
baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Correlative psychosocial measures of health -related 
quality of life and psychological distress will be completed at baseline as part of the 
SJLIFE study and following 6 months on treatment. Serum melatonin will be collected 
at baseline and 6 month follow -up.   
Brief Outline of Treatment Plan: Participants will take a fixed 3 mg oral dose of time 
release melatonin or placebo once per day 1 -2 hour s before initiating sleep onset for a 
6 month period. Participants will be called biweekly throughout the intervention to 
monitor treatment adherence, side effects, and adverse events.

Deficits in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort  
Hypotheses/Estimates:  
 Hypothesis 1:  Long -term survivors of childhood cancer with documented 
baseline neurocognitive deficits ( Cohorts  1 and 2)  in attention, memory, and/or 
executive functioning,  randomized to the melatonin treatment arm, will 
demonstrate improved neurocognitive performance following six months of 
treatment compared to those randomized to placebo.  
 
 Hypothesis 2:  Long -term survivors o f childhood cancer with delayed sleep 
onset latency at baseline  (Cohorts  2 and 3), randomized to the melatonin 
treatment arm, will demonstrate improved sleep onset latency following 6 
months of treatment compared to the placebo groups.  
 
 Hypothesis 3: Impro vement in sleep onset latency with melatonin treatment 
will result in improved neurocognitive performance in long -term childhood 
cancer survivors who have both comorbid sleep onset latency and 
neurocognitive deficits at baseline ( Cohort  2). 
 
 Exploratory Hy pothesis 1: Improvement in sleep onset latency following 
melatonin treatment will be independent of baseline endogenous melatonin 
levels.  
 
 Exploratory Hypothesis 2: Improved sleep quality will be associated with 
decreased psychological distress and enhance d quality of life.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria for Evaluation:   
Three domains of neurocognition will be examined as primary study outcomes 1) 
attention, 2) memory, and 3) executive functioning.  Sleep parameters to be assessed 
include objective and subjective measures .  Correlative psychosocial measures of health -
related quality of life and psychological distress will be evaluated . Treatment adherence 
and side effects will be monitored .

Randomization:  
Participants in each cohort  will be randomized 1:1 to receive time release melatonin 3 mg

Data Analyses : 
Primary Aim : The primary aim of this study  is to determine the difference between 
changes in neurocognitive functioning from baseline to the [ADDRESS_254788] identified six neurocognitive domains in 
which the marginal impairment rate is >15% in the SJLIFE cohort. Normalized Z -scores 
(M=0, SD=1) are available for each domain and survivors who score at or  below the 10th 
percentile will be classified as impaired on that specific domain. The lowest test -retest 
correlation coefficient  for the neurocognitive measures has been observed to be 0.60. 
Then, a ssuming the difference in the Z -scores to be normally dis tributed but assuming 
(conservatively ) the variance to be 1, we need outcome data for  [ADDRESS_254789] an improvement of 
.66 units (in standardized scale , considered to be clinically me aningful ) with 80% power 
with type I error control =0.05 /6=0.[ADDRESS_254790].  Assuming 
an attrition and loss to follow up of 25%, we plan to enroll 987 survivors (Cohort 1= 328; 
Cohort 2= 328; Cohort 3= 331).

Secondary Aim  1: The primary interest of secondary aim  one is to assess the efficacy of 
melatonin on delayed sleep onset latency in adult survivors of childhood cancer, which 
will be evaluat ed in Cohorts  2 and 3. We hypothesize that survivors randomized to the 
melatonin treatment arm will evidence a greater reduction in sleep onset latency 
compared to survivors randomized to placebo. The CCSS cohort mean and SD for sleep 
onset latency among p articipants with delayed sleep onset latency (i.e. SOL > 30 
minutes) is 46.[ADDRESS_254791] correlation for sleep onset 
latency from the PSQI has been observed to be in the range of 0.70. Following the 
justification set for th in the Primary Aim, and assuming the SD to be 27.7, we will need 
outcome data for  131 survivors in Cohort 2 and 133 in Cohort 3 between the melatonin 
and placebo arms for these Cohorts to see an improvement of 15 minutes in sleep onset 
latency with 80% power with type I error control =0.05. The analysis for Aim [ADDRESS_254792]. 
Secondary Aim 2:  The aim of this objective  is to investigate the association between 
sleep onset latency and specific neurocognitive processes [Coho rt 2]. We hypothesize 
that decreased sleep onset latency following 6 months of melatonin treatment will be 
associated with improved neurocognitive performance. We will need outcome data for  
131 survivors  in Cohort 2 [ 66 randomized to melatonin, 65 randomiz ed to placebo] so 
that we will have 80% power to detect a correlation of at least 0.25 between reduced 
sleep onset latency and improved neurocognitive performance with type 1 error control 
=0.05.  
Exploratory Aim s: To explore  the association between endoge nous melatonin levels and 
improvement in sleep onset latency . To explore  the association between sleep qu ality and 
psychological  distress and health related quality of life.

Human Subjects :  
The risks to the subjects will be related to the side effects of melatonin which may 
includ e drowsiness, headache, additional sedation if taken with other sedating drugs, an 
allergic reaction, confusion, and rarely seizures, and tachycardia. Adverse events are rare, 
occurring at similar frequency to those with placebo in publishe d research in adults with 
primary insomnia. Participants will be informed of these side effects during the informed 
consent discussion. Adverse events will be monitored and reported and treated 
accordingly.

 1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
Over 80% of children diagnosed with a pediatric malignancy become long -term 
survivors. Many of these survivors received neurotoxic cancer treatments that may 
interfere with the development of specific neurocognitive abilities,  deficits that are lasting 
and appear to be progressive over time. Furthermore, survivors are at increased risk for 
sleep problems and fatigue that may exacerbate neurocognitive impairment.  Few 
interventions have been offered to remediate neurocognitive d eficits in adult survivors of 
childhood cancer and even less attention has been directed at improving sleep difficulties. 
Melatonin is an endogenously produced hormone with known sleep -promoting effects 
and recent evidence demonstrates that melatonin can i mprove neurocognitive functioning 
in adults at -risk for cognitive decline. As such, treatment with exogenous melatonin may 
provide an ideal method by [CONTACT_212449], yet interrelated late 
effects of childhood cancer, neurocognitiv e and sleep dysfunction.  
 
This application proposes a randomized double -blind placebo controlled trial of time 
release melatonin for long -term adult survivors of childhood cancer who demonstrate 
impaired neurocognitive functioning and/or delayed sleep onse t latency. The sample will 
be stratified to generate three mutually exclusive groups [Cohort 1: neurocognitive 
impairment without delayed sleep onset latency;  Cohort 2: neurocognitive impairment 
with delayed sleep onset latency ; Cohort 3: delayed sleep ons et without neurocognitive 
impairment] . Within each cohort , participants will be randomly allocated to either 
melatonin or placebo treatment for a 6 month trial. Baseline and follow -up evaluations 
will be completed to determine the efficacy of melatonin tre atment on specific 
neurocognitive processes  and sleep parameters .

directed at mitigating neurocognit ive dysfunction are imperative.  
 
Survivors of childhood cancer are also frequently reported to experience 
fatigue and sleep disturbance. For example, survivors of childhood

treatment,16,17 and survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) report more 
fatigue than their siblings and population -based controls.18-[ADDRESS_254797] of fatigue and sleep loss on neurocognitive

Little is known of the association between sleep problems and 
neurocognitive outcomes among survivors of childhood cancer. A recent 
report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study indicated that 49.5% of 
all survivors demonstrated significant problems with fatigue, vitality,

 their initial diagnosis. Nonpharmacological intervent ions, such as 
cognitive training/remediation programs have yielded small, short -term 
improvements on select neurocognitive processes; however, such 
programs are extremely time -intensive, costly, and suffer from high 
dropout rates. Additionally, there are n o published reports of interventions 
for sleep or fatigue problems in adult survivors of childhood cancer, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_212420]. There is a clear 
need to test inte rventions with the potential to impact the interrelated 
processes of neurocognitive functioning and sleep, and for approaches that 
are feasible, of low burden to the participant and have a strong potential 
for efficacy.  
 
This study proposes a highly disse minable intervention for  improving 
neurocognitive function and sleep difficulties in adult survivors of 
childhood cancer. Melatonin (N -acetyl -5-methoxytryptamine) is the 
primary hormone released nocturnally by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_212421]. Its 
powerful anti -oxidant and anti -inflammatory properties have been 
implicated in enhanced neurocognitive functions and melatonin has well 
known effects on sleep. Melatonin has not yet been studied in adult 
survivors of childhood cancer. Investigating the effectiveness of melatonin 
is important as it will provide a safe, non -intensive intervention approach 
with the strong potential to improve neurocognitive and sleep dysfunction 
in an at -risk population.

melatonin as a hormone that promotes sleep onset to one with the additive 
benefit of enhancing neurocognition.  
 
2.2.1  Melatonin a nd neurocognition:  Cognitive dysfunction is one of 
the most common late effects following treatment with CNS directed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212422]. While the pathogenesis of radiation -
induced cognitive decline is not well understood, recent evidence sugg ests 
that disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis may be involved.[ADDRESS_254800] cranial irradiation induced

mice. Specifically, melatonin was found to reduce neuronal damage by

 to three mechanisms including: 1) reduced presence of human protein B -
amyloid in the brain, 2) decreased inflamm atory cytokines within the 
brain, and 3) reduced oxidative stress within the brain.  
 
Beneficial effects of exogenous melatonin on neurocognition have also 
been reported in open -label studies of human adults with and without 
neurodegenerative disease. Speci fically, melatonin has been proposed as a 
potential therapeutic agent for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).[ADDRESS_254804] ameliorating  cognitive deficits is warranted.  
 
2.2.2  Melatonin and sleep:  Melatonin also has demonstrated efficacy in 
stimulating sleep onset in animals and humans. Nonhuman primates are 
considered an ideal model, as the supr achiasmatic nucleus (SCN) exerts 
similar regulatory properties on the circadian system in humans and 
monkeys.[ADDRESS_254805] of melatonin and support the use of sleep onset latency as an 
outcome variable.  
 
Exogenous melatonin also has been demonstrated to promote sleep onset 
latency in healthy adult humans,49 as well as adults with insomnia 
combined with dementia ,50 and mild cognitive impairment.43 A meta -
analysis on the efficacy of exogenous melatonin for primary insomnia 
reported reduced sleep onset latency of -7.2 minutes (95% CI -12.0 to -
2.4).51 Efficacy has further been demonstrated in individuals with 
intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum d isorder.52 Recent meta -

minutes (95% CI -10.9 to -2.6).55 Furthermore, their data demonstrated 
that treatment ef ficacy was independent of endogenous melatonin levels 
with no signs of tolerance or reduction in benefit during the 6 -month 
treatment period.  
 
2.2.3 A safe intervention:  Importantly, animal and human studies have 
shown melatonin toxicity to be remarkably l ow with no serious negative 
side effects even at high doses. In a randomized, double -blind placebo 
controlled  trial, Se abra et al56 investigated the toxicology of 10mg of 
melatonin administered to healthy adults for [ADDRESS_254807] double -blind randomized placebo 
controlled trial of sustained release melato nin, Wade et al55 reported no 
difference in the type or frequency of adverse events  between melatonin 
and placebo treatment groups during a 6 month trial  with samp le size of 
722. Twelve per cent of patients treated with 2 mg of sustained release 
melatonin reported a drug related adverse event compared to 17% of 
patients treated with placebo.[ADDRESS_254808] recently, Lemoine et al59 reported results from a 6 -12 month open -
label study of the efficac y, safety, and withdrawal of 2mg prolonged 
release melatonin in 244 adults, ages 20 -80, who previously participated in 
a double -blind placebo -controlled trial (i.e. Wade et al55). The efficacy of 
prolonged release melatonin was maintained during the open -label period 
and no differences were reported in safety parameters between patients 
who were treated for 6 compared to 12 months. Additionally, few rebound 
and withd rawal symptoms were reported following discontinuation of 
melatonin treatment.  
 
2.2.4 Novel contributions of the current proposal:  There are nearly 
300,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the [LOCATION_002], many of 
whom received neurotoxic treatment that interfered with the development 
of neurocognitive abilities. Moreover, these treatment effects appear to be 
progressive over time, thus increasing risk for early cognitive decline 
among adult survivors of childhood cancer. Neurocognitive difficulties

 appea r to be exacerbated in the context of poor sleep and fatigue, with 
increased vulnerability observed in childhood cancer survivors. There are 
few interventions for neurocognitive deficits and those available are 
limited by [CONTACT_212452] (i.e. high  dropout rates, limited 
disseminability), resource requirements (i.e. time intensive, supervision, 
cost), and questio nable efficacy. This protocol  is innovative as it proposes 
an intervention that is cost -effective, safe, and of low burden to the cancer 
survivor. The intervention is portable and uses a single treatment modality 
to target two distinct, highly prevalent late effects in childhood cancer 
survivors, neurocognitive and sleep dysfunction.

neurocogn itive and sleep dysfunction in adult survivors of childhood 
cancer.  
 
2.3.1  Sleep, Fatigue and Neurocognition:  Research efforts led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Krull using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort provide 
strong evidence for the associations between sle ep quality, fatigue and 
neurocognitive impairment. Participants included 1,426 adult survivors of 
childhood cancer who were treated before 18 years of age and survived >5 
years from their original diagnosis. Among those with fatigue, 53% 
reported impaired attention and processing speed compared to 15% of 
those without fatigue. Similarly, 40% of survivors with poor sleep quality 
had impaired attention and processing speed compared to 16% of those 
without poor sleep. Multivariable logistic regression models c ontrolling 
for sex, age, cranial radiation therapy, psychological distress, and 
household income revealed increased risk for impaired attention and 
processing speed for survivors with reduced vitality (RR=1.75, 95% CI, 
1.33-2.30), fatigue (RR=1.34, 95% CI,  1.13-1.59), daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] 
(RR=1.68, 95% CI, 1.55 -1.83), and poor sleep quality (RR=1.23; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.49). Reduced vitality (RR=2.01, 95% CI, 1.42 -2.86), daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (RR=2.05, 95% CI, 1.63 -2.58), and poor sleep quality 
(RR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.19 -1.76) significantly predicted impaired memory. 
Importantly, the risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with 
fatigue and sleep disturbance was roughly equivalent to that seen with 
high-dose cranial radiation.  
2.3.2  Actigraphy and Neurocognition:  Drs. Mandrell and Krull 
recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_212423] 35 adult survivors of Hodgkin’s 
disease using the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) at SJCRH. 
Participants were on average 15 years old at the time of their cancer 
diagnosis (range, 5 to 18 years) and 42 years of age at the time of study 
completion (range, 34 to 55 years). Survivors completed the Epworth

4) Absence of delayed sleep onset  latency  will be defined as inability to 
fall asleep within 30 minutes < once a week during the past month.  
 
Each of the cohorts is described below:  
 
Cohort 1 : 
 
a.  Has neurocognitive impairment defined as performance on at least one 
measure of attention, memory, and/or executive functioning <10th 
percentile.  
b. Is absent  of delayed sleep onset latency defined as  an inability to fall 
asleep within 30 minutes < once a week during the past month.  
 
Cohort  2: 
 
a.  Has neurocognitive impairment defined as perfor mance on at least one 
measure of attention, memory, and/ or executive functioning <10th 
percentile.  
b.  Has delayed sleep onset latency  defined as self -report of an inability to 
fall asleep within 30 minutes > once a week during  the past month . 
 
Cohort  3: 
 
a. Is absent of neurocognitive impairment defined as performance >10th 
percentile on all six measures of attention, memory, and executive 
functioning.  
 
b. Has delayed sleep onset latency  defined as self -report of an inability to 
fall asleep within 30 minutes > once a week during  the past month . 
 
Upon completion of baseline neurocognitive and sleep evaluations , if it is 
determined that the participant does not have neurocognitive impairment 
and no delayed sleep onset latency, he or she will not be randomized and 
will be taken off study.

possible. Considered a measure of cognitive flexibility, Trai ls B is found 
to have adequate psychometric properties.  
 
Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA):  This is a task of verbal 
fluency. Participants are given a letter and must say as many words that 
start with that letter within [ADDRESS_254825], 
one using the letters FAS and the other using CFL, to control for practice 
effects.  
4.2 Sleep Measures  
 
Sleep parameters will be assessed at three time points during the study: 
Baseline, 3 -months, and 6 -months. The Baseline assessment w ill occur 
prior to initiation of the melatonin intervention. The two follow -up 
assessments will occur while participants are actively enrolled on the 
intervention trial. Each assessment will include the objective and 
subjective measures as outlined below.  
 
4.2.1  Actigraphy  
 
Sleep -pattern measures of each participant will be measured with 
Actigraphy to be worn over 5 consecutive days at three specified intervals 
[Baseline, 3 months, 6 months]. Actigraphy provides objective assessment 
of wrist movement that infers wakefulness and sleep. Functionally, the 
actigraph provides sleep -pattern measures including: sleep onset latency 
(SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). 
Movement triggering the actigraph is relatively high during wakefulne ss 
and decreases to near -zero values during sleep. The actigraphy will collect 
data in the zero crossing mode, where the transducer signal is compared 
with a fixed sensitivity threshold. The number of times the signal voltage

until the user -defined epoch length has transpi[INVESTIGATOR_5697].  
[Acceleration Index —the acceleration index (AI) is calculated by [CONTACT_212455]: AI=2p -1] 
Where p is the proportion of the interval required for 50% of the total 
activity in the interval to be completed.  For example, for a [ADDRESS_254826] 20 minutes of the interval, p would be 20/60 or .33. 
Doubling p and subtracting 1 scales the index form -1 to +1.  Thus, 
negative values represent slowing during the interval, [ADDRESS_254827] is highly similar.  
 
4.2.2  Daily Sleep Diary  
 
The daily sleep diary is a 15 item self -report measure that assesses 
participant sleep patterns during  the previous night. The items measure 
sleep parameters such as onset latency, efficiency, duration, and quality.69 
The sleep diary will be completed for fiv e consecutive days to correspond 
with 5 days of actigraphy data collection. Sleep logs are widely employed 
in research and are more accurate than a single, global, and retrospective 
estimate of sleep parameters.70  
 
4.2.3  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_106735] h Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
 
The PSQI assesses sleep quality over the previous month and is compris ed 
of 19 items that are scored on a 4 -point Likert scale (0  = not at all during 
the past month to 3  = three or more times a week). Seven equally weighted 
components are measured by [CONTACT_212456], including subjective sleep quality, 
sleep onset latency, sleep du ration, habitual efficiency, sleep disturbance, 
and daytime dysfunction. Component scores can be evaluated individually 
or summed to provide an overall score from 0 to 21. Higher scores 
indicate poorer quality of sleep. The overall reliability coefficient 
(Cronbach alpha) is 0.[ADDRESS_254828] reliability has a Pearson 
correlation of 0.85.

The FACIT -Fatigue  is a measure of physical and functional consequences 
associated with fatigue. The 13 items comprising this measure are scored 
on a reverse 4 -point Likert scale (4  = not at all to 0 = very much). Scores

4.3 Corr elative Psychosocial Measures   
Psychosocial measures of health -related quality of life and psychological 
distress will be completed at baseline  as part of the SJLIFE protocol  and 
following 6 months of melatonin/placebo treatment. Previous studies have 
demo nstrated an association between melatonin treatment and depressive 
symptoms and quality of life has been identified as an important 
functional outcome of clinical trials.  
 
4.3.1  Medical Outcomes Survey 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey 
(SF-36)  
Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured with the SF -36, a 
widely used generic health profile which provides subscale scores for 8 
domains of HRQOL: general health, role physical, physical function, 
bodily pain, vitality, mental health, social function,  and role emotional. 
The SF -[ADDRESS_254831] reliability are excellent.71

and aliquoted to 1.2 mL cryovials which hold 0.5mL of serum. The vials 
will be labeled with the participant’s assigned study number. Of note, it is 
necessary to collect 12mL of blood per participa nt since melatonin levels 
have not been previously established in this unique participant population. 
Therefore, it is possible that samples will need to be processed multiple 
times to accurately characterize the levels The cryovials will be stored at -
[ADDRESS_254833] ing service 
via standardized shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585].   
 
Serum melatonin will be analyzed via quantitative radioimmunoassay. 
Recent data indicate strong correlations between serum and plasma levels 
as well as urine and serum  levels, suggesting that serum is a useful 
specimen for the quantification of melatonin levels. Daytime adult levels 
range from 3.4 to 53.9pg/mL while nighttime levels range from 7.1 to 
89.5pg/mL.  Importantly, a five -fold difference in melatonin levels has 
been reported with serum collected in the morning hours compared to that 
collected in the afternoon. Therefore, all blood samples will be drawn in 
the morning.73Participants may choose  to participate in the Melatonin 
blood  sample at the baseline and [ADDRESS_254834] reported 
low nocturnal salivary74 and 24 -hour plasma75 levels of endogenous 
melatonin in childhood su rvivors of craniopharyngioma. Increased 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_212428] 6mg of exogenous 
melatonin resulted in improved daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].74 
 
Data are lacking on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
melatonin in cancer survivors, although among adults individual variation 
is apparent.  The ability to synthesize melatoni n varies among individuals

incidence of side effects (PRISE), frequency and intensity of s ide 
effect rating (FISER), and global rating of side effects burden 
(GRSEB). The PRISE form assesses the presence of side effects 
for a variety of biological systems. For each of the nine 
organ/function systems (gastrointestinal, nervous system, heart, 
eyes/ears, skin, genital/urinary, sleep, sexual functioning, and 
other), the participant indicates the presence of a side effect, and if 
present, the tolerability of the side effect (tolerable or distressing). 
The FISER and GRSEB assess three domains of medic ation side 
effect impact: frequency, intensity, and burden. Each domain is 
rated on a 7 -point Likert scale (i.e. Frequency, ranging from no 
side effects to present all the time; Intensity, ranging from no side 
effects to intolerable; and Burden, ranging fr om no impairment to 
unable to function due to side effects). Reliability and validity have 
been reported.  
 
4.6 Dose Modifications  
 
There will be no dose modifications for melatonin or placebo. Treatment 
will be discontinued if a participant reports an adverse event that is not 
tolerable which the investigator deems related to the study drug.  The 
participant will end treatment on the study  and arrangements will be made 
for the return of unused melatonin/placebo .

 5.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
 
Melatonin  
Source and Pharmacology: Melatonin (N-Acetyl -5-Methoxytryptamine ) is a 
neurohormone produced in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_212432]. It is naturally released during the dark hours of the normal day -night cycle. 
It is also thought to play a rol e in regulating the secretion of growth hormones and 
gonadotropic hormones. Melatonin may also possess some antioxidant properties.  
Melatonin undergoes significant first -pass metabolism (up to 60%) with an oral 
dosage form, and is metabolized into two ina ctive metabolites: 6 -
hydroxymelatonin and N -acetyl serotonin. Clearance is severely reduced in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Melatonin is mostly excreted in the urine as 
the inactive metabolite 6 -hydroxymelatonin. Adults experience approximately a 
37% decline in melatonin production between the ages of [ADDRESS_254842] with 
calcium channel blockers leading to an increase in blood pressure. Possible 
immune -stimulating effects of melatonin may interfere with immunosuppressant 
therapy.  
Formulation and Stability:  Melatonin 3 mg time rel ease tablets will be used. 
The tablets are to be stored at controlled room temperature and are stable 
according to manufacturer’s labeling.  
 
Supplier:   Commercially available from various manufacturers.  For the current 
study Natrol® 3mg time release mela tonin will be utilized.   Additional ingredients 
included in the Natrol®  3 mg time release melatonin tablets includes Vitamin B6 
(from pyridoxine hydrochloride),  cellulose , dibasic calcium phosphate,  
hypromellose, silica,  stearic acid , magnesium stearate,  methylcellulose and  
glycerin.  Melatonin is considered a nutraceutical and is not FDA approved for 
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of disease.  
 
Toxicity: Drug toxicities with melatonin are rare. Serious side effects have not 
been reported but long term  studies have not been performed. The most common 
side effects of using melatonin are drowsiness and confusion, especially if used 
with other CNS sedating drugs. Other toxicities that have been associated with 
melatonin are headache, hypersensitivity, tach ycardia, hypothermia, and increased 
seizure activity. Melatonin may reduce glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. 
Use with caution in individuals with a history of bleeding disorders, hemostatic 
disorders and in individuals taking anticoagulant medicat ions (warfarin, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
NSAIDs or antiplatelet agents) or antidiabetic agents or insulin. Avoid use in 
women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.

Baseline  Measures: Baseline evaluation for all participants will includ e a 
medical evaluation , neurocognitive assessment , and collection of biological 
samples. Because evaluations performed,  as detailed in the Children’s 
Oncology Group “Long -Term Follow -Up Guidelines for Survivors of 
Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Can cers,” are standard care in the

baseline medical or neurocognitive evaluation in the proposed study cohort. 
Medical evaluations are based on primary cancer diagnosis, age at 
diagnosis, an d therapeutic interventions and are limited to screening and 
diagnostic evaluations to characterize cancer -related health complications. 
Complete treatment records, including all information from all medical 
follow -up, will be available to study investigat ors. [CONTACT_212486] is the

 The following definitions ap ply: 
 
A serious event refers to any event in which the outcome is fatal or life -
threatening, results in permanent disability, causes inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212437], or is a 
congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.  
 
An unanticipated adverse event refers to those not identified in their 
nature, severity, or frequency in the current risk documents (e.g., 
investigator’s brochure), or consistent with the investigational plan.  
 
The following are considered reportable: Any  injuries, serious event or 
other unanticipated adverse events involving risk to participants or others 
which occur at a frequency above that considered acceptable by [CONTACT_212471]. (FDA) As described in 4.3 above, the OHSP 
Director or desi gnee performs the initial review of unanticipated problems 
or serious adverse event reports. Internal reports of events that are 
unanticipated, serious, and related or possibly related to study 
interventions or procedures are then forwarded to the IRB Chai r or 
designee and if necessary, referred to the full IRB. Based on the frequency 
and seriousness of adverse events, the IRB Chair or Committee may deem 
it necessary to suspend or terminate a research study or studies.  
 
All anticipated Grade III or IV adver se events will be reported to the IRB 
in the continuing review report and/or summary.  The DSMB will monitor 
accrual and toxicities every six months.  
 
9.2 Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
All serious adverse events will be recorded in th e source, dat abase and/or

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The primary focus of  this study is to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin on 
neurocognitive functioning in long term survivors of childhood cancer. Currently, 
there are 2,331  survivors potentially eligible for this study and 1,410 (61%  have 
been identified as expected to have least one area of neurocognitive impairment.  
Further, it is estimated that among all the eligible survivors roughly 30% will 
have delayed sleep (sleep onset latency ≥ 30 minutes). Thus, the eligible survivors 
can be classified into three distinct cohorts (I) Those who are neurocognitively 
impaired b ut don’t have delayed sleep 987 (II) Those who are neurocognitively 
impaired and have delayed sleep 423, i.e. 30% of 1,410 , and (III) Those who 
don’t have neurocognitive impairment but have delayed sleep problems (this 
would be roughly 30%  (276) of those w ho are not neurocognitively impaired.  
Targeted enrollment for the study is 987 survivors and expected evaluable is 395.

 and/or executiv e functioning, randomized to the melatonin treatment arm, 
will demonstrate improved neurocognitive performance following six  
months of treatment compared to those randomized to placebo.    
 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that treatme nt with 
melatonin will be associated with improvement in neurocognitive performance. 
This will be evaluated in Cohorts 1 and 2 independently. The study will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_212478].  
 
For those who are in Cohorts 1 and 2 baseline neurocognitive evaluation along 
with other evaluations will be obtained prior to randomization to melatonin or 
placebo arm. After randomization, sleep data will be collected using actigraphy in 
week one when the s urvivors are in their homes. The intervention will be 
delivered for a period of six months with regular phone calls for monitoring. Then 
one week before the six month visit sleep data using actigraphy will be collected. 
The neurocognitive data will be coll ected at the 6 month return visit (post -
treatment).  
 
There are [ADDRESS_254852] identified six in which the marginal impairment rates were 
seen to be greater than 15%. There are norma lized Z -scores available for each 
subscale and a survivor that falls below the 10% (≤ -1.3) is classified as impaired 
on that subscale . It is possible that a survivor could be impaired on more than one 
subscale but we will assess improvement i n each subsc ale independently. Thus, 
we will have the Z -score corresponding to each of the subscales within at baseline 
and at follow -up visit. For simplicity, consider the first subscale. We don’t expect 
to see any change in the Z -scores for the placebo arm but we do  expect to see an  
improvement in the melatonin arm. Let

difference in the Z -scores to be normally distributed but assuming 
(conservatively) the variance to be 1, we will need to randomize [ADDRESS_254854] an improvement of 0.66 units (in 
standardized scale, considered to be clinically meaningful) with 80% power with 
type I error control =0.05/6=0.[ADDRESS_254855] for multiplicity of 6 tests for each 
subscale. However, t he sample size required to evaluate the secondary objective 
in cohorts 2 and 3 is 1 31 and 133, respectively,  per cohort. Thus, we plan to enroll 
131 research participants from Cohorts 1 and 2 and 1 33 research participants from 
Cohort 3.

 In addition to ana lyzing the differences for each subscale we will also analyze the 
data in an alternative manner as follows. For each subscale an improvement will 
be defined if the difference in the Z -score (follow -up time point – baseline) is 
greater than 0.6 units (≥0.6). Let us assume that the probability of observing an 
improvement in a subscale in an individual in the placebo group is about 5% and 
then the total of 6 subscales (assuming them to be independent with the same 
probability of improvement) wi ll follow a Binomial distribution B(6, 0.05) with a 
mean of 0.3 and SD of 0.54. If we assume that the probability of improvement to 
be higher say about 12% in the melatonin group then the total score in that group 
will follow a Binomial distribution B(6, 0 .12) with a mean of 0.[ADDRESS_254856] 
roughly 90% power to detect a difference of 0.42 units with type I  error control 
α=0.05.  
 
Secondary Objective :  Evaluate the efficacy of melatonin  treatment  on delayed 
sleep onset latency  in long -term childhood cancer survivors.   
 Hypothesis 2: Long -term survivors of childhood cancer with delayed sleep 
onset latency at ba seline  (Cohorts  2 and 3), randomized to the melatonin 
treatment arm, will demonstrate improv ed sleep onset latency following 
six months of treatment compared to the placebo  groups .  
 
The primary interest of Objective  2 is to assess the efficacy of melatoni n on 
delayed sleep onset latency in adult survivors of childhood cancer, which will be 
evaluated in Cohort s 2 and 3. We hypothesize that survivors randomized to the 
melatonin treatment arm will evidence a greater improvement in sleep onset 
latency compared  to survivors randomized to placebo. The CCSS cohort mean 
and SD for sleep onset latency among participants with delayed sleep onset 
latency (i.e. SOL > 30minutes) is 46.[ADDRESS_254857] correlation for sleep onset latency from the PSQI has been observed to be in 
the range of 0.70. Following the justification set forth in Aim 1, and assuming the 
SD to be 27.7, we will need to randomize 1 31 and 133  survivors between the 
melatonin and placebo arms in Cohort  2 and Cohort  3, respectively,  to see an 
improvement of 15 minutes in sleep onset latency with 80% power with type I 
error control =0.[ADDRESS_254858]. 
 
Secondary Objective : Investigate whether  improvement in sleep onset latency  
due to melatonin treatment  is associated with neurocognitive improvement in 
long-term childhood cancer survivors.  
 Hypothesis 3: Improvement in  sleep onset latency with melatonin 
treatment will result in improved neurocognitive performance in long -term 
childhood cancer survivors w ho have both  comorbid sleep onset latency 
and neurocognitive deficits at baseline ( Cohort  2). 
 
The secondary  interest of Objective 2  is to investigate the association between

 sleep onset latency and specific neurocognitive p rocesses in survivors with 
comorbid sleep and neurocognitive dysfunction [Cohort 2]. We hypothesize that 
decreased sleep onset latency following 6 months of melatonin treatment will be 
associated with improved neurocognitive performance. With a sample size  of 131 
in Cohort 2 [ 66 randomized to melatonin, 65 randomized to placebo] we will have 
80% power to detect a correlation of at least 0.25 between reduced sleep onset 
latency and improved neurocognitive performance with type 1 error control 
=0.05.  
 
Explor atory Objective : Explore  the association between endogenous melatonin 
levels and improvement in sleep onset latency . 
 
 Exploratory Hypothesis 1: Improvement in sleep onset latency following 
melatonin treatment will be independent of baseline endogenous 
mela tonin levels.  
 
Linear regression model and/or logistic regression model will be used to evaluate 
the association between serum melatonin  and improvement in sleep . 
 
Exploratory Objective : Explore the association between sleep quality and 
health -related qual ity of life and distress.  
 
 Exploratory Hypothesis 3: Improved sleep quality will be associated with 
decreased psychological distress and enhanced quality of life.  
Once again regression approaches, as discussed above, will be utilized to evaluate 
the associ ation between sleep quality and health -related quality of life and 
psychological distress.

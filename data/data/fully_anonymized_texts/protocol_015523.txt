Abstract
Objectives:
Primary
To determine the response rate (RR) for patients with Kirsten r at sarcoma (KRAS) 
wild-type locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the small bowel or ampulla 
of Vater treated with panitumumab.
Secondary 
1)  To determine the overall progression-free survival (PFS) fo r panitumumab.
2)  To determine overall PFS for panitumumab in the subset of p atients with metastatic 
disease only.3)  To determine the overall survival (OS) panitumumab.4)  To determine the OS for panitumumab in the subset of patien ts with metastatic 
disease only.5)  To determine the toxicity of panitumumab.
Rationale: (Be as concise as possible)
Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is a rare cancer that has man y molecular, genetic, 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_851183].  In particular 
both cancers demonstrate an identical frequency and pattern of mutations in the KRAS 
oncogene.  The use of anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (an ti-EGFR) antibodies, 
such as panitumumab, has demonstrated clear anti-cancer activit y in the treatment of 
2009-[ADDRESS_1183501] recently completed a phase II study of capecitabine com bined with oxaliplatin, 
CAPOX, in the treatment of SBA and AAC. This single institution  study conducted at 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center enrolled 31 patients with metastati c or unresectable 
disease.  The overall response rate was 52%.  The combination of CAPOX chemotherapy with the anti-EGFR antibo dy cetuximab has 
been explored in two phase II studies.  Panitumumab is an anti- EGFR monoclonal 
antibody of the IgG2 isotype that was approved by [CONTACT_443699] a nd Drug Administration 
(FDA) in September of [ADDRESS_1183502] of care 
chemotherapy treatment, CAPOX, for locally advanced or metastat ic Small bowel 
adenocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC).  
2009-[ADDRESS_1183503] of both the outcome for patients and pati ent safety.  As a single agent 
panitumumab continues to represent a scientifically sound and i nteresting anti-cancer agent 
to explore in small bowel adenocarcinoma and ampullary adenocar cinoma, and thus this 
study will no longer explore combination therapy but will explo re panitumumab as a single-
agent in refractory disease. 
Eligibility: (List All Criteria)
Inclusion:
1) Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of  the small bowel or ampulla of Vater 
that is either unresectable or metastatic.
2) Adequate tumor tissue available for KRAS mutational analysis or known KRAS wild-type status.
3) Prior progression on or intolerance to treatment with a fluor opyrimidine and oxaliplatin. Recurrence 
of disease within 6 months from the completion of adjuvant ther apy with both a fluoropyrimidine and 
oxaliplatin is considered progression.
4) Patients must have measurable disease as per the revised Resp onse Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Version 1.1).
5) If radiation was previously received, the measurable disease must be outside the previous radiation 
field, unless this area has demonstrated evidence of radiograph ic growth.
6) A minimum of [ADDRESS_1183504] elapsed from completion of any  prior chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy or surgery and the start date of study therapy.
7) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 - 2.
8) Adequate organ function including: a) Absolute neutrophil cou nt (ANC) =/>1,000/ul; b) Platelets 
=/>75,000/ul; c) Total bilirubin =/< 1.[ADDRESS_1183505]; in patients wit h known Gilbert’s syndrome direct bilirubin 
=/<1.[ADDRESS_1183506] will be used as organ function criteria, instead o f total bilirubin; d) AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) 
< [ADDRESS_1183507]; e) Creatinine <[ADDRESS_1183508].
9) Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in women with childbea ring potential (defined as not 
post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical steriliza tion), within one week prior to initiation of 
treatment.
10) The effects of panitumumab on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_851184]. For this reason, women of 
childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contr aception (hormonal or barrier method of 
2009-[ADDRESS_1183509] - Page 4
birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for six months following the 
completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant while par ticipating in this study, she should 
inform her treating physician immediately.
11) Patients must sign an Informed Consent and Authorization ind icating that they are aware of the 
investigational nature of this study and the known risks involv ed.
12) Magnesium level =/> lower limit of normal.
Exclusion:
1) Prior anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_851185] (eg. panitumumab or cetuximab) or 
prior small molecule anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_851186] (eg. erlotinib) for adenocarcinoma of 
the small bowel or ampulla of Vater.
2) Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent s nor have received any 
investigational drug 30 days prior to enrollment.
3) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,  cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would limit adherence with study  requirements.
4) Interstitial pneumonia or extensive and symptomatic interstit ial fibrosis of the lung.
5) Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse ev ents in nursing infants secondary to 
treatment of the mother with panitumumab, breast feeding must b e discontinued.
6) Age <18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are cu rrently available on the use of 
panitumumab in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded  from this study.
Is there an age limit?  Yes
Why?  Provide scientific justification:
18 years or older.  Because no dosing or adverse event data are  currently available on the use of 
CAPOX and panitumumab in the pediatric age group.
Disease Group:
Gastrointestinal
Treatment Agents/Devices/Interventions:Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Panitumumab
Proposed Treatment/Study Plan:
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II study.   Patients who enroll will 
have tumors tested for the presence of activating mutations in codons 12 or 13 , or at 
codon 61 (if tested) of the KRAS oncogene.  Only patients who h ave wild-type KRAS 
gene sequences at these codons will be eligible to undergo stud y treatment with 
panitumumab.
Panitumumab will be administered at 9 mg/kg given over approxim ately a 60-minute

2009-[ADDRESS_1183517] - Page 7
The primary endpoint of this phase II, single arm study is resp onse rate (RR) for patients 
treated with single-agent Panitumumab. Patients will be evaluat ed for up to [ADDRESS_1183518] dose, and a patient will be considered as a no n-responder if no PR or CR 
has been documented after 8 cycles of treatment. Patients who w ithdraw early will be 
included in the ITT analysis. Based on our current data with a null hypothesis of </=1% 
RR to an inactive drug for refractory patients, a sample size o f 17 patients with 
Panitumumab would be required to demonstrate a response rate of  17% using a 
binomial one-sample test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and pow er of 90%. 
 
The primary adverse event to be monitored will be the toxicity rate.  Toxicities to be 
included in toxicity monitoring include definite or probably tr eatment-related grade [ADDRESS_1183519] 4 
cycles of therapy will be used in toxicity monitoring. Accrual is estimated at 1 to 2 
patients per month.   
 
Sample Size and Endpoint Monitoring 
 Response and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using th e Bayesian approach of 
Thall, Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the extension by [CONTACT_851191] (1998). Data from 
a previous study of single agent Panitumumabe in Kras wildtype colorectal cancer 
demonstrated a response rate for Panitumumab is approximately 1 7%. The toxicity rate 
of Panitumumab will estimate it will be approximately 25%.  For  the prior distribution of 
standard Panitumumab, we assumed a simple Dirichlet distributio n and independence 
between OR and toxicity in 124 patients.  The parameters for th is prior distribution are as 
follows:   
 
Dirichlet parameters for the joint prior distribution of object ive response and 
toxicity rate assuming information on 124 patients and independ ence among 
response and toxicity for Panitumumab. 
      N o  R e s ponse   Response 
  No Toxicity             77       16 
  Toxicity             26         5  
A flat Dirichlet prior distribution for experimental Panitumumab  was chosen reflective of 
information from the equivalent of 4 patients with the same mar ginal distributions as for 
Panitumumab (e.g., RR rate of 17% and toxicity rate of 25%). 
 
This regimen of Panitumumab will be considered worthy of furthe r investigation if it elicits 
an increase in RR to 25% with acceptable toxicity.  A 25% toxic ity rate is considered 
unacceptable.  Thus, interim monitoring rules, assuming the pri or distributions above, 
were constructed that meet the following two conditions, 
1) Pr(ØS, Toxicity <ØE, Toxicity | data) > 0.95 and, 
2) Pr(ØS, Response <ØE, Response | data) < 0.[ADDRESS_1183520] rule provides for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] i f excessive toxicity is highly 
probable (i.e., probability >95%) for Panitumumab.  The second condition will stop the 
study early if the data suggest that it is unlikely (i.e., prob ability < 5%) that response rate 
2009-[ADDRESS_1183521] - Page 8
of the drug is 17%. Assuming the minimum number of patients is 1, the maximum 
number of patients is [ADDRESS_1183522] 10 patients.
 
Stop accrual if the number of toxicities is equal to or greater  than indicated 
(i.e., # toxicities) among the number of patients evaluated (i. e., # patients) 
# Toxicities 3-4 4-6 5-9 6-11 17-14 8-16 
# Patients 3-4 5-6 7-9 10-11 12-14 15-16 
 
Monitoring the response rate, based on the above assumptions an d monitoring will begin 
after 1 patient is treated (on an intent-to-treat basis). Follo wing this rule, the trial will be 
terminated if [# Response]/[# patients evaluated] =< 0/8.  For example, accrual will 
cease if [ADDRESS_1183523]  8 patients treated.
Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.0.0) was used to generate the tox icity and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304470]. In order to utilize the software f or the design, a beta (21, 
103) prior was assumed for the historical control response rate  and a beta (31, 93) prior 
was assumed for the historical control toxicity rate. 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851187] e rate of the Panitumumab 
was not better than 17% was 35%.  Probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851188] (i.e., 37%) were 57% when the true RR rate was 17% and 48 % when true RR was 
25%.

2  INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE                                     
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) comprise a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas that have consistently demonstrated poor outcomes when treated with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens (e.g. CHOP). When treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), the overall response rate (ORR)  for PTCL is 50 -70%, with 
a progression free survival ( PFS) of 30 -40% at 12 months  (1, 2)  and long term disease free survival 
rates of 20 -30% (2). In an attempt to improve upon these outcomes, more intensive combination 
chemotherapy approaches, such as CHOEP (CHOP with etoposide) or DA -EPOCH (dose adjusted, 
continuous infusion etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, doxorubicin, and bolus dosing of 
cyclophosphamide ), have been used. Based on retrospective and post -hoc analysis, outcomes 
appear improved in PTCL patients treated with etoposide containing regimens  (1, 3, 4). As a result, 
EPOCH has emerged as a first line chemotherapeutic option for patients with PTCL at the University of Colorado, as well as other centers (5 -8). Nevertheless, long term outcomes in patients 
with PTCL continue to be sub- optimal with current estimates of 5 -year survival of 10-30% (9).  
 Checkpoint blockade is an exciting new therapeutic approach in oncology that has improved the standard of care in multiple hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. L ess is known about the 
use of checkpoint blockade for the treatment of T cell lymphomas relative to other malignancies.  Nivolumab had a response rate of 40% in PTCL in a phase 1 study (10) . In a heavily pretreated 
advanced stage cutaneous T -cell lymphoma cohort, pembrolizumab showed an ORR of ~40% with 
meaningful durable responses (11) . Additionally, 5 out of 7 patients with relapsed/refractory 
NK/T -cell lymphoma after L -asparaginase based therapy had a complete response to 
pembrolizumab (2 PRs) (12).     Mechanistically, th ere is reason to believe that PD -1 inhibition will be effective for the treatment 
of PTCL. I n lung cancer, increased PD -L1 expression is associated with increased response rates 
to PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies  (13) . In T -cell lymphomas, PD -1 expression on tumor cells is frequent.  
For instance, 93% of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphomas (AITL) and 62% of PTCL -NOS have 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422019] 2020  
7 of 75 increased number of extrafollicular PD -1 positive cells. PD -1 expression can also be used to aid 
in the diagnosis of PTCL (14).  
 Furthermore, the microenvironment is expected to play a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of PTCL  (15) . The programmed death (PD)  pathway serves as a checkpoint to limit T -cell 
mediated immune responses. Blocking the PD -[ADDRESS_422020]. Nivolumab inhibits  the 
ligation of PD -1 and PD -L1 and would be expected to alter the microenvironment stimulating T -
cell mediated anti -tumor immune responses (16). 
  
2.[ADDRESS_422021] yet complementary  mechanisms of action. As  chemotherapy regimens like  EPOCH are effective 
(albeit with modest long- term success) for patients with PTCL, approaches that combine 
chemotherapy with PD -1/PD- L1 antibodies are appealing. Mechanistically, it has been 
demonstrated  that chemotherapy- induced apoptotic cells behave as a potent source of 
immunogenic tumor antigens for the stimulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)  (17) . It has 
subsequently been demonstrated that multiple components of the EPOCH regimen, including etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine  increase antigen presentation and MHC expression, 
thus triggering an immune response  (18, 19). Further, chemotherapy may increase the activity of 
immune effector cells such as NK cells, while also suppressing the effects of negative regulators of an immune response such as T -regulatory cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells  (20) .  
These immune -modulating effects of chemotherapy may allow for synergism with checkpoint 
blockade. Of note, it has been demonstrated that increased expression of antigens via MHC II has been correlated with response to checkpoint blockade in melanoma  (21). Similarly, loss of function 
mutations in JAK/STAT and beta -2-microglobulin proteins leading to decreased expression of 
MHC I has been associated with acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade (22). 
 
Patients receiving checkpoint blockade in later lines of therapy tend to be more de -conditioned 
and have weakened immunity  after failing prior lines of chemotherapy. In solid tumors, checkpoint 
blockade in combination with standard first line chemotherapy regimens appears to be a safe and potentially synergistic combination. For instance, the response rate for pembrolizumab plus standard of care pemetrexed/carboplatin in first line lung cancer is 57%; the response rate for chemotherapy alone was 30% (23). Of note, the response rate for second line checkpoint blockade 
in unselected non-small cell lung cancer is about 19% (24). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 75% crossover rate to PD-[ADDRESS_422022] line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

R-CHOP in B cell lymphomas (Clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). We are not 
aware of any concerning safety signals that have emerged from these studies; however, there are 
no trials on clinicaltrials.gov combining checkpoint blockade with EPOCH.     Thus, we are conducting a multi -center phase I/II study of standard of care EPOCH in combination 
with nivolumab for the first- line treatment of PTCL.

these studies have demonstrated evidence of therapeutic activity, as well as reasonable toxicity 
profiles when combining chemotherapy with PD -[ADDRESS_422026] line chemotherapy appears to be an effective and tolerable approach in multiple tumor types in preliminary investigations.  
 Nivolumab has been given to a large number of patients with diverse malignancies. As a result , 
nivolumab has a well characterized toxicity profile, outlined below. Nevertheless, the toxicity 
profile of nivolumab specifically in patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) has not been completely characterized given the small number of patients with PTCL who have received nivolumab. Further, few if any prior patients with PTCL have been treated with DA -EPOCH in 
combination with nivolumab. Thus, potential interactions of the drug components of DA -EPOCH 
with nivolumab are not yet completely characterized.   Of note, a recent pre- clinical study found that PD -[ADDRESS_422027] as a tumor suppressor and PD-1 
inhibition may  lead to proliferation of lymphoma cells in a genetic PTCL mouse model  (27). This 
pre-clinical model relied on translocation  of ITK -SYK, which has been observed in 5/46 cases of 
PTCL (28). Similarly, a recent clinical study of PD -1 immunotherapy for T -cell leukemia 
lymphoma was stopped prematurely due to rapid progression of the initial enrolled patients (29).

9 of 75 Nivolumab  Monotherapy 
MDX1106- 01 was a Phase 1, open- label, multicenter, safety and pharmacokinetic dose -escalation 
study of nivolumab (0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) in subjects with selected refractory or relapsed 
malignancies. 27 of 39 subjects received a single dose of nivolumab and 15 of those 27 received 
10 mg/kg. All subjects were followed for up to 84 days after the dose of study drug.  
The following are the key safety findings(30) :  
24 of 27 (88.9%) subjects had a drug- related AE. The most commonly reported (≥5%) drug - 
related AEs were: fatigue, lymphopenia, proteinuria, dry mouth, fever, decreased weight, pruritus, 
hypocalcemia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, TSH increased, TSH decreased, hypokalemia, myalgia, 
and rash. No drug- related AEs were serious. Most drug- related AEs were Grade 1 or 2. Nine 
(33.3%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 drug- related AEs; the most commonly reported drug- related 
AEs were CD4 lymphocytes decreased ( N=4) and lymphocyte count decreased (N=2 )(30). 
7 of 27 (25.9%) subjects had an immune -mediated adverse event. These included rash/erythema 
(N=4), pruritus (N=3 ), arthritis ( N=1), melena ( N=1), hypersensitivity ( N=1), blood bilirubin 
increased ( N=1). No immune -mediated adverse events were serious. All immune -mediated 
adverse events were Grade 1 except for the case of hypersensitivity which was Grade 2 (30).  
There was no apparent dose -related pattern with regard to the incidence, severity, or relationship 
of AEs (30).  
 Nivoluma b in C ombination with Chemotherapy: 
In CA209012, a completed, multi-arm, Phase 1 safety study of nivolumab in chemotherapy- naive 
NSCLC subjects, 56 subjects were administered nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin, pemetrexed/cisplatin, or carboplatin/paclitaxel) (31).  
 The maximum evaluated dose was 10 mg/kg of nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy. No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in any subjects receiving nivolumab + platinum-
based chemotherapy during the protocol -defined evaluation period (first 6 weeks of treatment) 
and, thus, no MTD was defined. The safety profile of nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy was manageable and consistent with that reported for nivolumab monotherapy and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy alone. No new safety concerns were identified.   The following were the key safety findings:   The most frequently reported drug- related AE with nivolumab + chemotherapy was fatigue 
(71.4%) (31).  
 Drug -related SAEs reported in more than [ADDRESS_422030] s treated with nivolumab in combination with 
chemotherapy included pneumonitis (7.1%), anemia (5.4%), febrile neutropenia (3.6%), and rash maculo -papular (3.6%) (31).  
Drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation reported in more than [ADDRESS_422031] s treated with 
nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy included pneumonitis (5.4%) and hypersensitivity (3.6%) (31).  
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422032] deaths in CA209012 were due to disease progression. There were no deaths reported due to study drug toxicity in subjects treated with nivolumab + chemotherapy(31) .  
 
PD-1 Immunotherapy in Combination with R- CHOP : 
 
An ongoing study is evaluating the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with R- CHOP 
chemotherapy. The preliminary safety results were presented at ASH 2017(26) . Safety results were 
available for the initial 14 patients. Of these, median age is 62 (range 38 -72); NCCN -IPI [INVESTIGATOR_340971], 
low-int, and high- int, and high in 2,6,6, and 0 pts respectively. 2/9 tested are double -expressers  
(MYC IHC >40%, BCL2 IHC>50%), and no patients  have double hit (now high- grade B -cell) 
lymphoma. 
 Eleven grade [ADDRESS_422033] occurred, in 7 unique patients (7/14 patients, 
50%). Eight serious adverse events occurred in 5 patients; none met criteria for reporting as an unanticipated event. One death occurred in the first accrued patient who had extensive gastric involvement by [CONTACT_341010] 1 of RCHOP of bleeding from the responding tumor bed despi[INVESTIGATOR_340972]. Two probable imm une-related adverse events were 
seen: grade 3 rash, resolving with steroid and not recurring on continuation of pembrolizumab and grade 1 hyperthyroidism. No instances of pneumonitis were observed, and no serious immune -
related adverse events were seen.  
 
 
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Nivolumab has demonstrated evidence of clinical activity in multiple malignancies, including in 
early phase studies of PTCL  (10, 12). Nivolumab may increase the likelihood of improved 
outcomes in patients with PTCL, though further studies are needed.  The risks to participants  are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to participants and/or 
society, and in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result, thereby [CONTACT_135858]: 
 
• To Participant: Potential to improve management of malignancy. 
• To Society: Impro ved understanding of the role of nivolumab in the 
management of PTCL.  
• Justify the importance of the knowledge gained: PD -1 immunotherapy has led 
to improved outcomes in patients with a large number of malignancies, 
including melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer, H odgkin’s disease, and others.  
However, there is a relative paucity of information regarding the efficacy of 
PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with PTCL. This protocol will provide

11 of 75 valuable insights into the potential role of nivolumab in the management of 
PTCL.  
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Primary objective s:   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study to  measure the efficacy of nivolumab when given in combination with dose 
adjusted EPOCH for the first line management of peripheral T cell lymphoma.   
 
Secondary objectives:   
Progression free survival (PFS) , overall response rate (CR + PR) , toxicity/safety  and duration of 
response.  Correlative analysis:    
Determine immune -related predictors of response to nivolumab plus EPOCH chemotherapy. 
 
Rationale for correlative analysis: Data is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_340973]. Further, dynamic changes in peripheral blood and tumor immune profiling also associate with response to immunotherapy; however, less is known about predictive correlates associated with T -cell lymphomas, especially 
in patients receiving checkpoint blockade in combination with chemotherapy.

scan to be obtained after [ADDRESS_422044] achieved a complete remissio n but will be considered non-responders. 
  
4.2.2 S ECONDARY  ENDPOINT S 
 Two-year PFS (32). PFS is defined as time from enrollment to PD or death of any cause. Living 
patients without PD who are  lost to follow up will have their information censored at date of most 
recent tumor assessment . Overall response rate is defined as the rate of complete responses + 
partial responses. Minor responses will not count towards the overall response rate. Duration of response is defined as time elapsed from initial evidence of either a PR or CR, until patient is found to have disease progression or death . Toxi city and tolerability will be monitored, and adverse 
events will be quantified.  
[ADDRESS_422045] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Ability  to sign and dat e the consent form. 
2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of 
the study. 
3. Be a male or female aged  18-80. 
4. Histologically confirmed new diagnosis of Stage II, III or  IV Peripheral T -cell Non -
Hodgkin’s lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
(ALK negative) (ALK positive if IPI 3, 4, or 5), Angioimmunoblastic T -cell lymphoma, 
Enteropathy associated T -cell lymphoma (MEITL and EATL), H epatosplenic T-cell 
lymphoma, γ/δ T-cell lymphoma , Subcutaneous panniculitis like T- cell lymphoma, and 
Nodal T- cell lymphomas with T -follicular helper phenotype.

Skin lesions can be used as measurable disease provided bi -dimensional measurements are 
possible. Patients with non -measurable but evaluable disease may be eligible after 
discussion with the PI. Abnormal PET/CT scan s will not constitute evaluable disease, 
unless verified by [CONTACT_341013], CT scan, or other appropriate imaging.  
10. For w omen of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent ( refrain  from 
heterosexual intercourse)  or use of contraceptive methods that r esult in a failure rate of <

identifie d cause other than menopause), and has
 not undergone surgical ster ilization 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus) . Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of < 1%  per year include bilateral tub al ligation , male sterilization , hormonal 
contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices and copper 
intrauterine devices . The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to 
the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usua l lifestyle of the patient. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods)  and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Nivolumab  
Preparation and storage: 
Vials of nivolumab injection must be stored at 2°C to 8 °C (36°F to 46°F) and protected from light 
and freezing. Nivolumab injection is to be administered as an IV infusion through a 0.2- micron to 
1.2-micronpore size, low -protein binding (polyethersulfone membrane) in- line filter at the 
protocol- specified doses and infusion times. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus 
injection. When the dose is based on patient weight ( i.e., mg/kg), nivolumab injection can be 
infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% Dextrose 
Injection, to concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. When the dose is fixed (e.g., 240 mg, 360 mg, or 480 mg flat dose), nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exceed a total infusion volume of [ADDRESS_422057] does not contain 
any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin containers and infusion sets, and glass bottles. Further details regarding preparation and administration of Nivolumab can be located in the current investigator brochure or package insert.  Known potential toxicities:

18 of 75 Nivolumab vials of 100mg, 10 mg/ mL (10 mL) , will be supplied by [CONTACT_414] -Meyers Squibb 
(BMS ).  
 
Nursing guidelines:  
• Severe infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials of nivolumab. In case of a severe or life -threatening infusion reaction, the nivolumab infusion must be discontinued 
and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients with mild or moderate infusion reaction may receive nivolumab with close monitoring and use of premedication according to local treatment guidelines for prophylaxis of infusion reactions. Instruct patient to take prednisone after and close to meals. To prevent sleep disruption and restlessness, avoid taking prednisone at bedtime. A mild sedative may be needed. 
• Monitor for signs/symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, 
immune -mediated colitis, pneumonitis, rash/dermatologic toxicity, and encephalitis 
(changes in neurologic function). 
Concurrent drug therapy issues:  
• Drug -drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose 
or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative 
therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information. 
• Potential lack of benefit in treating PTCL, or the addition of nivolumab to standard of 
care chemotherapy may even lead to inferior outcomes. 
• Patients undergoing allogeneic transplant after receiving nivolumab may have 
complications, some of which could be fatal. Such complications including severe 
graft versus host disease, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, lymphocytic encephalitis, 
and others have occurred.  
• Patients with pre -existing auto- immune conditions may experience flares as a result 
of receiving nivolumab. Such flares may be severe and irreversible, or mild and 
reversible.  
 
Dose Adjusted EPOCH:  
Please refer to CALGB [ZIP_CODE] protocol for detailed instructions regarding preparation and administration of EPOCH 
Body Surface Area (BSA) Calculations : 
Dosage calculations will be based on the patient’s BSA at baseline, recommend using Mosteller 
formula. Actual height and weight should be used in determining body surface area. Dose adjustments at the beginning of each cycle do not need to be made unless t here has been a >10% 
weight gain or loss.   Requirement for Venous Access:  
Central venous access is required for protocol participation. A previously placed central venous access device that is functioning properly (free infusion of saline, unimpeded blood return, good condition of external appliance, no recent history of device infection or thrombosis) can be used. Should the patient need a new central venous access device, an implanted port central venous

Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422059] 2020  
19 of 75 access device should be placed (e.g. Power Port) or peripherally inserted central venous catheter 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) after appropriate informed consent has been obtained. Other aspects of catheter/port management will be in accordance with standard nursing clinic cent ral venous port procedures.  
 Prophylaxis:   Pre and post medications as prescribed by [CONTACT_1963].   Intrathecal chemotherapy:  
Treatment or prophylaxis for secondary CNSL is not required by [CONTACT_760]. Patients should be treated per institutional guidelines.    Tumor lysis precaution, per institutional guidelines:  
Patients considered to be at risk for tumor lysis should be well hydrated and treated with allopurinol or a suitable alternative for [ADDRESS_422060] infusion of chemotherapy.  
 Prophylactic Anti- Emetic Premedication:  
Standard antiemetic prophylaxis will be given per institutional guidelines. Note: EPOCH is 
considered moderately ematogenic and nivolumab has minimal ematogenicity.   
Cyclophosphamide  
Preparation and storage:  Injectable powder is stored at room temperature. The temperature is not to exceed 90°F. Reconstituted parenteral solutions are stable for 24 hours at room temperature or six days if refrigerated. Dissolve the 100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, 1 gm, and 2 gm vials in 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mL of sterile water, respectively, resulting in a solution of 20 mg/mL. Shake vials vigorously. The lyophilized form is more easily solubilized. Further details regarding preparation and administration of cyclophosphamide can be located in the current investigator brochure or package insert.  
 Known potential toxicities:

• Advise patient of possible strong metallic taste associated with cyclophosphamide and 
suggest hard candy with a strong flavor (cinnamon, peppermint) to alleviate it. 
• Administer antiemetics as necessary to minimize nausea and vomiting, which usually occurs 6 -8 hours after administration  and can continue up to 5 days. 
• Report and record any complaint of lightheadedness, facial “heat sensation”, or diaphoresis during administration. 
• Corticosteroids, phenothiazine, imipramine, and allopurinol may inhibit Cytoxan 
metabolism and modify its effect. They may also increase bone marrow suppression.  
 
Etoposide  
Background:   
Etoposide has been shown to delay transit of cells through the S phase and arrest cells in late S or early G2 phase. The drug may inhibit mitochondrial transport at the NADH dehydrogenase level or inhibit uptake of nucleosides into HeLa cells. It is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and appears to cause D NA strand breaks. Etoposide does not inhibit microtubular assembly. 
 Formulation:   
Commercially available for injection as: Injection, solution: 20 mg/mL (5 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL)   Preparation, storage, and stability:   
Refer to package insert for complete preparation and dispensing instructions. Store intact vials at room temperature of 25ºC (77ºF); do not freeze. Protect from light. Etoposide should be diluted to a concentration of 0.2 -0.4 mg/mL in D5W or NS for adminis tration  (avoid concentrations >0.4 
mg/mL) . Diluted solutions have concentration- dependent stability; more concentrated solutions 
have shorter stability times. Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_340979] r with concentrations >0.4 mg/mL. Following 
dilution 0.9% Sodium Chloride or D5W to concentrations of 0.2-0.4 mg/mL, drug is chemically stable for 96 and 24 hours at room temperature, respectively.   Pharmacokinetic information: Distribution: V
d: 7-171 L/m2; poor penetration across the blood- brain barrier; CSF 
concentrations <5% of plasma concentrations Protein binding: 94% to 98% Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 and 3A5, to various metabolites. Half-life elimination: Terminal  4-11 hours 
Excretion: Urine (56%; 45% as unchanged drug) within 120 hours; feces (44%) within 120 hours  Potential Drug Interactions:  
• Metabolism/Transport Effects: Substrate  of CYP1A2 (minor), CYP2E1 (minor), 
CYP3A4 (major), P-glycoprotein; Inhibits  CYP2C9 (weak), 3A4 (weak)

administration. Pre -medicate with antiemetics as ordered and monitor for their 
effectiveness.  
• Instruct patient in importance of maintaining adequate hydration to avoid hyperuricemia. 
• Monitor liver function tests. 
• Etoposide solution is oil based and settles to bottom of bag or drip chamber. Be sure to 
agitate bag to avoid reaction to concentrated solution. Reaction would include flushing, shortness of breath, back pain, and anxiety. 
• Advise patient that facial flushing is common and may occur even after administration. 
• Monitor INR closely in patients on warfarin therapy, as etoposide may increase prothrombin (PT) time. 
• May increase the toxicity of methotrexate or cyclosporine when given concurrently. 
 
Doxorubicin  
Preparation and storage:   
Doxorubicin vials must be protected from light  and kept  at room temperature. Doxorubicin PFS

Nursing guidelines:  
• Check CBC and platelet counts. Monitor for signs of infection, bleeding, and anemia. 
• Advise patient that their urine may turn pi[INVESTIGATOR_340981] 24 hours after administration of the drug. 
• Doxorubicin is a vesicant. Check IV potency before and frequently during administration. If extravasation occurs, refer to institutional extravasation policy. 
• Hair loss occurs 2 -4 weeks after initial injection and can be complete. Regrowth begins 2-
3 months after discontinuation. 
• Beware of doxorubicin “flare” that can occur during administration. The reaction consists 
of an erythematous streak up the vein receiving the infusion. Adjacent veins may also 
demonstrate red streaks. Urticaria and pruritus can be associated with the react ion. The use 
of corticosteroids and/or antihistamines has been helpful. 
• Administer antiemetics to minimize nausea and vomiting.  
• Assess for alterations in mucous membranes. Stomatitis occurs within [ADDRESS_422066] 3 
days. Carafate slurry may be useful. Adequate nutritional counseling is important. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_340982]. Advise patient that 
there is often significant malaise and fatigue 1 -2 weeks after injection.  
• Doxorubicin may potentiate toxicity of other antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It has reportedly exacerbated cyclophosphamide - induced hemorrhagic cystitis. 
• Assess heart and lung sounds. Monitor vital signs (resting pulse). Be alert to early signs of cardiotoxicity  (i.e., dyspnea, steady weight gain, nonproductive cough, arrhythmias, 
tachycardia, and pulmonary rales). 
• Document dose s, total should not exceed maximum cumulative dose  (550 mg/m2 or 450

6.1.1 DOSING SCHEDULES  
INDUCTION 
 Patients will receive  a planned  6 cycles of therapy (or 5 cycles if patient received a cycle of 
chemotherapy prior to enrollment) before having an autologous stem cell transplant or surveillance.  
 Each cycle is  21 days, +/- 3 days . Nivolumab (360 mg) will be given on day 1 concurrent ly with 
chemotherapy, including for cycles that are delayed beyond 21 days. Unless there is a planned 
delay (e.g. for low blood counts) , the start of chemotherapy should be within [ADDRESS_422069] protocols derived from CALGB [ZIP_CODE] with the 
exception s outlined in this protocol. 
 All patients will begin treatment at dose level -1.

5. Each “day” of the chemotherapy regimen  EPOCH represents an approximate 24 hour infusion; however, each day 
may not finish until the subsequent day. (i.e. day 2 chemo may end on day 3, day 3 on day 4, etc. ). These alterations 
from schedule should not be considered protocol deviations and are expected.   
6. Within 24 -72 hours after completing chemotherapy. Alternatively , can administer filgrastim 480 mcg subcutaneous  
daily from Day 6 until ANC > 5000 after the nadir (nadir usually between Days 10 -12) or for 10 days (Days  6-15) if 
the ANC is not being monitored, during every cycle.  Substitutions with generic or biosimilar growth factors are 
permitted.  
7. Nivolumab treatment will always be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_341016]. There is no study -directed window 
between completion of Nivolumab administration and start of EPOCH administration.  
  
Dose adjustments listed in table below (and modified from CALGB [ZIP_CODE])  for subsequent cycles  
of EPOCH will be determined by [CONTACT_341017] (ANC) or platelet nadir (below adjustments are based on twice weekly CBC).    
° If nadir ANC is greater or equal to 500, increase the EPOCH dose level  by 20%.  
° If nadir ANC is less than 500 on 1 or 2 measurements, then continue EPOCH at the same 
dose level.  
° If nadir ANC is less than [ADDRESS_422072] 3 measurements (3- 4 days apart), then decrease  
the EPOCH dose level 20%. 
 OR 
 
° If nadir platelet count is less than 25,000 on 1 measurement, then decrease the EPOCH 
dose level  by 20%. 
 Begin each cycle of EPCOH chemotherapy when ANC is greater than  or equal to 1000 and 
platelets are greater than  or equal to 100,000  (unless low due to bone marrow infiltration

- If patient ’s counts recover by [CONTACT_4475] 28 or sooner, dose adjustments  for EPOCH should be 
made as outlined above.   - If patient’s counts recover on day 29 or later, reduce DA -EPOCH to next lower dose level 
and hold nivolumab for subsequent cycle. Then, may resume nivolumab with subsequent 
cycle at the same lower dose level  of EPOCH . If delayed count recovery (e .g. by [CONTACT_4475] 29 or

adjustments to DA -EPOCH and permanently discontinue nivolumab. 
- If patient ’s counts are low (eg. ANC <1000 or platelets <100 at day 21) due to marrow 
involvement by [CONTACT_4623], next cycle can resume without delay  or dose reduction. EPOCH  
can be delayed or  reduced per investigator discretion. 
 
Additional  adjustments for  severe cytopenias  attributed to nivolumab and not EPOCH : For 
hematologic nadirs: ANC<500 for ≥7 days or PLT<25,000 for ≥7 days: For first occurrence hold nivolumab with next   cycle and make necessary standard dose reductions . If hematologic recovery 
is not delayed with this cycle, then may resume nivolumab with subsequent cycle. If this occurs a 
second time after patient resumed nivolumab, make standard dose adjustments and permanently 
discontinue nivolumab.  Dose levels, as originally described in CALGB [ZIP_CODE].

After the initial two cycles, if  it’s felt by [CONTACT_341019] a dose increase of EPOCH would be 
detrimental to the patient, chemotherapy doses can be maintained without dose escalation. Similarly, if the investigator feels it is in the best interest of the patient dose levels can be decreased.  
If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  
Omit = The current dose(s) during a cycle is skipped. The patient does not make up the omitted 
dose(s) at a later time.

reaction, withhold nivolumab and administer systemic corticosteroids. Consider increasing the corticosteroid dose (and/or other immunosuppressants) if there is no improvement or if toxicity worsens. Begin corticosteroid taper when adverse reaction improves to below grade 1 and continue taper over approximately 1 month. For adverse reactions that do not result in permanent 
discontinuation, when improved to grade 1 ( or lower ) and the cor ticosteroid dose is reduced to ≤ 10 
mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), resume nivolumab with subsequent cycles.

34 of 75 7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE  
7.1 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS  
• PET/CT:  A PET/CT scan is done at baseline as part of the initial staging evaluation, and 
at the end of therapy to confirm the response. For patients that had already been treated 
with [ADDRESS_422089] or PET/CT is required within [ADDRESS_422090]  or 
PET/CT response assessment will also be done between cycle 2 and  cycle 3 of EPOCH + 
nivolumab ( if the patient received  [ADDRESS_422091] and 4th cycles 
of all chemotherapy , and between cycles 2 and 3 of EPOCH + nivolumab). PET- CT should 
also be performed within [ADDRESS_422092] or PET/CT (per investigator ’s discretion)  at D+100  (+/- 14 days) , but PET/CT would 
be preferred if not in a CR after cycle 6.
 
 
• Bone Marrow Biopsy:  A restaging bone marrow biopsy may be done if a staging bone 
marrow biopsy was previously positive or if symptoms suggest involvement. Restaging may also include MRI, if clinically indicated. 
 
 
• Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation:  After 6 courses, and if transplant 
eligible, patients can proceed to autologous hematopoietic  cell transplantation per 
investigator’s discretion. Auto-HCT will be performed per institutional guidelines.  
 
• Post-Trial Assessments: Patients who go off study treatment at any time during the trial 
will complete end of treatment assessments per section 7.3.6. For all patients, drug- related 
SAEs and AEs will be followed until baseline or ≤ grade [ADDRESS_422093]- trial assessments.
 
 
• Clinical Evaluations:  Patients should be seen and evaluated by [CONTACT_341020] 7 
days prior to start of every chemotherapy cycle, and patients should be evaluated by a 
provider or nurse no more than 48 hours prior to every chemotherapy cycle.   
 
7.1.1 R ESPONSE  ASSESSMENT  
Response to therapy will be classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), early death , or not evaluable. Response assessment will be 
obtained between  cycle 2 and cycle 3  of EPOCH + nivolumab and after cycle  6 as outlined in 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422094] 2020  
35 of 75 treatment plan  (For patients that got [ADDRESS_422095] of care chemotherapy prior to enrolling in 
study, then response assessment is between cycles 3 and 4 of all induction chemotherapy and 
between cycles 2 and 3 of study EPOCH + nivolumab).  If patients discontinue therapy due to a 
toxic event this will not also be counted towards the efficacy endpoint unless objective progressive 
disease is documented.  Patients with a complete response based on end of treatment imaging 
assessment, but subsequently develop rapid progression within [ADDRESS_422096] portion of the PET/CT if possible, or MRI scans where applicable . Measurement of disease burden 
will be from sum of longest diameters (SLD). A maximum of three target lesions will be followed.  Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner
 similar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that is only assessable  
– but not measurable by [CONTACT_341021] (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions)  – will be recorded 
as present or absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_341022]. Response is based on the CT component of 
PET/CT (as below) , CT alone, or MRI where applicable. Response assessment will be performed 
by [CONTACT_341023].

assign PD directly. New smaller but suspi[INVESTIGATOR_340985], and if later confirmed (by [CONTACT_341024]) as being due to lymphoma, the documented date of progression should be the date of when it was first identified as equivocal . 
 Complete Response (CR)  
CR is defined as a complete resolution of all target lesions by [CONTACT_341025] -PET uptake in all areas (Deauville score of 1 –3), 
and bone marrow biopsy negativity (if it was positive or unknown at baseline). If pretreatment PET scan was negative, lymph nodes that measured 15 mm in the long axis should regress to < [ADDRESS_422100] scan criteria (reduction in sum of longest diameters by [CONTACT_341026] >30%) with normalization (Deauville score 1– 3) of FDG -PET activity in FDG -
avid lymphoma.  
 Normalizing of FDG -PET imaging alone is not sufficient by [CONTACT_341027] a significant (>30%) decrease in the sum of diameters. Accordingly, a reduction in the sum of diameters by ≤ 30% with normalization of FDG -PET uptake should not be considered a CR unless 
documented by a negative tissue biopsy.  
  If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679],
 the infiltrate must 
have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this 
determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). 
If the sample is indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by 
[CONTACT_9064]. A sample that is negative by [CONTACT_341028] a small population of clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_341029]:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422101] may shrink the long axis of a target lymph node to a normal value of <10 mm. However, even though the lymph node is now within normal size range, consistent with CR, the percentage of diameter reduction may be <30% (less than a PR). In these cases, a normalized diameter of “0, or resolved” should be used to calculate the sum of diameters, and therefore ensuring accurate response designation. Patients in CR but with rapid 
progression within 6 weeks of end of treatment scan will not be considered a CR, but rather will be considered a PD.  
Criteria for Partial Response (PR)  – the designation of PR requires all of the following: 
PR is defined as a reduction of the sum of longest diameters of target lesions by 30%, but without meeting the definition of CR described above. If one or more target lesions grew in size but the sum of the diameters remains ≤ 30% of the baseline measurement, and no new lesions appear, the response should be designated PR. This definition will eliminate the false interpretation of disease progression due to treatment- related inflammatory flares.  Patients in CR but with 
rapid progression within 6 weeks of end of treatment scan will not be considered a CR, but rather will be considered a PD.  
Criteria for Stable Disease (SD)  
  A patient is
 considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed 
for a CR or PR (see above) but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see 
below).   
Progressive D isease (PD) 
  Consistent with Deauville  criteria , and using a unidimensional tumor measurement, 
PD after initiating a new therapy is defined as an increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions by >20%, and/or appearance of a new lesion (lymph node or a soft tissue mass [ADDRESS_422102] diameter), irrespective of FDG -
PET results. Whenever possible, questionable small FDG-PET avid lesions should be confirmed by a histologic or cytologic analysis. Appearance of a new FDG -PET 
avid lesion that is smaller th an the above thresholds should be closely monitored, 
and whenever possible, a biopsy should be performed to determine its nature. An increase in the size of previously involved small lymph nodes by >20% while other lesions are decreasing, especially at the beginning of treatment with investigational 
agents, may represent a tumor flare and should not be designated a PD, unless there is continued increase in size on subsequent imaging studies. Patients should be allowed to remain on trial at investigators and  patient discretion  (eg if patient is not 
showing signs of symptomatic progression or deterioration)  until the response or 
lack thereof is clarified on subsequent imaging. When treating clinicians are 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_340986], repeat imaging should be obtained 4- 8 weeks after initial 
indeterminate scan to help make the diagnosis of flare versus PD.

38 of 75  
Relapsed D isease    
  After an initial response, and in the absence of appearance of new lesions, PD is defined as an increase of the nadir sum of diameters by >20%. Consistent with Deauville  criteria, patients who achieve a CR (normalization of all lymph node 
measurements and disappearance of extranodal lesions), at least one previously involved lymph node should increase in size to measure [ADDRESS_422104] diameter from 8 to 13 mm is not considered a PD, even though there is 38% increase in the measurement, since the lesion did not exceed 15 mm. Similarly, a change from 12 to 16 mm does not qualify as a PD even though the new measurement exceeds 15 mm, since the absolute increase was < [ADDRESS_422105] to progression -free survival (PFS). Progression -free survival 
is defined as time from therapy until relapse, progression, or death from any cause.    
7.2 LABORATORY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS  
Local laboratory assessments as specified  on the schedule of events table will include the 
following: 
• Hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing will include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti -HBs), and antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen 
(anti-HBc). If a subject is anti -HBc or HBsAg positive, then a quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction test to measure viral DNA load  will be done. 
• Testing for HCV (testing for antibody; if positive then quantitative polymerase chain reaction test to measure viral DNA load), HIV, and HTLV will be performed per institutional guidelines.  
• EBV PCR will be performed in EBV+ subset. 
• Hematology: Complete Blood C ount (CBC) with absolute differential , including 
hematocrit,  hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC) with differential, and platelet 
count. 
• Chemistry : Comprehensive Metabolic Panel including albumin, alkaline  phosphatase, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT), bilirubin  
(total and direct) , calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose,
 phosphorous, potassium, sodium, 
total protein, serum urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN), LDH and uric acid.  
• Thyroid function tests will include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4). 
• Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) will be estimated using the Cockcroft- Gault  
formula by [CONTACT_12115]: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 – age) (weight [kg]) / 72 (serum 
creatinine [mg/dL]; for females, the formula is multiplied by 0.85 (Cockcroft, 1976).

7.3.2 INDUCTION TREATMENT WITH NIVOLUMAB  + CHEMO THERAPY  
 
Cycle 1 – Cycle 6 
 Chemotherapy should be started within 3 days of day 1 for each 21- day cycle.  
  NOTE:  If patient has been given one cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP)  prior to 
enrollment , this cycle of treatment will count toward the 6 cycles of treatment given in the study, 
and thus would be starting at Cycle 2.  Thus, patients will receive no more than 6 total cycles of 
induction treatment.  
 If screening assessments are performed within 48 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1, safety laboratory and physical examinations need not be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1.  Upon starting treatment, patients will be seen and evaluated by t reating provider within 7 days 
prior to day 1 of every cycle. All laboratory, safety, and physical examinations should be performed  by a provider or nurse  within 48 hours of the start of every cycle  (e.g. within 48 hours 
of the start of chemotherapy).

Patients undergoing autologous transplant will undergo clinical and laboratory evaluation according to standard of care subsequent to end of induction treatment visit.  A CT or PET/CT 
should be obtained according to standard of care every 3 months (+/ - 14 days) until [ADDRESS_422121] 
transplant. While encouraged, it is not mandatory to obtain imaging every 3 months if patients achieve complete metabolic response after completi on of cycle 6. The end of treatment visit will 
be at D+100 (+/- 14 days) after the transplant date. Patients will then enter LTFU.   
  
7.3.5 END OF TREATMENT  (FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRANSPLANT OR THOSE WHO 
DO NOT COMPLETE 6 CYCLES OF TREATMENT)  
 This visit will be completed  for subjects who are withdrawn  from treatment for any reason as 
soon as possible after the decision to permanently discontinue  treatment has been made.  This visit 
applies to patients who stop treatment for any reason prior to completing all treatment OR if a 
patient goes on to get an autologous stem cell transplant , then they would complete the E nd of

Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422122] 2020  
45 of 75 Treatment visit 100 days after their transplant (see calendar  for details ). If a patient decision to 
withdraw the patient from treatment occurs at a specific time point in the protocol (ex: at the 
scheduled End of Induction visit  a patient comes of f treatment due to PD) then that time point 
would be considered the EOT visit.   The following evaluations will b e performed at the EOT  visits: 
 
• History and physical examina tion with vital signs and  weight  
 
• Adverse Event assessment

oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in t he preceding 24 consecutive months).  
4. Central review of pathology is required for confirmation of diagnosis. Completion of central pathology review is not required prior to registration for patients; however, materials for central review must be submitted within  30 days  after 
registration. Pathology material: H&E stain and IHC slides or a representative FFPE tissue block from initial diagnosis, including additional material for correlative analysis. Please NOTE: the diagnostic H&E slide and IHC slides will be 
returned af ter review. In addition, patients whose tissue is not available may still be eligible to go on trial if they choose to 
have an SOC biopsy prior to treatment . 
5. PT/INR assessment frequency (for patients on Coumadin) is per investigator discretion to keep within therapeutic range.  
6. Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible.    
7. Imaging should be obtained per standard of care and NCCN guidelines. PET/CT is mandatory pre- and post -treatment. 
Interim CT may be adequate to assess disease response; however, PET/CT is preferred. Note that we generally recommend interim scan be performed prior to 3rd cycle of study chemotherapy; for patients that got [ADDRESS_422127] interim scan be performed prior to cycle 3 of EPOCH + 
nivolumab  (Thus, for patients who received [ADDRESS_422128] cycle of nivolumab + EPOCH).  
8. Imaging must be done ≤ [ADDRESS_422129] of care and only mandatory in the setting of unexplained 
cytopenias. However, bone marrow biopsies are highly encouraged, especially in the setting of cytopenias. If screening bone marrow biopsy is indicated, it should be done ≤ 6 weeks prior to study registration.  
10. Screening bone marrow biopsy and/or CSF analysis will be performed if clinically indicated (for screening: must be performed ≤6 weeks prior to study registration).  Since the chemotherapy requires dose adjustment based on hematologic 
toxicity it is strongly encouraged to obtain a bone marrow biopsy prior to treatment but can be omitted in select situations after discussion with the study chair.  
11. 12-lead single electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded.  
12. MUGA or ECHO.  
13. A lumbar puncture and cytologic examination of the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_340989]. (Secondary CNSL is not an exclusion criteria).

19. If bone marrow positive at diagnosis, a r epeat bone marrow biopsy must be done to confirm CR. Can be delayed to end of 
treatment response assessment or done in parallel with interim response assessment. If interim bone marrow biopsy is negative for disease, it will be repeated at the discretion of the treating physician.  
20. During the induction treatment, patients will dose according to section 6.1.[ADDRESS_422134] be done 2 times per week (i.e., twice during every 7-day period, starting with Day 1)  at 
least one day apart, but ideally [ADDRESS_422135] or PET/CT should be obtained according to standard of 
care every 3 months (+/ - 14 days) until 1- year post -transplant. While highly encouraged, it is not mandatory to obtain 
imaging every 3 months if patients achieve complete metabolic response after completion of cycle 6.  
25. If the patient elects to undergo autologous transplant, at D+100 (+/- 14 days) response evaluation is required with CT or 
PET/CT (per investigator’s discretion), but PET/CT would be preferred if not in a CR after cycle 6. This visit will also be

26. An end of treatment visit will  be completed for the subjects who are withdrawn from treatment  early,  for any 
reason, as soon as possible after the decision to permanently discontinue treatment has been made. For 
patients who undergo autologous transplant, the end of treatment visits will be D+100 (+/ - 14 days) post auto-
transplant . 
27. Patients who have had a PET -CT within the last  21 days  will not require a repeat scan.  
28. The long- term follow -up (LTFU)  period begins after the EOT visit. All patients on LTFU will be contact[CONTACT_162150] 3

All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the 
case report forms (CRFs). For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed  only by a properly authorized/ licensed clinician. Medications reported in 
the CRF are concomitant prescription medications, over -the- counter medications, and non-
prescription medications.  In addition, examples of acceptable methods of contraception include the following (also listed in section 5.1): 
° Bilateral tube ligation  
° Male sterilization  
° Hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation 
° Hormone- releasing intrauterine devices  
° Copper intrauterine devices 
NOTE: Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of contraception. 
 Involved site radiation therapy (ISRT): ISRT does not have a proven role for the management of PTCL and will not be allowed during induction(33) or as consolidation for patients in complete 
response treated in this protocol. If patients have residual disease after induction chemotherapy 
and opt not to undergo an autologous transplant, consolidative radiation will be permitted after discussion with the study chair.    
7.5.1 PRECAUTIONARY MEDICATIONS, TREATMENTS, AND PROCEDURES  
° Antiemetics may be used at the discretion of the attending physician. 
° Tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis will be used at the discretion of the treating physician.  
° Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and following institutional policies and recommendations. Pegfilgrastim support will be given with each cycle. Treat as needed.  
° Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study. This includes blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions.  
° All blood products and concomitant medications such as anti -diarrheals, analgesics, and/or 
antiemetics received from the first day of study treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical records.

51 of 75 ° Treatment with immuno -suppressive medications, except as used to treat drug- related 
adverse events, will not be permitted unless discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_248581].   
° Patients will also not be allowed to be treated with any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy, including chemotherapy, non- palliative radiotherapy, and Chinese medications used for 
cancer treatment.   
° Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, articular, intra -nasal corticosteroids are permitted. A brief (<3 w eeks) 
course of steroids is permitted for purposes of prophylaxis ( e.g. contrast) or treatment of 
non-auto-immune conditions (e.g. anaphylaxis). 
 Treatment needs to be administered in collaboration with an oncology trained pharmacist .  
Drugs that have interactions with standard of care EPOCH  or nivolumab  should be used 
with caution or avoided as per institutional guidelines.    
7.7 PROPHYLACTIC MEDICATIONS, TREATMENTS, AND PROCEDURES  
Prophylactic medications, treatments and procedures should be performed according to institutional guid elines. This includes prophylactic antibiotics, anti -fungals, or PJP prophylaxis. 
We strongly encourage prophylactic antibacterial and antifungal for 10 days after EPOCH (e.g. 
levofloxacin 500 mg daily and fluconazole 400 mg daily) and continuous antiviral prophylaxis (e.g. acyclovir 400 mg BID or valacyclovir 500 mg daily) for [ADDRESS_422142] of care. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_340990]. Inquiries regarding handling of adverse events

52 of 75 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS  
 
8.1.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
A non- serious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
Laboratory Test Abnormalities: All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following institutional 
procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such.  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately: 
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or interrupted 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_9673] ( e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
  Overdose:  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE.  
 
 Other Safety Considerations:  Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, X -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non -serious or  serious AE, 
as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

53 of 75 8.1.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE  below) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e .g. pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as an SAE (e.g. death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
The following are NOT  considered serious adverse events:  
° A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
° Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
° Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
° Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy) 
° Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422145] 2020  
54 of 75 ° Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
° Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs 
 
 
8.1.3 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UAP)  
 
The Office of Human Research Protection ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving 
risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the parti cipant 
population being studied. 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_341034]). 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
This study will use the OHRP definition of UAP.     
8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
8.2.1 SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For AEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used 
to describe severity.  
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.

Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422146] 2020  
55 of 75 8.2.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY AGENT  
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following: 
Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and 
the AE.  The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) 
 
8.2.3 EXPECTED  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
The study investigator s will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent.  
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/ stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UAPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.  Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

consent is obtained (for SAEs) or  from initiation of study treatment (AEs) until [ADDRESS_422148] day of study treatment . At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence 
of AE/ SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution 
or stabilization.  
  
8.[ADDRESS_422149]. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) 
Adverse events will be documented in clinic notes at all scheduled visits. Adverse events will be 
graded by [CONTACT_341035] C TCAE v5 .0. 
 NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or final 
study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [ e.g., IND US trial] as 
part of an annual reporting requirement. The collection of non- serious AE information should 
begin at initiation of the study . All non- serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be 
treatment -related) should be collected continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_422150] dose of study treatment.  
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious. Follow -up is also required for non- serious AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
 
8.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI), and new cancer are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
1) Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
i) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
ii) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_422151], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase) 
AND  
iii) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

58 of 75 If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. The sponsor must notify FDA and all participating PIs  in an IND safety report of potential serious 
risks  as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines 
that the information qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).  The sponsor must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse reactions as soon 
as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  The study clinician will complete an SAE Form within the following timelines: 
• All deaths and immediately life -threatening events, whether related or unrelated, will be 
recorded on the SAE Form and submitted to the study sponsor within [ADDRESS_422157] information. 
• Other SAEs, regardless of relationship, will be submitted to the study sponsor within 72 
hours of site awareness.  
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_340991]. Other supporting documentation of the event may be 
requested by [CONTACT_8704].   The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
 Overdose:  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE.  
  
8.4.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UAPs require the creation and completion of a UAP report form. It is the site PI ’s responsibility to report UAPs to their IRB, using the IRB’s 
standard UAP form. The Lead PI  [INVESTIGATOR_340992], if 
applicable. If an IRB UAP  form is not provided, the UAP  report will include the following 
information: 
• Protocol- identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
PI:   [INVESTIGATOR_340968] #:   18- 0708  
Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422158] 2020

outcome represents a UAP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UAP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UAPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:  
• UAPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the D SMC  within 5 calendar 
days of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
• Any other UAP will be reported to the IRB and to the DSMC  within [ADDRESS_422159] exposure (including during at least [ADDRESS_422160] dose of a potentially fetotoxic, non-genotoxic 
therapy ) the investigational product will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner 
(e.g., dose tapering if necessary for participant).  
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555] of this event via either the 
CIOMS  in accordance with SAE reporting procedures, as listed in section 8.4.2. 
Protocol- required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
participant.  
Follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the CIOMS, 
MedWatch, BMS Pregnancy Surveillance Form, or approved site SAE form. A BMS Pr egnancy 
Surveillance Form may be provided upon request. 
8.5 STUDY HALTING RULES  
Toxicity  
If any patient experiences death due to an adverse event that is assessed as related to study 
treatment (by [CONTACT_65423]/or Sponsor), it will lead to temporary hold of study pending review 
by [CONTACT_15328]. 
Toxicities of special interest:  The study will be halted prematurely if [ADDRESS_422161] : For patients undergoing auto-transplant 
the study will be halted prematurely if 3 out of  initial 10 patients undergoing auto-transplant

Version Date:  Version [ADDRESS_422162] during period from start of 
conditioning regimen (e.g. BEAM) through [ADDRESS_422163]-transplant: 
• Non-relapse related death  
• grade 4 or higher hepatotoxicity  
• autograft mobilization failure  
 
Treatment -related mortality:  If any patient experiences death due to an adverse event that is 
assessed as related to study treatment (by [CONTACT_65423]/or Sponsor), it will lead to temporary hold of study pending review by [CONTACT_15328]. The study will be terminated prematurely if at any 
point [ADDRESS_422164] that the true probability of achieving a complete response falls below 30% while assuming 
the treatment drug will elicit a 56%  complete  response rate. Statistically significant evidence for 
this low  complete  response rate is defined as an observed  complete  response rate whose upper one -
sided 90% confidence limit is lower than 30%. Sample size calculations were made assuming 80% 
power. In practice, the  study will be suspended if too few  complete responses are observed in 
participants. Table 3 displays the total number of subjects needed for a complete response endpoint 
for this study and the number of subjects to be accrued in each of two stages in Simon’s two- stage 
procedure (n1 and n2). If r1 or fewer complete responses are observed during stage 1, the trial is 
stopped early for futility. If r2 or fewer complete responses are observed by [CONTACT_341036] 2, 
then no further investigation of this treatment regimen is warranted. While 17 samples are needed 
to achieve 80% power, 18 total patients will be enrolled in the study to account for possible drop-
out/loss to follow-up.

8.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
Monitoring and Oversight The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial including any specimens collected, executing the data and safety monitoring (DSM) plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center) . The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data

61 of 75 quality and study participant safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center, which is the 
coordinating institution of this trial. A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as follows:   • Conduct of internal audits  • Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UAPs)  • Has the authority to suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues  • May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s Executive Committee  
 Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs and UAPs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor investigator per protocol. All SAEs and UAPs are to be reported to the DSMC within 7 (for fatal or life -threatening events) or 15 (non- life-threatening events) calendar days of 
the sponsor investigator receiving notification of the occurrence.  Each subject’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_340994]. Data regarding number of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and treatment responses will be discussed . 
 The sponsor investigator is responsible for organizing and conducting regularly scheduled teleconferences with all participating sites. The sponsor investigator will also be responsible for including data from all the participating sites to include the min utes from these regularly scheduled 
teleconferences between the sponsor investigator and the sites within the overall trial’s DSM progress report.  
 
The sponsor investigator will provide a DSM progress report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a recurring basis (either every six or twelve months based on DSMC vote). The DSM report will include a protocol summary, current enrollment numbers, summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs, any dose modifications, all protocol deviations, and protocol amendments. The DSM report submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted. Results  and recommendations from the review of this 
progress report by [CONTACT_341037] a DSMC review letter. The sponsor investigator is then responsible for ensuring this letter is submitted to the site’s IRB of reco rd at the time of IRB continuing review.  
 
Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Site monitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_16170]’s authorized representative on a regular basis, pursuant to the Monitoring Plan. During these visits, information recorded on the CRFs will be verified against source documents. As necessary, requests for data clarification or correction will be sent to the appropriate site PI.  Independent auditors from the sponsor investigator’s authorized representative will be allowed by [CONTACT_779]’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_16158]. In addition, audits may be conducted at any time by [CONTACT_16171]/or the IRB.

complete response. We hypothesize that treating patients with standard of care EPOCH in combination with nivolumab that we can improve complete response rate to 56% by [CONTACT_341039]. Safety will be tested by [CONTACT_341040]. Simon’s two- stage design (Simon, 1989) will be 
used to test the efficacy of combination treatment. Efficacy will be assessed using the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response. See 8.[ADDRESS_422168] complete response rates of approximately 40% (Maeda 
et al. Haematologica. 2017;  Gleesen et al. Leuk & Lymphoma. 2018;  Schmitz et al. Blood 
& Vose  et al. JCO). Of note, these prior studies include favorable subsets (low risk ALK+ ALCL 
and Stage I disease), which we have excluded from our study. Additionally, in our study we have 
included poor risk subsets (EATL, MEITL, γ/δ  TCL, and secondary CNS disease), which are 
commonly excluded from PTCL  studies . In this current  study investigating nivolumab + EPOCH, 
we hope to achieve an observed complete response rate of >5 6% and if fewer than 30% of patients 
experience a complete response to treatment, then the treatment approach is considered a failure.

63 of 75 A sample size of 17 was determined assuming a Simon Two- Stage design with a Type I error of 
0.096 and a power of 0.813—given an assumed complete response rate of 56% compared to a 30% 
complete response rate of the treatment population under standard of car e (with realization that 
this treatment population excludes favorable subsets of the overall disease population). An additional patient will be enrolled to account for potential loss -to-follow-up, etc.   
 
For the experimental treatment, we define failure as an observed complete response rate less than 
30%, and we define the null hypothesis as follows: H
0: p0 ≤ 0.30. Under the assumption that 
standard of care in combination with nivolumab will result in an observed complete response rate of at least 56%, we define the following alternative hypothesis: H
1: p1 ≥ 0.56. Formal calculation 
of the p- value associated with the observed data (as well as calculation of a 90% two -sided 
confidence interval for the complete response rate) will be made using the method outlined by [CONTACT_43900] (2007).  Secondary endpoints  The following secondary endpoints will be descriptive in nature (no formal statistical analyses will be conducted.) They are:

10.4 DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH    
 To assess efficacy, this study will be guided by a Simon Two-stage design.  The proportion of patients achieving a  complete  response also will be calculated for the patients 
being treated in this study. This proportion will be formally compared to a null proportion of 30%.   
Calculation of the p- value for the observed data and a two- sided 90% confidence interval will be 
made using the method outlined by [CONTACT_43900] (2007).

treated in this study. This proportion will be formally compared to a null proportion of 30%. The population proportion for complete response rate and associated p -value and 90% confidence 
intervals for the complete response rate will be calculated at study completion.  
  
10.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
 Secondary endpoints will be descriptive in nature, and no formal statistical analyses will be conducted on them.  Progression- free survival (PFS) will be summarized by [CONTACT_341041] 24 months of therapy.    Overall response rate is defined as complete response rate + partial response rate.  
 Duration of response is defined as time from first evidence of response until progressive disease

70 of 75 Source Documentation : 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate  
interpretation of data. When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a  
single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE  
CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.  
 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and  
documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical  and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_340998], microfiche,  photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media,  X-rays, patient files, and records kept  at pharmacies, 
laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in a clinical trial.  
 Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly  
defined in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into 
the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data.  
 Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the 
eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained.  The study site must also allow  inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
 
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical  record 
system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the  source 
document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements 
pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. 
 An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original  entry of 
data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit  trail that shows the 
original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date 
of the change.  
 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) : 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data)  and 
clinical laboratory data will be entered into a n electronic data capture system provided by  [CONTACT_341044].  eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -Investigator designated EDC system. Sites 
will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. The  data 
system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, 
to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will  be entered 
directly from the source documents. All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained site 
staff.

 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58625] (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained 
for recording data for each subject enrolled in the study. Data reported in the  eCRF derived from 
source documents should be consistent with the source documents or the  discrepancies should be 
explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the subject’s official electronic study record.  
 Data Quality Assurance : 
The Sponsor -Investigator will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of  eCRFs. Site 
will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  System 
backups for data stored by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator and records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the Sponsor-Investigator’s standard procedures.

72 of 75 14.4 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has 
access to the published results of NIH -funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer -
reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the di gital archive PubMed Central 
upon acceptance for publication.  The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human participants  to intervention or concurrent 
comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a medical 
intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any 
biomedical or health -related measures obtained in patients or participants, including 
pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and the Section [ADDRESS_422183] of 2007 requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional clinical trials performed under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the edit orial office of the journal in which they wish to publish. 
  FDAAA mandates that a “responsible party” (i.e., the sponsor or designated PI ) register and report 
results of certain “applicable clinical trials”.  
• Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I 
investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation; 
• Trials of Devices: Controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA 
regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric post -market surveillance 
studies.

Version Date: 10/08/2020
Study Title: Nivolumab with standard of care  chemotherapy for the first 
line treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma
You are being asked to participate in a research study. A member of the research team will 
explain what is involved in this study and how it 
will affect you. This consent form 
describes the study procedures, the risks and benefits of participation, as well as how your 
confidentiality will be maintained. Please take your time to ask questions and feel 
comfortable making a decision whether to participate or not. This process is called 
informed consent. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to sign this 
form.
Why is this study being done?
The purpose of this study is to learn  more about a combination of the standard 
chemotherapy regimen with one additional drug and how well they might work to treat 
peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The chemotherapy drugs together are commonly 
called DA-EPOCH and include the following: Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine, 
Doxorubicin, and Cyclosphosphamide. ‘DA’ stands for dose-adjusted. The additional drug 
that you will receive is called Nivolumab.
You are being asked to be in this research study because you have been newly diagnosed 
with PTCL.
The drugs in EPOCH regimen are  approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to treat PTCL. Nivolumab is approved by [CONTACT_341045], including other blood cancers, but is not approved to treat your specific type of 
cancer. This combination is therefore considered to be experimental.
Throughout the rest of this consent form, the  DA-EPOCH regimen and Nivolumab will be 
called the “study drugs” when referenced together.
How many people will participate?
Up to 14 
people from your area will participate in the study.
Up to 24 people from around the country will participate in the study.

Page 2 of 26What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a copy 
to keep and the original form will be kept
 at the clinic. You can withdraw from the study at 
any time and without giving a reason. This will not affect the standard medical care you 
receive.
There are 3 parts to the study:
1.Screening (before beginning the study drugs)
2.Induction Phase (attempt to eliminate visible lymphoma in your body)
3.Follow-Up
The next section of this form lists what  will be expected of you if you join this study.
Study Procedures
While you are taking part in this study, some of  the tests and procedures are the same 
type that would be performed as part of your regular cancer care even if you did not join 
the study. Some of the tests and procedures are required only for the study, and are 
identified below as “ research” procedures.
The screening tests and procedures will be done to see if you are eligible to join this study. 
You may have had some of these tests and procedures done recently as standard care for 
your cancer, and they may not need to be repeated.
Informed Consent (Research)
This informed consent form will
 be discussed with you and you will be given a copy 
of this document. If you join the study, you will be asked to sign this consent form 
before you receive any study related tests or procedures.
Medical and Cancer History (Standard of  Care)

Version Date: 10/08/2020
Page 3 of 26Performance Status (Standard of Care)
We will assess how well you are performing
 your daily  activities.
Review of Current Medications (Standard of Care)
Your study doctor will let you know which medications you can and cannot take 
while taking part in this study. From the time you first receive the study drugs 
through [ADDRESS_422191] medications you may be taking.
Review of Side Effects (Standard of Care)
Some risks have been identified because of the disease process  or through use of 
the study drugs themselves and these will be followed very closely by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_6012]. More information will be provided in the Risks section of 
this consent.
Blood and Urine Samples (Standard of Care)
These tests are sometimes called safety labs so the study doctor can be sure it is 
safe for you to take part in this study and to be given the study drugs.
oPregnancy test: Women who are able  to become pregnant will be given 
either a urine or a blood pregnancy test. A positive pregnancy test prior to 
being given the study drugs will exclude you from starting or continuing to 
take part in the study. This test must be performed 14 days prior to starting 
treatment.
oComplete blood count (CBC)
oComprehensive metabolic panel  (CMP)
oBlood clotting tests (PT/INR, and PTT)
oThyroid function tests (TSH)
oCreatinine Clearance
oTesting for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HBV (hepatitis B virus), 
HCV (hepatitis C virus), and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)
oUrinalysis
Blood Samples  (Research)
These tests are being done specifically
 because you are participating in this  study.
oBlood testing:  These tests will be done to understand better how the drug is 
working.
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) (Standard of Care)

Version Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_422192] and connected in a specific 
order to a machine. Output usually appears on a long scroll of paper that displays a 
printed graph.
Echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multigated  Acquisition (MUGA) Scan (Standard of 
Care)
This is a noninvasive scan of the heart using sound waves. This test will be used to 
see how well your
 heart pumps blood.
Bone Marrow Biopsy/Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (Standard of Care, if  necessary)
At various time points 
during the study, you will have bone marrow examined. This 
involves placing a hollow needle into
 your hip bone near the small of your back and 
taking a small sample of the bone (bone marrow biopsy) and 2-3 tablespoons of the 
liquid bone marrow inside the bone (bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]).
If a screening bone marrow biopsy is required, it needs to be done within 6 weeks 
prior to 
study enrollment. A repeat bone marrow biopsy prior to Cycle 3 would only 
be required to assess response if initial biopsy was positive for disease.
Imaging (CT or MRI) (Standard of Care)
These tests will be performed to check
 the status of your disease. These tests must 
be performed [ADDRESS_422193]: A computed tomography scan uses x-rays to make detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_340999].
oMRI:  Magnetic resonance imaging is a test that uses a magnetic field and 
pulses of 
radio wave energy to make pi[INVESTIGATOR_341000].
Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) Scan (Standard of  Care)
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a test that uses radioactive glucose 
(sugar) and 
a computer to create images of how organs and tissues in the body are 
functioning. Abnormal cells in the body use glucose at a different rate than normal 
cells and this allows the scanner to create a detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_341001]. A PET/CT scan is mandatory before and after treatment. A CT scan may 
be performed in place of a PET/CT scan at other time points during the study, 
depending on your insurance carrier.
Tumor Tissue Samples (Standard of Care)
oArchived Tissue:  If you had surgery for your cancer in the past, you must 
agree to allow us
 to contact [CONTACT_95786] a portion of your tumor tissue that they have stored so

Page 5 of 26we may use it for this to confirm your diagnosis of PTCL and for future 
research.
oTumor tissue biopsy during screening: If archived tissue is not available, we 
will ask you to
 allow us to take a fresh biopsy of your tumor tissue prior to 
treatment to confirm your diagnosis and to store it for optional future 
research. This biopsy may be core needle, excisional, or incisional since  fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_341002] a diagnosis of PTCL.
Lumbar Puncture (Standard of Care,  if necessary)
A lumbar puncture (spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499]) is performed in your lower back, in the lumbar 
region. During a lumbar puncture, a needle is inserted
 between two lumbar bones 
(vertebrae) to remove a sample of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. This is the fluid that 
surrounds your brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_341003]. If this procedure is 
required, it will need to be performed 6 weeks prior to starting treatment.
Receiving the Study  Drugs
EPOCH regimen (Standard of Care):
You will receive these drugs through an intravenous infusion, using a central 
venous catheter. This involves the insertion of a catheter, or small tube, into a large 
vein in the arm, or into a vein under your collar bone. This may be done under local 
anesthesia. You will receive these drugs over 5 days including a continuous 96 hour 
infusion.
Nivolumab (Research): You  will also receive these drugs through an intravenous 
infusion, using a
 central venous catheter.

You may continue receiving study drugs
 for up to 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) and 
be followed every 3  months for
 the next 2 years.
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
You may have side effects while you are in this study, but you will be carefully checked by 
[CONTACT_341047]. There may be risks or side effects of the study 
treatment that are unknown at this time. You should tell the study doctor about anything 
that is bothering you or any side effects you have, even if you do not think they are related 
to the study treatment. Many side effects go away shortly after the medications are 
stopped, but in some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting, or permanent.
Because this treatment is experimental, it is possible that the addition of a new drug, 
nivolumab, to standard of care may make the therapy either more or less effective.

Risks of the Study Procedures
Blood collection
Blood sampling and needle punctures carry some risk. Possible side effects include, but 
are not limited to, fainting, bleeding, bruising, discomfort, dizziness, infection and/ or pain 
at the puncture site.

Bone marrow biopsy
In this study we
 will take four samples of bone marrow from your pelvic bone. Before we 
take each sample, we will give you some numbing 
medication on the skin outside your 
pelvic bone (on your hip). After your skin is numb, we will push a special needle into the 
center of your pelvic bone. Then, we will draw the bone marrow up into the syringe. When 
we do this, you will have a pulling feeling as the marrow leaves the bone and goes into the 
syringe. The area around the bone will be sore for a few days. There is a very small 
chance that you will be allergic to the numbing medicine. There is also a very small chance 
that you could bleed or develop an infection.
Tumor biopsy
In this study, an additional biopsy may be required from you. There are some risks to 
taking a 
biopsy. There is a small chance that you could get an infection where the needle 
goes in. You may also experience redness, swelling, minor bleeding or bruising at the site 
where the cut was made or the needle inserted. You may experience mild to moderate 
pain at the site of the needle puncture. There is also a small chance that you could have 
an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine. After your skin heals up, you may have a 
small scar where we take the samples. If an X-ray is used to help place the needle, you 
will be exposed to additional radiation. The amount of radiation you receive during each 
biopsy procedure is approximately equal to the radiation you would receive in about [ADDRESS_422199] a lung biopsy, there is a risk of air getting into the space around your 
lung that would require a tube to be placed in between your ribs to draw the air out. If this 
tube is placed, some additional risks include damage to other nearby [CONTACT_341050], including 
the lung, a prolonged air leak, and a possible need for additional tubes or procedures. 
There is a small risk of death from complications of a biopsy.

An electrocardiogram (EKG)  is a  test that records the electrical activity of the heart. Skin 
irritation is rare but could occur during an EKG from the electrodes or the gel that is used.
Imaging (PET, CT scans)
Procedures such as CT scans, X-rays and/or radioactive drugs will be used during this 
research study to see how you are doing. The cumulative radiation exposure from these 
tests is considered small and is not likely to adversely affect you or your disease. However, 
the effects of radiation add up over a lifetime. It is possible that having several of these 
tests may add to your risk of injury or disease. When deciding to enter this study, think 
about your past and future contact [CONTACT_341051]. Examples of contact [CONTACT_341052] x-rays taken for any reason or radiation therapy for cancer treatment.
MRI
Some people cannot have an MRI because they have some type of metal in their body. 
For instance, if you have a heart pacemaker, artificial heart valves, metal implants such as 
metal ear implants, bullet pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], chemotherapy or insulin pumps or any other metal such 
as metal clips or rings, they cannot have an MRI. During this test, you will lie in a small 
closed area inside a large magnetic tube. Some people are scared or anxious in small 
places (claustrophobic). The MRI scanner makes loud banging noises while taking a 
measurement, so either ear plugs or specially designed headphones will be used to 
reduce the noise.
Lumbar Puncture
Post-lumbar puncture headache. Up to [ADDRESS_422200] from a few hours to a week or more.
Back discomfort or pain. You may feel pain or tenderness in your lower back after 
the procedure. The pain might radiate
 down the back of your legs.
Bleeding. Bleeding may  occur near the puncture site or, rarely, into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_341006].
Brainstem herniation. Increased pressure within the skull (intracranial), due to a 
brain tumor or other space-occupying lesion, can lead to compression of the 
brainstem after a sample of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_341007].

Reproductive Risks
While participating in this research study, you should not become pregnant, nurse a baby, 
or father a baby. Both men and women who are able to have children must use a highly 
effective means of birth control approved by [CONTACT_6814].
If you are a female who has stopped having menstrual periods for at least 1 year 
(menopause), please discuss with your study
 doctor the need for birth control. If you 
become pregnant, you must stop taking the study drugs at once and notify your doctor 
immediately. You will not be allowed to continue in the study. You may be asked 
questions about the outcome of your pregnancy and the baby.
You must continue the use of birth control during the entire time of your study participation 
and to at least [ADDRESS_422201] your information, but it cannot be guaranteed.
There may be other risks that  could arise which are not reasonably foreseeable. If new 
information becomes available which could influence your willingness to continue, this new 
information will be discussed with you.
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is designed for the researcher to learn more about a combination of the standard 
chemotherapy regimen with an additional
 drug (Nivolumab). However, there is no guarantee that your 
health will improve if you join this study. Also, there could be risks to being in this study. If there are 
risks, these are described in the section describing the discomforts or risks.
Are there alternative treatments?
There may be other ways of treating your cancer. Instead of taking part in this study:
You may choose to receive treatment with an approved  therapy.
You may choose to participate in a different study with another experimental  drug.
You may choose to receive comfort/ palliative care.

any applicable copays required by [CONTACT_262795].
There are some medical procedures that you would get for your condition whether you were 
in this study or not, such as routine blood draws, imaging, drugs for the EPOCH regimen, 
and administration of nivolumab. These are considered standard of care. You and/or your 
health insurance may be billed for the costs of medical care during this study if these 
expenses are related to standard of care procedures. If you have health insurance, the cost 
of these services will be billed to your insurance company. If your insurance does not cover 
these costs, or you do not have insurance, these costs will be your responsibility.
Ask your study doctor to discuss the costs that will or will not be covered by [CONTACT_265724]. This
 discussion should include the costs of treating possible side effect. Otherwise, 
you might have unexpected expenses from being in this study.
Is my participation voluntary?

The researcher carrying out  this study is Bradley Haverkos, MD. You may ask any 
questions you have now. If you have questions, concerns, or complaints later, you may call 
[CONTACT_341060] at [PHONE_7081] (office hours) or [PHONE_2073] (24-hour contact [CONTACT_6227], and 
ask for HEME BMT Attending on-call). You will be given a copy of this form to keep.
You may have questions about your rights as someone in this study. You can call [CONTACT_341061] with questions. You
 can also call the responsible Institutional Review Board 
(COMIRB). You can call them at [PHONE_1622].
A description of this  clinical trial will be available on http://www.Clinical Trials.gov, as 
required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At 
most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at 
any time.
Optional Consent for Specimen Banking for Future Research
[CONTACT_341061] would like to keep some blood, tissue from biopsies, and/or archived tissue 
that was taken during previous biopsy procedures. If you agree, the samples will be kept 
and may be used in future research to learn more about cancer. The research that is done 
with your samples is not designed to specifically help you. It might help people who have 
cancer and other diseases in the future. Reports about research done with your samples 
will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health records. 
The research using your samples will not affect your care.
Consent and Authorization Form
COMIRB #18-0708
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_340967], MD
Version Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_422204]. Haverkos will not give 
them your name, address, phone number or any other information that will let the 
researchers know who you are.
Sometimes samples are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families). If your samples are used for this kind of research, the results will not be told to 
you and will not be put in your health records. Your samples will only be used for research 
and will not be sold. The research done with your samples may help to develop new 
products in the future, but there is no plan for you to be paid.
We may share data from our research with other researchers or data banks. One such 
data bank 
is called dbGAP, which collects genetic and other data and is sponsored by [CONTACT_4878]. By [CONTACT_341053], we can make 
our discoveries more accessible to other researchers. Information which directly identifies 
you will not be sent to these data banks.
Because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small risk that someone 
could connect the information back to you. Also, genetic research and broadly sharing data 
may involve risks to you or people like yourself that are unknown at this time.
The possible benefits of research from your samples include learning more about what 
causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them and how to treat them. The 
greatest risk to you is the release of your private information. [CONTACT_341060] will protect your 
records so that your name, address and phone number will be kept private. The chance 
that this information will be given to someone else is very small. There will be no cost to 
you for any data or sample collection and storage by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Haverkos.
Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each 
sentence, circle “yes” or “no.” If you have questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse. 
Remember, no matter what you decide to do about the storage and future use of your 
samples, you may still take part in the study.

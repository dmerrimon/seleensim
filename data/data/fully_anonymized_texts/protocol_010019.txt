Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Imaging with 11C-ER176 to D elineate Macrophage Activation 
in Diabetic Gastroparesis  
A. Specific Aims  
Diabetic gastroparesis (DG) is a well -established complication of diabetes mellitus and results in significant 
morbidity for the patients1, 2. Mechanistic studies from diabetic animal models of delayed gastric emptying as 
well as molecular studies on human full -thickness gastric biopsies have significantly advanced our 
understa nding of this disorder3-6. An innate immune dysregulation and resulting injury to the interstitial cells of 
Cajal (ICC) and other compon ents of the enteric nervous system is central to the pathophysiology of DG7, 8. 
Specifically, hyperglycemic animal models have demonstrat ed that macrophages are critical for the 
development of delayed gastric emptying9, 10. A loss of anti -inflammatory macrophages associates with loss of 
ICC in both animal models and patients with DG. Our transcriptomic5 and proteomic6 studies in gastric full 
thickness biopsies from DG patients have also demonstrated macrophage -based immune dysregulation as the 
primary pathway altered. Although they have provided us seminal findings, widespread use of full -thickness 
biopsies can be chall enging for assessment of neuromuscular immunopathology in the stomach. Additionally, 
these biopsies only provide assessment of a small area in an untargeted manner, which can result in 
incomplete assessment considering that changes can be patchy11. Thus, there is an unmet need for novel 
noninvasive strategies to assess immune dysregulation in the gastric wall. 
Activated state of macrophages is mirrored by [CONTACT_351076] 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO)12-14. 
Positron emission tomography (PET) with TSP O-specific ligands has been developed over the last few years 
and provides a novel in vivo  molecular technique to detect macrophage activation15. However, results obtained 
by [CONTACT_91307] -generation radioligands in preclinical models have not been consistently reproduced in humans15. 
Successively more promising PET radiotrace rs have been developed for this application16-20. Recently, one of 
the newer agents, ER176 {4 -(2-chloroph enyl) -N-(methyl -11C) -N-((1R) -1-methylpropyl) - 2-
Quinazolincarboxamide} , a third -generation  TSPO -specific radioligand 
(Figure 1 ), has shown high affinity and excellent in vivo  target -to-
background binding21, 22. Based on imaging data from several 11C-labeled 
TSPO PET ligand studies , ER176 has been identified as the most suitable 
for in vivo  study of activated macrophages  due to: 1) a higher specific 
binding, 2) a smaller inter -subject variability, and 3) the unique ability to 
image even a low -affinity binding state23. Delineation of activated 
macrophages with 11C-ER176 PET in the stomach of patients with DG is a 
novel application. Mayo Clinic has an FDA -approved investigational new 
drug (IND) application (#149229) for use of 11C-ER176 in a trial of 
neuroinflammation, which will be amended to include gastric imaging in DG 
and control participants proposed in t his study.  
The overall goal  of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of dynamic 11C-ER176 PET imaging to identify 
macrophage -driven immune dysregulation in gastric muscle of patients with DG. Non -invasive quantitative 
assessment with PET can significa ntly add to our diagnostic armamentarium for patients with diabetic 
gastroenteropathy. If a clear immune dysregulation is identified in a subset of patients, it can be targeted using 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, if validate d, this imaging technique can 
facilitate clinical trials aimed at targeting immune dysregulation in DG, thus offering new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a disorder 
with significant unmet need. We propose the following specific aim:  
Specific Aim : To determine feasibility of dynamic 11C-ER176 PET to identify macrophage -activation in diabetic 
gastroparesis  
Hypothesis 1 : Patients with diabetic gastroparesis demonstrate increased uptake for 11C-ER176 in gastric 
body and antrum compared to matched controls  
Hypothesis 2 : Increased uptake of 11C-ER176 associates with a shift towards pro -inflammatory macrophage 
milieu on tissue assessment made by [CONTACT_351077]

Gastroparesis as a complication of diabetes mellitus : Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder of the upper GI 
tract characterized by [CONTACT_351078]/or liquids in the absence of mechanical 
obstruction of the gastric outlet1. Cardinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, bloating, postprandial fullness, 
early satiety and abdominal pain. In one study, DG accounte d for almost a third of the overall gastroparesis 
cases24. In the diabetes control and complications trial, dela yed gastric emptying was associated with greater 
HgbA1c, longer duration of diabetes, lower R -R variability on electrocardiogram, nephropathy, retinopathy, and 
greater GI symptoms25. In a study from the type [ADDRESS_436270] a significant impairment of their 
quality of life; especially symptoms of nausea, bloating and chronic pain28, 29. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_351052], there is a significant dearth of treatment 
options.  
Immune dysregulation in pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis : ICC are the pacemaker cells, which 
create the bioelectrical slow wave potential in the GI tract30. Syncytial network of ICC generate electrical slow 
waves in a spatiotemporal manner driving rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle cel ls31, 32. ICC are also 
involved in integrating and mediating sequential excitatory and inhibitory neuro -transmissions and in 
mechanotransduction, the critical components of n ormal gastrointestinal motility33. Variants in Ano -1 
transcripts, a protein specifically expressed in ICC has been associated with symptoms in DG34. Macrophage 
activity is a reflection of both pro -inflammatory and anti -inflammatory subtypes. In the Non -obese diabetic  
(NOD) mice, the development of delayed gastric emptying was associated with an increase in iNOS 
expression, a marker for macrophages with a “M1” phenotype (classically activated or pro -inflammatory).4 
Macrophage -deficient CSF1op/op mice did not develop delayed gastric emptying despi[INVESTIGATOR_351053].9 Administration of CSF1 resulted in replenishment of m acrophages and development of 
delayed gastric emptying and ICC damage in >75% of the mice. Conditioned media from macrophages 
exposed to oxidative stress resulted in damage to cultured ICC, which could be prevented by [CONTACT_351079]6R a nd TNF.35 We showed that decreased CD206+ (alternatively activated, anti -
inflammatory M2 macrophages) in the gastric antrum of patients with DG correlated with the loss of ICC.36 
Additionally, patients with DG had long GT alleles in the HMOX1 gene, and these were associated with worse 
nausea symptoms.7 In our deep transcriptomic analysis of full thickness (excluding mucosa) gastric body 
biopsies, 111 genes were found to be differentially abundant in DG (log 2fold difference of |≥2| with a false 
detection rate (FDR) < 5%)5. Top canonical pathways in DG included genes involved with macrophages, 
fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In a more recent study, we used the SOMAscan proteomics platform that 
quantitate s expression of 1300 human proteins. We found that 73 proteins were differentially expressed in DG. 
“Role of Macrophages, Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells” was the most statistically significant altered pathway. 
Additionally, in DG, properdin expression s trongly correlated with bloating scores on the Gastroparesis 
Cardinal symptom Index and expressions of prostaglandin 
G/H synthase 2, protein kinase C zeta type and complement 
C2 correlated with [ADDRESS_436271] an immune 
dysregulation driven by [CONTACT_351080].  
Lack of noninvasive tools for assessment of immune 
dysregulation in DG : There are  no imaging techniques that 
can reliably assess activated macrophages in vivo . Metabolic 
imaging with the ubiquitous PET radiotracer, F18 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), is insufficient for this purpose 
because of its non -specificity. There can be both diffuse o r 
focal uptake of FDG in the stomach either physiologically or 
due to inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. A 
representative image showing diffuse uptake of FDG in the 
stomach is shown ( Figure 2 ). On the other hand, 11C-ER176

OMB No. 0925 -0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018 ) Page       Continuation Format Page  is a radiotracer with specif ic binding to TSPO in activated macrophages and has many favorable imaging 
properties. For instance, preliminary studies have noted physiologic organ uptake of 11C-ER176 in brain, 
thyroid, lung, heart, liver, spleen and kidneys but not in the stomach22. Finally, there have been no adverse or 
clinically detectable pharmacologic effects of 11C-ER176 in healthy subjects22. Therefore, 11C-ER176 
represents a promising PET radiotracer for delineation of activated macrophages in patients with DG.  
Innovation : This proposal is innovative from both biological and technical st andpoints. Strong animal and 
human data generated by [CONTACT_351081]. This has 
been mechanistically shown to play a role in gastric motor dysfunction via injury to ICC. There is currently no 
noninvasi ve way to determine immune dysregulation in the gastric muscle. More broadly, macrophage 
dysfunction also plays a role in other inflammatory disorders of the gut such as inflammatory bowel disease. 
Technological advancements in ligands for PET imaging have  already led to emergence of its role in studying 
neuroinflammation as well as joint inflammation. We plan to use the latest generation TSPO radioligand, 11C-
ER176, for delineating macrophage activation in DG. We will validate imaging findings with state -of-art 
sampling of gastric muscle followed by [CONTACT_351082] -based techniques to 
determine transcriptional changes in immune cells. If successful, these studies will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_351054].  
 
C. Preliminary Studies  
Macrophage cell population in gastric muscle expresses TSPO : In preliminary studies, human gastric 
muscle tissues (idiopathic gastroparesis) were dissociated followed by [CONTACT_351083]45+ immune cells. Libraries were prepared using 10x Genomics Library Kits and sequenced on HiSeq4000. 
The t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t -SNE) plot revealed 1 2 clusters of CD45+ cells ( Figure 3a ). 
CD68, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, heavily expressed in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage 
forming a discrete cluster ( Figure 3b ). TSPO showed predominant expression in the CD68+ subset of cells 
(Figure 3c ). This suggests that gastric muscle contains immune cells that are TSPO+, hence, providing proof -
of-concept data that 11C-ER176 PET imaging targeting TSPO should demonstrate uptake in vivo  in humans. 
TSPO has been strongly associated with an activated or pr o-inflammatory macrophage subtype. In a recent 
study, during M2 (anti -inflammatory) polarization, TSPO expression was decreased14. A TSPO antagonist 
enhanced anti -inflammatory polarization. Additional studies have also demonstrated TSPO being an imaging 
target for identifying pro -inflammatory macrophage milieu12, 19. 
 
 
D. Research Design and Methods  
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_436272] no clinical history 
of diabetes or any GI symptom s. These will be screened using a simple GI questionnaire. Additionally, they will Fig 3: Gastric muscular propria single cells on tSNE plots. (A) Overall immune cells (CD45+). (B) CD68+ cell subset, a

details are as below:  
Imaging: 11C-ER176 will be produced in 
full accordance with GMP requi rements in 
the Mayo Clinic Cyclotron Facility. All PET/CT imaging will take place in the PET/CT Molecular Imaging 
Research Center on  of Mayo Clinic. PET/CT imaging will be performed on a state -of-the art digital 
PET/CT system (Siemens Biograph V ision 600, Siemens  Healthineers). This system utilizes silicon 
photomultiplier PET detectors to attain a spatial resolution of 3.7 mm, a timing resolution of 210 pi[INVESTIGATOR_351058] a sensitivity of 16 cps/kBq over a [ADDRESS_436273] will 
void their bladder and an intravenous (IV) line will be placed in an arm for administration of 11C-ER176. 
Participants will be given small amount of water (≤ 250 ml) immediately before the PET scan to allow gastric 
distension. The subject will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_351059] a head -holder. 
Participants will be monitored visually an d intermittently for adverse events during injection.  
The participants  will have a low -dose, non -gated, non -contrast -enhanced, free-breathing CT from the orbits to 
upper thigh  for attenuation correction (CTAC) and anatomic co-localization.  Immediately foll owing the start of 
the PET scan , 518 MBq (14 mCi) (range 370 -666 MBq; 10 -18 mCi) of 11C-ER [ADDRESS_436274] 6 min of PET scanning will be a dynamic acquisition over the 
heart for measurement of the bolus phase of an input function (IF)  which represents the amount of 11C-ER176 
in blood supplying tissue as a function of time . Next, 8-[ADDRESS_436275] through abdomen , which 
will include the heart for late phase of the IF  in multiple passes. A whole -body PET scan from the orbits to

fully-3D iterative reconstruction algorithms that include corrections for attenuation (using the CTAC scan), 
scatter, randoms, dead time, decay and normalization.  
Image analyses : PET and CT images will be transferred to a dedicated workstation (MIM Software Inc., OH) . 
Image analyses will be done by a board -certified nuclear radiologist. Diagnostic image quality of the late PET 
images will be rated on a 5 -point Likert scale. Ratings  of ≥[ADDRESS_436276] (VOIs) will be Table 1: Enrollment criteria for DG and Diabetic patients

in each PET image will be measured and decay -corrected to the time of injection and normalized to the 
administered activity. The quantified VOI activity for all PET images will be converted to time -activity curves , 
and the retention of activ ity in each region will be used along with the IF to model the biodistribution of 11C-ER 
176. The radiopharmaceutical biodistribution will also be quantified by [CONTACT_351085] [ maximum & mean 
standardized uptake value  (SUVmax  and SUVmean  respectively)] . The image quality, time -activity curves, and 
semi -quantitative metrics will be compared between diabetic gastroparesis patients and controls.  
Upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound and targeted biopsies of gastric muscle : A pregnancy 
test will be administered to women of child -bearing potential. Upper endoscopy will be performed only on DG 
patients  only. The endoscopy will be performed within 12 weeks of the participant’s PET/CT scan, this will 
allow more scheduling flexibi lity for the participant and study team. During the endoscopy procedure an 
additional procedure known as endotracheal intubation may be performed to keep the airway open and assist 
with breathing. This will vary from case to case and is determined by [CONTACT_941] a nesthesiologist assisting with or the 
physician performing the endoscopy.  The echoendoscope (Aloka Arietta 850; Olympus, Center Valley, PA) will 
be advanced into the gastric lumen and a site targeted for EUS -guided core biopsies based on findings of the 
PET scan. Fine needle biopsy of the gastric wall will be performed using a 19 G needle (SharkCore; Medtronic, 
Minneapolis, MN) passed through the echoendoscope and across the entire gastric wall ensuring a full 
thickness (mucosa to serosa) core tissue sample . Sampling of the uninvolved region will be done to serve as 
control. In patients who do not have clear signal on PET/CT, sampling will be done from gastric antrum and 
body to ask as negative control. All endoscopic procedures will be done by [CONTACT_351086][INVESTIGATOR_541]  
). EUS-guided core biopsy is a safe procedure associated with a low risk of adverse events.  
Assessment of gastric macrophages : After tissue dissociation, using technique similar to that shown in the 
preliminary data, cells will be sorted and profiled using the Fluidigm (San Francisco, CA) Helios cytometry by 
[CONTACT_233824] (CyTOF) mass spectrometry system. After cleanup in FloJo to  obtain singlets, data will be 
analyzed using the R -based CytofKit tool38, 39. In an approach that was not biased towards a limited subset of 
cell types, cellular s ubtypes will be identified and counted after labeling with a panel of 32 antibodies to 
distinguish monocytes and tissue myeloid cells from the other immune cells (CCR2, CD24, CD64, Ly6C, 
CD115/CSF1R, CD38, CD8a, Ly6G, CD11b (Mac -1), CD3e, CX3CR1,MERTK, CD1 1c, CD4, ESAM, PDL -1,

heatmaps.  
Endpoints and statistical analysi s: The biodistribution of 11C-ER [ADDRESS_436277] to see uptake of TSPO 
ligand 11C-ER 176 in the gastric muscle.  
Anticipated results, pot ential pi[INVESTIGATOR_351061] : We anticipate finding that patients with DG 
will have significantly higher PET uptake of 11C-ER176 compared to healthy volunteers. Additionally, we 
anticipate that the uptake will strongly associate with upregula tion of TSPO and other pro -inflammatory 
markers like Ly6C and downregulation of anti -inflammatory markers like CCR2, CX3CR1 and CD206. Most 
second -generation TSPO radioligands have varying degrees of sensitivity to the single nucleotide 
polymorphism rs6971  in the TSPO gene40, and this genotype sensitivity may vary depending upon the orga n 
where it is expressed22. Therefore, some subjects who are low -affinity binders are excluded from analyses and 
the remaining subjects are corrected for being either high - or mixed -affinity binders.  On the other hand, 11C-
ER176, a third-generation ligand, has shown little in vitro  sensitivity to rs6971. However, in vivo , 11C-ER176 
was found to be sensitive to rs6971. Nevertheless, it allowed quantitation even in low affinity binders and had 
high non -displaceable binding potential, w hich suggests that its relative in vivo  sensitivity to rs6971 may not 
impact clinical imaging22. Due to the small sample size of this feasibility study, we will be unable to select 
subjects with varying TSPO affinity genotype. However, if we see insufficient binding, we will determine the 
genotype.

PET/CT as well as endoscopic ultrasound with core biopsies within [ADDRESS_436278] 2 months. Considering the large volume of DG patients seen at 
Mayo Clinic and strengths of the PI’s team in recruitment, we are confident we will be able to recruit. The PI’s 
laboratory is housed within the Enteric Neuroscience Program (Director, ) and the group 
has considerable experience in cellular and molecular assessment of human gastric tissue1, 5, 6, 10, [ADDRESS_436279] and expertise in studies of this nature 
as well as an established infrastructure to perform the dynamic PET  scanning. T he preliminary data, availability 
of participants, and the expertise of the investigating groups (GI, radiology) will ensure that the proposed 
studies are completed within the 1 -year time frame allowing time for dissemination of results and generating 
data for a larger grant proposal.

Patients with diabetic gastroparesis (n=4) , diabetic patiens, and  age-and BMI -matched healthy volunteers 
(n=4) will be recruited for the study (all female) using following criteria.   
Participants:  
Inclusion criteria : 
1) Age: 18 to 70 years of age  
2) Ability to provide informed consent  
3) Type I or II diabetes mellitus  
4) Gastroparesis defined by [CONTACT_351087] -99m >60 % at 2 hrs and/or >10% at 4 hrs on scintigraphy  
(for DG patients only)  
5) Average Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) ≥3 indicating moderate -severe symptoms  (for DG 
patients on ly) 
 
Exclusion criteria : 
1) Women who are pregnant or cannot stop breast feeding for 24 hrs  
2) Using anti -coagulants, anti -inflammatory medications (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, etc.) or 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_351064] 4 weeks prior  (for DG patients only)  
3) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351065] 4 weeks of gastric emptying scintigraphy  
4) 4. Prior gastric surgery  
5) 5. History of IBD, celiac disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, microscopic colitis  
 
Dietary, fluid and other restrictions:  
During recruit ment, informed consent review, and visits, the subjects were informed and reminded of the 
following restrictions:  
1. No alcohol for [ADDRESS_436290] visit and until after end of study period  
2. Use of tobacco products (last 3 months)  
 
Sites where resear ch will be performed  
Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster, Minnesota  
 
b. Sources of research materials  
Research material will be the 11C ER 176 PET/CT images, upper endoscopy with gastric muscle biopsies and 
cells derived from the biopsies. Additionally, questionnaire responses and medical records will be research 
materials. Results will be maintained in the research laboratories that are ultimately the sole responsibility of 
the PI, and will be accessed by a secure password available only to authorized st udy personnel. Data will be 
merged for studies of associations by [CONTACT_46134]. All of the information collected in this study will be for 
research purposes only.  
 
c. Potential risks  
The potential risks associated with the study are those associated  with completing questionnaires, 11C ER 176 
PET/CT scan and EUS with biopsies. EUS -guided core biopsy is a safe procedure associated with a low risk of 
adverse events. Mild self -limiting serosal bruising and/or localized hematoma formation at the sites of EUS 
biopsies were reported in a small cohort of patients with gastroparesis who underwent EUS -guided FNA biopsy 
of the gastric muscle. Questionnaires come with a risk of privacy erosion and emotional distress. However, the

OMB No. 0925 -0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018 ) Page       Continuation Format Page  questionnaires proposed in the st udy are extensively validated and well received. Participants will have the 
option of leaving any question unanswered that makes them uncomfortable.  
 
2. Adequacy of Protection against Risks  
a. Recruitment and informed consent  
All participants will provide written informed consent using IRB -approved consent forms. The consent form 
becomes a permanent part of the medical record at Mayo Clinic. All subjects will be given a verbal explanation 
of the study, provided time to read and understand the written consent form, given opportunities to ask 
questions and provided a copy of the consent form. Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from 
the study at any time without prejudice t o their clinical management at Mayo Clinic then or in the future. 
Consent will be sought by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_351066], and consent will be documented by [CONTACT_2416]’s signature [CONTACT_75288]. Specific information is provided in the  Mayo consent form 
regarding storage and future use of the samples. The participants will be informed that any genetic information 
collected is not yet pertinent to clinical practice, the information will not be included in the medical record, but 
will be maintained in a coded fashion accessible only to study personnel. The consent form includes specific 
details about sharing sequencing data on public databases in a coded fashion at the time of publication. All 
recruitment material will be approved by [CONTACT_941] I RB at Mayo Clinic.  
 
b. Protection against risk  
Responsible conduct of human research by [CONTACT_351088]. This is done through IRB’s w ebsite “Protecting Human Research Participants” online 
training program. At the conclusion of the instruction, individuals are required to complete a quiz for 
competency assessment. In addition, [CONTACT_351094] has completed CCaTS Core 6001 (Refresher in Respon sible 
Conduct of Research) and Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training on Good Clinical Practice 
Course for Clinical Trials Involving Drugs. He is also up -to-date on the CITI instruction in human subjects 
protection. The course is d esigned to help users understand human subjects protection issues through a web -
based program.  
 
Specific risks and precautions  
1) Survey questionnaires: Questionnaires pose no more than minimal risk to the participants. There is a 
potential for perception of privacy intrusion. However, the subjects have the right to refuse to answer any of 
the questions or stop at any time, and there  is no penalty for refusing to participate. No complications have 
been recorded. The proposed questionnaires are validated, widely used, and were received well by [CONTACT_32346].   
2) 11C ER 176 PET/CT scan: PET scans and the tracers used are generally safe . In a recent study, no 
adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were observed with 11C -ER176 for any of the 17 
subjects  
3) EUS-guided core biopsy: Mild self -limiting serosal bruising and/or localized hematoma formation at the 
sites of EUS biop sies. Other standard risks of an upper endoscopy include pain (abdominal and throat), 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_351067], death. Serious risk of bleeding and frank perforation is rare (<1 in 1000).  
 
3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subje cts and Others  
The proposed research has the potential to remarkably enhance our understanding of visualizing immune 
dysregulation in the gastric muscle of patients with diabetic gastroparesis.  This will have a downstream effect 
of identifying immune dysf unction in other GI conditions. Broadly, this can revolutionize assessment of 
inflammatory milieu in areas that are not easily or safely amenable for a biopsy. As of now, there likely will not 
be a direct benefit to the gastroparesis patients as we still d o not have clear therapi[INVESTIGATOR_351068]. Given the anticipated mechanistic insights to the participants in this research 
proposal, and to others with diabetic gut dysfunction, the benefits outweigh the risks.  
 
4. Importanc e of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Protocol Version 2.0 
 10/4/2021  
OMB No. 0925 -0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018 ) Page       Continuation Format Page  The proposed research has the potential to develop a new approach to diagnose immune dysregulation in 
diabetic gastroparesis, a disorder with unmet clinical need. Specifically, this project is aiming to determine if a 
specia l radio ligand 11C ER 176 based PET/CT imaging can detect activated macrophages in the gastric 
muscle of patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Additionally, these results will be validated using actual 
assessment of gastric muscle tissue to determine cellu lar markers that associate with pro - or anti -inflammatory 
macrophages. This study will open a novel paradigm for assessment of immune dysregulation in the GI tract 
which will have utility for a broad range of GI conditions. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_351069]. The risks to the participants are 
fairly low with questionnaires, PET/CT scan and EUS with biopsies which are safe procedures. Given the 
repertoire of  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_351070], endoscopic and imaging studies of this nature 
as well as the precautions taken to minimize discomfort or adverse effects, the overall risk of this study is fairly 
low. There is a high likelihood (e.g., inve stigator team’s record and expertise, validated methods) of obtaining 
meaningful, useful information for the proposed aim.  
 
5. Data and Safety Plan  
Subject Safety : Adverse Events  
Adverse Event Grading  
Attribution scale : An adverse event is defined as either an expected side effect that is of a serious nature, or an 
unexpected side effect regardless of severity. All events will be graded as to their attribution (unrelated to 
protocol: possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol). Any event tha t is reported to either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_351071].  
Expected risks: These risks will be addressed in the protocol and consent f orm. The expected risks include:  
o Loss of confidentiality through unauthorized release of private medical information. This is unlikely 
since all data are collected in electronic form and access is protected by [CONTACT_351089].  
o Questionnaires pose s ome risk of causing emotional distress but these are validated and widely used 
questionnaires which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_351072].  
o 11C ER 176 based PET/CT imaging is generally safe and no adverse effects were noted in published 
studies. However, there is ra diation exposure which can be harmful. Additionally, there could be 
intolerance to the IV injection of radio ligand.  
o EUS with core gastric biopsies are generally low risk, especially with an advanced endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_351073]. 
Rajan who will perform this procedu re on all proposed participants. Adverse effects include abdominal 
pain, bleeding, and perforation. Rarely, these adverse events can lead to sepsis and death. However, 
the probability of a serious adverse event is 1 in 2000 or less, making the procedure qu ite safe.   
 
Plan for Reporting both Anticipated and Unanticipated Adverse Events.  
Any adverse event that is reported generates a report, which will be submitted to the Mayo Clinic IRB. The 
report will include a description of the event, when and how it was reported, as well as any official chart records 
or documentation to corroborate t he event or the reporting of the event. All adverse events will be graded as 
mild, moderate, or severe. Any severe and/or unanticipated adverse event will be reported within [ADDRESS_436291] Safety : Safety review plan and monitoring  
Safety Reviews: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_351074] a quarterly basi s.  
Annual Review:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_172078] a continuing basis for participant safety and include results 
of the review in the annual progress reports submitted to the IRB. The annual report will address: (1) whether 
adverse event rates are cons istent with pre -study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) 
whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that 
additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the  study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_351090].

OMB No. 0925 -0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018 ) Page       Continuation Format Page  Data Integrity   
Adherence Statement:  The DSMP outlined will adhere to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_68275] (IRB -C 
which handles research conducted in the Mayo Clinic CCaT S). 
Subject Privacy:  Data are kept in strict confidence. The template consent form required by [CONTACT_111212]’s IRB 
includes appropriate language addressing the risks and confidentiality protection. Confidentiality is assured by 
[CONTACT_351091]. All data will be identified with the use of the 
study number identifier to the participant. Participants are assured protection of confidentiality as specified by 
[CONTACT_351092]. 
Data Confidentiality.  
Database protection : The Mayo Clinic software programs are secured with password protection. All information 
kept within Excel spreadsheets use a study number identifier. Any electronic communication with collaborators 
outside t he Mayo Clinic would include data identified by [CONTACT_34161]. The only people with access to the 
spreadsheet are the study coordinator and the study statistician. The remaining investigators only review group 
data that have been summarized by [CONTACT_351093].  
Secure storage of biospecimens : Tissue samples collected are submitted to a designated laboratory 
technologist after anonymizing with a study number that is unrelated to the patient’s Mayo Clinic registration 
number. Thus, the technologist does not have access to clinical information. The database that includes 
sample numbers and Mayo Clinic numbers is maintained in an Excel spreadsheet by [CONTACT_9137].  
 
G. Sharing Plan  
We will share materials and manage intellectual property as described in the NIH Sharing Policies and Related 
Guidance on NIH -Funded Research Resources including the NIH Public Access Plan for Increasing Access to 
Scientific Publications and Digital Scient ific Data from NIH Funded Scientific Research (February, 2015) and 
the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (August, 2014).  
Following publication, we will share our results, methodology, and reagents with the research community at 
large in a manner consistent with data/resource sharing policies of the National Institute of Health, the Mayo 
Clinic and the publishers of the journals where our reports will appear. Should any intellectual property arise 
which requires a patent, we will ensure that the technology (m aterials and data) remain widely available to the 
research community according to the NIH Principles and Guidelines document.  
As a means of sharing knowledge, publication of NIH -supported original research in primary scientific journals 
will be our priori ty. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_351075] a timely manner and acknowledge 
that the research is supported by [CONTACT_18121]. Upon acceptance, publications will be submitted to the NIH 
Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system for open access via PubMe d Central.

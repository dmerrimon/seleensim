Specific Aims:  
To determine if metformin can decrease the loss of muscle mass and physical performance in insulin -resistant 
older adults and to investigate the mechanistic pathways involved.  
 
Background and Significance:   
 
Significance  
 
The proposed clinical trial may identify potential new targets for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. 
Sarcopenia is present in up to 24% of adults between the ages of 65 and 70 years and over 50% of adults over the 
age of 80 in the [LOCATION_002].1 It is assoc iated with the clinical consequences of lower physical performance, 
decreased strength, impaired activities of daily living, greater disability, and more falls and fractures.1-3 As a 
result, the healthcare costs of sarcopenia were estimated at $[ADDRESS_432043] epi[INVESTIGATOR_50123], clinical and translational studies to 
understand sarcopenia in older veterans, thus allowing me to fill a much needed role for the field of sarcopenia 
research.

compared to WWII veterans despi[INVESTIGATOR_347685].9 As the Vietnam veteran cohort enters older age, prevention 
of sarcopenia will be needed to help keep them indepe ndent and functional.  
Sarcopenia, defined as low appendicular lean mass, exists in up to 24% of adults under 70 years old and over 50% 
in those over the age of [ADDRESS_432045] been no interventional studies to 
determine the effects of metformin on preventing  the loss in muscle mass and muscle function.  
Potential Mechanism for Sarcopenia Prevention with Metformin  
The skeletal muscle of aging adults differs from young adults with lower 5’ adenosine monophosphate -activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) activity, a selective decrease in type II muscle fibers, accumulation of intramyocellular 
lipid, lower capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] -to-muscle fiber ratio, and fewer mitochondria.26-30 Both metformin and exercise can 
stimulate the phosphorylation of AMPK, an enzyme that can regulate the transcription of genes responsible for 
switching muscle fiber types from glycolytic to more oxidative , fatigue -resistant fibers, lowering muscle lipid 
accumulation, stimulating angiogenesis and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig 1).31-[ADDRESS_432046], 5 -

our proposed mechanistic framework (Fig. 1), the effect of metformin on human muscle composition remains to 
be confirmed.  
AMPK activation in basic studies also supports an improvement in muscle mass and function. While AMPK is 
thought to increase atrophy through inhibition of mTOR from cell -based studies,51, [ADDRESS_432049] muscle, and provide a compelling rationale 
for the positive associations between metformin use and muscle  mass and function that we describe in our 
preliminary studies below. As an AMPK activator, metformin is also expected to result in histologic changes for 
decreasing intramyocellular lipid and increasing capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], mitochondrial density and oxidati ve fibers. If 
our proposed study provides evidence to support this mechanistic framework, future studies of signaling 
intermediates for these histologic changes will be pursued with stored tissue specimens. Therefore, our proposed 
study of metformin treatm ent in insulin -resistant older adults will provide further insight into its mechanisms for 
preventing sarcopenia and to identify other therapeutic targets for this condition.  
 
Preliminary Studies / Progress Report:  
 
The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS)  Study is a prospective cohort study of 5994 ambulatory, community -
dwelling men aged 65 and older (mean age 73.7 years, range 64 -100) who were enrolled initially March 2000 -
April 2002 from six U.S. clinical sites (Portland, OR; Palo Alto, CA; San Diego, CA ; Minneapolis, MN; 
Birmingham, AL; and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) for the purpose of studying osteoporotic fracture determinants.57 
Participan ts returned for follow -up visits in 2005 -2006 and 2007 -2009 and continue to participate in ongoing 
follow -up for multiple health outcomes and assessment of vital status. The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures ( SOF) 
is a prospective cohort of 9,704 Caucasian w omen aged 65 years and older who were enrolled between 1966 -1988 
from Portland, OR; Minneapolis, MN; Baltimore, MD; and the Monongahela Valley near Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA for the 
study of osteoporosis and fractures.58 They were studied at baseline and returned every 2 years for a clinic visit. 
Information coll ected in both of these cohort studies includes dual x -ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) for body 
composition measurements (in MrOS), biochemical measurements, neuromuscular function, and questionnaires 
for medical problems, medications, demographic informatio n, and lifestyle factors. These are unique and rich 
resources for studying longitudinal changes in older men and women. From these studies, the following 
preliminary data have been generated.  
 
Lean mass loss is associated with increased risk 
of mortality  
To examine the mortality risks of sarcopenia in 
older men, we used data from participants in the 
MrOS study who had DXA -based measurements 
of body composition on average 4.6 (range: 3.5 -
5.9) years apart. Older men with ≥5% lean mass 
loss had a 1.8 -fold inc reased risk for all -cause 
mortality compared to men who maintained lean

mass. This risk remained significantly elevated even after accounting for baseline lifestyle factors and medical 
conditions and did not differ by [CONTACT_347704], BMI or self -rated health  (interaction p -value<0.10) (Fig. 2). 
However, the risk of all -cause mortality associated with  ≥5% total body lean mass loss was higher for men who 
lost weight unintentionally (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.65, 2.65) compared to men who lost weight intentionally in w hom 
there was no increase in mortality risk (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69, 1.62). Overall these findings indicated that 
involuntary lean mass loss doubled the risk of all -cause mortality in older men. While other studies have shown 
increased morbidities with sarco penia, this study showed that there is also an increased risk of mortality. These 
results were presented and honored with a Presidential Poster Award at the 2010 Annual American Geriatrics 
Society Meeting and were published in the Journal of the American G eriatrics Society.59  
 
Insulin resistance is associated with lean mass loss  
Baseline insulin resistance was predictive of future loss in 
lean mass in older, non -diabetic men. Insulin resistance was 
measured by [CONTACT_347705] e (HOMA -IR) in non -diabetic men in MrOS at 
baseline. There was a significant trend towards greater % 
loss in lean mass with increasing insulin resistance (Fig. 3). 
This association was unaltered by [CONTACT_347706]. The loss of lean mass associated 
with greater insulin resistance also existed independent of 
other metabolic co -morbidities like hypertension, body 
weight and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. These data were presented at t he 
Gerontology Society of America meeting in November 
2010 and a manuscript describing these results was 
published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics 
Society.60  
 
 
Insulin resistance is associated with increasing 6 -meter walk time  
The associations between baseline insulin resistance and the 
longitudinal change in 6 -meter walk time was also 
examined in 3256 MrOS participants without diabetes who 
had these measurements taken 4.7 years apart. There was a 
significant trend towards inc reased 6 -meter walk time 
(p<0.05) with greater insulin resistance as measured by [CONTACT_347707] 
(HOMA -IR) in models accounting for age, clinic site, self -
rated health and baseline walk time, physical activity, 
hypert ension and the change in lean mass (Fig. 4). 
Compared to the most insulin -sensitive men in the lowest 
quartile of HOMA -IR, insulin -resistant men in the highest 
two quartiles of HOMA -IR had a significantly greater 
increase in walk time in fully -adjusted mod els (p -
values<0.05). Therefore, greater insulin resistance in older 
men without diabetes is also associated with an accelerated 
loss in gait speed (data not yet published).  
   
 Metformin use may attenuate lean mass loss for older men with diabetes  
To furth er assess the association between insulin resistance and changes in lean mass, the loss in appendicular 
lean mass over 3.5 years was evaluated in older men who were grouped into the following categories of glycemic 
status at baseline: normoglycemia (n=1853 ), impaired fasting glucose (n=1403), untreated diabetes mellitus 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 6 (n=234), diabetes mellitus treated with insulin -sensitizers (n=151) and diabetes mellitus treated without insulin -
sensitizers (n=111). Even after adjustment for baseline demographics, lifest yle factors and medical comorbidities, 
the loss in appendicular lean mass was significantly attenuated in diabetic men on insulin -sensitizers compared to 
men with normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose, untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetic men not on i nsulin -
sensitizers, p<0.001 for all comparisons (Fig. 4). Among diabetic men on insulin -sensitizers, metformin use was 
associated with significantly less appendicular lean mass loss ( -0.41 Kg) compared to men with normoglycemia ( -
0.75 Kg), p<0.01; whereas the amount of appendicular lean mass loss for men on thiazolidinediones ( -0.65 Kg) 
did not differ significantly from men with normoglycemia, p=0.67.  These data suggest that use of insulin -
sensitizers, particularly metformin, may attenuate the loss of appe ndicular lean mass for older men with diabetes. 
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed, and these results were unchanged even after exclusion of [ADDRESS_432050] recently been published in Diabetes Care.25 
 
 
Metformin may attenuate the loss in usual gait speed for older women with diabetes  
We hypothesized that insulin sensitizer (metformin/thiazolidinediones) use would also be associated with 
attenuated loss in physical performance in older diabetic women. In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a multi -
center, longitudinal cohort study, 282 6 women aged ≥70 years had physical performance measures assessed 
between 1997 -1998 and 4.9±0.[ADDRESS_432051] squares mean change in 6 -meter walk speed was estimated in 
multivariate linear regression models for women with no diabetes (n=2711), diabete s mellitus with no insulin -
sensitizers (n=162) and diabetes mellitus with insulin -sensitizers (n=30). After accounting for baseline age, race, 
BMI, education, self -rated health, hypertension, walk speed, and use of estrogen and statins, the decline in walk  
speed was significantly greater in women with diabetes who were not using insulin -sensitizers ( -0.18 m/s, 95% CI 
-0.21, -0.15) than in women with no diabetes ( -0.12 m/s, 95% CI -0.12, -0.11); whereas the loss in gait speed for 
women with diabetes using in sulin -sensitizers ( -0.09 m/s, 95% CI -0.17, -0.04) did not differ to the loss seen in 
women with no diabetes. These results were unchanged after excluding women using insulin. These findings also 
remained unchanged after excluding 2 women on thiazolidinedi ones, suggesting that metformin use in older 
diabetic women may attenuate the loss in walk speed (data not yet  published).   
 

IRB #8860  
08/16/[ADDRESS_432052] helped to establish that insulin -resistant, older adults experience 
a greater loss in lean mass and physical performance. However, older adults with diabetes who were treated with 
metformin had a significant attenuation in the loss of lean ma ss and walk speed. These preliminary data provide 
the rationale for determining whether metformin can be used to prevent the loss of muscle mass  and function. 
Although these observational results are compelling, validation with a randomized controlled tria l is essential. 
Furthermore, a carefully performed trial will provide critical data about the mechanistic effects of metformin on 
muscle.

Participant recruitment  
 
We will plan to screen up to 3,000  older adults (including phone screens) from VA primary care clinics (Portland, 
Vancouver, Metro East, Metro West, and West Linn) to account for those who may not qualify due to the 
presence of exclusion criteria . We plan to  enroll up to 300 participants in order to randomize 120 subjects at the 
VA Portland  Health Care System  (VAPORHCS ) since we anticipate many participants to screen out of the study 
based on lab values after having signed a consent form . Advertisement flyers will be posted on approved bulletin 
areas on the VAPORHCS . VA primary care physicians may refer any interested and potentially eligible subjects 
to the study team.  Mailing recruitment will also occur , using primary care and endocrine patient listings of those

Study Visits  
All visits will be completed  at VAPORHCS and/or at OHSU.  
 
Screening Visit  
  
IRB-approved study personnel will have a full discussion with the potential subject, including information on 
study visits, procedures, risks, and benefits.  All participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from the 
study at any time. The princ ipal investigator will answer any questions from participants at any time.  Participants 
will provide written informed consent  prior to any study procedures being performed. A copy of the IRB -
approved informed consent and signed HIPAA authorization form wil l be given to the subject. Demographic 
information (including age, gender, and race) and lifestyle factors (including physical activity, smoking history  
and alcohol intake ) will be obtained. Medical history (including self -reported physician medical diagno ses), drug 
allergies/adverse effects and medications will be obtained. Height, weight and blood pressure (BP) will be 
measured. Criteria for exclusion criteria will be formally reviewed . Participants must demonstrate that they are 
able to ambulate [ADDRESS_432059] IFG will be  scheduled to attend a Baseline visit if the  Screening visit does not reveal 
presence of an exclusion criterion.   
 
 
Baseline  Visit  
 
The Baseline visit will occur in 14 days (+/- 7 days) from Screening. Participants will be instructed to remain 
fasting for [ADDRESS_432060] after their fasting lab draw 
has been done. A fasting glucose level will be measured.  Subjects will proceed with the following study 
measures: review and completion of questionnaires, medication inventory, physical performance tests, and whole 
body DXA.  For those subjects who signed the consent indicating their interest in participating in the muscle 
biopsy substudy and are eligible, they will be schedule d for a Baseline muscle biopsy visit within 14 days of their

guidelines for  diet and lifestyle modification consistent with the goals of the Diabetes Prevention Program at 
baseline and yearly visits.72 These include intake of < 25% of calories as fat and engaging in ≥150 minutes of 
physical activity weekly.  
 
Baseline Muscle Biopsy  Visit (if in substudy)  
 
Participants enrolled in the muscle biopsy substudy will receive a telephone call within [ADDRESS_432062] after muscle biopsy has been 
obtained.  
 
Phone calls between visits  
At 3 and 9 month time points between annual visits, t elephone surveying of medication compliance  will be 
obtained . Any adverse events (AE) will be reviewed. A [ADDRESS_432063] for 12 hours prior to the visit, to remind them to abstain from vigorous

Half -Yearly Visit s (6  months; Year 1 +6 months; Year 2 +6 months)  
 
Half-yearly v isits will occur at 6 Months, Year 1 + 6 Months, and Year 2 + 6 Months. All subjects will go  to 
VAPORHCS for these visits . For those in the substudy, only for the 6  Month visit , they  will also go to OHSU  
after labwork is drawn at VAPORHCS .  
 
This visit could take up to 2 hours for participants ( 3 hours for participants in the muscle biopsy substudy  at the 6 
Month visit ). At each half-yearly  visit, all participants will have  fasting labwork drawn, and have questionnaires 
reviewed and completed . Subjects >[ADDRESS_432064] after fasting la b work/muscle biopsy has

Annual Visits  (Years 1, 2, and 3) 
 
These annual visits could take up to [ADDRESS_432065] before proceeding with the following study measures: review and completion of questionnaires, 
medication inventory, physical performance tests, and whole body DXA.  
IRB #8860  
08/16/[ADDRESS_432066] chosen to study metformin in this  clinical trial due to the observation that metformin use was associated 
with an attenuat ed loss of muscle mass and function in our preliminary studies. While both metformin and 
thiazolidinediones can upregulate AMPK and PGC1α in muscle to increase muscle fatty acid oxidation, 
angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative muscle fibers for healthi er-appearing muscle,32, 34, 68 
metformin has additional benefits on mortality, microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 
diabetes;[ADDRESS_432067] ies. A covariate -adaptive ra ndomization scheme  will be used to ensure equal age, gender and 
race distributions . The investigators and study participants will be blinded to the randomization of the study drug 
assignments. A 90 -day supply of study drug will be mailed every 3 months to participants  with a pre -paid 
envelope for returning unused study drugs for pi[INVESTIGATOR_216603]. An additional 4 -day buffer may be included to avoid 
lapses in study drug administration  due to unforeseen complications in medication delivery and/or receipt.  To 
minimize self -limiting gastrointestinal side effects, participants randomized to metformin  will begin with a n oral  
dose of 850 mg tablets once daily (taken with meals) for [ADDRESS_432068] on muscle using this dosage, since a significant reduction in 
peripher al insulin resistance occurs even with a metformin daily dosage of 750 mg.61 Furthermore, this dose was 
safe and effective in lowering the risk o f diabetes for subjects with prediabetes in the Diabetes Prevention 
Program.75 Plans for monitoring and preventing risks associated with metformin are further discussed under 
Human Subjects.  
 
Instances where the study drug is discontinued include  the follo wing:  development of a contraindication to 
metformin as described under the section for exclusion criteria; development of lactic acidosis ; diagnosis of 
diabetes; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; [ADDRESS_432069] medium ; or development of 
B12 deficiency . For those who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347688], efforts will be made to recheck 
kidney function within 48 hours after discharge/procedure and the study drug will be restarted if there is no 
evidence of renal dysfun ction. For tests or  procedures that require fasting, study drug will be stopped [ADDRESS_432070] or procedure, and study drug can be resumed after the participant is allowed to eat again . Compliance 
to study drug will be tracked and accounted for in analyses.  
 
Study Procedures  
All study procedures are research -related.  
 
Exam:  Exams for annual visits will occur at OHSU  after fasting labwork has been drawn at VAPORHCS . At 
Screening, baseline and yearly exams, height will be measured in meters using a wall -mounted Harpenden 
stadiometer, b ody weight will be measured in kilograms using a balance beam scale , waist and hip circumference 
measured with a tape measure , and measurements of pulse and blood pressure  will be taken .  
 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 13 Labs:  The lab samples will be collected  at VAPORHCS at the Screening  (after consent  is obtained ), Baseline, 
Half-Yearly  Visits and Annual Visits , and processed at  VAPORHCS or OHSU . Fasting plasma will be drawn at 
Screening for ascertainment of IFG (100m g/dL≤fasting glucose <126mg/dL)  and exclusion criteria: creatinine ≥ 
1.5 mg/dL for men or ≥1.4 mg/dL for women, eGFR<60 mL/min, B12 <180 pg/mL, ALT>48 U/L, or AST > 41 
U/L. Whole blood will b e assayed for platelet counts , and platelet -poor plasma will be assayed for INR and aPTT. 
At Baseline , fasting plasma will just be assayed for glucose. At annual follow -up study visits, fasting plasma will 
be assayed for glucose, insulin, B12 (pg/mL), creatinine (mg/dL) , alanine transaminase (U/L) , aspartate 
aminotransferase (U/L ), and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( mL/min ). Exclusion criteria for follow up labs 
will be identical with the following exception:  The FDA guidelines requiring the safe use of metformin  have 
recently changed and the eGFR cutoff as indicated by [CONTACT_347716] < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 which we will 
use as our exclusion criteria for continuation of study drug.  With the exception of i nsulin , the blood labs  will be 
analyzed at  VAPORHCS . Insulin will be analyzed at OHSU.   
 
A total of 10 ml of blood w ill be drawn  at the Screening Visit . At the Baseline visit, 30 mL of blood will be 
drawn . At the half -yearly visits, a total of 20 mL of blood will be drawn. At the Annual follow -up visits, 30  mL of 
blood will be drawn .   
 
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings at the scheduled end of the study should be followed up 
until satisfactory resolution or diagnosis can be made.    
 
Biorepository  
 
A separate  biorepository protocol will be submitted to the IRB for approval. Additional samples of blood and 
muscle tissue (if in substudy) will be collected and stored for future analyses  at the Baseline visit, muscle biopsy 
visit, half -yearly visits,  and annual visits. These are described above in the Lab section and Muscle Biopsy section 
in this protocol  below . 
 
Questionnaires:  Prior to all study visits from  Baseline to Year 3/End of Stu dy, questionnaires to assess lifestyle,  
diet, physical activity, physical function, fatigue and  medical diagnoses  will be mailed to participants in their visit 
reminder letter to be completed and returned on the study visit day. A #[ADDRESS_432071] questionnaires reviewed at the study visit by [CONTACT_347717] a nd will finish any incomplete sections at the study visit.  At 1, 3 and 9 month time points 
between study visits, adherence to study drugs will be surveyed over the telephone.67 
 
Medication Use:  Participants will be instructed to bring all prescription and over -the-counter medications to their 
study visits, and research staff will take an inventory of all medication names and doses.  For the convenience of 
participants, a bag will be mailed along with the visit reminder letter that they may use to bring their medications 
to the visit. Participants will be given pre -paid envelopes to mail  unused study drugs to the research pharmacy 
every 3 months for pi[INVESTIGATOR_347689] .  
 
Physical Performance Tests:  Performance tests will occur at VAPORHCS and OHSU . They will be conducted 
at Screening , Baseline, and the annual visits. At Screening, subjects must demonstrate they are able to walk 400 
meters. At Baseline and the annual visits, assessments of grip strength, a 400 meter walk,  timed 6 meter walk,  all 
of the short physical performance battery (SPPB) tests , and  Instrumented Sway ( ISway)  test will be conducted. 
All performance tests will be instrumented with Mobility Lab sensors on bilateral  upper and lower extremities , 
waist and chest using elastic straps. The IS way test consists of [ADDRESS_432072] in lateral and anterior -posterior directions with 42 metrics. The SPPB com prises tests 
of balance, timed walk and chair stands and is predictive of subsequent disability in older adults.11 For tests of 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 14 balance, the ability and/or duration (s) in which a participant can maintain a tandem, semi -tandem and side -by-
side stand will be recorded. Participants will be timed in the task of rising from a seated position 5 times in rapid 
succe ssion without use of their arms. Those who are unable to complete this task without the use of their arms 
will be considered unable. The participant’s time to complete a 6 meter walking course at his/her usual pace will 
be measured with a stopwatch. Walkin g speed (meters/second) will be determined from the better of two trials. In 
addition to the SPPB, tests of endurance and strength will assessed with a [ADDRESS_432073] will also be measured with a stopwatch. Participants will be considered 
unable to perform this task if they require more than 15 minutes for the 400 meter walk or if they require use of 
assistance. Grip strength will be assessed using a Jamar dynamometer in the participant’s dominan t hand.73 The 
maximum effort from two trials will be taken as the measurement of maximum grip strength (kilograms).  
 
Imaging  (DXA) : DXAs will occur at OHSU. At Baseline and the annual visits, w hole body scans will be taken 
with a Hologic QDR 4500W DXA scanner by a certified DXA operator to determine total body lean mass and 
appendicular lean mass (kilograms), as previously described.59, [ADDRESS_432074] for longitudinal drift.   
 
Muscle Biopsy studies (for those in the substudy ): Subjects are asked to participate in the muscle biopsy studies 
based on their platelet and INR results. There will be [ADDRESS_432075] platelet count  < 150 billion/L , INR > 1.2 , or aPTT > 36 seconds.  
 
At the Baseline Muscle Biopsy visit and 6 month  visit, fasting muscle biopsy samples will be obtained at OHSU  by a 
physician or certified nurse practitioner from the vastus lateralis muscle, 15 cm above the patella using the modified 
Bergstrom technique, as described.36, 74 -76 Using a 2% lidocaine for anesthetic, a small, ¼ incision will be made in the 
skin and fascia to place a 5 mm Bergstrom biopsy needle  while suction is applied through the 140 cc syringe , 
obtaining approximately 150-200 mg of muscle . The incision will be clo sed with sterile adhesive strips, and a 
pressure bandage will be applied for a period of 24 hours.  This procedure takes approximately 15 minutes, is a 
relatively painless, and well -tolerated in older adults.  Subjects will be instructed not to perform phy sical exercise 48 
hours prior to the muscle biopsy procedure to help prevent acute effects of exercise on intramyocellular lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] 
(IMCL ) (7:8). They will also be given discharge instructions after the procedure for precautions to follow to prevent 
complica tions.   
 
All muscle s pecimens  will be processed at OHSU . The specimen  (50 mg) for histochemistry will be mounted on a 
small pi[INVESTIGATOR_347690], placed in cooled isopentane for 2 -3 minutes and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Another 
portion (50 mg) will be placed in a cryovial and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of diacylglycerol and 
ceramide content.  The remaining tissue will flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for future analyses.  
 
All specimens will be st ored in a -80 freezer in the biorepository   located at the O regon Clinical & Translational 
Research Institute (OCTRI)  lab until they are analyzed . All muscle specimens will be stored after being  assign ed 
code numbers and the information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects’ identities will be kept 
in a separate, secure, locked location.  This is done to protect research subject’s confidentiality. If a research subject 
decides to withdraw the specimens may continue to be stored as outline d in the approved consent documents . 
Identifiers will be stored separately from the samples.  
 
During the course of the study, 100 mg of stored muscle biopsy specimens will be prepared for histochemical 
analyses will be sectioned  on a cryostat at -20 C and placed on precleaned glass slides. A longitudinal section will 
be made and imaged at 36,000 magnificatio n for acquisition of 15 -20 micrographs to determine mitochondrial 
content using digital image analytical software (Metamorph 6.3) as previously described.77 Succinate 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 15 dehydrogenase staining and quantification using image analysis of staining intensity will be assessed as 
described.75 Triglyceride content will be determined using Oil Red O staining using  established m ethods.78 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168] (number of capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]/muscle area) will be determined by [CONTACT_347718] a 
tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyante (TRITC) excitation filte r after thawed and air dried sections are fixed in 
0.25% formaldehyde, incubated with lectin and rinsed.[ADDRESS_432076] antihuman myosin heavy chain -7 (type I fibers) and 
myosin heavy chain -2 (type IIa fibers) and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein 
(type IIa fibers) and rhodamine (type I fibers) . Type IIx fibers will remain un stained. Images will be acquired 
with an optical microscope.36, 74 Diacylglycerol and c eramide content will be measured using high -performance 
liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry  from a homogenized (using ice -cold buffer of 250 mM 
sucrose, 25 mMKCl, 50 mMTris, and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH7.4) liquid nitrogen -frozen sample as previously 
described.36

Adverse events  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated at each visit. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_347691] -Investigator will determine 
the relation of the side effect to treatment as: 1) related , 2)  possibl y related , or 3) not related .   
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that res ults in death, a life -threatening experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] (for a patient already hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]); persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity; congenital anomaly and/or birth defects; an event that jeop ardizes the subject and may 
require medical or surgical treatment to prevent one of the preceding outcomes; or death .  
 
“Unanticipated” means an event that is new or greater than previously known in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency, given the procedures described in protocol -related documents and the characteristics of the study 
population.  Unanticipated problems involving risk (UPRs) are physical, psychological, social, or economic risks 
to subjects or others, including device and drug effects , and anything reportable to the FDA.  
 
All unanticipated SAEs  and UPRs  must be reported to the joint IRB within  [ADDRESS_432077] compensation will be offered at the end of each study visit, as follows:  
• $50 at Baseline , Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3/End of Study visits  
• $50 at Baseline Muscle Biopsy visit  and at 6 month visit (if in substudy)  
• $5 at 6 month ; $5 at Year 1 +6 month; and $5 at Year 2 +[ADDRESS_432078]. Each  annual  study 
visit is 2 -3 hours . Baseline and annual visits include a fasting blood draw, height, weight, blood pressure, 
questionnaires, performance tests, and DXA. The procedures at every 6 month study visits (in between annual 
visits) are only fasting labs and questionnaires for all participants . For the muscle biopsy substudy, there will be a 
separate 1-2 hour visit at baseline and an additional 1 hour added to the  6 month visit.  
 
Payments are fair and appropriate and do not constitute (or appear to constitute) undue pressure or influence on, 
or coercion of, the prospective research subjects to volunteer for or continue participation in the research study.

Stati stical considerations  
 
Sample Size and Power  
 
Based on prior observational findings, there 
was a significant difference (2.2%, p< 0.01) 
in the percentage change in appendicular 
lean mass over 3.5 years between 
metformin -treated and untreated men. The 
samp le size required for 80% Power to 
detect this difference and reject the null with 
SD=4% and α=0.[ADDRESS_432079] is 106 study participants (53 in each 
group). We plan to enroll  300 participants 
and, of those, randomize  120  ( 60 in each 
group) to allow for potential drop outs due 
to noncompliance and other reasons (7.5-
10%). While 8 -11% of participants may 
progress to diabetes yearly,72, 79, [ADDRESS_432080] size estimates for gait speed (SD=0.19) for α=0.05 for 60 
participants and 53 participants per group are illustrated in the graph (Fig. 8) and based on our preliminary data in 
older women. The sample size of [ADDRESS_432081] 73% Power to detect a 0.09 m/s difference in 
gait speed. Within each group, [ADDRESS_432082] sizes of the difference in histologic measures between the two groups after 6 
months  are sho wn below in Table 3. While this study is adequately powered for 3 year outcomes in muscle loss, 
interim analyses may be performed by a D ata Monitoring Committee (managed by [CONTACT_347720]) , given blinding 
of the primary investigator to the intervention, and t he trial may be terminated early if a significant difference in 
the primary outcome between metformin - and placebo -treated groups is noted before 3 years.

Statistical Analyses  
 
To assess a difference in the primary outcomes of change in muscle mass and performance between metformin - 
and placebo -treated groups, longitudinal (mixed effects) models will be used to estimate the trajectory of change. 
These models will account for corr elation of outcomes within subjects and allows for those with missing follow -
up data to be included in analyses. Four measures of muscle mass and performance (baseline, year 1, 2 and 3) are 
the outcomes in separate models. These will be modeled as a linear  change over time, and other functional 
changes (squared, cubic and quadratic) will be evaluated. In the best fitting model, an interaction between time 
and group (metformin vs. placebo) will be included in the model to determine if changes in muscle 
mass/ performance differ between the two groups. For the secondary outcomes of muscle histology, the discrete 
change in measures of mitochondrial content, muscle capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], percentage of fiber types and 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 19 intramyocellular lipid content over 6 months  will b e calculated. The absolute and percentage changes in these 
measures will serve as the outcome in linear regression models with treatment group as the dichotomous 
exposure. Nonlinear associations between the exposure and outcomes will be evaluated with high er order terms. 
For the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes, potential confounders including demographic information , 
physical activity, diet, lifestyle factors , medical history and medication use are expected to be evenly distributed 
between the gr oups in a random fashion; nevertheless, we will evaluate for potential confounding by [CONTACT_347721] >10%.  There is no anticipated  gender difference in the study outcomes , so the study has 
not been powered to detect a significant interaction by [CONTACT_547]. However, t he primary and secondary outcomes 
will also be stratified by [CONTACT_347722] a gender -specific mus cle response to metformin.  To account 
for missing data, multiple imputation modeling will constructed from participants with complete data. Participants 
with missing data will have those values imputed at each time point multiple times from these models ut ilizing 
available covariate data and then analyzed according to the principles of multiple imputation.82 Results will be 
reported with and without imputed values.  
 
Data Integrity  
 
For any protected health information (PHI)  used for recruitment purposes (i.e. from patient lists for mailing 
recruitment letters ), the information  will strictly be stored  on the secure VA server .  
 
Study forms will contain the subject number, and may contain PHI. All study forms with PHI will be stored 
securely in locked file cabinets in a locked office, or on a secure electronic VA drive.  All PHI  will be coded prior 
to release  for analysis.  
 
There is a transfer of ownership of data from VAPORHCS to OHSU. The data will be managed at OHSU behind  
OHSU firewall . The Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute’s (OCTRI) Biomedical Informatics 
Program has the resources and expertise – software engineering, research analysts, and project management – 
available to assist researchers and staff wi th the storage, retrieval, sharing, and optimal use of biomedical 
information, data, and knowledge for problem solving and decision -making.   The data collection and management 
tools utilized for this grant are REDCap (Research Electronic Da ta Capture) .  The REDCap system  provide s 
secure, web -based applications that are flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research, provide an 
intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real time validation rules (with automated data type and range 
checks) at the time of entry. Th is system  offer s easy data manipulation with audit trails and reporting for 
reporting, monitoring and querying patient records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical 
packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).  
 
 
Human Subjects Considerations:  
 
Potential Risks, Protection from Risks, and Risk/Benefit Discussion  
 
Potential Risks   
 
This is an FDA approved drug for an unapproved purpose. However, this drug has been well -studied in and 
sometimes used for people with impaired fasting glucose to prevent progression to diabetes and risks in this 
population are no different than those in the FDA approved population.82, 92 The proposed metformin dose of 850 
mg twice daily has been previously studied safely in a population with pre -diabetes for the prevention of 
diabetes.75 This study is not intended to be used to support a  significant change in the labeling or in the 
advertising of metformin, and t he same route of administration will be used. With these elements , an IND is not 
necessary.  
Risks of Metformin Use 
 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 20 There are risks of gastrointestinal distress, hepatitis , or lactic acidosis . Gastrointestinal distress includes diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, flatulence, indigestion, abdominal discomfort/pain, constipation, and distention  of the  abdomen. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms are common during initiation of metformin therapy. Metformin is known  to be 
substantially excreted by [CONTACT_10521], and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the 
degree of impairment of renal function.  Lactic acidosis is a n extremely rare, but serious, metabolic complication 
that can occur due to metf ormin accumulation during treat ment with metformin.  Occurrence of gastrointestinal 
symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. A decrease in vitamin B12 levels has been 
observed in clinical trials with metformin.  Signs of lac tic acidosis include feeling very weak, tired or 
uncomfortable, unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, unusual or unexpected stomach discomfort, feeling cold, 
feeling dizzy or lightheaded, and suddenly developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a slow or irregular heartbeat.  Contrast (i n radiologic) 
studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic 
acidoses.  
 
There are o ther rare risks  from metformin use. Acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and 
other conditions characterized by [CONTACT_347723] (a medical condition characterized by [CONTACT_347724] -containing 
compounds in the blood). Alcohol is known to poten tiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Subjects 
should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic.  Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients 
receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, 
when strenuous exercise is not compensated by [CONTACT_347725], during concomitant use with other 
glucose -lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol , or with substantial  alcohol  use. When a 
patient st abilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a 
temporary loss of glycemic control may occur.  When starting to take metformin, a metallic taste could occur.  
 
With the exclusion criteria and screening te sts, these risks (except gastrointestinal intolerance) would be 
minimized. See section “Protection Against Risks of Metformin Use.”  
 
Risk of Diagnosis  of Diabetes  
 
From participating in this study, there is a risk that diabetes may be detected. Participants and their primary care 
physician will be notified so that they can seek confirmatory testing and appropriate medical care from their 
primary care physician.  
 
Risks of Study Procedures  
 
Muscle biopsy:  The risks of percutaneous muscle biopsy are bleeding and infection (both rare), bruising 
(infrequent) and discomfort (likely). With the use of a local anesthetic, the discomfort of muscle biopsy is 
describe d as about twice that of intravenous cannulation.  Some residual stiffness in the vastus lateralis can persist 
for 1 -2 days (common). An el astic wrap and ice bag are applied post -biopsy to decrease the risk of bruising and 
for an anesthetic effect. Subjects from similar protocol have not experienced any adverse effects from these 
procedures other than a small amount of residual localized sore ness at the biopsy site. Additional risk includes 
any unusual reaction to the elastic bandage wrap and ice, i.e. leg numbness which would indicate the elastic 
bandage had been applied too tightly or the ice left on too long; or any skin redness, irritation , and chafing from 
the applied antibiotic ointment and/or steri -strips.  
 
DXA scans : There is risk of radiation exposure. There will be multiple scans during the study which will increase 
exposure to radiation.  
 
Blood collection : There is a risk of pain, bleeding, infection, and bruising. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_347726].   
 
Physical Performance : Participants with neuromuscular dysfunction may have a risk of falling during the 
IRB #8860  
08/16/[ADDRESS_432083] behind the secure VA 
firewall  or in locked file cabinets in a locked VA office .   Coded samples will be processed in the VAPORHCS 
and OCTRI laborator ies, and then transferred (without any iden tifiers) to [CONTACT_347738]’s lab at Sanford -
Burnham Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes  for muscle biopsy analysis .  The signed 
consent forms and paper study documents will be kept in a locked file cabinet  in a loc ked office or on a password -
protected drive behind the secure VA firewall .  
 
 
Adequacy of Protection from Risk  
 
The study will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_347727] -OHSU IRB. The investigators will adhere to 
the 
Data Monitoring Committee plan  described in this protocol . Trained and IRB -approved study personnel will 
perform all data collection and  information will be coded with a subject identifier to protect subject 
confidentiality.  
 
Protection Against Risks of Metformin Use  
 
By [CONTACT_347728] , the risk of lactic acidosis 
or hepatitis on metformin will be decreased. Furthermore, we intend to prevent such risks by [CONTACT_347729] 80 or greater and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_347693]/kidney dysfunction for their safety. Per 2016 FDA guidelines, 
metformin use will be discontinued if the eGFR drops below 45 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_432084] medium, the drug will be held and efforts will be made to recheck kidney function within 48 
hours after discharge/procedure. The study drug will be restarted only if there is no evidence of renal dy sfunction.  
For tests or procedures that require fasting, study drug will be stopped [ADDRESS_432085] Risks of Diagnosis  - From labs at Screening and study visits, diabetes may be diagnosed 
(defined by [CONTACT_347730]≥126 mg/dL). Participants will be notified and referred to their primary care 
physician.  
 
Protection Against Risks of Study Procedures  
 
Muscle biopsy : The exclusion of participants on warfarin, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], Aggrenox, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], dabigatran or 
anagrelide will minimize serious bleeding with the procedure.  We will also ensure that participants are not on 
these medications within a week of their second muscle biopsy. Furthermore, participants will have screening of 
INR, aPTT and platelets and will not be enrolled in the muscle biopsy substudy  if there is any abnormality in 
clotting function to avoid serious bleeding. They will also have reassessment of these indices prior to the second 
IRB #8860  
08/16/2016  
 
 22 biopsy and will not undergo the second biopsy unless these labs are normal.  Local anesthesia with 2% lidocai ne 
will be used to reduce pain associated with the muscle biopsy. To ensure safety with the anesthetic, no 
participants with an allergy to lidocaine will be enrolled. To minimize the risk of infection from muscle biopsy, 
the procedure will be performed usi ng sterile techniques. Appropriate pressure , hemostasis  and use of an elastic 
wrap and ice bag after the biopsy will decrease the risk of bruising and aid in an anesthetic effect.  Participants will 
be given instructions on care of the biopsy incision site to prevent bleeding and infection after the procedure.  
 
DXA scans:  The radiation exposure from one whole body DXA scan is 3.6 (4.6) µSv of radiation which is less 
than the accumulated daily background radiation dose to the whole body.3 Therefore even the amount of radiation 
from four DXA scans is nominal and should not raise the risk for adverse health effects.  
 
Blood collection:  A sterile technique will be used prior to venipuncture or intravenous access and pressure will be 
applied f or appropriate hemostasis after withdrawal of the needle/catheter.  
 
Physical Performance:  To prevent harm from falls during the exam, neuromuscular tests will be administered by 
[CONTACT_347731] a history of falling or is so frail that a fall might occur.  
 
Protection Against Risk of Breach of Confidentiality  
 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with HIPAA regulations. The recruitment database will 
be protected by [CONTACT_347732] . After consent is signed, data will be maintained in the OCTRI/OHSU REDCap 
database. In addition, the database will be password protected, and  only project  personnel approved by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Klein  
will be given access to them.   
 
Potential Benefits of Research  
 
Potential benefits to participants include the detection and potentially earlier treatment of diabetes mellitus. 
Participants in both metformin and placebo gro ups will benefit from routine lifestyle modification counseling at 
yearly visits for prevention of diabetes.  
 
Others may benefit from a greater understanding of the effect  of metformin on muscle mass and function  in 
insulin -resistant older adults .  
 
VA Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  
 
A data monitoring committee  will be provided by [CONTACT_347733]&D. W ith DMC’s experience in the conduct and 
monitoring of clinical trials , it will  assist with ensuring the overall safety of s tudy participants, assessing safety 
and efficacy of the study intervention, monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical trial including 
recommendations on recruitment and retention of participants and improvement of study drug adherence, and 
providing r ecommendations on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_347694]. SAEs and UPRs  will be reported to the 
DMC . For further details, see the “Instructions for the Review of New (uninitiated) Protocols by [CONTACT_347734].”    
 
Inclusion of Women and Children  
 
Because sarcopenia is a condition of older age, children will not be enrolled in this study. Women will be 
includ ed in a proportion reflective of their gender distribution at the VAPORHCS . 
 
Criteria for Discontinuation

Study of Exparel Versus Epi[INVESTIGATOR_909915] n Control After Thoracotomy 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
April 27, 2018
Study Protocol 
All patients will be screened by a study coordinator and written informed consent will be 
obtaine
d at the preoperative visit. Inclusion criteria will be patients age 18 years and older 
unde
rgoing thoracotomy (lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection or pneumonectomy). We 
will stratify patients by [CONTACT_909926] 
e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_909916]. Operations will be performed by [CONTACT_79924] [ADDRESS_1277327] wall resection or abdominal incision 
a
nd/or gastroesophageal surgery; current enrollment in another post-thoracotomy analgesic 
research protocol; pre-existing pain syndrome (such as fibromyalgia, complex regional pain 
syndrome or postherpetic neuralgia in a thoracic distribution); daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]; current 
gabapentin or pregabalin therapy; allergy to any study medication; coagulation or infectious 
issues that would preclude epi[INVESTIGATOR_41835]; severe psychological disorders or 
inability to understand the study protocol; prisoners or other institutionalized individuals; and 
severe hepatic, renal or cardiovascular disorders. Women who are pregnant will not be included 
in t
his study.

l of T6 –T8 and advanced [ADDRESS_1277328] dose of lidocaine 1.5% 
will
 be administered before the induction of general anesthesia. Patients will be excluded from 
the stud
y if the catheter cannot be placed . A bolus dose of 0.5 mg hydromorphone plus 4.5 ml

0.075% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 10 mcg/ml hydromorphone, prepared by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_4601], will be 
star
ted intraoperatively at a rate of 5 ml/h r .  
In
tercostal Nerve Block 
In the intercostal block (ICB) group,  liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 1.3% (4 ml) will injected by 
[CONTACT_909927]. In addition, liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 1.3 % (4 ml) will be 
inje
cted at  each of the chest tube exit sites. Thus, a total of 20 ml liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 1.3% 
(260 mg) will be administered. 
G
eneral Anesthesia 
 General anesthesia based on inhaled isoflurane will be administered to both groups.

ntraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including up to [ADDRESS_1277329]-anesthesia care unit (PACU), IV fentanyl will be given for NRS > 4 as needed,  25 
mcg IV every 2 minutes up to a maximum 200 mcg. If additional analgesia was required, 15 mg 
of IV ketorolac will be given once for NRS > 4.  An IV fentanyl patient-controlled analgesic 
(PCA)
 will be initiated for all patients in the PACU on the ward . All patients will receive 
acetaminophen (1000 mg orally every 8 hours 6 hrs ) during the first 48 hours postoperatively. IV 
ketorolac (15 mg every 6 hours) may also be administered depending on pain severity, urine 
output and renal function. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_909921],

management.  Adjustments to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_909924], according to the

recorded every 4 hours using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for the first 48 hours following 
surge
ry will be analyzed as secondary outcomes. These endpoints will be compared between 
g
roups using an appropriate two-sample comparison (t-test or rank sum test).  In addition, a 90% 
confidence interval for the difference between groups will be constructed to assess whether the 
lower bound is above the non-inferiority limit (-1).  Secondary outcomes will include overall 
satisfaction with pain management, incidence of postoperative hypotension (defined as a systolic 
or diastolic blood pressure more than 20% below baseline), pruritus, nausea or vomiting, and 
postoperative sedation. Additional secondary outcomes will include postoperative complications 
(re
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], myocardial infarction, and pneumonia), readmissions to the ICU, length of 
ICU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241900]. Groups will also be compared with 
respect to IV fentanyl PCA use and ketorolac use for 0-[ADDRESS_1277332] (or rank sum test) and categorical variables will be compared using 
the 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.  In all cases we  will assess distributional assumptions 
a
nd use transformations (e.g. log) or analysis of ranks as appropriate.  The level of statistical 
sig
nificance for all tests was P<0.05.  
Power Calculation 
 The number of patients required in each group was determined from a power analysis on 
the basis of non-inferiority hypothesis (4) for the primary endpoint which is pain with cough at 
8:00 AM on postoperative day 1.  For non-inferiority of the intercostal nerve block vs TEA, a 
max
imum difference of 1 (margin of non-inferiority) on the NRS scale was considered as 
a
cceptable. On the basis of previously published data, a standard deviation of 2 was assumed for 
NRS
 distribution (3). If there is truly no difference between the standard and experimental 
treatment, then 138  patients  (69 patients per group)  are required to be 90% sure that the lower 
limit of a two-sided 90%   confidence int erval (one -sided alpha=0.05) will be above the non -
inferior ity limit of -1.  Thus t he  proposed sample -size of N=140 (70  per group) will provide 
a
dequate statistical power to detect a meaningful difference .

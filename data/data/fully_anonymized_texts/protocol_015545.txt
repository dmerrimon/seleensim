TITLE OF STUDY: An Open -label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase  3 Study to Compare the  
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and S afety of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals Insulin Glargine Injection to L antus® 
(Insulin Glargine Injection) in Adult Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes M ellitus   
STUDY  CENTERS : Approximately  100 sites are  planned in  the [LOCATION_002]  and Europe  
STUDY  PERIOD : Subjects randomized to the Gan & Lee 
Insulin Glargine Injection group or  the Lantus® group will 
receive treatment for 26  weeks.  PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The study  started in 2017 and is expected to end i n 2019  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate equivalence of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® in terms of 
immunogenicity  
Secondary Objectives:  
• Immunogenicity: To evaluate the percentage of subjects with negative anti-insulin antibodies  
(AIAs) at baseline  who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26, the percentage of 
subjects w ith at least a  4-fold increase in titers  compared to baseline value , mean change from 
baseline in AIA titers between treatment groups, the percentage of  subjects with confirmed positive  
AIA who develop any anti-insulin neutralizing antibodies up to visit Week 26, and percentage of 
subjects who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26 of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine 
Injection in comparison with that of Lantus®. 
• Safety: To evaluate the safety of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that of 
Lantus® 
• Efficacy: To evaluate the efficacy of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that 
of Lantus® 
Exploratory Objectives : 
• To investigate the retrospective hypoglycemic rate and the time in hypoglycemia  and 
hyperglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)  data 
• To examine the relationship between the plasma concentration s of insulin glargine , M1, and M2, 
and immunogenic re sponse   
STUDY DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Gan  & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection with that of  the reference 
medicinal product, Lantus®, in adult  subjects  with type 1  diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form  (ICF), they will be screened  for 
eligibility,  and the following information will be collected: adverse events, medical history (including 
diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and concomitant medications , vital signs, height, body 
weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The following procedures will be performed: 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG),  physical examination, and blood collection for fasting blood glucose  (FBG) test, 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1 c), AIA, routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, 
metabolic chemistry panel  with serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , and free thyroxine [T4]). 
A urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this 
visit, the subject will be issued a glucometer , test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or designee 
will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer  for prospective  capi[INVESTIGATOR_600655] a prospective manner . Subjects will be allowed 
to keep the glucometer  after the study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations.  Subjects will 
also receive a Hypoglycemic Event s Record  in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that occur during their participation in the study. At this visit, the subject will have a n Abbott  
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring  Syste m sensor applied to the back of the upper  arm. The 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_795464] will also be issued a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  for the 
8-day period, in which they will record the time of their meals and insulin use. After [ADDRESS_795465] bag; if the end of the 8-
day CGM period coincides with the date of the  randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit  
by [CONTACT_6624] . The information obtained through CGM will have no direct impact on treatment advice and is 
intended for research purposes only. Subjects will bring  both their Hypoglycemic Event s Record  and their 
Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  to the randomization visit.  Between the screening and randomization 
visits, subjects will have their basal insulin dose optimized based on their fasting glucose results . 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -label fashion to 
receive either Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection or Lantus® for 2 6 weeks. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_1606] . Subjects will continue using their bolus (short -acting) insulin and will substitute the 
investigational product  (IP) for their long- acting (basal) insulin. In the [LOCATION_003], t he Sponsor will ensure that all 
insulin s will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or reimbursement issues.  This 
applies to the non- study insulins and this should be discussed with the Study Monitor.  
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will  receiv e a supply of insulin pens with IP. The Investigator 
or designee will train the subject on all study procedures and proper dose administration.  
All subjects  will attend 9 clinic visits (the screening  visit, the randomization visit, and visits at Weeks  2, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief visits during which a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits 
at Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contact[CONTACT_30354] 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. The Week 2 6 
visit (Visit 9) will be the end -of-treatment visit. 
At all visits and phone contacts  (except for visits to apply a  CGM sensor) , the Investigator or designee will 
review glucose results  (especially focusing on hypoglycemia ), adverse events, changes in concomitant 
medications, and changes in IP and bolus  insulin use. At all study  visits, the following procedures will be 
performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing 
potential, and an FBG  test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as f ollows: a t Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c will be 
collected;  at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their CGM sensor to the site for the staff to safe ly remove 
it; they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record for the site staff to review, and  blood will be 
collected for routine hematology and chemistry , TSH  and free T4 ; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be 
collected for AIA;  and at Week [ADDRESS_795466] blood drawn at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 for 
optional pharmacokinetics (PK) (insulin glargine, M1, and M2 concentrations).  
If a subject discontinues the study prematurely (early termination – ET), site personnel will make a 
reasonabl e effort to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 ( end of treatment – EOT visit). 
Additionally, it is also very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 + 4 weeks (and Week 12 + 1 week,  if applicable) for  a blood sample  to be obtained for AIA and HbA1
c 
measurements.  
Site personnel will contact [CONTACT_30355] 30 days after study completion to query for serious adverse event information only.  
Subjects will only be included in the optional PK portion of the study if they are able to provide a baseline PK sample.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Enrollment is planned for 550 su bjects overall (275 subjects per treatment 
group). The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be a n equivalence test  using the 2 one -sided tests 
(TOST) approach with α=0.05.  This sample size was chosen to achieve over 80% power on the equivalence 
test under margins dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate . Sample size calculations were 
performed using EAST Version 6.4.  
STUDY TREATMENT(S):   
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection for subcutaneous 
injection, 100 U/mL , in the integrated,  disposable 3.0-mL pre -filled  Gan & Lee in jector  pen 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: Lantus® (insu lin glargine injection) solution for 
subcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the SoloStar® 3-mL pre-filled insulin pen   
Lantus® contains insulin glargine, an insulin analog, and has a prolonged duration of action. Lantus® and 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day. 
To be consistent with current Lantus® labeling, twice -daily dosing of IP is strictly prohibited. The dose 
regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted.

Exploratory Endpoints : 
• Retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate  
• Time in hypogly cemia and hyperglycemia  
• Relationship between p lasma concentration s of insulin glargine , M1, and M2 , and AIA titers  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the TOST approach with α=0.[ADDRESS_795471] of difference in proportions to ( -margin, +margin) where the margin is dependent on the 
observed treatment -induced AIA rate in Lantus®. The number and percentage of subjects in each treatment 
group who develop treatment -induced AIA after baseline and u p to visit Week [ADDRESS_795472] for difference in proportions based on the normal approximation. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction. The estimand of interest for the primary immunogenicity analysis  
is the difference in treatment -induced immunogenicity rates regardless if all subjects tolerate or adhere to 
study treatment or receive other insulin treatments . Intercurrent events will be handled according to the 
treatment policy strategy. Treatment Policy strategy is defined as the strategy that considers “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is  used regardless of 
whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (See ICH E9 R1 addendum).  
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority  (EMA) of Gan & Lee 
Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus
® for HbA1 c by [CONTACT_17921] 90% confidence interval with 
(-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by [CONTACT_30357] 95% CI 
with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and stratification factor of country  included as fixed 
effects and baseline HbA1
c included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation will 
use the outcomes of patients who completed the study (inclu ding subjects who discontinued treatment but 
provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 
recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1
c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all 
randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analy sis Set. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_600656].  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_795473] of 
difference in proporti ons. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% 
CI using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction.  The secondary immunogenicity 
variables of the percentage of subjects in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA at baseline and at least a [ADDRESS_795474] of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set. Th e exact confidence limits are computed by [CONTACT_24518] 
[ADDRESS_795475] tests that are based on the score statistic.  The mean change from baseline in each 
treatment group in AIA titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will be tabulated descrip tively .  
Safety variables will be summarized descriptively in the Safety Analysis Set consisting of all randomized  
subjects according to actual treatment received. All reported adverse events will be assigned a system organ class and preferred term accordi ng to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and graded 
according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events (all adverse events, hypoglycemia, serious adverse events [in cluding fatal], 
adverse events leading to termination of study treatment and/or early withdrawal from the study, IP -related 
adverse events, and injection site reactions) will be presented. Vital signs, body weight and BMI, ECG, and laboratory results will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659].  
The secondary efficacy variables of number and percentage of subjects achieving a HbA1 c value < 7.0% a t 
visit Week [ADDRESS_795476] result of ≤ 6.0 mmol/L 
(≤ 108.0 mg/dL) in each treatment group will be compared using a test of difference of proportions based 
on the normal approximation and confidence intervals . The retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate and time 
in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be summarized for subje cts in the Safety Analysis Set. The plasma 
concentrations of insulin glargine, M1, and M2 will be plotted against AIA titers.

6.1 Disease Review
Type 1 diabetes usually results from cellular autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the 
pancreas, severely reducing or eliminating production of endogenous insulin. Without 
insulin , glucose cannot enter cells and blood glucose concentration increases.  Hepatic 
gluconeogenesis may ensue, further elevating the blood glucose concentration. Without treatment, potentially lif e-threatening ketoacidosis may develop [ 1]. 
Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that, if inadequately treated, can lead to significant morbidity, including macrovascular and microvascular complications, and significantly increased mortality. In conjunction with ongoing patient lifestyle education regarding self-management of the disease, subcutaneous insulin is t he mainstay of treatment for 
patients with type 1 diabetes [ 1].  
The Diabetes C ontrol and Complications Trial (DCCT) [2] demonstrated that intensive 
therapy with subcutaneous insulin leads to improved glycemic control and better outcomes. Since the publication of the DCCT, several insulin analogs have been developed that are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and  lowering of 
glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1
c) equivalent to human insulin [ 2]. Ratner et al [ 3] showed 
that compared with human insulin, treatment with insulin glargine was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and a lower incidence of hypoglycemia. Hasslacher et al [ 4] 
showed that subjects with type 1 diabetes and early stage chronic kidney disease who we re 
treated with insulin analog s such as insulin glargine had better kidney function and higher 
hemoglobin concentrations, compared with those who received human insulin.  
6.2 Compound Review  – Insulin Glargine  
Insulin glargine is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a longer duration of action than human 
insulin. The substitution of glycine for asparagine at A21 and the addition of 2 arginines at 
the C-terminus of the B chain result in stabilization of the molecule, leading to delayed and 
prolonged absorption after subcutaneous injection [3, 5].  
6.2.1 Nonclinical Studies 
An extensive characterization and comparison of structural and biofunctional properties of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® has been conducted [ 6]. T he s tructural 
characterization  (includi ng  primary,  secondary,  tertiary a nd quaternary s tructures; size, 
hydrophobicity, charge hete
rogeneities, and cell-based biofunctionality including the binding 
to the receptors of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1), and the activation  of the insulin-
signal
ing cascade  and the stimulati
on of glucose uptake were demonstrated to be  similar 
betwe
en Gan & Lee Insul
in Glargine Injection and Lantus®. For in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacologic and toxicologic studies and clinical studies, r eference is made to  
NDA 021081 [ 5].

rated bioequivalence of Gan & Lee Insulin G largine  Injection  
and United S tates (US) -sourced Lantus®. A lthough this exploratory study suggested 
biosimilarity,  it was not  powered to pr ovide  robust statistical conclusions. G an & Lee Ins ulin 
Gla
rgine  Injection  was well tolerated,  and treatment -em ergent adverse events were 
comparable to those with Lantus®. There were no significant signals that would indicate a 
difference in t he safety profile between the treatments. A p ivotal pha se I st udy will be  
performed 
conc urrently to assess the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of  
Gan & L ee Insulin G largine  Injection  compared w ith U S- and Europe an-sourced Lantus®. 
6.3 Clinical Study  Rational
e 
The purpose of this study is to compare Gan & Lee  Insulin G largine  Injection 100 U/mL 
with that of the reference medicinal product, Lantus®, [COMPANY_011]-Aventis’ brand of insulin 
glargine injection 100 U/mL, and evaluate equivalence in terms of immunogenicity, safety, 
and efficacy , in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus . 
Insulin analogs are more costly than conventional insulins, and limited access to affordable 
insulin may keep some patients from accessing important treatment options, leading to unnecessary complications [ 1, 7].  
Biosimilar products may result in significant price reductions compared to the cost of the 
reference products, even if the reductions are not of the magnitude seen with many generics [ 8].  
Biosimilar drugs are not identical to the reference product. Because even small differences in 
the primary structure can result in clinically significant functional differences, there are concerns abo ut potential risks to patients [ 8]. Insulin glargine has been shown to exhibit 
proliferative and anti- apoptotic effects in vitro in colorectal cancer cells; however, clinical 
studies have produced conflicting results regarding an association between insulin glargine and cancer risk [ 9]. And although a number of observational studies in [ADDRESS_795495] cancer after a median 5-year follow-up period among those who were insulin-naïve. A nonsignificant increase in risk was found among subjects who had switched to insulin glargine from other insulins [ 10]. 
Because biosimilar insulins have immunogenic potential, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA require an evaluation of safety and  immunogenicity between 
biosimilars and their reference products, and the EMA has indicated these studies should be of sufficient duration (at least 6 to 12  months) to detect these differences. This study is 
designed in accordance with the guidance documents provided by [CONTACT_23357] [11] and the 
FDA [ 12].

 The immunogenicity assessment will use the one- assay [ 13] and tiered approach [ 14]. 
Samples collected at all time points (including pre -dose) from both treatment groups will 
first be tested  using the validated electrochemiluminescence method [ 15]. The rate and 
degree of immunogenicity, and data interpretation will also include consideration of other 
clinical attributes such as (but not limited to) symptoms of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions and the PK profile.

8.1 Overa
ll Study Design and Plan 
The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy 
of Gan  & Lee Insulin G largine Injection with that of the reference medicinal product, 
Lantus®, in adul ts with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form (ICF), they will be 
screened  for eligibility, and the following information will be collected: adverse events, 
medical history (including diabetes melli tus and thyroid disease history), prior and 
concomitant medications, vital signs, height, body weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The 
following procedures will be performed: 12- lead electrocardiog ram (ECG), physical 
examination, and blood collect ion for fa sting blood glucose (FBG)  test, HbA1 c, AIA, and 
routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic chemistry panel with serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and free thyroxine [T4]). A 
urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed. At this visit, the subject will be issued a glucometer, test strips, and other 
supplies, and the Investigator or designee will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] a prospective manner . Subjects will b e allowed to keep the glucometer after the 
study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations.
 Subjects will also receive a 
Hypoglycemic Events Record  in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that occur during their participation in the study.  
During the [ADDRESS_795496] a FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose 
Monitoring sensor  applied to the back of the upper arm according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Monitoring System is approved by [CONTACT_30362] 
[ADDRESS_795497] will also be issued a Mealtime 
& Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of their meals, and insulin use. After [ADDRESS_795498] bag provided and 
bring it with them to the randomiz ation visit. If the end of the 8-day continuous glucose 
monitoring ( CGM ) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can 
be removed at the visit. Subjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic Events Record and their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit.  
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -
label fashion to receive either Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine or Lantus
® for 26 weeks. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1606]. Subjects will continue using their bolus insulin

 but will substitute  IP for their basal  insulin. The Sponsor will ensure that all insulin s will be 
provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or reimbursement issues.   
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will receive supply of insulin kit s with IP  and 
the Investigator or designee will train subjects on all study procedures and proper dose 
administration.  
Subjects in both treatment groups wi ll be assessed every 2 weeks after Visit 2 ( randomization 
visit) through Week 22 ( telephone call ); and then at Week 26; they will attend a total of 
9 clinic visits (the screening visit, the randomization visit, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 26), 2 brief visits during which  a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits 
at Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contact[CONTACT_30354] 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. 
The Week 26 visit (Visit 9) will be the end-of- treatment  visit.  
At all planned visits and phone contacts (except for visits to apply a CGM sensor)  the 
Investigator or designee will review glucose results (especially looking for hypoglycemia), 
adverse events,  changes in concomitant medications, and changes in IP  or bolus insulin use, 
and the following procedures will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential, and an FBG test .  
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16 and 26, blood for HbA1
c 
will be collected; during the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their  CGM sensors 
to the site for the site staff to safely remove it, and they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin 
Dose Record  for the site staff to review , and blood will be collected for routine hematology 
and chemistry testing , TSH and free T4  and TSH ; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be 
collected for AIA; and at Week 26, a 12- lead ECG and physical examination will be 
performed.  
A subset of additionally consented subjects will have blood drawn at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 for optional PK (insulin glargine, M1, and M2 concentrations). If a subject discontinues the study prematurely, site personnel will make a reasonable effort 
to perform all study activities sch eduled for Visit 9 (end of treatment [ EOT ] visit). 
Additionally, it is very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 (±  4 weeks) (and Week 12 ± 1 week if applicable) for a blood sample to be 
obtained for AIA and HbA1
c measurements.

 8.5.9 Initiating Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Switch ing from Other Insulins to Insulin Glargine  
When switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate - or long-acting insulin to a 
regimen with insulin glargine, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and 
the conc omitant treatment for diabetes may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of 
additional regular insulins or fast-acting insulin analogs ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Switch ing from Twice-Daily Isophane (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn [ NPH ]) 
Insulin to Insulin Glargine  
To reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycemia, subjects who are changing their basal insulin regimen from a twice -daily NPH insulin to a once- daily regimen with 
insulin glargine should reduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20% to 30% during the first weeks of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypoglycemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia may change with a change of insulin regimen, depending on the action profile of the insulins used. Because Lantus
® has a more sustained 
basal insulin supply, fewer nocturnal but more frequent early morning epi[INVESTIGATOR_30342]. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable for subjects in whom hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_30343], such as subjects with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycemia), and for subjects with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if they have not been treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycemia). 
Subject adherence to the prescribed medication, diet, and exercise regimens; correct insulin 
administration; and awareness of symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. If normal or decreased HbA1
c values are noted, the Investigator should 
consider the possibility of recurrent,  unrecognized (especially nocturnal) epi[INVESTIGATOR_30344]. 
Investigators will advise each subject about circumstances in which warning symptoms of 
hypoglycemia may be different, diminished, or absent, and that hypoglycemia (and possible loss of consciousness) may occur before the subject is aware of any symptoms.  
Some factors that may increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia and require particularly close monitoring and possible dose adjustment include: 
• Markedly improved glycemic control after starting the study treatment 
• A known tendency to gradually develop hypoglycemia 
• Older subject age 
• Switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• Autonomic neuropathy

ethical and legal guidelines and regulations. 
8.6.2 FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitori ng System is a glucose-monitoring device 
indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons (age 18 and older) with 
diabetes.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monito ring System aids in understanding the 
person’s  glucose profile and detecting epi[INVESTIGATOR_30346].   
Interpretation of the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System readings will be based o n the trends and patterns analyzed through time using the reports available. 
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring S ystem consists of a sensor with an 
applicator, and reader that is used to start the sensor on the subject and gather the glucose data at the end of the CGM period. The s ensor has a small, flexible filament  that is ins erted 
just under the skin. The sensor can be worn for up to [ADDRESS_795514] a single reader that will  be used for 
all their subjects . Readings from the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System 
will not be made available to subjects in real time and so they will continue performing 
glucose self -testing with the glucometer according to the Investigator’s instructions. The 
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will be used for data collection 
purposes only and will not be used to make treatment  decisions. The s ystem does n ot requir e 
any subject action . 
At the screening visit  and between 8 and 10 days before the visits at Weeks 12 and 26, 
subjects will attend a brief visit so the Investigator or designee can apply a CGM sensor to 
the back of the upper arm  according to the instructions in the FreeStyle Libre Pro User 
Guide. Subjects will also receive a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of meals, and insulin doses for the 8-day CGM period. 
Eight days after the screening visit, the subject may rem ove the sensor and will bring it to the 
randomization visit; if the en d of the 8-day CGM period coincides with the date of the 
randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit. Subjects will bring both their

period before the visit, and the site staff  will remove the sensor at the visit. The Investigator 
or designee will use the reader to retrieve the data from the sensor, and the 8-day M ealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record  will be collected and reviewed. The data from the sensor does not have 
to be uploaded at the time of the visit, but the Investigator will retain each subject’s sensor 
until it is  confirm ed the data have been successfully uploaded. Each sensor will be labeled 
with the subject and visit number and will be stored in a secure location until the end of the 
study after confirmation of successful upload . 
Investigators and staff will review  the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System 
warnings and limitations and instruct subjects about the need to avoid medications and conditions that could interfere with the results .

The data management
 and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by [CONTACT_600661].  
12.1 Data Management 
An e lectronic clinical database (Medidata Solutions) will be us ed and a Data Management 
Plan will be prepared by [CONTACT_30372].  
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available WHO Drug 
Reference Dictio nary. Coexistent diseases and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA).  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked. Any changes to the database after that time can be made only by [CONTACT_600662] & Lee Pharmaceuticals [LOCATION_003] and PRA Health Sciences.  
12.2 Sample Size Estimation  
Enrollment is planned for 550 subjects overall (275 subjects per treatment group). The 
primary a nalysis f or imm unogenicity will be an equivalence test us ing the 2 one- sided t ests 
(TOST) a pproach with α=0.05. This sample size was chosen to achieve ove r 80% power on 
the equivalence test of proportion of subjects unde r the margins dependent on the observed 
treatment-induced AIA rate. For example, a sample size of 550 will provide approximately 
85% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects with treatment-induced AIA 
using an event rate of 30% and a margin of 12% (Table 4 ). The treatment-induced AIA is 
defined as newly c
onfirmed positive AIA development or important (at least a 4-fold) 
increase in AIA titers, after baseline and up to visit Week 26. For this sample size of 550, no 
drop outs are considered in the calculation. Subjects will be encouraged to come back for 
assessments even i f they ha ve discontinued t r eatment  early. 
The similarity margin, based on the actual observed event rate for the intended reference 
product, will be used for final analysis after 
database lo ck as summarized in Table 4. Linear 
interpolation will be used for values between AIA rates in the table.

12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study 
database. The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol. Additional analyses may be added. Table, listing , and 
figures shells will also be provided. 
12.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Gan & Lee Insulin G largine  Injection  or 
Lantus
® treatment.  Subject randomization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_1606].   
Registration and randomization w ill take place using a centralized IXRS. At registration, the 
IXRS will assign a unique subject identification number that will be used on all of that 
subject’s eCRFs and serious adverse event  report forms.  
The study is not blinded. However, to avoid the introduction of operational bias into final study results and to increase the interpretability and reliability of the data , certain roles of the 
Sponsor and study team will be blinded. Details will be provided in the Data Blinding and

12.5 Analysis Sets  
12.5.1 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set is composed  of all randomized subjects who receive any IP , even a 
partial dose  (Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lan tus®). Subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received. All safety and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. 
12.5.2 Full Analysis  Set  
The Full  Analysis Set (FAS) is composed  of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the FAS 
will be grouped according to planned treatment. All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
using the FAS based on the subject’s randomized treatment.  
12.5.3 Per Protocol Set 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set is compo sed of all randomized subjects who received at 
least [ADDRESS_795535] 1 pre- dose assessment that is sufficient to derive plasma 
concentration of insulin glargine, M1, or M2. Subjects in the PK analysis set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received.  
12.6 Statistical Methods  
In general, categorical variables will be summari zed using counts and percentages. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, and standard  deviation, median, minimum 25
th and 75th percentiles, and maximum. All 
summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_600663] l as the total.  All statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS®. The SAS® version number will be noted in the SAP.

 12.8 Key Secondary Endpoint  
12.8.1 Change from Baseline in HbA1 c at 26 Weeks 
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority(EMA) of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus® for HbA1 c by [CONTACT_17921] 90% 
confidence interval with (-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by [CONTACT_30357] 95% CI with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with 
treatmen
t and stratification factor of country included as fixed effects and baseline HbA1 c 
included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation wil l use the 
outcomes of patients who completed the study (including subjects who discontinued treatment but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample)
 to impute outcomes in patients 
without actual visit Week 26 recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c 
will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, equivalence/noninferiority  will be tested with 
a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1
c in the testing 
hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with  supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis 
Set. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30351]. The estimand of interest for the HbA1

(where one is provided, according to local country requirements) will be provided to the Investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance w ith ICH E6 Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement any 
deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement by [CONTACT_600666]/IECs of a protocol amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an imm ediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of 
telephone number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by [CONTACT_1034]. A written amendment must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/IEC s assuming this responsibility. The 
Investigator must await IRB/IEC  approval of protocol amendments before implementing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to subjects. In these cases, the IRB/IEC  must be notified within [ADDRESS_795551] be approved in writing by [CONTACT_600667]/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which require 
notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29614], with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC , the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject , the currently approved written ICF  will require modification. The modified ICF must 
also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1034], appropriate regulatory authorities, and the IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from subject s enrolled in 
the study before participation continues.

 17 APPENDICES  
17.1 Appendix 1: Declaration of Helsinki 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical  Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_795558], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of et hical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a 
whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of 
all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The  health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when  providing medical 
care.” 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimat ely must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research  
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 71 of 77 
 7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and  
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most i nterventions involve risks and burdens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human  subjects 
and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly  vulnerable and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, ani mal experimentation. 
The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving hum an subjects must be 
clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the 
ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest,  incentives for subjects and 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study 
access by [CONTACT_600670].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must  be 
independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_795559] be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_795560]’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed. 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must  normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where 
consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or wo uld pose a threat 
to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may  be done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship  with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_30388].  
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of bene fit for them unless it is  intended to promote the 
health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research  entails only minimal risk and minimal 
burden. 
28. When a pote ntial research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to  
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition  to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent  should be 
respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary cha racteristic of the  research population. In 
such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent  from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if  the research cannot be delayed, 
the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_795561] current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current  proven 
intervention exists; or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for ex ample, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in  a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient-physician relationship. 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking ex pert advice, with informed consent from the patient 
or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating  suffering. Where 
possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

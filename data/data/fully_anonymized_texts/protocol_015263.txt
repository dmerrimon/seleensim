1.0 Background  
 
1.1 KRAS and NRAS mutant colorectal  cancers  
 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the 
[LOCATION_002], afflicting approximately 4.8% of men and women during their lifetimes 
and causing an estimated 50,310 deaths in 2014. Mortality is primarily driven by [CONTACT_941] 20% 
of CRC patients with metastatic disease, who suffer 5 -year overall survival (OS) of only 
12.9% [1]. Patients with metastatic CRC have experienced improvements in median OS, 
from 14.2 months for those diagnosed in 1990 -1997 to over 29 mont hs for those 
diagnosed after 2004 [2]. Much of these improvements are attributable to development of 
novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Previously, only fluoropyrimidines like [ADDRESS_15125] 
options for patients with CRC, but starting in the mid -2000s, increas ing numbers of 
patients were treated with irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and the monoclonal 
antibodies targeting the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR), and more widespread 
use of these agents contributed to improvements in survival [2]. Nevert heless, barring 
surgical resection of oligometastatic disease, inevitably metastatic cancers develop 
resistance to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], resulting in clinical progression and ultimately death. There 
remains a great unmet need to better understand biologic mechanisms of susceptibility to 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15852].  
 
EGFR and proteins involved in its downstream signal transduction play important roles in 
oncogenesis and tumor progression in CRC. EGFR is a tran smembrane receptor tyrosine 
kinase, with an ectodomain that can bind known ligands such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] 
(EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF -α), amphiregulin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], heparin - 
binding EGF, betacellulin, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_15853]. Upon ligand bindin g, EGFR homodimerizes to 
activate downstream intracellular signal transduction cascades, notably including the 
mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via RAS, RAF, and mitogen -activated 
protein kinase kinase (MEK), to ultimately promote cell proli feration and survival [3].  
There are three RAS genes in humans encoding homologous proteins, HRAS , NRAS , and 
KRAS [4]. Mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of KRAS and NRAS are found in 37 -43% of 
CRC patients [5],and contribute to oncogenesis by [CONTACT_15910] a growth 
factor -independent fashion [3]. The RAS proteins are G proteins that are in active 
conformation when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and in inactive conformation 
when bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Oncogenic KRAS mutatio ns hinder 
hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and thus keep KRAS in an active conformation [4]. The active 
conformation of GTP -bound KRAS can then bind other effector proteins, such as the 
RAF family of serine/threonine kinases, to activate them and facilitate activa tion of 
MEK. MEK also functions as a kinase that, when active, phosphorylates and activates 
ERK, ultimately activating a variety of transcriptions factors to drive cell  proliferation.  
 
1.2 Rationale for combination MEK and CDK4/[ADDRESS_15126] demonstrated that RAS mutated 
malignancies may be susceptible to MEK inhibitors, but that monotherapy with MEK 
inhibitors is unlikely to yield a durable and clinically meaningful response. Seven CRC 
cell lines with mutations in exon 4 of KRAS were found to rely on MEK activity for 
proliferation, as they had IC 50 values <100 nM to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 [6].  
6 ACCRU -GI-1618   
CRC cell lines with mutations in exon 2 of KRAS also demonstrated heterogeneous 
responses to MEK inhibitor monotherapy, with seven cell lines showing sensitivity to 
PD0325901 with IC 50<[ADDRESS_15127] [6]. Thus, in vitro data suggests that KRAS mutant CRC cell lines may 
be susceptible to MEK inhibitors, although there are additional mechanisms of resistance 
that need to be elucidated.  
 
Several small molecule inhibitors of MEK have been in clinical trials in malignancies 
harboring mutations in BRAF , KRAS , or NRAS , including CRC. However, results with 
MEK inhibitor monotherapy have been unimpressive to date. Monotherapy with the 
MEK inhibi tor trametinib ([COMPANY_004]1120212) in 12 KRAS mutated CRC patients yielded no 
responses. Four of the 12 patients had stable disease, with duration on study of 31, 28, 16, 
and 16 weeks [7]. Preclinical in vivo work and early phase clinical studies investigating 
combination MEK inhibitor and inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathways have also 
been disappointing. For example, combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor 
selumetinib and the PI3K/MTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in murine patient derived xenografts 
from metastatic  CRC patients showed no tumor responses  [8]. 
 
Although MEK inhibitor monotherapy has not yielded significant responses in early 
clinical trials of KRAS -mutant CRC, it was able to yield significant duration of disease 
stability in one -third of KRAS -mutant C RC subjects. Combining MEK inhibitors with 
cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors is a rational combination to augment 
response. Alterations in cell cycle pathways including CDKs, p16INK4A, and 
retinoblastoma protein (Rb) are increasingly implicated in oncogenesis in RAS -mutated 
malignancies. Mitogenic signals lead to increased synthesis of cyclin D and binding to 
CDK4 or CDK6, which phosphorylate Rb. Hypophosphorylated Rb is bound to the 
transcription factor E2F, but phosphorylated Rb releases E2F, i ncreasing transcription of 
genes promoting progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. The protein 
p16INK4A induces senescence in G1 by [CONTACT_15911] 
D and CDK4/6. While loss of the Rb tumor suppressor is a common  event in 
carcinogenesis, RB1 mutations are very uncommon in CRCs. Non -silent RB1 mutations 
are found in only about 2.7% of CRCs, which does not represent a significant increase 
over the expected background rate of mutations as detected by [CONTACT_15912] [5]. 
Furthermore, since Rb is a tumor suppressor, both alleles of RB1 would need to be 
mutated in order to result in loss of Rb, which is extremely uncommon. In fact, the 
majority of CRCs have higher amounts of Rb detectable by [CONTACT_9064] [9 ]. 
Nevertheless, loss of functional Rb is vital to maintain ongoing cell proliferation, via a 
mechanism independent of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway [10]. RAS mutated 
malignancies often dysregulate the p16/CDK/Rb pathway upstream of Rb. Methylation 
of p16 and subsequent loss of expression is common in KRAS mutant CRCs[11], and 
concomitant p16 methylation and KRAS mutation is associated with worse prognosis in 
CRCs [12]. Thus, CDK4/[ADDRESS_15128] Rb 
is a potential strategy to inhibit proliferation in RAS -mutated malignancies, particularly 
in combination with MEK inhibition, and there is accumulating preclinical evidence 
supporting this strategy.  
 
Combination of MEK inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor is a rational pairin g in RAS mutant 
malignancies given the associations between the EGFR/MAPK pathway and the cell 
cycle machinery. Some of the activity of MEK inhibitors is likely mediated by [CONTACT_15913]. LS1034 and CCCL -18 colon cancer cell lines, which both ha ve mutations 
in KRAS A146T, demonstrated marked decrease in cyclin -D and hypophosphorylation of  
7 ACCRU -GI-1618   
Rb when treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901[6]. Mechanisms of resistance to 
MEK inhibitors may use alternative pathways to uncouple the cell cycle effects from 
MEK inhibition. For example, concomitant PIK3CA mutations and KRAS mutations in 
HCT -[ADDRESS_15129] [13]. Combination of MEK inhibitor and 
CDK4/[ADDRESS_15130] analysis as driving 
the differential gene regulation. Combination treatment with the CDK4/6 i nhibitor 
palbociclib and either of the MEK inhibitors selumetinib or trametinib had synergistic 
effects in vivo in both the inducible NRAS melanoma model and in NRAS -mutant human 
melanoma xenograft models [14].  
 
1.21 Preliminary data supporting combination  MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors in RAS 
mutant CRC  
 
Indeed, the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors has synergistic efficacy 
in KRAS mutant models of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Our work at the University 
of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center demonstrated that t he combination of 
binimetinib and palbociclib synergistically impaired cell viability and growth in 
vitro in a panel of 11 KRAS mutant CRC cell lines[15]. Reverse phase protein 
arrays performed on cell lines after 24 hours of treatment with binimetinib and  
palbociclib demonstrated that combination treatment synergistically decreased 
the level of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, which we confirmed on 
immunoblotting. Though this decrease was blunted in two cell lines with 
concomitant mutated PIK3CA , anoth er cell line with mutated PIK3CA had brisk 
synergistic decrease of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, suggesting that 
PIK3CA mutation alone is not a biomarker of resistance to combination therapy. 
Additionally, the combination of palbociclib and trametin ib caused tumor 
regression in KRAS mutant CRC cell line xenograft models and in KRAS mutant 
patient -derived xenograft (PDX) models, including notably a model with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_15854] A146T mutation [15]. Immunohistochemistry from the PDX model 
showed marked decr ease in staining for the proliferative marker Ki67 with 
combination therapy. RPPA from PDX -derived tissues after 21 days of treatment 
showed greater downregulation of phospho -S6, polo -like kinase 1 (PLK1), and 
cyclin B1  (Ccnb1).

Additional work performed at the University of Michigan demonstrated the 
efficacy of palbociclib and trameti nib in a wider variety of KRAS mutant CRC 
PDX models[16]. This work independently also found synergistic activity of  

[ADDRESS_15132]. Additionally, 18/18 
CRC -derived PDX models had RB expression, confirming that RB loss is an  
exceedingly rare event in CRC. Three KRAS mutant PDX models were tested for 
efficacy of the combination of trametinib and palbociclib in vivo, and objecti ve 
responses were observed in all three models with combination 
trametinib/palbociclib. These models were varied in their genotypes and were 
KRASG12V PIK3CAWT, KRASG12D PIK3CAQ546L, and KRASQ61H PIK3CAE542K. 
[16]. The combination of trametinib and palbocic lib indeed significantly reduced 
phospho -RB as seen on immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. This strong 
preclinical evidence motivated the current clinical trial.  
 
1.3 Investigational Agent Binimetinib (MEK162 /  ARRY -438162)  
 
Binimetinib is an oral, ATP non-competitive, highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2. The 
compound has nanomolar activity against purified MEK enzyme (IC 50 = 12 nM) and 
inhibits both basal and induced levels of ERK phosphorylation in numerous cancer cell 
lines with IC [ADDRESS_15133] (melanoma, CRC, 
pancreatic, non -small cell lung) with tumor regressions in some. Tumor growth inhibition 
correlated with decrease d phospho -ERK levels in all tumor xenografts. Binimetinib has 
also shown significant anti -tumor activity in xenograft models in combination with the 
CDK 4/[ADDRESS_15134] prominent findings were dose -related, reversible hair loss and/or 
scabbing in rats and dose-related, reversible loose or watery stools in monkeys. 
Administration of binimetinib to rats was associated with microscopic findings of 
soft tissue mineralization, skin effects, and minimal to mild clinical pathology 
changes. Gastric mucosal lesions were associated with binimetinib administration 
to rats at 100 mg/kg. In cynomolgus monkeys, administration of binimetinib was 
associated with soft stools, moderate clinical pathology changes in some animals 
and reversible histopathologic changes in the ga strointestinal  tract.  
 
There was no evidence of genotoxicity. Embryo -fetal development studies 
showed evidence of teratogenicity in rabbits (ventricular septal defects and 
outflow tract defects) and decreased ossification that is considered to be 
secondary  to decreased fetal body weights at maternally toxic doses in rats.  
[ADDRESS_15135] chemotherapy agents or immunomodulating 
agents. These patients constitute the binimetinib safety population, which 
includes 229 healthy subjects, 17 subjects with hepatic dysfunction, 6 subjects 
with renal dysfunction, 164 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 2400 patients 
with advanced cancer.  
 
Overall, binimetinib has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Available 
clinical data indicates a safety profile consistent with those reported for other 
allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors. The adverse events observed are generally 
reversible and manageable by [CONTACT_15916]/or dose 
modification. The most frequent treatment -related AEs in patients receiving 
binimetinib include rash,  dermatitis acneiform, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
peripheral edema, fatigue, and CPK elevation. Other clinically relevant toxicities 
are retinal events, increase of blood pressure, decrease of ejection fraction, and 
noninfectious pneumonitis which are mon itored closely.  
 
Important potential adverse effects associated with the administration of the 
binimetinib have been established primarily from safety data from the phase 3 
COLUMBUS study in which it was combined with the BRAF inhibitor 
encorafenib in pati ents with unresectable or metastatic melanoma  
(https://www.accessdata.fd a.gov/dr ugsatfda_docs/label/2018/210498lbl.pdf), and 
include:  
 
• Left ventricular dysfunction : Symptomatic or asymptomatic  decreases 
in ejection fraction occurred in 7% of patients, with Grade 3 left 
ventricular dysfunction occurring in 1.6% of  patients.  
• Hemorrhage : Hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients, with events ≥ 
Grade 3 occurring in 3.2% of patients. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in 
the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of 
patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, 
including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and 
hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%).  
• Venous thromboembolism : Occurred in 6% of patients, including 
3.1% of patients who developed pulmonary  embolism.  
• Ocular toxicities : Serous ret inopathy is a class effect of MEK 
inhibitors. It is generally asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and 
reversible [22]. Serous retinopathy occurred in 20% of patients. 
Symptomatic serous retinopathy occurred in 8% of patients with no 
cases of blindness. The median time to onset of the first event of serous 
retinopathy (all grades) was 1.2 months. RVO is a known class -related 
adverse reaction of MEK inhibitors and may occur in patients treated 
with binimetinib in combination with encorafenib. In patients with 
BRAF mutation -positive melanoma across multiple clinical trials, 0.1% 
of patients experienced  RVO.  
• Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease: Pneumonitis occurred in 0.3% 
of patients with BRAF mutation -positive melanoma across multiple 
clinical  trials.  
11 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• Hepatotoxicity : The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver 
function laboratory tests was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline 
phosphatase. No patient experienced Grade 3 or 4 serum bilirubin 
elevation.  
• CK Elevation/Rhabdomyolysis : Asymptomatic elevations of laboratory 
values of serum CK occurred in 58% of patients. Rhabdomyolysis was 
reported in 0.1% of patients with BRAF mutation -positive melanoma 
across multiple clinic al trials.  
• Embryo -Fetal Toxicity : Binimetinib can cause fetal harm  when 
administered to pregnant  women.  
 
1.4 Investigational Agent Palbociclib  (PD-0322991)  
 
1.41 Preclinical pharmacology and  toxicity  
 
Altered glucose metabolism (glycosuria, hyperglycemia, decreased insulin) 
associated with changes in the pancreas (islet cell vacuolation), eye (cataracts, 
lens degeneration), teeth (degeneration/necrosis of ameloblasts in actively 
growing teeth), kidney (tubule vacuolation, chronic progressive nephropathy), 
and adipose tissue (atrophy) were identified in the [ADDRESS_15136] prevalent in males at doses ≥30 
mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the human exposure [AUC] at the 
recommended dose). Some of these findings (glycosuria/hyperglycemia, 
pancreatic islet cell vacuolation, and kidney tubule vacuolation) were present in 
the [ADDRESS_15137] not been conducted with palbociclib.  
 
Palbociclib was aneugenic in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro and in the 
bone marrow of male rats at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Palbociclib was 
not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation  (Ames) assay and was not 
clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay.  
 
In a fertility study in female rats, palbociclib did not affect mating or fertility at 
any dose up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times human clinical e xposure 
based on AUC) and no adverse effects were observed in the female reproductive 
tissues in repeat -dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the rat and 3 
mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 6 times and similar to human exposure 
[AUC], at the recom mended dose, respectively).  
 
The adverse effects of palbociclib on male reproductive function and fertility 
were observed in the repeat -dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs and a male 
fertility study in rats. In repeat -dose toxicology studies, palbocic lib-related 
findings in the testis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], prostate, and seminal vesicle at ≥30 mg/kg/day 
in rats and ≥0.2 mg/kg/day in dogs included decreased organ weight, atrophy or 
degeneration, hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, lower sperm motility and  
12 ACCRU -GI-1618   
density, and decreased secretion. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ 
effects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4 - and 12 -week non -dosing 
period, respectively. These doses in rats and dogs resulted in approximately ≥10  
and 0.1 times, respectively, the exposure [AUC] in humans at the recommended 
dose. In the fertility and early embryonic development study in male rats, 
palbociclib caused no effects on mating but resulted in a slight decrease in 
fertility at 100 mg/kg/day  with projected exposure levels [AUC] of [ADDRESS_15138] 
cancer patients.  
 
In a study of palbociclib 125 mg/day plus letrozole 2.5 mg/day versus letrozole 
alone, in which [ADDRESS_15139] cancer received at leas t 1 dose of treatment with 
palbociclib/letrozole, the median duration of treatment for palbociclib was 13.8 
months while the median duration of treatment for letrozole on the letrozole - 
alone arm was 7.6 months. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction o f any 
grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole. Permanent 
discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 7 of 83 (8%) 
patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole and in 2 of 77 (3%) patients 
receiving letroz ole alone. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those 
patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole included neutropenia (6%), asthenia 
(1%), and fatigue (1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any 
grade reported in patients in the pa lbociclib plus letrozole arm were neutropenia, 
leukopenia, fatigue, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], nausea, stomatitis, 
alopecia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, asthenia, 
peripheral neuropathy, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. The most freque ntly reported serious 
adverse reactions in patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole were pulmonary 
embolism (3 of 83; 4%) and diarrhea (2 of 83; 2%). An increased incidence of 
infections was observed in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (55%) compare d to 
the letrozole alone arm (34%). Febrile neutropenia has been reported in the 
palbociclib clinical program, although no cases were observed in this  study.  
Grade ≥3 neutropenia was managed by [CONTACT_15917]/or dose delay or 
temporary discontinuation  consistent with a permanent discontinuation rate of 
6% due to neutropenia.  
 
In another study of palbociclib 125 mg/day plus fulvestrant [ADDRESS_15140] 1 dose of 
treatment with palbociclib/fulvestrant, dose reductions due to an adverse reaction 
of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant. 
Permanent discontinuation associated with  an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 
345 (6%) patients receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant, and in 6 of 172 (3%) 
patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to 
discontinuation for those patients receiving palbociclib plus fu lvestrant included 
fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%). The most 
common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the  
[ADDRESS_15141] frequently 
reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant were  infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary 
embolism (1%).  
 
1.5 Control Agent Trifluridine/Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]  (TAS -102) 
 
1.51 Preclinical pharmacology and  toxicity  
 
TAS -102 is an orally administered chemotherapeutic drug comprised of the 
combination of trifluridine, a cytotoxic thymidine -based nucleic acid analogue, 
and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor that prevents overly rapid 
degradation of trifluridine to allow for therapeutic plasma concentrations for 
longer durations. N o long -term studies evaluating the carcinogenic potential of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_15857]. Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_15858] a reverse mutation test in bacteria, a chromosomal aberration test in 
mammalian -cultured cells, and a micronucleus test in mice. Animal studies did 
not indicate an effect of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_15859]. Dose -related

1.52 Clinical experience with  TAS-102 
 
TAS -102 is currently FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic CRC after 
prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine -, oxaliplatin -, and irinotecan -based 
chemotherapy, an anti -VEGF biologic therapy, and an anti -EGFR therapy if 
wild-type in RAS. In a randomized (2:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled trial,  
533 patients (median age 63 years; 61% men; 57% White, 35% Asian, 1% Black) 
with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer received TAS -102 as a single 
agent at a dose of 35 mg/m2/dose administered twice daily on Days 1 through 5 
and Days 8 through 12 of each 28 -day cycle. The mean duration of TAS -102 
therapy was 12.7 weeks. The median progression -free survival on this trial was  
2.0 months (95% confidence inter val 1.9 -2.1 months)[17]. These results were 
also true in the KRAS mutant subgroup (n=407), with median PFS of 1.9 mo [18]. 
The most common adverse drug reactions or laboratory abnormalities (all Grades 
and greater than or equal to 10% in incidence) in pati ents treated with TAS -102 
at a rate that exceeds the rate in patients receiving placebo were anemia, 
neutropenia, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, 
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. In the study, 3.6% of patient s 
discontinued TAS -102 for an adverse event and 13.7% of patients required a 
dose reduction. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction 
were neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and  diarrhea.  
 
2.0 Goals  
 
2.1 Primary  Objective  
 
2.11 The primary objective is to compare the progression -free survival (PFS) between 
those randomized to palbociclib/binimetinib and those randomized to  TAS -[ADDRESS_15142] 1.1 criteria between those 
randomized to palbociclib/binimetinib and those randomized to TAS -102 in 
patients with refractory KRAS - or NRAS -mutant metastatic  CRC.  
 
2.22 To compare the overall survival (O S) between those randomized to 
palbociclib/binimetinib and those randomized to TAS -[ADDRESS_15143] for response or resistance to combination of  palbociclib/ binimetinib.  
 
2.32 To determine the correlation between circulating tumor DNA and tumor response 
or resistance to therapy with palbociclib/binimetinib or  TAS -102. 
 
2.33 To determine the association between Consensus Molecular Subtype based  on 
gene expression profiling and response or resistance to combination of 
palbociclib/binimetinib.

6.[ADDRESS_15163] begin ≤[ADDRESS_15164] o f two parts: Part 1 is a safety run -in to confirm the safety and tolerability of the doses of 
binimetinib and palbociclib determined in a preceding independent Phase I study; and Part 2 is a 1:[ADDRESS_15165] of care therapy TAS -102 (trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]).  
Subjects randomized to the TAS -[ADDRESS_15166] the option of crossing over to therapy with the 
combination of palbociclib and binimetinib upon progression.  
 
7.1 Part 1: Safety  Run-In 
 
In Part 1, an initial cohort of 6 patients will receive palbociclib orall y once daily on days 1 -21 out 
of a 28 day cycle and binimetinib orally twice per day continuously per Dose Cohort 1 in the table 
below. The starting dose of palbociclib will be 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 -21 out of a 28 
day cycle (Dose Cohort 1; see  Table 7.1).  
 
Dose Cohort  Binimetinib Dose  Palbociclib Dose**  
-1 30 mg BID daily  75 mg daily Days 1 -21 
1* 30 mg BID daily  100 mg daily Days 1 -21 
* Starting dose  level  
** Dose levels as listed in Table 1 are provisional, and actual dose levels will be determined per 
discussion with participating investigators during dose escalation teleconferences and may 
differ from those presented in Table 1. If the starting dose is not well tolerated, with 2 or more 
subjects experiencing excessive toxicity as defined  in Section 7.15, then dose de -escalation will 
be studied to determine a safe and tolerable dose in this population of colorectal cancer 
patients.  
 
7.11 Rules for Dose  De-escalation  
 
Dose de -escalation will be considered if Dose Cohort 1 per Table 7.1 proves ex cessively 
toxic, with 2 or more subjects having excessive toxicity as defined in Section 7.15. If this is 
the case, an additional 6 patients will be enrolled at Dose Cohort -1 with dose de - 
escalation.  
 
Dose de -escalation will proceed per the tables below: 
Dose Cohort 1  
If there are…  Then…  
0-1/6 subjects with excessive  
toxicity per Section 7.15  Proceed to Part II  
≥2/6 subjects with excessive

≥2/6 subjects with excessive  
toxicity per Section 7.15  STOP. Will need to 
reconsider dosing scheme  
 
7.12 Patient  Cohorts  
 
Six patients will be treated at each dose level and observed for a minimum of 28 days from 
the day that treatment is initiated with binimetinib and palbociclib (Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 
1 Day 28), to assess toxicities, before new patients are treated. Doses will not be escalated 
in any individu al patient.  
 
All patients who receive the assigned treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicities 
to make a dose escalation decision.  
 
If any patient in Part 1 withdraws from the study for any reason other than study drug 
toxicity or adverse event p rior to completing one 28 -day cycle of treatment with the study 
drugs, then he/she may be replaced. Otherwise, patients will not be replaced on study.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_15167] the ACCRU Operations Office (507 -266-0800) as soon as any 
event comprising excessive toxicity per S ection 7.15 occurs.  
 
7.14 Re-Starting Patients on Treatment Following Excessive Toxicity  event  
 
For all toxicity grades, if the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within 1 week of 
onset, treatment may be resumed at the same or a lower dose level at the investigator’s 
discretion and following discussion with the study chair. For toxicities that result in 
treatment delays of more than 7 but not more than 21 days, treatment may be resumed at a 
lower dose level.  
 
If a patient requires a dose interruption of >[ADDRESS_15168] 
possibly related to binimetinib and/or palbociclib that occurs during the first 28 days of 
treatment and fulfills any of the criteria in the table below. Toxicity is evaluated according 
to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Whenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfills the criteria 
for an excessive toxicity event, treatment with the study drug will be interrupted and the 
toxicity will be followed up.  
32 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
For this protocol, excessive toxicity events will be defined as follows:  
 
• Grade 3+ Febrile  Neutropenia  
• Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased > 7 consecutive  days 
• Grade 4 platelet count  decreased  
• Grade 4+  anemia  
• Non-hematologic AE: Any Grade ≥4; Grade 3 requiring dose modification  (dose 
reduction per section  8.0) 
o In addition:  
▪ Ejection fraction decreased: Grade  ≥2 
▪ Retinal vascular disorder if comprised of retinal vein occlusion as 
assessed by [CONTACT_15922]: Grade  ≥2 
 
If 2 or more patients (out of 6) experience any of the above, then we will a) de -escalate or  
b) temporarily stop the trial to re -assess the drug dose.  
 
7.2 Part 2: Randomized Phase II Study and Optional  Crossover  
 
After confirming the optimal safe and tolerable doses of combination binimetinib and palbociclib 
in Part 1, eligible patients will be enrolled in an open -label, 1:1 randomized clinical trial of 
binimetinib/palbociclib (arm A) vs. TAS -102 monotherapy (arm B).  
 
Subjects in arm B who discontinue study therapy due to disease progression per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_15169] to cross over will need to re -register ≤28 days from progression on 
TAS -102 and will undergo monitoring as per subjects in arm A. Up to 24 cycles of crossover 
treatment is allowed.

9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care  
 
Patients should recei ve full supportive care while on this study. This includes blood product support, 
antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions. All blood 
products and concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesi cs, and/or antiemetics received from 
the first day of study treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the 
medical records.  
 
9.1 Permitted concomitant therapy requiring caution and/or action with binimetinib  therapy  
 
Binimetinib potently inhibits CYP2B6 (Ki of 1.67 µM). Based on these in vitro findings, 
binimetinib may inhibit the metabolic clearance of co -medications metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6 if 
sufficiently high concentrations are achieved in vivo. At 45 mg BID, the maxi mum concentrations 
achieved in plasma are normally <1.5 µM so the risk of drug interaction is limited. Caution should 
be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with other drugs that are substrates of this 
enzyme.  
 
Binimetinib induced CYP3A4 in vitro; however no clinically relevant inhibition or induction was  

55 ACCRU -GI-1618   
observed in a clinical midazolam -based drug interaction study [CMEK162A2105] following 14 
days of repeat dosing of binimetinib.  
 
Binimetinib is primarily metabolized via glucuron idation by [CONTACT_15924]1A1. It is advised that inhibitors 
or inducers of UGT1A1 should be taken with caution when co -administered with binimetinib.  
 
In vitro data showed that binimetinib is a substrate of P -gp as well as a substrate of BCRP. Thus, 
the use of drugs that are known to inhibit or induce P -gp and BCRP should be used with caution.  
 
The solubility of binimetinib is pH -dependent, and a 10 -fold decrease in solubility is observed 
between pH 1 and 2. However, the extent of binimetinib exposure (AUC) was not al tered in the 
presence of a gastric acid reducing agent (rabeprazole) [Clinical Study ARRAY -162-105].  
 
Drugs with a conditional, possible, or known risk to induce Torsade de Pointes (TdP) should be 
used with caution. Patients receiving such medications must  be carefully monitored for potentiating 
of toxicity due to any individual concomitant medication, and may require dose titration of the drug 
substance. Investigators should use caution when prescribing co -medications, as clinical experience 
with these com pounds in patients with cancer is often limited.  
 
Refer to Appendix I for list of medications to be used with caution when administered with 
binimetinib.  
 
9.2 Management of nausea and/or vomiting (on binimetinib  arm)  
 
Because nausea and vomiting have been reported for binimetinib, it is recommended that patients 
are educated on the possibility of occurrence of these side effects prior to starting study treatment. 
Patient education as well as proper management of nausea and/or vomiting at the first sign is 
important.  
 
Clinical judgment and experience of the treating physician should guide the management plan of 
each patient. Patients experiencing nausea and/or vomiting ≥ Grade 1 by [CONTACT_3989] v4.03 will 
receive antiemetics at the discretion of the treating physici an (as per local guidelines). It is 
recommended that patients be provided a prescription for antiemetics, and are instructed on the use 
of antiemetics on the first day of study drug treatment. Prophylactic antiemetics such as 
dexamethasone 8 mg, prochlorpe razine, or metoclopramide may be administered to patients on an 
"as needed" basis.  
 
Dose interruption/reduction decisions for nausea and/or vomiting should be based on the CTCAE 
grade of the toxicity and the guidelines provided in Section  8.4. 
 
As a guidance  for recommendations  on supportive  measures  for the prevention  and/or  management 
of nausea and/or vomiting, the published recommendation from American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and Multinat ional 
Association of Supportive Care (MASCC) can be used [19,  20]. 
 
9.3 Diarrhea (on binimetinib  arm) 
 
9.31 Proactively investigate for occurrence of diarrhea and educate  patients  
 
• Remind patients at each visit to contact [CONTACT_15925]. Additionally, at each study 
visit, each patient should be asked regarding occurrence of diarrhea or diarrhea - 
related symptoms. If the patient had symptoms, the patient should be asked 
regarding the actions taken for these symptoms and re -instruct if  indicated.  
56 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
• The patients should be instructed on dietary modifications and on early warning 
signs of diarrhea and potentially life -threatening illnesses (e.g. severe crampi[INVESTIGATOR_15869] a sign  for severe diarrhea, fever with diarrhea might be a sign for 
infection, fever and dizziness on standing might be a sign for  shock).  
 
• Patients should be educated about what to report to the Investigator (i.e., number of 
stools, stool composition, stool  volume).  
 
9.32 Anti-diarrheal  therapy  
 
• In order to effectively manage diarrhea and mitigate the escalation in severity or 
duration of diarrhea, patient education as outlined above as well as proper 
management of diarrhea is  important.  
 
• Management of diarrhea shoul d be instituted at the first sign of abdominal 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], loose stools or overt diarrhea. All concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15870]. It is recommended that patients  be provided loperamide tablets 
and are instructed on the use of loperamide at on the first day of binimetinib 
treatment. In addition to the binimetinib induced -diarrhea dosing guidelines, these 
instructions should be provided at each visit and the site sh ould ensure that the 
patient understands the  instructions.  
 
• Explain the frequency of diarrhea and its relationship to NCI CTCAE  grading.  
 
• Determine if diarrhea is complicated or  uncomplicated.  
 
9.33 Rule out other or concomitant causes 
These may  include:  
• Infection with Candida, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Giardia, 
Entamoeba and Cryptosporidium species can lead to severe infections in 
immunosuppressed  patients  
• Medication -induced  diarrhea  
• Malabsorption/lactose  intolerance  
• Fecal  impaction, partial bowel  obstruction  
 
9.34 For uncomplicated Grade 1/2 diarrhea  
 
• Stop all lactose -containing products, alcohol and eat frequent small meals that 
include bananas, rice, applesauce or  toast  
 
• Stop laxatives, bulk fiber (i.e. Metamucil®) and stool softeners (e.g. docusate 
sodium; Colace®)  
 
• Stop high -osmolar food supplements such as Ensure® Plus and Jevity® Plus (with 
fiber)  
 
• Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day (e.g. water, Pedialyte®, 
Gatorade® or  broth)  
57 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• Consider  administration of standard dose of loperamide: initial administration 4 
mg, then 2 mg every 4 hours (maximum of 16 mg/day) or after each unformed 
stool.  
 
• Discontinue loperamide after 12 -hours diarrhea -free (Grade 0)  interval.  
 
• If uncomplicated Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, escalate to 
high dose loperamide: 2 mg every 2 hours (max. of 16 mg/day) or after each 
unformed  stool.  
 
NOTE: Oral antibiotics may be started as prophylaxis for infections under the discretion of 
the physician.  
 
• If uncomplicated Grade 1 to Grade 2 diarrhea persists after 48 hours of treatment 
with loperamide, discontinue loperamide and begin a second -line agent which  can 
be an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] (opi[INVESTIGATOR_11983]), octreotide acetate or steroid 
(budesonide)  
 
9.35 For co mplicated Grade 1/2 diarrhea or any Grade 3 to 4  diarrhea  
 
• The patient must call the investigator  immediately  
 
• If loperamide has not been initiated, initiate loperamide immediately. Initial 
administration 4 mg, then 2 mg every 4 hours (maximum of 16 mg/day) or after 
each unformed  stool  
 
• Administer IV fluids and electrolytes as needed. In case of severe dehydration,  
replace loperamide by  [CONTACT_15926].  
 
• Monitor/continue IV fluids and antibiotics as needed. Intervention should be 
continued until the patient is diarrhea free for at least 24  hours.  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15871].  
 
9.4 Skin Toxicity (on binimetinib  arm) 
 
Clinical judgment and experience of the treating physician should guide the management plan of 
each patient. In general, the following interventions are in addition to the rash dosing guidelines in 
Section 8.4:  
 
• Prophylaxis of skin toxicity to be initiated [ADDRESS_15181] treatment with study 
drug or later as  needed  
 
• Application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_11971], scalp, 
neck, upper chest and upper  back 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15872] -oily sunscreen (PAB A free, SPF ≥30, UVA/UVB protection), topi[INVESTIGATOR_15873] (preferably mometasone cream i.e. Elocon®) and topi[INVESTIGATOR_15874] (i.e. 
Eryaknen® or topi[INVESTIGATOR_11974])  
 
NOTE : Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11975] a daily basis starting on Day [ADDRESS_15182] dose, and more often as needed.  
58 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• Possibly oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for the first 2 -3 weeks of study drug 
administration.  
 
Other effective medications are antihistamines, other topi[INVESTIGATOR_15875], other topi[INVESTIGATOR_11976] -dose systemic corticosteroids.  
 
The treatment algorithm based on CTCAE grade is as  follows:  
 
9.41 Mild rash (CTCAE Grade  1) 
 
• Consider prophylactic rash treatment if not already  started  
 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15876] (i.e. mometasone cream) and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_15877] (i.e. erythromycin 2%) are  recommended.  
 
• The patient should be reassessed within a maximum of 2 weeks or as  per 
investigator  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
 
9.42 Moderate rash (CTCAE Grade  2) 
 
• Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15878] (1%) plus topi[INVESTIGATOR_15879] (1%) plus oral antibiotics such as: doxycycline (100 mg BID) 
or minocycline (50 to 100 mg  QD).  
 
• Although there has been no evidence of phototoxicity or photosensitivity in 
patients being treated with binimetinib, doxycycline (or minocycline as second - 
line) should be used with thorough UV protection (i.e., avoidance of direct 
exposure to sunlight, use of sunscreen and sunglasses,  etc.).  
 
• Use of acitretin is not  recommended  
 
9.43 Severe rash (CTCAE Grade  3) 
 
• In addition to the interventions recommended for moderate rash, consider oral 
prednisolone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Upon improvement, taper the dose in a 
stepwise manner (25 mg for 7 days, subsequently decrea sing the dose by 5 mg/day 
every  day).  
 
• Alternatively, in addition to the interventions recommended for moderate rash, 
consider oral isotretinoin (low doses, i.e. 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg) (Lacouture et al  2011)  
 
• Use of acitretin is not  recommended  
 
9.44 Severe rash (CT CAE Grade  4) 
 
• Immediately discontinue the patient from study drug and treat the patient with oral 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910] (see recommendation CTCAE Grade  3). 
 
9.45 Symptomatic  treatment  
 
It is strongly recommended that patients who develop rash/skin toxicities receive 
symptomatic treatment  
59 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• For pruritic lesions, use cool compresses and oral antihistaminic  agents  
 
• For fissuring, use Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate, or zinc oxide cream. If not 
sufficient use mild steroid ointments or combinations of steroids and antibiotics 
such as  Fucicort®  
 
• For desquamation, use emollients with mild pH 5/neutral (best containing  urea 
10%)  
 
• For paronychia, antiseptic bath and local potent corticosteroids, use oral antibiotics 
and if no im provement is seen, refer to a dermatologist or  surgeon  
 
• For infected lesions, obtain bacterial and fungal cultures and treat with topi[INVESTIGATOR_15880]  
 
9.5 Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and following 
institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should follow published 
guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Recommendations for the Use 
of WBC Growth Factors: American Soc iety of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline 
Update. J Clin Oncol  2015;33:3199 -3212.  
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and  Monitoring  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or n ot 
considered drug related . 
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event.  
 
Expedited Reporting  
Events reported to sponsor within [ADDRESS_15183]  
Events that would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_15881], but that 
for a specific protocol are being  reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the review of 
safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]).  
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_15184] access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.03. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP  web 
site: (  
 
a. Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical  trial. 

60 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
b. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version  4.03.  
 
c. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section  10.2).  
 
d. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section  10.3).  
 
e. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the 
timeframe/mechanism (see Section  10.4).  
 
f. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section  10.5). 
 
g. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data 
reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.5 and  18.0).  
 
Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event  used for 
medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT). 
NOTE: A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT the same as serious AE which 
is defined in the table in Section 10.4.  
 
10.2 Expected vs. Une xpected  Events  
 
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study specific 
consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if an investigator 
brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general investigational plan).  
 
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 15.0 of the 
protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in the investigato r 
brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed); if an investigator 
brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan.  
 
Unexpected also refe rs to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not been observed with the drug 
under investigation.  
 
10.3 Assessment of  Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the 
following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s)/treatment. 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s)/trea tment. 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s)/treatment. 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/treatment. 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)treatment.  
 
Events determined to  be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment 
suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug/device and the 
adverse event.  
 
10.31  Protocol -Specific Exceptions to Expedited  Reporting  
61 ACCRU -GI-1618   
10.311  The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3517] 
“adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15882] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15883] (where the condition 
requiring the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15884])  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3521] a device (e.g., battery  replacement) 
that was in place before study  entry  
 
10.312  Death  
 
• Any death occurring wit hin [ADDRESS_15185] dose, regardless of 
attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within  24-hours.  
 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/int ervention under an 
IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within  24-hours.  
 
• Reportable categories of  Death  
 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE  term.  
 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_15929] 28 days of  life. 
 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a 
CTCAE term associated with Grade  5. 
 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one 
hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of 
life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term a ssociated with 
Grade  5. 
 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade  5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including 
cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the 
system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the 
death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., 
radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: 
clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should 
be submitted.  
 
10.313  Secondary  Malignancy  
 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial  neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignan cies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND/IDE  to be reported.  Three  options  are available  to describe  the event:  
62 ACCRU -GI-1618   
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., AcuteMyeloctyic 
Leukemia  [AML])  
 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary  malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.314  Second  Malignancy  
 
• A second  malignancy  is one unrelated  to the treatment  of a prior malignancy  (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine  reporting.  
 
10.315  Pregnancy  
 
To ensure patient safety, pregnancies  or lactation  (both those of female patients 
and female partners of male patients) occurring while the patient is on study 
treatment must be reported to ACCRU within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, inclu ding 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications.  
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A and reported by [CONTACT_15930]. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same 
form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study 
treatment any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must 
be reported on the MedW atch Form 3500A.  
 
If a pregnancy occurs while on study treatment, the newborn will be followed for 
at least [ADDRESS_15186] obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian. A consent form will need to be submitted to the 
IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, 
no information may be collected.  
 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, the 
child/fetus is the patient.  
 
NOTE: When submitting the MedWatch Form 3500A reports for  “Pregnancy”, 
“Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk of exposure of the fetus to 
the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the 
“Description of Event” section. Include any available medical documentation . 
 
10.4 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Commercial Agent(s) – Palbociclib + Binimetinib or  TAS -[ADDRESS_15187] the sponsor -investigator in notifying the FDA if  required.  
 
10.5 Other Required  Reporting  
 
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in  general, 
include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following  criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are describe d in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB - 
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics 
of the subject population being  studied;  
 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, 
possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  and 
 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater r isk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or 
psychological harm associated with adverse events. In  other cases, unanticipated problems 
place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.

Submit via appropriate ACCRU Case Report Forms (i.e., paper or electronic as applicable) 
the following AEs experienced by a patient and not specified in Section 10.5:  
 
10.531 Grade 1 and 2 AEs deemed possibly, probably, or definitely relate d to the study 
treatment or procedure.  
 
10.532 Grade 3 and 4 AEs regardless of attribution to the study treatment or procedure.  
 
10.533 Grade 5 AEs (Deaths)  
 
10.5331Any death within 30 days of the patient’s last study treatment or procedure 
regardless of attribution to the study treatment or procedure.  
 
10.5332Any death more than 30 days after the patient’s last study treatment or 
procedure that is felt to be at least possibly treatment related must also be 
submitted as a Grade [ADDRESS_15188] once a week (or  
more frequently if required by [CONTACT_15931], or if clinically indicated) for [ADDRESS_15189] be reported as follow -up to the 
original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. 
An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrela ted 
to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new  event.  
 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the MedWatch 3500A Form; all 
applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough 
report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each 
specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the 
MedWatch 3500A Form, and send the completed form to ACCRU.  
 
Follow -up information is sent to the same contact(s) to whom the original SAE Report 
Form was sent, using a new MedWatch 3500A Form stating that this is a follow -up to the 
previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, 
comp lication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that 
event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the p atient 
continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
 
10.55  Late-Occurring Adverse  Events  
 
Refer to the instructions in the Forms Packet (or electronic data entry screens, as 
applicable) regarding the submission of late occurring AEs following completion of t he 
Active Monitoring Phase (i.e., compliance with Test Schedule in Section 4.0).  
 
10.56  Quarterly Report: Research Coordinating Center will provide [COMPANY_007] with accrual and 
a toxicity report on a quarterly  basis.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_15190]  Guideline  
 
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the table 
regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
67 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) (26) . Changes 
in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of th e tumor lesions and the short axis measurements 
in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline . 
 
11.[ADDRESS_15191] diameter can be 
accurately measured as 2.[ADDRESS_15192] x -ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_15193] 
compo nent of a PET/CT, or  MRI.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_15194] diameter is ≥1.0 cm in 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging. In the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a r uler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
 
11.213  A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_15195] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 
mm).  
 
NOTE: Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable 
disease.  
 
NOTE: “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non -cystic l esions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 
cm are considered non - pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or 
followed.  
 
11.22  Non-Measurable  Disease 
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non -measurable disease, including 
pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pu lmonis, inflammatory 
breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non - 
measurable as well.  
 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable  Disease  
 
11.31  Measurement  Methods:  
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of 
centimeters) using a ruler or  calipers.  
68 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_15196] -treatment tumor  assessments.  
 
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_15932] a treatment.  
 
11.32  Acceptable Modalities for  Measurable  Disease:  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is ≤[ADDRESS_15197] slice thickness >[ADDRESS_15198], if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of t he type 
and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse 
sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans. Body scans should be perfo rmed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if  possible.  
 
11.33  Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation  
 
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the SD 
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks (see Section 
11.44).  
 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stab le disease 
(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive  disease.  
 
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and  CR 
in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where  
known residual benign tumors can  remain.)  
 
11.[ADDRESS_15199]  
 
11.41  Target Lesions & Target Lymph  Nodes  
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions  and 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as “Target Lesions” and 
recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non -nodal or nodal (as 
defined in 11.21) , where no more than 2 lesions are from the same organ and no 
more than 2  malignant nodal lesions are  selected.  
 
NOTE: If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified, there is 
no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to 
discover new lesions.  
69 ACCRU -GI-1618   
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their size, 
be representative of all involved sites of disease, and in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible, repeated measurements. It may be the case 
that, on occas ion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurements, in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or 
malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be  selected.  
 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable 
dimension of the  disease.  
 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest diameter for 
all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be 
calculated and repor ted as the post -baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD). If the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph 
node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or 
target lymph node) is bel ieved to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_15200] that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded a s 0 cm. 
 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the 
PBSD.  
 
11.42  Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph  Nodes  
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target lesions or non - 
target lymph nodes and shou ld also be recorded at baseline. These lesions and lymph nodes 
should be followed in accord with Section 11.43.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_15201]/MRI/PET -CT/Chest X - 
ray/physical examination must be measured on re -evaluation at evaluation times 
specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in objective status to either a PR or 
CR cannot be done without re -measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
NOTE: Non-target lesions and non -target lym ph nodes should be evaluated at 
each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of 
response. In selected circumstances, certain non -target organs may be evaluated 
less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated on ly when 
complete response is identified in target disease or when progression in bone is 
suspected.  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
• Complete Response (CR)  - All of the following must be  true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all target  lesions.  
 
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.0 
cm. 
70 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
• Partial Response (PR)  - At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all 
the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD 
(see Section  11.41).  
 
• Progression (PD)  - At least one of the following must be  true:  
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_15202] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest  diameter  for 
all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD 
(Section 11.41). In addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the  MSD. 
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD)  - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR,  nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the  MSD.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes  
 
• Complete Response (CR)  - All of the following must be  true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target  lesions.  
 
b. Each non -target lymph node must have a reduction in short axis  to 
<1.0 cm.  
 
c. Normalization of tumor biomarkers (i.e.  CEA)  
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD - Persistence of one or more non-target lesions or non - 
target lymph nodes and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits . 
 
• Progression (PD)  - At least one of the following must be  true:  
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and increased 
to ≥1.0 cm short axis during  follow -up. 
 
b. Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions and non - 
target lymph nodes. ( NOTE : Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion and target lymph node status. It must 
be representative of overall disease status  change.)  
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.

IRB review and approval. This collection is p art of a general strategy of 
investigation for the majority of ACCRU studies.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_15207] been validated by [CONTACT_15935] -approved laboratories.  
 
15.0 Drug  Information  
 
 Refer to the package insert for complete, up -to-date information.  
 
 
15.1 Binimetinib (MEK162, ARRY -438162,  ONO -7703)  
 
15.11  Background  
 
Binimetinib is an orally bioavailable, selective and potent MEK1 and MEK 2 inhibitor. As 
a MEK inhibitor, this compound has the potential to benefit patients with advanced cancers 
by [CONTACT_15936] (mitogen -activated protein kinases) pathway.  
 
15.12  Formulation : Binimetinib drug product is supplied as film -coated tablets in a dose 
strength of [ADDRESS_15208] of binimetinib, colloidal silicon 
dioxide/silica colloidal anhydrous; croscarmellose sodium; lactose monohydrate; 
magnesiu m stearate; microcrystalline cellulose/cellulose, microcrystalline; and a 
commercial film coating. The tablet is ovaloid biconvex (capsule shaped), yellow to dark 
yellow in  color . 
 
15.13  Preparation and storage : Binimetinib film -coated tablets should not be stor ed above 
25°C and should be protected from light. Tablets are packaged in plastic bottles acceptable 
for pharmaceutical  use. 
 
Binimetinib oral suspension prepared from 15 mg binimetinib tablets should not be stored 
above 25°C and should not be refrigerated. The suspension should be used within 30 days 
after preparation.  
 
15.14  Administration: Binimetinib is administered twice daily with water, approximately 12 
hours apart with or without meals. Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not  be 
chewe d. 
 
Binimetinib oral suspension is intended for oral administration as prepared.  
 
15.15  Pharmacokinetic  information : 
Absorption: The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib are characterized by [CONTACT_15937], accumulation of approximately 1.[ADDRESS_15209] eady state concentrations 
reached within 15 days . The human ADME study CMEK162A2102 indicated that 
approximately 50% of binimetinib dose was absorbed.  
 
Distribution: Binimetinib is more distributed in plasma than blood. The blood -to- 
plasma concentration r atio of binimetinib in humans is 0.718. It is highly bound to 
plasma proteins (humans: 97.2%).  
75 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
 
Metabolism: The primary metabolic pathways include glucuronidation (up to 61.2% via 
UGT1A1), N -dealkylation (up to 17.8% via CYP1A2 and CYP2C19) and amide 
hydrolysis.  
 
Excretion : Results of a human ADME study indicated 62% of the dose was eliminated in 
feces, and 31% was eliminated in the urine. The T 1/2 range was 8.1 -13.6 hours, median 8.66 
hours.  
 
Results from a hepatic impairment study indicate the exposure of binimetinib in mild 
hepatic impairment is similar compared to that of subjects with normal liver function; 
study results indicate exposures patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment may 
be increased up to approximately 2 -fold [Clinical Study  CMEK162A2104].  
 
Results from a renal impairment study indicate the exposure of binimetinib in subjects with 
severe renal impairment is 14 -29% higher compared to that in healthy subjects [Clinical 
Study ARRAY -162-106].  
 
15.16  Potential Drug  Interactions : 
Overall, the risk for binimetinib to be a cause of or be affected by [CONTACT_15938] -drug 
interactions is predicted to be low. However, given the predominant role of UGT1A1 in the 
metabolism of binimetinib, and because the effect of a UGT1A1  inhibitor or inducer has 
not been evaluated in a formal clinical study, special consideration should be taken for co - 
administration of drugs that are UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers, and administration of 
binimetinib to patients with low UGT1A1 activity.  
 
Binimetinib has been shown to be a substrate for P -gp and BCRP in vitro. The impact of P - 
gp/BCRP inhibitors on the PK of binimetinib in vivo is unknown; therefore, it is 
recommended that P -gp and BCRP inhibitors are dosed with caution.

15.36  Potential Drug  Interactions  
 
Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., 
zidovudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with FTD/TPI, may theoretically compete 
with the effector of FTD/TPI, i.e., FTD, for activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, 
when using antivir al drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for 
possible decreased efficacy of the antiviral agent, and consider switching to an alternative 
antiviral agent that is not a human thymidine kinase substrate such as: lamivudine,  
zalcitabine, d idanosine, abacavir, etc.

patients enrolled on the experimental arm (palbo+bini) before randomization. (details see Section 
16.62). Other endpoints of interest that will be evaluated are adverse even ts, overall survival, and 
overall response rate.  
 
16.2 Statistical  Design  
 
16.21  Primary  Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint for this study will compare PFS between palbociclib/binimetinib vs. 
TAS -[ADDRESS_15221] at 
one-sided level 0.05. The stratification factors listed in Section 5.1 will be used for 
the analysis. The HR for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model and the 95% CI for the HR will be provided. Results from an 
unstratifie d analysis will also be provided. Kaplan -Meier methodology will be 
used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves 
will be produced.  
 
16.22  Decision  Rule 
 
The primary goal is to compare PFS between those randomized to palbociclib/ binimetinib 
and those randomized to TAS -102. The alternative hypothesis is that the combination of 
palbociclib and binimetinib has improvement in PFS compared to TAS -102. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_15222] th e alternative hypothesis at the  
interim (i.e. reject palbociclib/binimetinib as effective), the HR will need to be ≥  
1.043 for palbociclib/binimetinib compared to TAS -102, which corresponds to a 1 - 
sided p -value of 0.551 or larger. Otherwise, if the HR is < 1.043 (1 -sided p -value  
<0.551), the study will continue to full accrual, and the final analysis will be 
conducted as discussed below.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_15223] the alternative hypothesis at the final 
analysis (i.e. re ject palbociclib/binimetinib as effective), the HR will need to be ≥  
0.68 for palbociclib/binimetinib compared to TAS -102, which corresponds to a 1 - 
sided p -value of 0.05 or larger. Otherwise, if the HR is < 0.68 (1 -sided p -value < 
0.05), the palbociclib/b inimetinib treatment will be considered effective. All 
eligible patients who sign the consent form, are randomized, and receive any 
protocol treatment will be considered evaluable for this endpoint.  
 
16.23  Power and Significance  Level  
 
If we enter 45 evaluable p atients to each arm of the study using a 1:1 randomization 
scheme (90 evaluable patients in total), then with a total of [ADDRESS_15224] 
90% power to detect an improvement in the median PFS from 2 to 4 months (hazard ratio 
(HR) = 0.5), assuming  a 1-sided significance level of 0.05 and an accrual rate of 8 patients 
per month. The trial has a single interim analysis for futility, adopting Rho family (Rho =  
3) beta spending function, for controlling the overall type II error rate.  
 
The operating ch aracteristics of current design are tabulated below. Probabilities reported 
in the table are calculated based on simulation study with 50,000 replicates.

all analyses relating to OS will be descriptive in nature. No formal statistical tests 
will be performed. We will use Kaplan -Meier methods to evaluate time to event 
endpoints, and will report median OS and its 95% confidence interval.  
 
16.243  Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be describe d by [CONTACT_15950] [ADDRESS_15227] initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for 
assessing adverse event rate(s). For patients that elect to crossover, only AEs that 
occur prior  to crossover will be considered for this endpoint. AEs after crossover 
will be described independently. The maximum grade for each type of adverse 
event will be recorded for each patient, and described using frequency tables. The 
adverse events will be co mpared by [CONTACT_15951].  
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be 
taken into consideration.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_15228] formal 
statistical power testing. Analyses that are planned for correlative studies are described in 
Section 17.3.  
 
16.3 Sample  Size 
 
The study design to be utilized is fully described in Section 16.2 and includes a planned interim 
analysis. There will be 45 evaluable patients randomized to each arm of this study (total of 90 
patients). We anticipate accruing an additional 5 patients in each arm (10 total) to account for 
ineligibilities, cancellations, major violations, or ot her reasons. Including 6 -12 patients for early 
adverse event assessment in the experimental arm, thus the maximum accrual is 112 patients in 
total.  
 
16.4 Accrual Time and Study  Duration  
 
We conservatively estimated the accrual rate at about 8 patients per month , as enrollment of 
KRAS/NRAS mutant refractory metastatic CRC on clinical trials at each site is at least 1-[ADDRESS_15229] 
over a year to  complete.  
 
16.5 Over  Accrual  
 
If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patient s will not be used to 
evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15901]; however, they will be  
[ADDRESS_15230] (DSMB). 
Reports containing patient characteristics, toxicity and administrative information will be 
provided to the DSMB every six months, with the first report due at the first reporting 
period after study initiation.  
 
16.62  Early Adverse Assessment in Experimental Arm (Safety  Run-In) 
 
To ensure safety before randomization, the first [ADDRESS_15231] of these 6 patients becomes evaluable for toxicity (started protocol treatment and 
either: 1, completed one cycle of AE assessments or 2. went off treatmen t prior to one 
cycle), the data from these first 6 patients will be reviewed. If there are 0 -1 excessive 
toxicities (as defined in Section 7.15) among the first [ADDRESS_15232] the decision - 
making process.  
 
Patients in Arm A enrolled before randomization for early toxicity assessment (Safety 
Run-In Cohort)  
 
i. will not be used to evaluate the efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15902];  
ii. will not be included in the primary and secondary efficacy comparison; will be 
included in the descriptive analysis of adverse events and analyses in translational 
study.  
 
16.63  Adverse Events Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15903] d on the knowledge available at the time of 
study development. We note that the Adverse Event Monitoring Rule may be adjusted in 
the event of either (1) the study re -opening to accrual after any temporary suspension or (2) 
at any time during the conduct of  the trial and in consideration of newly acquired 
information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may also choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events 
considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e., an adverse event with attribute 
specified as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite ”) that satisfy any of the following criteria 
for each arm separately:  
87 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
 
• If at any time 3 of the initial 10 treated patients or ≥30% of all patients on the 
experimental arm (i.e., when accrual is greater than 10 patients) have experienced 
at least one grade [ADDRESS_15233] possibly related to protocol treatment at 
any point during treatment, excluding lymphocytopenia, uncomplicated 
neutropenia <7 days, and uncomplicated leukopenia <7  days.  
• If at any time [ADDRESS_15234] possibly related to protocol treatment (not due to progressive 
disease).  
 
NOTE: For evaluation of the AE Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15904], we will only consider patients that 
are included in the randomized portion of the  trial.

17.28  If a corresponding H&E wasn’t submitted with the block/slides, the ACCRU Operations 
Office  will request  a slide  to be  processed  (i.e., cut and  H&E stained)  from  the tumor  tissue 
block at the IHC core facility at Mayo Clinic  [COMPANY_002]ster.  
 
17.3 Study Methodology and Storage Information 
Submitted tissue samples will be analyzed as  follows:  
17.31  Archival formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tissue will be collected for the following 
research:  
 
17.[ADDRESS_15237] differential 
response to combination palbociclib/binimetinib. In addition, we will investigate 
whether alterations in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway predict for  differential  

89 ACCRU -GI-1618   
 
responses to combination palbociclib/binimetinib.  
 
17.312  We will perform gene expression profiling to determine gene expression subtypes 
via the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS subtypes). Distinct CMS subtypes 
are associated with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics, differential prognosis, 
and activation of dis tinct signaling pathways.[21] We will investigate whether 
CMS subtypes are associated with efficacy of therapy  withpalbociclib/binimetinib.  
 
17.313  We will perform immunohistochemistry to confirm staining with  retinoblastoma 
protein is present at baseline. Additi onal immunohistochemical stains may be 
considered as  well.  
 
17.314  ACCRU will batch ship blocks/slides to The University of [LOCATION_007] MD  Anderson 
Cancer Center at the end of the  study.  
 
17.32  At the completion of the study, any unused/remaining material will be stored at the The 
University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center for future research according to the 
patient consent permission (see Section 6.15). Potential future research may include 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses to analyze predictive biomarkers, changes in 
expression pattern with therapy, and correlation with response and/or adverse events. 
When a protocol is developed, it will be presented for IRB review and  approval.  
 
17.[ADDRESS_15238].  
 
17.35  Return of Genetic Testing Research Results: No genetic specimens will be collected from

Appendix III: Study Contraception Guidelines  
 
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, 
must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 12 weeks after 
study drug discontinuation.  
 
Highly effective contraception methods include:  
 
• Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
NOT acceptable methods of  contraception  
• Double barrier methods  
o Condom with spermicide in conjunction with use of an intrauterine  device  
o Condom with s permicide in conjunction with use of a  diaphragm  
• Birth control patch or vaginal ring  
• Oral, injectable, or implanted  contraceptives  
• Surgical  sterilization  (have  had surgical  bilateral  oophorectomy  with or without  hysterectomy)  or 
tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, 
only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_15956] (LH), follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH), and/or  estradiol.  
• Male ster ilization (at least 6 months prior to registration). For female patients on the study, the 
vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that  patient  
 
NOTE: Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had  12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, 
history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) or tubal ligation ≥[ADDRESS_15245] use highly effective methods of contra ception throughout the study and for 12 
weeks after study drug discontinuation and should not father a child in this period.  
 
Highly effective contraception methods include:  
 
• Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of t he patient. Periodic

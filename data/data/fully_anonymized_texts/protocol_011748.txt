1.1 Introduction 
Approximately 20,000 hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) are performed in the United 
States each year (Pasquini MC. 2014 CIBMTR Summary Slides ). Myeloablative allogeneic 
HCT remains the only potential cure for leukemia, lymphoma, and hematopoietic disorders, 
however , it is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Myeloablative 
conditioning (MAC) refers to the necessary chemotherapy and/or radiation regimen used in 
stem cell transplant to eliminate residual leukemia/lymphoma and condition the host for the 
incoming graft of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).  
Non-relapse mortality (NRM), defined as mortality from complications of HCT but not tumor 
relapse, is usually from graft v ersus host disease (GVHD), infection, or organ failure. NRM 
after allogeneic HCT is influenced by [CONTACT_92901] (related vs. unrelated), conditioning 
chemotherapy doses, and co-morbidities of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. In a study reported by [CONTACT_92902], 2-year NRM in myeloablative allogeneic HCT was 14% to 41% based on patient 
comorbidities (1). In a recent clinical trial ( BMTCTN 0901) comparing conditioning 
chemotherapy regimens of different intensities in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) , the 
overall NRM was 16% at 18 months  (2).  
HCT after myeloablative conditioning has several associated toxicities such as 
pancytopenia, mucositis, interstitial pneumonitis, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/ VOD) , and sepsis. These HCT toxicities are 
induced by [CONTACT_92903] a pro-inflammatory state 
with elevated inflammatory cytokines such as IL -1 and tumor necrosis factor -alpha ( TNF-α) 
(3). The inflammatory response increases antigen presenting cell (APC) activity presenting 
minor histocompatibility antigens to T-cells resulting in acute GVHD  in 35-50% of HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Acute GVHD is a leading risk factor for chronic GVHD which  is present in 40-
70% of all HCT (3 ). GVHD, infection, and organ failure as a consequence of HCT 
contributes to NRM after all ogeneic HCT. The one-year NRM at Virginia Commonwealth 
University (VCU) in 2014-2015 was 10-20% for patients receiving HLA -matched related 
donor grafts (MRD) and 20 - 40% in those with unrelated donor grafts (MUD)  (4, 5).  
The NRM risk, mediated by [CONTACT_2898], endothelial injury, and GVHD, may be mitigated 
by [CONTACT_92904] C  which has several beneficial effects in patients with sepsis -
associated acute inflammation including reduction in endothelial injury, hemodynamic 
instability, organ dysfunction and markers of inflammation (6 ). These effects are partly 
mediated by [CONTACT_92905] (ROS), an important cons equence of 
both sepsis and high-dose chemoradiotherapy  (7). We have demonstrated at our institution 
that patients’ pre-HCT are deficient in vitamin C and remain deficient out to Day +[ADDRESS_102673] (8 ).  
This phase [ADDRESS_102674] by [CONTACT_92906], endothelial and organ injury , as well as GVHD and will result in a reduction in the risk of transpla nt-related 
mortality.  
 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -17-[ZIP_CODE]  12 Version #:  6 
IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /[ADDRESS_102675] to achieve long-term freedom from disease 
progression in patients with recurrent hematological malignancies. This combination 
results in a pro-inflammatory state that resembles severe sepsis. The tissue damage results in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF -α), and the net effect is acute GVHD  (9). Immunosuppression administered to 
prevent GVHD increases the risk of both relapse, as well as opportunistic infections, 
contributing to the observed high non-relapse mortality following allogeneic HCT. Evidence 
of the deleterious impact of the pro-inflammatory state comes from biomarker studies using 
ferritin and C-reactive protein ( CRP) as well as cytokines IL- [ADDRESS_102676]. A review of 
the patients transplanted at VCU has found that elevated ferritin (>2020 G/dL) was 
associated with an increased risk for GVHD and inferior survival in patients transplanted for myeloid malignancies  (4).  
CRP  produced by [CONTACT_92907]-6 is widely used as a reliable surrogate 
marker of inflammation ( 10). After allogeneic HCT, the elevation of CRP has been shown 
to be associated with transplant-related mortality  (11). In a study by [CONTACT_92908]., the 
correlation between the pre-engraftment CRP value and subsequent clinical events was 
analyzed to test whether high CRP reflected the degree of tissue damage because of the conditioning regimen, infections, and allogeneic immune reactions and/or inflammation, all of which could contribute to subsequent GVHD and NRM. They found that CRP > 15 
mg/dL was associated with a significant increase in GVHD and decreased overall survival  
post-allogeneic HCT (12). Another marker of tissue damage, cell -free DNA (cfDNA), is 
released as a result of cell necrosis or apoptosis and has been studied as a biomarker in severe sepsis  (13). In a retrospective, observation study of 80 patients with severe sepsis 
in the intensive care unit (ICU), cfDNA had a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 94% for 
predicting mortality in the ICU  (13). Systemic release of TNF -α during pre-HCT 
conditioning is highly predictive for occurrence of acute GVHD  and related complications 
and one-year transplant- related mortality in patients receiving allogeneic HCT (14, 15). 
Vitamin C’s pleotropic effect on the inflammatory process was demonstrated by [CONTACT_92909] (LPS) followed by [CONTACT_92910] C. Vitamin C reduced the reactive oxygen species and the production of  
pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α  and IFN -γ, as well as increasing the anti -inflammatory 
cytokine IL- 10. Also, glutathione (GSH) and G6PDH enzymes were increased in this study 
supporting the role of vitamin C as anti -oxidant (16). 
The endothelial injury syndromes such as microangiopathy, VOD  of the liver, diffuse 
alveolar hemorrhage, engraftment syndrome, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_92887] a major 
cause of NRM after allogeneic HCT. Further, biomarkers of endothelial injury such as 
thrombomodulin show  a close relationship with GVHD (17). Tatekawa et al., generated a 
novel diagnostic system for transplant related complications from endothelial injury by 
[CONTACT_42781] [ADDRESS_102677] and found that the peripheral 
blood levels of biomarkers angiopoieti n 2 (ANG2), CRP, D -dimer, and thrombomodulin at 
the onset were associated with transplant related complications with endothelial cell damage (18). These may then also serve as important biomarkers for endothelial injury 
and potentially its  response to vitamin C therapy in the setting of HCT, as proposed in the 
MCC -17-132999 study . 
 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -17-[ZIP_CODE]  13 Version #:  6 
IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /2022  High-dose vitamin C has been used in patients with septic shock to reduce inflammatory 
state. Nathens et al  used parenteral vitamin C dosed at 1 gram every 8 hours combined 
with oral vitamin E for 28 days in 594 surgically critically ill patients and found a statistically 
significantly lower incidence of acute lung injury and multiple organ failure (19). In a phase 
1 clinical trial performed at VCU, Fowler  and colleagues found that high-dose parenteral 
vitamin C (200 mg/kg/24hours) was safe to administer with no adverse events and was 
effective at reducing inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. All patients with severe sepsis had below normal serum vitamin C levels. Patients treated with parenteral vitamin C 
had a significant rise in serum vitamin C compared to placebo (6 ). To assess the effects of 
parenteral vitamin C on inflammation they assessed organ function in severe sepsis by [CONTACT_92911] (SOFA), and inflammatory biomarkers, CRP, procalcitonin and thrombomodulin. CRP and SOFA levels decline with both low and high doses of 
parenteral vitamin C compared to placebo (Figure 1). Thrombomodulin levels remained 
stable compared to placebo, which trended upward (6 ). Given the significant immune 
modulatory and anti -inflammatory effects of parenteral vitamin C in patients with septic 
shock demonstrated in the above-referenced studies, we have hypothesized that IV ascorbic acid in BMT patients undergoing myleoablative allogeneic SCT will impact not only early conditioning-induced complications such as mucositis, sepsis, VOD, and acute 
lung injury, but also modulate immune reconstitution and ameliorate remote events such 
as acute and chronic GVHD. This will likely have a salutary effect on immune reconstitution as well as diminishing the likelihood of severe late opportunistic infections, resulting in improved survivability of myeloablative allogeneic SCT.  
Patients undergoing myeloablative HCT are deficient in vitamin C, as reported by [CONTACT_92912] C were normal before HCT, but deficient by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_102678]  levels  at Day 14. In the 
same study, ferritin (a biomarker of inflammation ) increases inversely as vitamin C declines  
(20). A similar state of vitamin C deficiency has been observed in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_92888]. The pleiotropic anti -inflammatory effects of vitamin C make 
it an attractive intervention in HCT, which is a pro-inflammatory state that physiologically resembles severe sepsis.

as GVHD and immune reconstitution (21), which in turn affect the likelihood of NRM. The

results of the vitamin C levels are illustrated in Figure 2. The mean plasma vitamin C 
level was low at 40.8 μmol /L (±18.4) at baseline, falling to 27.3 μmol/L (±14.1) at 
Day 0 (p < 0.05, compared with baseline) , and reaching nadir at 21.5 μmol/L (± 
13.8) on Day 14 (p <0.05 compared with baseline) post-HCT. Plasma vitamin C 
levels recovered to 34.2 μmol/L (± 20.5) at D ay 30 and subsequently to 37.2 μmol/L 
(± 27.9) at Day 60 (p < 0.05 compared with D ay 14). Of the patients studied, none 
maintained normal v itamin C levels throughout the study period and 13/15 
developed significantly deficient vitamin C levels of < 28 μm ol/L. Patients with 
severe mucositis tended to have lower vitamin C levels at Day 14. These patients 
also had cfDNA levels measured, and as can be seen in Figure 3, elevated cfDNA 
during the conditioning phase of HCT and throughout the [ADDRESS_102683] (n=15). This is consistent with tissue injury sustained during conditioning prior to HCT.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS  AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS  
8.1 Definitions 
8.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
8.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A SAR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
AE. “Reasonable possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
An AE with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite (Section 8.1.8) is a SAR. 
8.1.3 Serious AE (SAE) or Serious SAR (SSAR)  
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it results in 
any of the following outcomes : 
• death, 
• a life-threatening AE or SAR  (An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in 
the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an AE  or SAR  that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.), 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
Planned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92890] . Events 
that prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92891], however, subject to SAE reporting requirements. 
• a persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -17-[ZIP_CODE]  23 Version #:  6 
IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /2022  judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
8.1.4 Unexpected SAR  
A SAR is considered “unexpected” if: 
• it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed;  
• or, if an investigator brochure is not required, is not consistent with the risk information described in the prescribing information. 
“Unexpected” as used in this definition, also refers to SARs that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as  anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the drug under investigation. 
8.1.5 Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
Unanticipated problems include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents , such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the patient population being studied; 
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests that the research places patients or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
8.1.6 AE D escription and Grade 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE  v5.0) will be utilized for AE 
reporting. 
8.1.7 AE Expectedness  
AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’. Refer to Section 8.2 regarding expected 
AEs. Unexpected AEs are those AEs occurring in one or more patients participating 
in the study, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:  
• The known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved 
in the research that are described in (a) the protocol -related documents , such as 
the IRB -approved research protocol and the current IRB-approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as 
product labeling and package inserts; or  
 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -17-[ZIP_CODE]  24 Version #:  6 
IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /2022  • The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or 
condition of the patient(s) experiencing the AE and the patient’s predisposing 
risk factor profile for the AE. 
8.1.8 AE Attribution 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study intervention. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study intervention. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study intervention. 
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study intervention. 
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study intervention. 
8.2 Known AEs Related to Vitamin C  
Too rapid infusion of intravenous vitamin C solution may cause temporary faintness or  
dizziness. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, and stomach 
cramps.  
8.3 Recording AEs, SAEs, and UPs 
All recordable AEs per protocol  (defined in Section 8.4), all SAEs, and all UPs will be 
recorded in MCC’s OnCore Clinical Trial Management System. In most cases, it is 
acceptable to record only the highest grade of a toxicity occurring during a particular study 
segment when an event has serial fluctuations in grade over time. 
SAEs will be entered into the OnCore SAE domain. UPs will be entered into the OnCore 
Deviations domain. An SAE that is both an SAE and a UP will be entered in both domains. 
For all SAEs, a corresponding entry should be made in the routine AE record to match the event entries in the SAE domain. Additionally, events related to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_92892]. 
8.4 Time Period and Grade of AE  Capture  
AEs ≥  grade [ADDRESS_102700] grade of each relevant toxicity during that period will be recor ded. 
Exception: Cytopenias and changes in electrolytes  will not be recorded. Only clinical 
events and lab values reflecting renal function (eg, creatinine, urinalysis results) will be 
recorded as AEs. 
8.5 AEs Requiring Expedited Reporting 
All patients in this study will be receiving potentially toxic preparative therapy, therefore, 
significant regimen-related toxicity is anticipated, ie, expected AEs.

Acidification of the urine by [CONTACT_92915][INVESTIGATOR_92894], urate or oxalate stones (renal calculi) and will alter the excretion of certain other drugs 
administered concurrently.  
Large doses interfere with the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.  
Ascorbic acid has on occasion been used as a specific antidote for symptoms 
resulting from interaction between ethanol and disulfiram (Antabuse®) . It may be 
expected that the concurrent administration of high doses of vitamin C  could 
interfere with the effectiveness of disulfiram given to patients to encourage abstention from alcohol.  
Because ascorbic acid is a strong reducing agent, it interferes with numerous laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions. Diabetics taking more than

IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /2022  13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Statistical Methods 
13.1.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary outcome in this study is  non-relapse mortality (NRM)  at one year . 
13.1.2 Secondary Endpoints (with  measurement type)  
• Time to engraftment (in days)  
• Acute GVHD (days to positive diagnosis: time-to -event; positive diagnosis: 
categorical)  
• AEs of grade ≥  3 possibly, probably, or definitely related to the vitamin C 
regimen (counts by [CONTACT_92920])  
13.1.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
• Chronic GVHD (days to positive diagnosis: time-to -event; positive diagnosis: 
categorical)  
• Overall survival  
• Relapse-fre e/GVHD -free survival  
• Levels in blood over time of vitamin C and exploratory biomarkers  
13.1.4 Statistical Analysis  
The primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between the study cohort 
and a historical cohort matched for age, donor type, and diagnosis. The NRM rate 
will be compared to the historical 35% rate (see Section 13.2  below) using a one-
sided exact binomial test. Time-to-event outcomes (time to engraftment, acute and chronic GVHD, and overall and relapse-free survival) will be graphically represented with a Kaplan-Meier step-function and will be assessed for associations with serum vitamin C levels and patient demographic measurements using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. Associations between blood levels of vitamin C and other exploratory endpoints will be estimated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients . 
13.2 Sample Size and Power Determination 
The sample size and power are calculated based on Simon’s two-stage minimax design, 
which minimizes the expected maximum sample size under the alternative hypothesis. The previous  [ADDRESS_102709] seen an ~15% NRM rate in MRD patients and an ~40% 
NRM rate in MUD patients. Given that MRDs comprise ~25% of total transplantations and MUDs comprise ~75%, we then assume an overall 35% NRM rate. The null hypothesis that the NRM rate is 35% will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In order to achieve 80% power (with 5% significance) to declare an NRM of 20% significantly smaller than the 
 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -17-[ZIP_CODE]  37 Version #:  6 
IND #: 138924  Version Date: 12/06 /2022  hypothesized null NRM of 35%, we will accrue 31 patients in stage 1 and an additional 24 
patients in stage 2 (provided the trial is not stopped early for futility). At the end of stage 1, 
if there are 11 or more NRMs in the 31 stage 1 patients, the study will be stopped for 
futility. Otherwise, 24 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 55. The null hypothesis will not be rejected if 14 or more NRMs are observed in the total 55 patients. We anticipate a 32% screen failure rate, leading to a recruit ment target of  81 subjects 
(VCU sees ~[ADDRESS_102710]/MUD patients per month). The number of MUD patients will be 
limited to 80% . 
The population evaluable for the primary endpoint includes all patients who receive at least one dose of IV vitamin C and who have a known survival status at one year. Patients who 
are enrolled to the study but do not receive any IV vitamin C or who are lost to follow up at one year will be replaced.

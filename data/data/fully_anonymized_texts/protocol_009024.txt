2.[ADDRESS_782004] response rates to relapse chemotherapy: various chemotherapeutic agents, 
such as paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, docetaxel, platinum, 
etoposide, ifosfamide , gemcitabine, and vinorelbine are available but result in 
response rates of 7 -40% [1, 2] . Unfortunately, relapse therapy is not curative and 
treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials demonstrated that anti -
angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with 
chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 
16-24% with an acceptable toxicity profil e [3, 4] . However resistance can 
develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore other novel anti -angiogenic agents, such 
as Nintedanib , should be evaluated in the treatment of ovarian cancer.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_782005] commonly used anti -angiogenic agent is bevacizumab, a monoclonal 
antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Several clinical 
trials have evalu ated bevacizumab in recurrent ovarian cancer. In a GOG phase II 
study that evaluated bevacizumab in patients who had failed prior chemotherapy, 
Burger and colleagues reported a response rate of 21% and a median response 
duration of 10 months with 40.3% of patients remaining progression -free at 6 
months  [3]. Another phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of combination 
bevacizumab and low -dose cyclophosphamide and demonstrated a response rate 
of 16%, a median  PFS was 4.4 months with 27.8% of patients remainin g 
progression free at 6 months  [4]. In these two trials the most common adverse 
events (AEs) were proteinuria, hypertension, and arterial thrombotic events  [3-5]. 
In view of the promising results with bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian 
cancer seen in the phase II setting, there are four phase III trials examining 
whether the addition of this anti -angiogenic therapy to carboplatin -based 
chemotherapy improves cl inical outcome in the primary and recurrent settings. 
The results of these trials have recently been presented and demonstrated a PFS 
benefit for concurrent followed by [CONTACT_592835] -line 
treatment of ovarian cancer  [6, 7] . We an ticipate increased use of bevacizumab in 
patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian, peritoneal, and tubal 
cancers.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_782006], there may be an advantage to continue VEGF -blockade, and this has 
been demonstrated clinically. In a phase II trial, 40 patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) who had previously been treated with bevacizumab 
(PMH Phase  II Consortium Trial) were treated with aflibercept (VEGF Trap). Of 
the 24 evaluable patients there was 1 partial response, 17 with stable disease, and 
7 with stable disease at 16 weeks. Nine patients were not yet evaluable for 
response. The 4 month PFS ra te and median PFS were 29% and 3.4 (1.9 -NR), 
respectively, and were similar compared to those patients who were bevacizumab 
naïve  [8]. Furthermore, in a prospective observational study, 1,[ADDRESS_782007] progression (BBP): (1) no post -progressive disease (PD) treatment (n=25 3); 
(2) post -PD treatment without bevacizumab (no BBP; n=531); and (3) BBP 
(n=642). The median OS rates were highest in the BBP group (31.8 months vs. 
12.6 vs. 19.9), in the no post -PD treatment and no -BBP groups, respectively. In 
multivariate analyses, co mpared with no BBP, BBP was strongly and 
independently associated with improved survival (HR, 0.48; P < .001). These 
findings strongly suggest that continued VEGF inhibition, in this case with 
bevacizumab, beyond initial PD may have utility in the manageme nt of 
previously bevacizumab -treated patients  [9]. Theoretically, an agent, such as 
Nintedanib , that can simultaneously inhibit the VEGF pathway as well as the 
alternate pro -angiogenic  pathways, may prevent tumor resistance to VEGFR 
inhibition and enhance anti -tumoral effects.  
 
2.4 Background Information and Experience with Nintedanib  
 
Nintedanib is a potent small molecule multi receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(PDGFR α/β (platelet derived growth factor receptor ), FGFR 1/3 (fibroblast 
growth factor receptor ), VEGFR 1 -3 (vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor ))[10] . On the molecular level, Nintedanib  is thought to inhibit the 
signaling cascade mediating angiogenesis by [CONTACT_356691] (ATP) binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain, thus 
interfering with cross -activation via autophosphorylation of the receptor 
homodimers. Besi des inhibition of neo -angiogenesis, tumor regression may also 
be achieved by [CONTACT_592836]. 
Inhibition of receptor kinases may also interfere with autocrine and paracrine 
stimulation of tumor angiogenesis via ac tivation loops involving VEGF, PDGF, 
and bFGF utilized by [CONTACT_592837]. In vitro , the target receptors are all inhibited by [CONTACT_592838]. In in vivo  nude mouse models, Nintedanib showed 
good anti -tumor efficacy at doses of 50 – 100 mg/kg, leading to a substantial 
delay of tumor growth or even complete tumor stasis in xenografts of a broad 
range of differing human tumor types including SKOV3 ovarian cancer 
xenografts  [11].

 Safety of Nintedanib : A total of [ADDRESS_782009] been treated with Nintedanib  
or placebo for oncological indications, of which more than 1400 patients 
(numbers estimated for ongoing studies involving blinded controls) have 
received the verum compound.  In total, [ADDRESS_782010] received Nintedanib  as 
monotherapy in phase I and phase II studies, 195 patients received Nintedanib  
(verum) in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy mostly in phase I dose 
escalation trials, and of the [ADDRESS_782011] for the respective indication [10]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_592805] -angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The predominant AEs were nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue of mostly low to moderate 
intensity.  Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were mainly confined to reversible 
hepatic enzyme elevations (AST, ALT, and γ-GT) which increased dose -
dependently  [10].  
The results from phase I monotherapy trials indicated that the MTD was [ADDRESS_782012] udies including Caucasian patients, and 200 mg bid 
Nintedanib  in Japan.  
 
The predominating dose limiting AEs of Nintedanib  were increases of liver 
enzymes that were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_592806]. Hepatic  
transaminase elevations of grade > 2 were absent at doses below the MTD, 
occurred  occasionally at the MTD dose, and increased in frequency at doses 
above the MTD.  
 
The safety profile overall appeared largely similar between Caucasian and 
Japanese patients,  with the sole exception that the pro pensity to experience liver 
enzyme increases may be  higher in Japanese patients. The lower MTD for bid 
dosing in Japanese patients was primarily  due to a higher incidence of reversible 
liver enzyme increases of grade >  2, which started to  occur at the dose  of 200 mg 
bid, whereas in trials including primarily Caucasian patients,  liver enzyme 
increases of grade >  2 were only observed starting at a dose of 250 mg bid.  
 
According to data from trials 1199.1 -3, splitting the cumulative daily dose into 
two doses i ncreased the tolerability of Nintedanib : at a total daily dose of 500 mg 
of Nintedanib  (250 mg  bid), 25% of the patients had dose limiting toxicities 
compared to more than 60% of the  patients treated with once daily 450 mg of 
Nintedanib  (1199.1 -1199.3).  
 
The phase I data indicate that continuous treatment with [ADDRESS_782013] from the background 
incidence in advanced cancer patients.  
 
Safety in pooled Phase I and II monotherapy trials with starting doses of 100 mg 
bid to 250 mg bid, also including all re spective patients from phase I trials treated 
at these doses in addition to the data from the phase II trials. The overview 
includes data of 334 patients: [ADDRESS_782014] not rec eived Nintedanib  in these trials 
(e.g., placebo -treated patients from trial 1199.9) are not considered.  
 
Gastrointestinal side effects and liver enzyme increases represented the leading 
AEs. Gastrointestinal AEs rarely were of CTCAE grade >  2, and the fre quency 
did not obviously increase with increased doses of Nintedanib  up to 250 mg bid.  
 
Similar to the phase I studies, liver enzyme increases of grade > 2 were only 
observed in the high dose group of 250 mg bid, and across all trials the only 
exception we re Japanese patients (phase I trial 1199.19), and Asian patients with 
hepatic impairment (1199.39, Asian patients with hepatocellular cancer). As in 
the phase I trials, increases of liver enzymes occurred within the first two months 
of treatment. Liver enz yme increases of grade >  2 were less frequent at a dose of 
200 mg bid Nintedanib . Among the phase II trials using 250 mg bid Nintedanib  
as starting dose, the frequency of liver enzyme increases grade > 2 exceeded 
33%.  
 
This frequency was higher than observed in other phase II trials for the same 
dose. In view of this observation, the absence of grade >  2 liver enzyme increases 
at 200 mg bid in Caucasian patients and the MTD of 200 mg bid in Japanese 
patients, the dose currently recommended for Nintedanib  monotherapy is 200 mg 
bid. 
 
Experience with Nintedanib  in ovarian cancer : With respect to the phase II trials 
in ovarian cancer, Nintedanib  was evaluated as maintenance therapy in patients 
with relapsed  ovarian cancer that had responded to a pre ceding line of 
chemotherapy (Study 1199.9)  [10]. Eighty -four patients were randomized to 
either Nintedanib or placebo. The median treatment duration was 116 days with 5 
patients randomized to Nintedanib completing 9 months of therapy compared to 
none of th ose in the placebo group.  The dose was 250 mg twice daily.  The 36 -wk 
PFS rates were 15.6% (95% confidence interval (CI)): 3.8 - 27.3) for Nintedanib 
and 2.9% (95% CI: 0.0, 8.4) for placebo. Although the trial was not powered for 
a direct comparison, the PFS hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.42, 1.09). Median 
time to progression based on RECIST criteria was 4.8 months for Nintedanib , 
and 2.8 months for p lacebo. Grade 3 and 4 AEs were reported in 54 and 7% 
compared to 25 and 3% in the  Nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively. 
Expected grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities as well as elevated liver enzymes 
occurred more frequently in the Nintedanib group ( GI: 16% vs. 10%; elevated 
LFTs: 43% vs. 6.3%). The findings suggested that maintenance Nintedanib could 
delay disease progression in patients with ovarian cancer who had previously 
responded to chemotherapy  [12]. A randomized placebo -controlled phase III

population with ovarian cancer, such as those with bevacizumab -resistant 
disease. This proposed study will evaluate single -agent Nintedanib  (200 mg po 
twice daily) in participants with bevacizumab -resistant recurrent or persistent 
ovarian, peritoneal, and tubal cancer. Patients will be treated to disease 
progression or toxicity.  
2.5 Biomarker Discovery for Ovarian Cancer – Blood -based Angiome Profili ng 
 
The Phase I Biomarker Laboratory at Duke University Medical Center acts as a 
molecular profiling laboratory for blood -based biomarkers of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592807] -angiogenic agents. Drs. Andrew Nixon and Herbert 
Hurwitz serve as co -directors of the facility and direct the overall research of the 
laboratory. The laboratory has quality control procedures in place to address 
many of the issues involved in clinical trials research including sample quantity, 
sample integrity, and sample heterogeneity.  
Additionally, the laboratory has been selected to act as a core facility for the 
oncology cooperative group, The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). 
CALGB is a national clinical research group sponsored by [CONTACT_6808], wi th the Central Office headquartered at the University of Chicago and 
Statistical Center located at Duke University. The services offered align with 
their programmatic focus around the interrogation of blood and urine samples 
using multiplex or standard ELI SA technologies. The multiplex design for this 
study addresses the specific drug target(s) for this drug as well as attempting to 
capture the relevant co - and counter -regulated proteins.  
All samples will have appropriate chain -of-custody documentation to ensure 
compliance with FDA and IRB regulations. The lab currently has systems in 
place detailing the location, transfer, and use of any and all human research 
subject samples. Any discrepancies or omissions in flow sheets and/or sample 
labels are resolved upon receipt of the sample in the lab. All sample and data 
handling procedures will be fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Sample handling protocols will 
provide step -by-step details for sample isol ation, sample handling, and sample 
receipt/shipment. Samples will be housed in ultra -low temperature freezers ( -
80°C). The freezers are monitored daily and are equipped with an alarm system 
designed to alert laboratory personnel upon freezer malfunction. A dditionally, 
secondary, independent alarm systems exist on all ultra -low freezers currently 
used to store all patient samples. Use of these redundant systems greatly reduces 
the chance of freezer failure, which could potentially result in the loss of 
irrep laceable samples from clinical trial patients.  
Blood -based Biomarkers:   In the past, the gold standard for detection of growth 
factors and cytokines in blood was the use of ELISAs; however, multiplex 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782016], time and labor. 
Furthermore, all plate designs are validated in order to 1) limit cross -reactivity of 
the antibodies 2) optimize sensitivity and specificity and 3) maximize the 
linearity of the assa y’s dynamic range.  
Several  systems exist, the plate -based platforms being the Meso Scale Discovery 
(MSD) multiplex system and the SearchLight system, produced by [CONTACT_592839] (formerly of Thermo  Fisher Scientific). The assay design in both 
cases is si milar to a sandwich ELISA, except multiple capture antibodies are pre -
spotted into individual wells of a [ADDRESS_782017] ELISA assays will also be 
included to evaluate soluble TGFbRIII and IGF -1 as additional blood markers.  
Biomarker Sele ction :  Since VEGF signaling is the fundamental pathway 
promoting angiogenesis, it will be informative to evaluate an array of VEGF and 
non-VEGF angiogenic factors. Since many angiogenic factors can be targeted 
with agents that are available or in developm ent, information gained regarding 
mechanisms of resistance to anti -VEGF agents could direct novel combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Currently, it is not known which set of these factors will predict for 
baseline resistance to Nintedanib , which factors mediate acquired resistance to 
Nintedanib  after initial response, and which factors may predict for greater or 
lesser risk of Nintedanib  related toxicity. This lack of information represents a 
major gap in our understanding of the clinical mechanisms of efficacy, 
resistance, and toxicity for this agent. For bevacizumab, the fact that VEGF alone 
is not predictive of response likely reflects the complexity and redundancy of 
tumor angiogenesis, presumably mediated by [CONTACT_592840] p roteins. 
Given the limitations of preclinical modeling, it is critical that these mechanisms 
of clinical efficacy, resistance and toxicity be validated and prioritized in 
patients.  
Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins interact with endothelial cells (EC) an d 
serve as a scaffolding structure to support angiogenic sprouting. Matrix 
Metalloproteinase (MMP) -mediated remodeling of the ECM coordinates directly 
with VEGF -dependent angiogenesis. Therefore, information of matrix -derived 
angiogenic factors will take t he microenvironment into consideration. 
Additionally, there are complex interactions between the coagulation system and 
the angiogenic process. For example, Tissue Factor (TF) is a principal initiator of 
coagulation; altered TF expression on EC membrane ha s been implicated in 
wound healing and angiogenesis, leading to VEGF upregulation. VEGF and TF 
levels are both increased by [CONTACT_592841] a 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782018] been validated in order to limit cross -reactivity 
of the antibod ies, optimized for sensitivity and specificity, and maximize the 
linearity of the assay’s dynamic range. The coefficient of variation (CVs) of the 
multiplex arrays is approximately 15 -20%, depending on the particular assay. 
Any study samples that fall outs ide the linear portion of the standard curve are 
retested. Samples that read below the limit of detection are retested, if possible. 
Samples that read above the linear portion of the standard curve are serially 
diluted and retested to obtain accurate measu rements. Any analyte that does not 
meet the aforementioned criteria will result in the sample being re -evaluated. 
Analytes of interest that are not available in our multiplex plates will be 
evaluated using commercial ELISA kits or ELISAs developed in the B iomarker 
Laboratory.

2.7       Background for quality of life and patient preferences addenda  
 
As clinical  endpoint s, neither OS nor PFS  considers the rate of adverse events, 
quality of life (QOL), or other patient -reported outcomes (PROs) while on 
treatment. This context is  critically important to frame survival metrics to better 
understand the implication of therapy.   In trials as well as in current practice, 
biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592808], sometimes until 
disease progression.  The practice of continuing treatment over a prolonged 
period brings into focus the question of what effect such treatment has on quality 
of life.  At a minimum, it results in more trips for medica l care and higher out of 
pocket expense on the part of both patients and caregivers.   
 
Development of a composite endpoint  
In phase III studies of ovarian cancer, quality of life is now often examined, 
usually as a secondary endpoint.  However, other pati ent-reported outcomes such 
as diverse symptoms, adverse event rates, and patient preferences have almost 
never been formally incorporated into primary trial endpoints for this disease. 
Our working group plans to develop a composite endpoint for ovarian can cer 
treatment trials that will incorporate PFS, severe adverse event rates, QOL and 
other PROs into the development of a composite endpoint for ovarian cancer 
trials.   
 
Patient preferences    
If a composite endpoint is to be considered, it is critical to e nsure that the 
endpoint will successfully address the outcomes that are most important to 
patients. To this end, there is a need to determine how patients prioritize the 
factors and conditions that are most important to their treatment.  For example, 
survi ving [ADDRESS_782020] been reported (1, 2), but never specifically fo r 
women with ovarian cancer.  
 
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_592809] (1) progression -free survival, 
(2) overall survival, (3) development of severe side effects, (4) o verall quality of 
life, and (5) ovarian -cancer specific health symptoms.  This study will allow us to 
determine the feasibility of assigning patient -determined weights to different 
individual endpoints for the future construction of a patient -centered comp osite 
endpoint.   Because preferences are often sensitive to the method of elicitation, 
multiple methods of elicitation will be used to assess the robustness of 
preferences.   Baseline quality of life and symptom index elicitation will allow 
examination of subjects’ preferences in relation to their current symptoms and 
well being.

4.1.8 Incompatibilities :  
   
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug Interactions : After oral administration of [14C] Nintedanib  
to rats, radioactivity showed an early peak in blood (0.[ADDRESS_782038] dose) 
and in the liver ([ADDRESS_782039] dose). In most of the other tissues the 
concentration of radioactivity followed a time course with maximum at [ADDRESS_782040] exposure was seen in the liver, followed by 
[CONTACT_33428], lung and kidn ey. Nintedanib  did not cross the blood brain 
barrier. In human liver microsomes, the cleavage of [14C] Nintedanib  by 
[CONTACT_11143] -cataly zed hydrolysis (formation of BIBF 1202) was the 
prevalent metabolic reaction (about 25 %). Metabolism of Nintedanib  by 
[CONTACT_097]450 enzymes plays only a minor role (5%); CYP 3A4 was the 
predominant enzyme involved in the formation of hydroxylated 
Nintedanib  and desmethylated Nintedanib . Nintedanib  did not show 
relevant inhibition or induction of the major drug metabolizing 
cytochrome P450 enzymes and specifically no irreversible CYP 3A4 
inhibition. The main route of excretion was via feces. In Rhesus 
monkeys, cumulative fecal excretion was 85.6 % following intravenous 
and 88.9 % following oral administration. The median 168 h our 
cumulative urinary excretion was 5.21% following intravenous 
administration and 1.54% following oral administration. In the rat, the 
Rhesus -, and the Cynomolgus monkey, exposure to Nintedanib  increased 
in essence linearly with the dose.  
 
With respect t o the in vitro finding that the main metabolite of 
Nintedanib , BIBF 1202, is glucuronidated by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 (liver and 
intestine) as well as UGT1A7, UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 (intestine), it 
may be speculated whether reduced UGT1A1 activity could result in 
increased le vels of the non -conjugated metabolite. Pharmacogenetic 
investigations are currently ongoing (correlation of UGT1A1 genotype 
with PK parameters and clinical parameters) and patients will be 
genotyped for UGT1A1 in the phase III trials.  
 
Thus far, no relati onship between reduced tolerability of Nintedanib  and 
increases of bilirubin have been observed. Patients with increased 
bilirubin levels or increases of transaminases to >  2.5x ULN prior to start 
of therapy have been excluded in most trials conducted thus  far and only 
patients with normal bilirubin will be enrolled in the phase III trials in 
NSCLC. Currently, there is no medical rationale to specifically exclude 
patients with slow metabolism genotype or reduced activity of the 
UGT1A1 enzyme since also UGT1 A7, UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 are 
capable of glucuronidating BIBF 1202 (intestine). Combination of 
Nintedanib  with agents metabolized via UGT1A1 such as irinotecan has 
not been tested thus far. Yet, the relevance of the possible interaction of 
Nintedanib  with UGT 1A1 for drug -drug interactions is not clear.

in all protocols.  
 
4.1.9 Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks:   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal adverse events:  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and 
abdominal pain (upper and lower) were the most frequent adverse events 
and were mostly of CTCAE grades 1 and 2 intensities. The frequency of 
CTCAE grade 3 gastrointestinal events did not exceed 8% over all trials. 
Gastrointestinal side effects were the predominant reason for treatment 
interruption besides liver enzyme elevations and fatigue/asthenia. All 
events were fully reversible [8].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic adverse events:  The predominant dose limiting toxicity in phase 
I dos e escalation trials was reversible elevation of hepatic transaminases, 
more pronounced for ALT than for AST. At doses below 200 mg bid no 
CTCAE grade 3+[ADDRESS_782042] two months of Nintedanib treatment is 10 -
15% for patients treated with 250 mg bid of Nintedanib . An increase of 
transaminases was only rarely observed in Caucasian patients treated 
with 150 mg bid or 200 mg  bid. An association with hyperbilirubinemia 
was rare, and was (if at all) represented by a low grade increase of 
bilirubin with only one exception in a patient with tumor stenosis of the 
ductus hepatocholedochus and grade 3 bilirubin increase two weeks af ter 
cessation of therapy. -GT elevations, either as isolated increases or in 
combination with transaminitis, were observed frequently. Enzyme 
elevations generally normalized upon dose reduction or discontinuation. 
No drug -related hepatic failure was repor ted [8].  
 
The current dose of Nintedanib  in all studies is limited to 200 mg bid 
and, all studies require monitoring of liver enzyme tests. In addition, all 
studies include specific dose reduction schemes regarding liver enzyme 
elevations [8]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infection adverse events:  Infections have been observed but were 
expected for advanced cancer populations and age group. Only a few 
were considered drug related.  
 
4.1.9 .4 Thromboembolic and cardiac adverse events:  In the combined phase I 
and II monotherapy trials (1 199.1 -3, 1199.9, 1199.10, 1199.11, 1199.16, 
1199.19), there were 13 patients (3.7%) with events from the “selected 
thrombotic events” category which included pulmonary embolism (3), 
deep vein thrombosis (2), myocardial infarction (2), transient ischemic  
attack (2), aphasia (1), hemiparesis (1), thrombophlebitis (1) , and 
thrombosis (1). Five of these events (1.4%) were considered treatment 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782043] 2018  
 
Page 19 of 78 
 related: deep vein thrombosis (2) myocardial infarction (2) , and transient 
ischemic attack (1). There were 66 patient s (19%) with events from the 
“cardiac events” category which include the following: chest pain (24 , 
6.9% ), edema peripheral (9 , 6.6% ), sinus tachycardia (8 , 2.3% ), 
cardiovascular disorder (3 , 0.9% ), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (3 , 0.9% ), arrhythmia  (2, 
0.6% ), cardiopulmo nary failure (2  (1 fatal and not considered  as 
treatment related ), 0.6% ), myocardial infarction  (2, 0.6% ), pericardial 
effusion (2 , 0.6% ), atrioventricular block second degree (1 , 0.3% ), 
cardiac failure (1 , 0.3% ), electrocardiogram ST segment (1 , 0.3% ), 
electrocardiogram change (1 , 0.3% ), heart rate decreased (1 , 0.3% ), heart 
rate irregular (1 , 0.3% ), pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034] (1 , 0.3% ), sudden death (1 case 
considered as not treatment related , 0.3% ), syncope (1 , 0.3% ), and 
ventricular arrhythmia  (1, 0.3% ). A total o f 12 from these events (3.4%) 
were considered as treatment related: chest pain (2), myocardial 
infarction (2) , peripheral edema (2) , sinus tachycardia (2) , arrhythmia 
(1), cardiac failure (1), electrocardiogram ST (1), electrocardiogram 
change (1), heart r ate decrease (1), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (1), tachycardia (1) , and 
ventricular arrhythmia (1). In the placebo controlled unblinded phase II 
trial 1199.9 comparing 250 mg bid of Nintedanib  to placebo in patients 
with ovarian cancer there was no difference in AEs from the SOC 
“Cardiac disorder” between both arms ( Nintedanib : 1 (2-3%) versus 2 
(5%) for placebo).There was also no meaningful difference between both 
arms regarding “thrombotic events”  (Nintedanib  arm: 2 with deep vein 
thrombosis . Placebo arm: 1 with pulmonary embolism) and regarding 
“cardiac events” ( Nintedanib  arm: 5  (12.5% ), placebo arm: 3 (6.8% )). 
 
In summary, the frequency of drug related thromboembolic events was 
low across all completed studies using Nintedanib monotherapy, and the 
frequency of thromboembolic adverse events regardless of relatedness 
did not exceed the expected rate in the patients with advanced solid 
tumors [8]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension adverse events:  In the combined phase I and II 
monotherapy studies trials (1199.1 -3, 1199.16, 1199.19, 1199.9, 
1199.10, 1199.11), 36 patients (10.3 %) had the AEs fr om the pool of 
‘hypertension’ events which include the following: 32 (9.2%) had 
hypertension, 3 (0.9 %) ha d blood pressure increased, and 2 (0.6 %) had 
systolic blood pressure increased. The majority of these events were 
considered as treatment related: 24 (6.9%) with hypertension, 3 (0.9% ) 
with blood pressure increased , and 1  (0.3%) with systolic blood pressu re 
increased. In a randomized study, in the combined trials, the frequency 
of reported hypertension adverse events was 2.6% -9.9%. Overall, the 
hypertensive potential of Nintedanib as an antiangiogenic compound is 
considered relatively low as compared to ot her compounds in the class 
[8].

Page 20 of 78 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Dermatologic adverse events:  In vitro studies suggested a theoretic risk 
of phototoxicity for patients treated with Nintedanib . However, it was 
estimated that the maximum concentration of Nintedanib in the human 
skin is about 4 -fold lower than the threshold level of 0.5 µg/mL in the in 
vitro  assay. Combined phase I and II Nintedanib  monotherapy trials 
1199.1 -3 1199.9, 1199.10, 1199.11, 1199.16 and 1199.19: a total of 72 
patients (20.7%) reported an AE  from the user -defined category ‘skin 
events’. These AEs include following: pruritus (18, 5.2%), rash (18, 
5.2%), hyperh idrosis (17, 4.9%), erythema (14, 4%), skin lesion (5, 
1.4%), acne (4,  1.1%), skin irritation (3, 0.9%), sunburn (3, 0.9%), skin 
fissure  (2, 0.6%), urticaria ( 2, 0.6%). Additionally, photosensitivity 
reaction, prurigo, pruritus generali zed, rash macular, rash pustular, skin 
reaction , and skin ulcer occur each in less th an 2 patients (0.3%). All 
events were grade 1 -2 [8]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other adverse eve nts include fatigue or asthenia, metabolism and 
nutrition disorders, anorexia, and lab abnormalities.

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_592846] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1)  [13]. Changes in the largest 
diameter (unidimensional measur ement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest 
diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
8.1.1 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as > [ADDRESS_782076] scan, as > [ADDRESS_782077] x -ray, or > [ADDRESS_782078] be 
recorded in decimal fractions of centimeters.  
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will 
not be considered measurable unless progression is documented or a 
biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days follo wing 
completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_782079] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 
mm). At b aseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782080] 2018  
 
Page 30 of 78 
 Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis), a re considered non -measurable disease. 
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal/pelvic masses (identified by [CONTACT_592847]), are considered as  non-measurable.  
 
Notes:   
Bone lesions : Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with 
identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_592848]. Blastic bone 
lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable 
nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. “Cystic 
lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described 
above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient,  
these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible, repeat ed 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion which can be reproducibly measured should be 
selected. A sum of the diameters (longest  for non -nodal lesions, short axis 
for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diame ters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_782081] 2018  
 
Page 31 of 78 
 8.1.2 Meth ods for Evaluation of Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely 
as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks 
before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_592849](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g. skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and  10 
mm diame ter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). In the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assu mption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_782082] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans), but 
NOT l ung.  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, 
and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition 
variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermo re, the availability of MRI is 
variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the 
modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline, 
and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. 
It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts, and diseases. 
Ideally, subsequent image acquisitions should use the same type of 
scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible. If 
possible, body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques.  
 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782083]: At present, the low -dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for 
use with RECIST measurements. PET -CT scans are not always done with 
oral and IV contrast. In addition, the PET portion of the  CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or 
serially performed.  
 
FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, 
it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
comple ment CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible “new” disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is 
not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  
scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at 
that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up cor responds to 
a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis 
of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note:  A “positive” FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tis sue on the 
attenuation corrected image.  
 
Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and 
should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations 
cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later 
date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed 
that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_460195], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is 
concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT 
in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective 
tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be  useful 
to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or 
to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
CA-125 (Ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_592821] c ancer trials) : 
CA-[ADDRESS_782084] normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for CA -125 
response (in recurrent ovaria n cancer) have been published  [14].  
 
Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases, e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain.  
 
It is mandatory to obtain cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin 
of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when 
measureable disease has met criteria for response or stable disease. This 
confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or stable disease versus 
progressive disease, as an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment.  
 
8.1.3 Response Criteria  
 
Determination of response should take into consideration all target and 
non-target l esions and if appropriate, biomarkers.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
           
  Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
 
  Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of 
the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more ne w lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
 
  Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the 
smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Not evaluable (NE) : When at least one target lesion is not 
evaluated at a particular time point.

Page 34 of 78 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
  Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions. 
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<  10 mm short 
axis).  
       
  Note: If CA-[ADDRESS_782086] 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
  Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  
 
  Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion i ncrease.  
 
  Not evaluable (NE) : When at least one non -target lesion is not 
evaluated at a particular time point.  
 
Although a clear progression of only “non -target” lesions is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_592822], and the progression status should be confirmed 
at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall (unconfirmed) Response  
 
The best overall response is the best time point response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest sum 
recorded since baseline). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria in some circumstances.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Best Overall Confirmed Response  
 
Confirmation of CR and PR for determination of best overall 
response is required for studies with a primary endpoint that 
includes response. SD should also be confirmed. Responses (CR 
and PR) require confirmation at greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_782089] overall 
confirmed response

*If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any disease seen at a 
subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to 
baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must 
have reappeared after CR). However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when  subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely 
still present and in fact the patient had PR or SD, not CR at the first 
time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR or SD and the best response is PR or SD.  
 
In non -randomized trials where response is part of the primary 
endpoint, confirmation of CR or PR is needed to deem either one 
the “best overall response.”  Patients with a global deterioration of 
health status requiring discontinuation of treatment or who die 
withou t objective evidence of disease progression at that time 
should be reported to be off study treatment due to “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or

progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is 
objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from study entry 
(date of registration ) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.

9.0  DURATION OF STUDY  
 
9.0 Patients will receive therapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity 
intervenes. The patient can refuse the study treatment at any time.  
 
9.1  All patients will be treated (with completion of all required case report forms) 
until disease progression or study withdrawal. Patients will then be followed (with 
physical exams and histories) every three months for the first two years and then 
every six mo nths for the next year. Patients will be followed for OS for up to 3 
years after completing the study (due to either disease progression or study 
withdrawal) . 
 
10.0     ADVERSE EVENTS, STUDY MONITORING & REPORTING PROCEDURE  
 
There must be adequate review, assessment, and monitoring of adverse events. All 
subjects will be closely monitored throughout the study for AEs. Investigators will assess 
the occurrence of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) at all subject evaluations a nd 
visits during the study. All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered 
by [CONTACT_15480], or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test, or other means will be recorded in the subject’s medical record an d on the 
appropriate AE or SAE CRF page.   
 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782095] be reported to the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Safety 
Desk at the Duke University by [CONTACT_10854] 24 -hours of learning of the event.  
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE (NCI C ommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events), version 4.0 for Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting.  
A copy of the CTCAE v4.0 can be downloaded from 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/ reporting/ctc.html .    
 
10.[ADDRESS_782096] recent version of the 
investigator brochure.  
 
 
10.2 Reporting Period  
 
Serious adverse events require immediate notification (within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event) to [CONTACT_592873] of Duke University 
Medical Center or designated representative. The study period during which all 
AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and 
initiation of study treatment on Cycle 1, Day  1. It ends [ADDRESS_782097] 
administration of study treatment, or if the patient initiates treatment with a new 
anti-cancer therapy, or study discontinuation/termination; whichever is earlier. 
Any SAEs occurring any time after this period should  be promptly reported if a 
causal relationship to the investigational product is suspected; investigators 
should report only SAEs that are attributed to study treatment.  
 
SAEs that are observed or reported prior to initiation of study treatment should be 
recorded as SAEs on the CRF if they are associated with protocol -mandated 
interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or 
no treatment run -in). 
 
10.3 Definitions   
  
10.3.1  An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unde sirable  
medical  condition, recurrence or deterioration of a preexisting medical 
condition, or disease temporally associated with or subsequent to exposure 
to a pharmaceutical product/treatment or protocol -imposed intervention, 
regardless of attribution. This includes sig ns (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptoms or condition occurring 
at any dose independent of perceived causal relationship to the product or 
treatment.  AEs may or may not be formal medical diagnoses. Common 
examples incl ude nausea, chest pain, tachycardia, enlarged liver, or 
electrocardiogram abnormalities.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_782098] 2018  
 
Page 39 of 78 
 Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse 
events if the abnormal ity: 
 Results in study withdrawal . 
 Is associated with a serious adverse event . 
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms . 
 Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests . 
 Is considered by [CONTACT_125943].  
 
10.3.3  A serious adverse event  (SAE ) as defined by [CONTACT_592850] (ICH) is any adverse experience that at any dose meets 
any of the following conditions:  
 Results in death (i.e. , the adverse event causes or leads to death).  
 Is life -threatening .  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] .   
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 An important medical event that may not result in death,  be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug reaction when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition abov e. Examples of such 
medical events includes allergic bronchospasms requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in impatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug  abuse.  
  
10.3.[ADDRESS_782099] 
caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk 
of death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic 
failure would not be considered life -threatening, even though hepatitis of a 
more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an aller gic reaction resulting in 
angioedema of the face would not be life -threatening, even though 
angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be 
fatal.

AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592825]. This is the case in the 
following situations:  
BIBF [ADDRESS_782100] 2018  
 
Page 40 of 78 
  The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a 
procedure required by [CONTACT_760] (drug administration, protocol -
requiring testing, etc.).  
 The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592826] a 
routine procedure followed by [CONTACT_16018] (e.g. , stent removal after 
surgery) . This should be recorded in the study file.  
 Social admissions (e.g. , subject has no place to sleep) . 
 Administrative admissions (e.g. , for yearly physical examinations) . 
 Admission for treatment of a preexisting medical condition not 
associated with the development of a new adverse event or with a 
worsening of the preexisting condition . 
 Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_592827] (e.g. , for elective cosmetic surgery) . 
 
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not 
worsened does not constitute an SAE . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592828]:  rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], respi[INVESTIGATOR_116513] (e.g. , 
caregiver relief), skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, routine 
emergency room admissions, or same day surgeries . Diagnostic and 
therapeutic non -invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as adverse events . However, the  medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of 
an adverse event . For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during 
the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, 
and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the 
adverse event.  
 
10.3.6  Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to   
conduct normal life functions. If there is any doubt about whether the  
information constitutes a n SAE, the information is treated as an SAE.

and the pre sence (or absence) of a more likely cause.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_782103] that is considered both excessive and medically important. An 
overdose is defined as a dose increase of Nintedanib  other than one  
prescribed by a health care professional or recommended by [CONTACT_3181], 
whether accidental or intentional.  For reporting purposes  overdose does 
not need to be reported to Boehringer Ingelheim unless there is an SAE 
associated with the overdose. An overdose itself does not meet any criteria 
for reporting to BI (Safety) as an AE/SAE. If an SAE occurs  due to 
overdose, the SAE should be reported and the information should be 
reported and the information should be reflected in the administration 
section of the SAE form.  
 
10.3.12  A pre-existing condition  is one that is present at the start of the study,   
and sho uld be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or 
the character of the condition worsens during the study period.   
 
10.3.13  Seriousness is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event   
outcome or action criteria usually associated w ith events that pose a threat 
to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the  
guide for defining regulatory obligations from the Sponsor to applicable 
regulatory authorities . 
 
10.3.14  Severity  (or intensity) refers to the grade of a s pecific AE (e.g., mild  
(grade 1); moderate (grade 2); or severe (grade 3) myocardial infarction ); 
see table for further details.          
 
**Severity  and seriousness  should be independently assessed when 
recoding AEs and SAEs on the CRF.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_782104] are to be reported using the same time line as 
Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not  meet any of the seriousness criteria :

1. Any gastrointestinal and non -gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula 
formation, and abscess. In such case, the following additional information 
need to be collected, documented on the eCRF page and forwarded t o 
Boehringer Ingelheim:  
 Location/extent of abdominal tumor ma gnifications . 
 Imaging and reports (CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, pathology, etc.).  
 Prior surgery (location, wound healing complications) . 
 Concomitant diseases with GI involvement (e. g. Crohn ’s, vas culitis, 
tuberculosis, diverticulitis).  
2. Elevated transaminases: based on laboratory values . 
(i) ALT and/or AST  > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation.  
(ii) ALT and/or AST  > 3x ULN with bilirubin > 1.5x ULN . 
(iii) Occurrence of at least two (2) elevated results no more than [ADDRESS_782106] icable , and included on 
the Boehringer Ingelheim  SAE reporting form :  
 Hepatic tumor involvement . 
 Gilbert syndrome . 
 Viral hepatitis (e.g. , Hepatitis A; B; C; EBV; CMV) . 
 Alcohol and/or autoimmune hepatitis . 
 Hepatobiliary disorders (e.g. , gallstones) . 
 Vascular hepatitis conditions (e.g. , portal vein thrombosis, right heart failure) . 
 Recent alcohol consumption . 
 Recent intake of hepatotoxic compounds (including steroids) . 
 Other etiology . 
 
Medical evaluation of these results and clinical documentation shou ld be 
provided.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_782107] prevented the 
medication error. Conse quently, the intention is to ensure that the improvements 
in labeling, dosing and/or packing clarity are implemented in the marketed 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782108]. Medication errors are reportable only as defined in the 
protocol.  Follow the guidance below.  
 
a. For studies with two or more treatment arms (e.g., double blind studies), the  
administration or consumption of the unassigned treatment is always a 
reportable medication error.  
b. Administration of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_592829] a reportable  
medicati on error when associated with an AE, or if otherwise appropriate, 
please define for your study.  
c. For parenteral products , define reportable errors involving rate of 
administration  and reconstitution and dilution, including use of appropriate 
diluent and the  time frame in which test article should be used after 
reconstitution and/or dilution.  
d. For vaccines and biologics , define in detail reportable errors related to storage 
or refrigeration requirements.  
 
All AEs and SAEs must be handled as specified in this protocol whether or not 
they are associated with a medication error. A medication error associated with an 
SAE (including overdose, inadvertent exposure, and/or accidental exposure) will 
be reported wit h the SAE on the SAE form. All other medication errors will be 
reported by [CONTACT_592852] c over.  
 
10.6 Progressive Disease  
 
Natural progression or deterioration of the malignancy under study (including 
new sites of metastasis and death due to disease progression) should be recorded 
as part of the efficacy evaluation and should not be reported as  AEs or SAEs.  
 
Signs and symptoms clearly associated with the disease under study should NOT 
be reported as AEs unless they are any one of the following:  
 Newly emergent (i.e., not previously observed in the subject).  
 Judged by [CONTACT_592853].  
 Judged by [CONTACT_592854] -related signs 
and symptoms to be caused directly by [CONTACT_5257].  
 
If there is reasonable uncertainty about an AE being caused by [CONTACT_118512], it should be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_782109] medication in the following:  
 Pregnancy. If a pregnancy is confirmed, use of the test article must be 
discontinued immediately.    
 Lactation.  
 Overdose .  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure  
 
10.[ADDRESS_782110], 
the sponsor -investigator within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence . If the 
pregnancy is associ ated with a SAE then the pregnancy should be reported to BI 
Unique Entry Point within ten (10) calendar days upon receipt of the initial and/or 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782111] 2018  
 
Page 45 of 78 
 follow -up information.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or volun tary termination, details of birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and 
newborn complications.  
 
10.10  Recording Adverse Events   
 
Classification of Adverse Events  
**AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs .  The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. 
Severity (or intensity) refers to the grade of a specific adverse event (e.g., mild; 
moderate; or severe ).   
Ex. A severe  rash is not likely t o be an SAE. Likewise, a severe headache is not 
necessarily an SAE.  However, mild chest pain may result in a day’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129608].  
   
“Serious” is a regulatory definition (see above) and is based on subject or event 
outcome or action c riteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations from the Sponsor to applicable 
regulatory authorities . Severity and s eriousness should be independently assessed 
when recording AEs and SAEs on the CRF.  
 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Full 
descriptions of each event will be followed . Thus, follow -up information which 
becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219475]), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial report, and immediately 
sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.  
 
The investigator must categorize the severity of each adverse event according to 
the following guidelines:  
 
Criteria:  
NCI toxicity criteria will be followed.  Special attention will be paid to 
gastrointestinal, non -gastrointesti nal perforation, leakage, fistula formation, 
abscess, and elevated transaminases.   
 
Mild :     Grade I NCI Common Toxicity  
Moderate :    Grade II NCI Common Toxicity  
Moderately    Severe:  Grade III Common Toxicity  
Severe :    Grade IV NCI Common Toxicity  
Death:    Grade V NCI Common Toxicity  
 
If the event is not found in the NCI Common Toxicity table, the adverse event 
will be scored using 5 grades:  
BIBF [ADDRESS_782112] 2018  
 
Page 46 of 78 
   
Grade 1   Causing no limitation of usual activities  
  Grade 2   Causing some limitation of usual activities  
  Grade 3   Causing some inability to carry out usual activities  
  Grade 4   Causing life -threatening or disabling toxicity  
  Grade 5   Causing death

[ADDRESS_782113] 
be recorded for each adverse event.  
Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”.  
 
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product administered and the AE.  
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product administered and the  AE.  
 
10.11  Procedures For Reporting  
 
Reporting of Adverse Events:  
Upon inclusion into a trial, the patient’s condition  is assessed (e.g. , documentation 
of history/concomitant diagnoses and diseases), and relevant changes from 
baseline are noted subsequently.  
BIBF [ADDRESS_782114] 2018  
 
Page 47 of 78 
 All adverse events, serious and non -serious, occurring during the course of the 
clinical trial (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the trial 
defined follow -up period) will be collected, documented and reported by [CONTACT_1275]. For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, 
end date, intensity, treatment required, outcome,  seriousness, and action taken 
with the investigational drug. The investigator will determine the expectedness of 
the investigational drug to the AEs as defined in the Listed Adverse Events 
section of the Boehringer Ingelheim’s Investigator Brochure for th e Product.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and unknown reactions or unexpected events that 
occur in the course of any patient’s treatment on study or within 30 days 
following cessation of treatment should be reported to the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_592830]/Sponsor ([CONTACT_592874]/Duke University ) within [ADDRESS_782115] be recorded using the Boehringer Ingelheim 
SAE Reporting Form, found in the Procedure Manual.    
 
Additional information and/or corrections may be subm itted as they are obtained.  
All SAEs must be followed through resolution or stabilization.  
 
All adverse events, regardless of severity, and whether or not ascribed to the study 
drug administration, will be recorded in the appropriate section of the Case Report 
Form. Patients withdrawn from the study due to AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_592855], when appropriate, additional 
written reports and documentation will be provided.

 Event outcome with dates should be communicated to the Duke as soon as 
possible.  
 When applicable and requested, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] 
(e.g., discharge summary, autopsy reports, etc.).  
 
Upon receipt of the Serious Adverse Ev ent Report Form by [CONTACT_34434], DCI Safety 
will:  
a. Notify [CONTACT_592876] of the event via email and obtain an assessment for each 
event via the SAE Review Form.  
b. Fax the form to Boehringer Ingelheim Global Pharmacovigilance Cent er US 
(GPV Centre US) at 1 -[PHONE_6800]  
 
All adverse events, regardless of severity, and whether or not ascribed to the study 
drug administration, will be recorded in the appropriate section of the Case Report 
Form. Patients withdrawn from the study due to AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_592855], when appropriate, additional 
written reports and documentation will be provided.  
 
10.12  Regulatory (Expedited) Reporting  
 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782117] 2018  
 
Page 49 of 78 
 As per 21 CFR 312.2(a), this study must be conducted under an IND. [CONTACT_592877] of Duke University Medical Center will be the sponsor -
investigator for this study and will hold the IND. Thus, [CONTACT_592876] will serve as 
both a principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_592831] -center study.  
 
Per 21 CFR 312.32(c ), the sponsor will notify the FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written IND Safety Report of:  
(A) Any adverse event associated with the use of the drug  
(B) That is both serious and unexpected (see above for definitions).  
 
 Each notification shall be ma de as soon as possible and in no event later than 
15 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Each 
written notification may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch form) 
or in a narrative format. In each written IND safety rep ort, the sponsor shall 
identify all safety reports previously filed with the IND concerning a similar 
adverse experience, and shall analyze the significance of the adverse 
experience in light of the previous, similar reports.  
 The sponsor shall also notify  the FDA by [CONTACT_592857] -threatening experience associated with the use of the 
drug as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's 
initial receipt of the information.  
 Follow -up information t o a safety report shall be submitted as soon as the 
relevant information is available.  
 Additionally, adverse events will be reported to the FDA in an annual report 
according to annual report requirements.  Events will be reviewed and 
reported to the Duke I RB according to local IRB guidelines.  
 
10.13  Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Duke University Health System (DUHS), the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and Cancer Protocol Committee (CPC) may 
perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of 
such an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine study -
related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to 
the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), g uidelines of the International ICH, 
and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
Study Monitoring Requirements  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] -investigator and will be independently 
monitored and assessed in accord with the Duke Cancer Institu te (DCI), NCI -
approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 
In terms of internal review, the sponsor -investigator is responsible for monitoring 
the protocol to ensure that the investigation is conducted in accordance with the 
BIBF [ADDRESS_782118] 2018  
 
Page 50 of 78 
 general investigational plan and  protocol (21 CFR 312.50), and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sponsor -investigator will continuously monitor and 
tabulate adverse events and will also monitor the conduct, data, and safety of this 
study to ensure that:  
 Interim analyses occur as scheduled;  
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9480]/or response are met;  
 Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects;  
 Appropriate internal monitoring of adverse events and outcomes is done;  
 Over -accrual does not occur;  
 Under -accrual is addressed with appropriate amendments or actions;  
 Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
 
External review begins with the initial scientific review by [CONTACT_140642] . The CPC 
assigns the degree of monitoring to co mmensurate with the type of intervention, 
phase, endpoints, degree of risk, size , and complexity of the protocol. The 
primary site, Duke, will be monitored by [CONTACT_592858]. The minimum level of monitoring t o be 
determined by [CONTACT_592859]:  routine 
monitoring after the first [ADDRESS_782119] been enrolled, followed by [CONTACT_33667] 1 -3 subjects until closed to enrollment or subjects are no longer 
receiving study drug or other interventions that are more than minimal risk. 
Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], 
unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns.  
CPC conducts annual progress reviews focusin g on protocol prioritization, 
accrual and scientific progress while the study is open to enrollment, excluding 
pediatric protocols.  
 
DUMC will serve as the coordinating site for this multi -site study.   
The DUHS sponsor -investigator is responsible for providing data and safety 
monitoring oversight for participating external sites.  The Duke Gynecologic 
Oncology team will be monitoring the external sites.  A site monitoring visit will 
be planned after the first [ADDRESS_782120] data will be monitored by [CONTACT_592860]. Subsequent monitoring will be arranged based on pace of accrual, 
accrual status, an d results of previous monitoring.  
 
The DCI Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) will conduct a nnual data and safety 
monitoring. SOC reviews data provided by [CONTACT_456] -investigator pertaining to 
safety data, toxicities and new information that may affect subj ect safety or 
efficacy.  All safety concerns are communicated to the sponsor -investigator and 
will be communicated to the IRB and CPC as necessary.

 The Duke Cancer Institute IT  (DCI-IT) group will be responsible for the 
management of clinical data utilizing the caBIG -compliant platform, known as 
the Cancer Central Clinical Database (C3D), with local implementation at Duke. 
C3D  is the Clinical Trials Database and a key component of NCI's  Clinical Trial 
Suite (CTS) . Oracle Clinical serves as the foundation of C3D  by [CONTACT_592861], data capture, multiple site reporting, data definition , and 
usage standardization. Trial definition is based on Common Data Elements (CDE)  
from an existing library of template Case Report Forms. Oracle Clinical's RDC 
Onsite system provides a user -friendly HTML -based interface that allows local 
and remote data entry and electronically confirms source data verification 
(electronic signature). C3D  also provides researchers with web -based tools for ad -
hoc querying, reporting and analysis of clinical data. DCI-IT has been a C3D 
adopter (locally hosted) for several years, and is the home of the caBIG Clinical 
Trials Management Systems Knowledge Cen ter. Through this enhanced 
relationship, DCI-IT will have access to a wide range of tools and resources, 
including case report form templates, the Common Data Elements dictionary, and 
other global library elements. This will enable us to construct the nece ssary data 
collection tools quickly.  
 
The process relies on the clinical site to originate data and correct any clinical 
data inconsistencies that are not included in the point of entry validation. A 
variety of quality control routines which are run regula rly will spawn queries that 
will need to be addressed by [CONTACT_592862]. This cycle is key to the process, as

Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) will be generated from NCI/CaBIG and 
other templates and Common Data Elements (existing and specifically curated), 
most of which already exist in the caBIG C3D library.  
 
Data entry via RDC On site is encrypted and secure.  Communications between 
clinical sites that require this level of security will be handled via Tumbleweed’s 
MailGate product  (a 128 bit encrypted and authenticated e -mail system ), as 
encapsulated through Duke’s implementation of Microsoft’s Outlook/Exchange 
Server product.

Meier curve and focus on the probability of surviving to 6 months as calculated 
by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. We will call this trial a success only if the lower 
10% confidence bound of this probability is greater than 0.13.  
 
Statistical Analysis of Secondary Aims  
 
Secondary Aim 1 is t o determine the proportion of patient who has an objective tumor 
response (complete or partial). To address this aim all responses will be tabulated: 
complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease.  
 
Secondary Aim 2 is to determin e the frequency and severity of adverse events. To 
address this aim, all toxicities will be tabulated by [CONTACT_16624].  
 
Secondary Aim 3 is to estimate the distribution of PFS and overall survival (OS). PFS 
was defined above. OS is defined as the length of the interval from on -study to death due 
to any cause. Both PFS and OS will be estimated with the Kaplan -Meier curve. In 
addition, we will compare the PFS of patients who had prior bevacizumab resistance with 
that of patients who had prior bevacizumab an d chemotherapy resistance. Specifically, 
within each of these two groups, we will describe PFS with a Kaplan -Meier curve and the 
6-month PFS rate (with its 80% confidence interval). We expect the latter group to have 
worse PFS than the former.  
 
Secondary A im [ADDRESS_782135] preferred attribute and vice versa. In the ra tings exercise, to 
describe respondents’ ratings on the [ADDRESS_782136] 
deviations for continuous variables and counts and proportions for categorical variables.  
  
 
Statistical Analysis of Translation Research Objectives  
 
The association of PFS with baseline values of VEGF (continuous) will be tested with the 
proportional hazards model; VEGF will also be dichotomized at a clinically meaningful 
cut point and a Kaplan -Meier plot of PFS according to VEGF level will be made. An 
analogous procedur e will be used to examine the association of PFS with baseline values 
of the growth factors listed Section 2.5.

    Summary of Changes  
The primary purpose of this Protocol Amendment is  to refine the criteria/ risk factors in inclusion 
criterion  #[ADDRESS_711884] (DSMB) and 
Adjudication Committee.  Consistent with  this objective, the exclusion criteria were updated to 
allow enrollme nt of patients with  osteomyelitis, nosocomial pneumonia due to S. aureus , 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators , permanent pacemakers , prosthetic cardiac values , cardiac 
value support ring s, and other implantable cardiac devices (see revisions to exclusi on criteria #6, 
7, 9, 11, 12 for all changes). 
In addition, the protocol was updated to add an assessment of re- infection by [CONTACT_544521] -of-Cure (TOC) and Day [ADDRESS_711885] 
serious adverse events (SAEs) through the Day 180 visit.  
The table below describes the changes that w ere made from the prior version of the protocol :

    • To describe the occurrence of clinical evidence of septic emboli and metastatic S. aureus  
infections.  
• To explore health resource utilization , including total length of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], days in the intensive 
care unit ( ICU), 30-day readmission for S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis, and surgery for treatment of 
S. aureus BSI/endocarditis.  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, multicenter, multinational, double -blind, study to eva luate the safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, and PK of CF -[ADDRESS_711903] from 
blood culture specimens collected within 72  hours prior to randomization are eligible  for the study.  
Approximately 115 patients will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
• Group 1: CF -301 in addition to  SOC antibacterial therapy (70 patients)  
• Group 2: Placebo in addition to  SOC antibacterial therapy (45 patients)  
Patients who are randomized will receive a single dose of CF -[ADDRESS_711904] practice 
at the site, treatment guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011 ; Baddour et al., 2015), and other local guidelines.  
Standard -of-care agents include daptomycin and vancomycin for MRSA and semi -synthetic 
penicillins (e.g., nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxicillin, flucloxacillin) and first -generation cephalosporins 
(e.g., cefazolin)  for methicillin -susceptible  S. aureus  (MSSA ).  If susceptibility is not known at the 
time of randomization, the patient should be treated empi[INVESTIGATOR_544482] l guidelines and practice; if prevalence of MRSA is high, empi[INVESTIGATOR_544483] .  Once 
susceptibility data are available , SOC may be changed at the investigator’s discretion based on 
susceptibility results to one of the SOC options described above.  Standard -of-care should be 
administered at the doses and durations specified in the manufacturer’s prescribing information, 
treatmen t guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011; Badd our et al., 2015), other local guidelines , and clinical 
practice .  The suggested duration of SOC treatment is 28 to 42 days for complicated bacteremia 
and/or endocarditis  and 42 to 84 days  for osteomyelitis .  Patients with known or suspected 
uncomplicated bacteremia are not eligible for the study; however, if a randomized patient is 
subsequently determined to have uncomplicated bacteremia, the suggested duration of SOC treatment 
is approximately  [ADDRESS_711905] be 
removed or changed and replaced at a different site as soon as possible within 72  hours after 
randomization.  In patients with central venous catheters (CVCs), ultrasounds to evaluate clots in the 
vein are recom mended  within  [ADDRESS_711906] one aerobic  blood cu lture will be collected daily during the 
study until negative for 2  consecutive days and at  Days  7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration .  
Additional blood cultures will be performed as clinically indicated.   Blood cultures should be 
collected from a peripheral venipuncture site when possible.  
Physical examinations will be performed at screening , daily through Day 7 and on Day 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, at EOT , and at TOC .  The physical examinati ons will include a close 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment # 4  June 22, 2018  
 10  
    evaluation for any new areas of pain  or signs of metastases ; new signs  should trigger diagnostic 
testing for metastatic foci . 
All patients should have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within [ADDRESS_711907] a follow -up TTE between 
Days 7 and 14 ; where possible, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) should also be performed 
(Baddour et al., 2015; Hab ib et al., 2010; Habib et al., 2015) .  TEEs are strongly recommended in 
patients with body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2.  The site will provide  all echocardiograms to the 
centra l echocardiography laboratory.  
Safety monitoring will include adverse event (AE)  monitoring , physical examinations, vital sign 
measurement s, 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), clinical safety laboratory tests, and 
immunological monitoring.  Safety monitoring  will be performed during the core study from 
screening through TOC, and a long -term follow -up will occur at Da y 180 after CF -301/placebo 
administration.  An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review unblinded safety 
data throughout the core study as defined in the DSMB charter.  
Blood samples for PK will be collected  as described in the “ Pharmacokinetics” section below . 
Clinical response will be assessed by [CONTACT_093] .  The Adjudication Committee will assess 
clinical response at pred efined intervals.  The efficacy analysis of clinical response will be based on 
the Adjudication Committee’s assessment.  
Number of patients (planned): Approximately 115 patients with S. aureus  BSI will be randomized 
(3:2) to receive a single dose of CF -[ADDRESS_711908] 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 25% in clinical 
response rate at Day 14 after CF -301/placebo, based on expected clinical improvement or response 
rates of 60% and 85% in the placebo and CF -301 treatment groups, respectively, using a two -sided 
target alpha level of 0.05  and Fisher’s exact test .

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration:  
• CF-301 will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg , with a maximum dose  of 30 mg for  patients 
who weigh ≥  120 kg. 
• Patients with creatinine clearance of <  60 mL/min  (including patients on dialysis)  will receive a 
dose of 0. 12 mg/kg, with a maximum dose  of 15 mg for patients in this subset  who weigh 
≥ 125 kg.  In patients on hemo dialysis,  CF-301/placebo will be administered either ≥ 8 hours 
prior to hemo dialysis or ≥  4 hours after the end of hemo dialysis.  
• Patients who are > 50 years of age will receive a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 
15 mg for patients in this subset who weigh ≥ 125 kg.  
If analyses by [CONTACT_544529] 0.4 mg/kg based on 
accrued PK exposure data in specific patient demographic groups, these will be described in 
Administrative Amendments or Clarification Letters to the protocol.   If the accrued PK data suggest 
the need for an increase in dose above the 0.4 mg/kg dose defined in the original protocol, then a protocol amendment will be issued.  
CF-301 will be provided as a sterile injectable solution in 10 mL vials.  Each vial will contain 4.0  mL 
of CF -301 (10 mg/mL).  CF -301 will be diluted as specified in the Pharmacy Manual and 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment # 4  June 22, 2018  
 14  
    administered as a 2 -hour IV infusion  using an IV set with an in -line filter (0.2 or 0.22 µm) with 
corresponding pump.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration: Placebo (vehicle control) will be provided 
as a sterile injectable solution in 10 mL vials.  Each vial will contain 4.0 mL of placebo.   Placebo will 
be administered diluted as specified in the Pharmacy Manual and administered  as a 2 -hour IV 
infusion  using an IV set with an in -line filter (0.2 or 0.22 µm) with corresponding pump.  
Duration of treatment:   Patients will receive a single dose of CF -301 or placebo in addition to  SOC  
antibacterial therapy .  The duration of SOC will generally be from 28 to 84 days based on the 
patient’s diagnosis  (28 to 42 days for complicated bacteremia/endocarditis and 42 to 84 days for 
osteomyelitis) , the investigator’s discretion, treatment guidelines, and standard practice.  
Duration of study (for each patient):  Each patient is expected to complete the core study (through 
TOC) in approximately 6 to 10 weeks, including scr eening, randomization, an estimated duration of 
approximately 28 to 42  days SOC, EOT visit, and TOC at  28-days after the end of SOC  treatment .  
Patients with osteomyelitis are expected to complete the core study (through TOC) in approximately 
10 to 16 week s, since estimated duration of SOC is 42 to 84 days.  
The study includes a long- term follow -up visit at Day 180 after CF-301/placebo administration for 
collection of an immunogenicity sample  and assessment of SAEs and re -infection .  The ability of the 
patie nt to return for the Day 180 visit is not required for enrollment in the study, but the visit is highly 
encouraged.  With the long -term follow -up through Day 180 after CF 301/placebo administration , the 
total study duration is approximately 25 weeks.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety and Immunogenicity:  
Adverse events will be monitored during the core study, from the time of consent through TOC .  
Patients must be directly observed  during CF-301/placebo infusion, and vital signs ( blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate ) will be performed approximately every [ADDRESS_711913] clinical signs 
and symptoms of allergic reactions to CF -301, the infusion shoul d be stopped immediately and vital 
signs checked; if hypotension or oxygen desaturation are present with or without skin flushing, hives, 
or rash, epi[INVESTIGATOR_544485] .  Additional treatments for 
sequelae of suspec ted anaphylactic reaction  should be provided in accordance with standard medical 
practice .  If a patient experiences signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (Simons, et al. , 
2011), bl ood sample s for serum tryptase and CF-301-specific IgE will be col lected as soon as possible 
within 2  hours .  If the serum tryptase sample is positive or equivocal, the sample may  also be tested 
for β -tryptase . Another blood sample for serum tryptase will be collected  2 weeks later . 
Safety laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be performed at randomization (pre -dose) , at approximately 2 to 4 hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion  
(for the first 17  patients randomized) , on Day 2, weekly  during SOC, at EOT , and at TOC .  Safety 
laboratory tests will be performed by a central laboratory.  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening, at approximately 2 to 4 hours after the start of 
CF-301/placebo infusion  (for the first 17 patients randomize d), on Day 2 , at EOT , and at TOC . 
Physical examination will be performed at screening, daily through Day 7 and on Day 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, at EOT, and at TOC .  Complete physical examinations will be 
performed at screening, Day 14, EOT, a nd TOC.  The physical examinations performed daily through 
Day 7 will be targeted physical examinations to evaluate for complications of BSI and will include assessments of head, eye, ear, nose, throat (HEENT), lungs, heart, skin for any evidence of emboli , 
and palpat ion for signs of pain.  P ain on physical examinations should trigger diagnostic testing for 
metastatic foci . 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment # 4  June 22, 2018  
 15  
    Vital signs will be performed at screening, approximately every 30 to 40 minutes during 
CF-301/placebo infusion and at approximately 30 to 40  minutes after the infusion , daily during SOC  
for inpatients (and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and 
Day 14 visits, and weekly thereafter ]), at EOT , and at TOC.   Vital signs will include blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate during infusion and b lood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate,  and 
temperature at all other time points.  
Blood samples will be collected for CF 301 -specific anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) and IgE at 
randomization (pre -dose) , Day 14, at EOT, at TOC, and on Day 180 after CF 301/placebo 
administration.  All testing will be performed at central laboratories, as described in the laboratory 
manual.  
If the patient agrees in the informed conse nt to have blood stored for optional future research (e.g., 
cytokine and chemokine assays and/or biomarker evaluation), 2 samples (1 serum and 1  plasma) will 
be collected at randomization (pre -dose) , 12 to 24 hours after CF -301/placebo dosing , on Day 7, and 
at EOT and TOC .  Note: future use samples will NOT  be collected from patients in Israel.  
An independent  DSMB will review accruing safety , tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK  data in an 
unblinded manner throughout the study , as detailed  in the DSMB chart er.  The Sponsor and study 
staff will remain blinded throughout the study.   The  DSMB will conduct an initial unblinded review 
of saf ety, tolerability, and PK data after approximately [ADDRESS_711914] PK data available 
(approximately 10 patients on CF -301 and approxi mately 7 patients on placebo ).  The DSMB will 
also assess whether the PK target for the 0.25 mg/kg dose has been attained as predicted from the 
population PK data from the Phase 1 study.  If the mean exposure to CF -301 is significantly lower 
(e.g., by >  25%) or higher than the mean exposure in healthy volunteers in Study CF -301-101 dosed 
at 0.25 mg/kg (i.e., the target safe and efficacious exposure), then to achieve the planned exposure 
target the DSMB may recommend dose adjust ment .  Enrollment will not be halted during the conduct 
of this review.  
After completion of the core study, all serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be collected  during the 
long- term follow -up through Day 180. 
Vital status (whether the patient is alive or dead, or last known alive date) will be obtained at Day  [ADDRESS_711915] to follow -up.  The patient’s vital status should be determined 
using available sources (e.g., the patient’s relatives, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and/or public records)  as 
permissible ba sed on local laws and regulations.  
Efficacy:  
Signs and symptoms of S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis will be evaluated at screening, daily during SOC 
for inpatients (and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and 
Day 14 visits, and weekly thereafter] ), at EOT, and at TOC.  
Two aerobic blood cultures preferably from [ADDRESS_711916] one aerobic 
blood culture  will be collected daily during the study until negative for 2  consecutive days and at 
Days  7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration.  Additional blood cultures will be performed as 
clinically indicated.   Blood cultures should be collected  from a peripheral venipuncture site when 
possible.  
In patients with CVCs, ultrasounds to evaluate clots in the vein are recommended  within 48 hours 
after randomization . 
Physical examinations will be performed at the time points described above under the “ Safety ” 
subsection and will include a close evaluation for any new areas of pain or signs of metastases; new 
signs  should trigger diagnostic testing for metastatic foci.  Metastatic foci  identified through Day [ADDRESS_711917]-randomization are considered related to  the patient’s baseline S. aureus  infection; new metastatic 
foci identified after Day [ADDRESS_711918]-randomization are considered progression of  the S. aureus  infection.

BMI > 30 kg/m2.  The site will provide all echocardiograms to the central echocardio graphy 
laboratory.  
Clinical and microbiological outcome will be assessed at Days 7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo 
administration, at EOT , and at TOC.  
Clinical outcome will be assessed by [CONTACT_544530].   
The signs and symptoms evaluated for clinical outcome assessments are presence of  shortness of

    Pharmacokinetics (PK):  
Blood samples will be collected for PK assessment of CF -301 in 3 subsets of patients as listed below.  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from patients in both the CF -301 group and the placebo 
group to maintain the blind.  
• PK Subset 1 :  A minimum of approximately 17 patients and up to approximately 34 patients 
(30%) will give serial PK samples at the following time points:  pre-dose, 0.5 (30 minutes) , 
1.5 (1 hour 30 minutes) , 2, 2.25  (2 hours 15 minutes) , 3, 4, 8, 14, 2 4, and 48 hours after the 
start of study drug infusion.   The sponsor will determine if additional patients will give serial 
PK samples in Subset 1  based on ongoing review of accrued PK data , and the number o f 
patients giving limited PK samples (Subsets 2 and 3 below) will be reduced accordingly.   
Note: PK Subset 1 will not be conducted in Israel.  
• PK Subset 2 : Approximately 40 patients (35%) will give limited PK samples at the following 
time points:  2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes) , 3, 8, and 2 4 hours after the start o f study drug 
infusion.  
• PK Subset 3 : Approximately 40 patients (35% ) will give limited PK samples at the following 
time points:  2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes) , 4, 8, and 24 hours after the start of study drug 
infusion.  
Permitted time windows are as follows:  
• ± 10 minutes around the samples at 0.5 and 1.5 hours after the start of infusion  
• ˗ 10 minutes before the sample at the end of infusion  (the sample is to be drawn before the 
infusion is complete and can be obtained up to [ADDRESS_711923] clock time should be recorded).  
• ± 10 minutes around the samples at 2.25, 3, and 4 hours after the start of infusion 
• ± 1 hour around the sample at 8 hours after the start of infusion  
• ± 2 hours around the samples at 14 and 24 hours after the start of infusion . 
• ± 4 hours around the sample at 48 hours after the start of infusion.  
PK parameters of CF -301 will be assessed from patients with se rial PK sampling, including 
maximum plasma concentrations (C max), time to C max (Tmax), elimination half -life (T 1/2), clearance 
(CL), volume of distribution (Vz), and area under the curve (AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞). 
Pharmacodynamics (PD):  
The pharmacokinetic/pharm acodynamic  (PK/PD ) parameters include AUC 0-24hr/minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) , Cmax/MIC, and % Time > MIC  over a 24 -hour period.  PK/PD parameters will be 
calculated for patients who  have MICs available.

    Statistical methods:  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock and analyses of 
data.  Summary data will be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_1570] . 
Safety:  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_544532] (TEAEs), clinical 
laboratory evaluations (biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and temperature) and ECGs.  Abnormal physical examination 
results will be recorded as AEs.  A treatment emergent AE is o ne that occurs on or after the first dose 
of study drug through TOC . 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities.  The incidence of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT), by [CONTACT_2946], PT and 
relationship to study drug, and by [CONTACT_2946], PT and severity.  Serious AEs and TEAEs that lead to discontinuation of the study drug will also be presented by [CONTACT_3592].  Descriptive statistics for 
clinical laboratory, vital signs and ECG parameters, inc luding change from baseline, will be presented 
by [CONTACT_544533] -baseline value.  Incidences of 
potentially clinically significant clinical laboratory results, vital signs and ECG parameters, as defined 
in the S AP, will also be summarized by [CONTACT_544534] -
baseline value.  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy outcome is clinical improvement or response at Day 14 after CF -301/placebo 
administration in the microbiological intent -to-treat (mITT) population .  The number and percentage 
of patients with an improvement/response, no response, and indeterminate will be determined by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of the clinical 
improvement /response rates in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson 
method.  The clinical improvement/response rate will be compared between the treatment groups 
using Fisher's exact test.  Statistical significance will be based on a two -sided alpha level of 0.05.  
The number and percentage of patients with a clinical outcome of improvement/response, no 
response, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544535] 7 after CF -301/placebo 
administration, at EOT , and at TOC  in the mI TT population .  Exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals 
for the point estimates of the clinical improvement/response rates in each treatment group will be 
determined using the Clopper -Pearson method.  Statistical comparisons between the treatment groups 
will be conducted using Fisher's exact test and p -values will be provided as explorative  statistics.  
The number and percentage of patients with a microbiological response  of clearance of bacteremia , 
ongoing bacteremia , and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544536] 7 and 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administrati on
 in the mITT population .  The number and percentage of patients with 
a microbiological outcome of eradication/presumptive eradication, persistence/presumptive persistence, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544537] .  Exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of the clearance of 
bacteremia or microbiological eradication/presumptive eradication rates in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson method.  Statistical comparisons between the t reatment 
groups will be conducted using Fisher's exact test and p -values will be provided as explorative  
statistics.  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be utilized to determine the time to clearance of bacteremia  in the mITT 
population .  Time to clearance of bacter emia will be defined as the date/time from study drug 
administration to the date/time of the first negative blood culture of the two negative blood cultures 
taken on 2 consecutive days .  Patients whose SOC for BSI was changed by [CONTACT_1583] a SOC 
antibacterial agent, switching to a different SOC antibacterial agent , or increasing the dose of SOC  
due to persistence , worsening , or recurrence of  S. aureus  BSI, died prior to clearance of bacteremia or

withdrawal, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Data collected from Subset 1 will be used to determine the following PK parameters:  C max, Tmax, T1/2, 
CL, Vz, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞.  These values along with the listings for plasma conce ntrations from all 
3 subsets (Subsets 1 to  3) will be reported in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
All PK data collected in this study (Subsets 1, 2, and 3) will be pooled with the PK data collected 
from the previous Phase  1 study (Protocol CF -301-101) to update the previously developed 
population PK model ; this will be reported in a separate report, which will include the target 
attainment analysis.  The population PK and target attainment analyses will be described in a separate 
analysis plan.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
PK/PD analysis will be conducted to determine the AUC 0-24hr/MIC, C max/MIC, and % Time > MIC 
ratios.  PK/PD parameters of CF -[ADDRESS_711924] MICs available.

    a. Patients should be randomized as soon as possible after confirmation of study eligibility.  However, to provide flexibility, screening assessments may be 
performed within 24 hours before randomization.  Dosing should occur as soon as possible after randomization and within 24 hours of randomization.  
b. When a specific “Day”  or “D” is noted (e.g., Day 7, D7 ), the days are relative to CF -301/placebo administration  unless otherwise noted .  There is a ±1-day 
window around the procedures performed on Days 7 and 14.  
c. The core study ends at TOC performed 28 days after the end of SOC.  A long- term follow -up visit occurs at Day 180 after CF -301/placebo  for collection of an 
immunogenicity sample and assessment of SAEs and re -infection.  The ability of the patient t o return for the Day 180 visit is not required for enrollment in the 
study, but the visit is highly encouraged.  
d. Medical history for 1 year prior to screening.  
e. Certain components of the Apache II score will be determined locally (including oxygenation, Glas gow Coma Scale, and c hronic health points ) and other 
components will be  obtained from  central laboratory data.  
f. The investigator will determine diagnosis at screening  and on Day 7  to determine treatment duration . 
g. Local Laboratory :  Limited safety laboratory  tests may need to be performed locally at screening for study eligibility determination (e.g.,  serum creatinine to 
calculate creatinine clearance  by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault formula using ideal body weight in patients with BMI ≥ 30  kg/m2 (Section 12.2) to determine the dose of 
study drug, FSH as applicable).  If local laboratory results are available within the 72  hours prior to screening , these may be used to support eligibility.  Central 
Laboratory :  Samples for safety laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) collected at randomization (pre-dose), at 
approximately 2 to 4  hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion (for the first 17 patients randomized), on Day 2, weekly during SOC, at EOT, and at TOC.  
Samples are sent to a central lab . 
h. 12-lead ECG at screening, at approximately 2 to 4 hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion (for the fi rst 17 patients randomized), on Day 2, at EOT, 
and at TOC.  
i. PE at screening, daily through Day [ADDRESS_711928], abdomen, extremities, neurological status, skin for any evidence of emboli, palpation for signs of pain, and 
any other notable conditions.  Targeted PEs will be performed daily through Day 7 and include evaluation for complications of  BSI, HEENT, lun gs, heart, skin 
for any evidence of emboli, and palpation for signs of pain.  Pain on PEs should trigger diagnostic testing for metastatic foci.  
j. Vital signs at screening, approximately every 30 to 40 minutes during CF 301/placebo infusion and at approximat ely 30 to 40 minutes after the infusion, daily 
during SOC for inpatients (and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and Day 14 visits, and weekly thereafter] ), at EOT, 
and at TOC.  Vital signs will include blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate during /after  infusion and blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and 
temperature at all other time points .  If more than one measurement is taken on a given day, record the  highest value for temperature and most abnormal 
value for other vital signs  in the CRF . 
k. Symptoms of infection at screening, daily during SOC for inpatients (and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and 
Day 14 visits, and weekly thereafter] ), at EO T, and at TOC.  
l. For study eligibility, patients have blood culture  positive for S. aureus  by [CONTACT_544538] -positive cocci 
in clusters plus positive tube coagulase test from blood culture collected within 72 hours prior to randomization ; this qualifying blood culture  will be collected in 
the eCRF.  Additionally, t wo aerobic blood cultures preferably from [ADDRESS_711929] one aerobic blood culture  daily during the study until negative for 2 consecutive days and at Days  7 and 14 
and as clinically indicated.   Blood cultures should be collected from a peripheral venipuncture site whe n possible.   All blood cultures performed during the 
study (from the qualifying blood culture through to Day 180), including blood cultures  that are positive or negative  for S. aureus , should be entered in the 
eCRF.  S. aureus  isolates , including the isolate from the qualifying blood culture,  are sent to the central lab.  
m. For females of reproductive  potential only : Urine or serum pregnancy test performed locally  at scr eening for eligibility determination ; blood sample collected for 
serum pregnancy test performed by [CONTACT_544539] , EOT, and TOC . 
n. IV catheters known or suspected to be infected must be removed or changed as soon as possible within [ADDRESS_711930] a fo llow-up TTE between 
Days 7 and 14; where possible, a T EE should also be performed.  TEEs are strongly recommended in patients with BMI > 30  kg/m2.  The site will provide all 
echocardiograms to the central echocardiography laboratory.  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment # 4  June 22, 2018  
 26  
    p. In patients with central venous catheters (CVCs), ultrasounds  to evaluate clots in the vei n are recommended within 48 hours after randomization.  
q. PK Subset 1 : pre-dose, 0.5  (30 minutes) , 1.5 (1 hour 30 minutes) , 2, 2.25  (2 hours 15 minutes) , 3, 4, 8, 14, 24, and 48 hours after the start of study drug 
infusion.   Note: PK Subset 1 will not be conducted in Israel.  
PK Subset 2 : 2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes) , 3, 8, and 24 hours after the start of study drug infusion.  
PK Subset 3 : 2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes) , 4, 8, and 24 hours after the start of study drug infusion.  
r. Blood samples for CF 301 -specific ADA and IgE at randomization (pre -dose) , Day 14 , EOT, TOC, and Day 180; s amples are sent to the central lab.  
s. If a patient experiences signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (Simons, et al., 2011; Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), blood samples for serum tryptase and CF -301-
specific IgE will be collected as soon as possible within 2  hours.  If the serum tryptase sample is positive or equivocal, the sample may also be tested for 
β-tryptase.  Another blood sample for serum tryptase will be collected 2 weeks later.   Samples are sent to a central lab.  
t. If patient consents  to optional future research, t wo samples (1 serum and 1 plasma) for cytokine and IgE will be collected at  randomization (pre -dose) , 12 to 
24 hours after dosin g, on Day 7, and at EOT and TOC.   Samples are sent to a central lab.   Note: future use samples will NOT be collected in Israel.  
u. Patients must be directly observed during CF -301/placebo infusion, and vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate) will be p erformed during/after 
infusion as described above .  CF-301 will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, with a maximum dose  of 30 mg for  patients who  weigh ≥  120 kg.  Patients 
with creatinine clearance of <  60 mL/min  (including patients on dialysis) will receive 0.12  mg/kg , with a maximum dose  of 15 mg for patients in this subset who 
weigh ≥  125 kg.  In patients on hemo dialysis, CF -301/placebo will be admi nistered either ≥ 8 hours prior to hemodialysis or ≥  4 hours after end of hemodialysis.   
Patients who are > 50 years of age will receive a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 15 mg for patients in this subse t who weigh ≥ 125 kg.  
v. AEs will be collected from the time of consent through TOC.   After completion of the core study, all SAEs will be collected during the long -term follow -up through 
Day 180.  For patients who  are unable to return for the Day 180 visit, this information may be obtained via phone or email.  
w. All medications taken within 28 days before randomization and through the E OT will be recorded, and only antibacterial medications or medications to treat AEs 
will be recorded after EOT through TOC.  
x. Re-infection between TOC and Day 180 will be assessed for patients who me et the definition of response at TOC.  
y. Vital status (whether the patient is alive or dead, or last known alive date) will be obtained at Day  [ADDRESS_711931] to follow -up.  The 
patient’s vital status should be determined using available sources (e.g., the patient’s rel atives, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and/or public records) as permissible based on 
local laws and regulations.

Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711943] of a new class  of 
highly  targeted,  protein- based  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_544488] .  Lysins are a new class 
of antimicrobials consistent of bacteriophage -derived cell -wall hydrolases.  CF -301 represents  
a novel, highly  potent  and targeted  therapeutic  for Staphylococcus  aureus  (S. aureus)  blood 
steam infections (BSIs)  to augment conventional  antibiotics  which are the current  standard of 
care.  
S. aureus, a virulent  pathogen  in humans, is a leading  cause of bacteremia and 
endocarditis.   S. aureus  BSIs including  endocarditis  are associated  with substantial  
morbidity  and mortality.   For example,  in 2011, the [LOCATION_002] Centers  for Disease  
Control  (CDC) estimated  that there  were  80,461 serious  methicillin -resistant  S. aureus  
(MRSA) infection  cases  in the United  States,  all of which  required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
resulting  in up to 11,285 deaths  (Dantes  2013).  S. aureus  BSI is often  associated  with 
complications, including  metastatic bone  and soft tissue  infections, endocarditis,  and 
recurrent  infections.  Complicated  S. aureus  BSI requires  extended  duration treatment  with 
antibiotic therapy, often accompanied  by [CONTACT_544540]  (e.g. in the setting  of 
prosthetic  devices,  or metastatic  soft tissue  infections).  S. aureus  BSI associated  with 
prosthetic  devices  can be particularly  difficult  to treat due to the presence of biofilms  which  
conventional,  standard -of-care (SOC) antibiotics  are unable  to penetrate.   The availability  of 
a new,  highly  effective treatment  of S. aureus  BSI remains  an area of high unmet  medical  
need  due to the high degree  of morbidity  and mortality,  potentially  lengthy  treatment  burden, 
and the  increasing  prevalence of multidrug  resistant  strains.  
In in vitro  experiments,  CF-[ADDRESS_711944]  when  
administered  in combination  with SOC  antibiotic treatments  for S. aureus  BSI (e.g. 
daptomycin).   Importantly, while biofilm  formation limits  the efficacy  of SOC  antibiotics  in 
the treatment  of complicated  S. aureus  bacteremia  (including  endocarditis),  CF-[ADDRESS_711945]  considers  these nonclinical  data to be highly  predictive of human  response,  and as 
such, considers  CF-301 to offer significant  potential  to improve  patient  outcomes  when  
administered  in combination with SOC antibiotics  for the treatment of S. aureus  bacteremia . 
7.1.2. Overview  of S. aureus Blood Stream Infections  
S. aureus  is a leading  cause  of bacteremia and is associated  with substantial  morbidity  
including  a range  of potentially  serious  and life-threatening  complications  that may be 
difficult  to recognize  and manage  (e.g., endocarditis;  Fowler  et al, 2003). Intravenous  drug 
Protocol CF -301-102-4

    users  and patients  with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) and renal  insufficiency,  
especially  those  requiring  hemodialysis,  are particularly  at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  S. aureus  
infections.   Approximately  20% of patients  with S. aureus  BSI develop  metastatic 
complications  such as infective endocarditis.   The incidence of infective endocarditis  in the 
setting  of S. aureus  BSI has been  estimated  to be 10-15% (Fowler  et al, 2003;  Chang  et al, 
2003;  Valente  et al, 2005), although  incidence  as high as 21% has been reported  (Chang  et al, 
2003).  Risk factors  for infective endocarditis  in the setting  of S. aureus  BSI include:  presence  
of prosthetic  heart  valve;  predisposing  cardiac  abnormalities; injection  drug use;  intravascular  
catheter  infection;  bacteremia  of unclear  origin;  and persistent  bacteremia (Chang  et al, 2003; 
El-Ahdhab et  al, 2005; Hill et al, 2007).  
Infective endocarditis  due to S. aureus  BSI is associated  with substantial morbidity  and 
mortality  and is associated  with complications  more  frequently  than other causative 
pathogens  (stroke, 21% versus  14%;  systemic  emboli,  27% versus  18%;  persistent  
bacteremia,  17% versus  5 %; and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69436],  22% versus  14%, respectively)  
(Fowler  et al, 2005).  The  likelihood  of developi[INVESTIGATOR_544489], duration  of illness  prior to therapy,  and underlying  
comorbidities.   Symptomatic  cerebrovascular  complications  occur  in up to 35% of patients  
(Ruttman  et al, 2006;  Snygg -Martin  et al, 2008;  García- Cabrera  et al, 2013).  Silent  
cerebrovascular complications  (including  ischemia and microhemorrhage) may occur in up 
to 80% of patients  (Snygg- Martin  et al, 2008; Cooper et  al, 2009).  The in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544490] 18 to 23% and the six-month mortality  rate 
has been  estimated  to be between  22 to 27%  (Wallace  et al, 2002;  Chu et al, 2004;  Hasbun et 
al, 2003;  Hill et al, 2007; Wang  et al, 2007). 
7.1.3. Current Treatments and Drug Resistance  
Current  treatment of S. aureus  BSI includes  prompt  control  or removal  of the source  of 
infection  (e.g., removal  of implicated  intravascular  catheters  and/or surgical  drainage  of 
abscess if present ; López -Cortès  et al, 2013).  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_544491] -susceptible  S. aureus  (MSSA)  is generally  
indicated  when  blood  cultures  with Gram-positive cocci  are observed (Kim  et al, 2008;  
McConeghy  et al, 2013).  Treatment  failure  is fairly  common in patients  with S. aureus  
BSI, particularly  among  those  patients  with infection  due to MRSA  (Lodise  et al, 2008).   
Drug -resistance,  toxicity  related  to high dose/long  duration therapy, and biofilm  formation 
that cannot  be cleared  by [CONTACT_544541].   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_544492],  the 30-day all-cause  mortality  
of S. aureus  BSI has been estimated  to be between  20-40% (Anantha  et al, 2014; Van Hal et 
al, 2012).  
The threat  of antibiotic resistance among bloodstream  S. aureus  isolates,  and in particular,  
the increasing  prevalence of methicillin  resistance and the emergence of multi -drug 
resistance are of concern.  Among  24,000 nosocomial  bloodstream  infections  in the United  
States  between  1995 and 2002, the proportion of MRSA  isolates  increased  from  22% to 
57% (Wisplinghoff  et al, 2004).   Mortality  associated  with MRSA  bacteremia has been  
reported to be higher  than mortality  associated  with MSSA  bacteremia (Shurland  et al, 2007;  
Cosgrove  et al, 2003).   Both  the CDC  and the World Health  Organization  (WHO)  regard 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711946]  threats  to human health  worldwide,  with S. aureus  
bloodstream  infections, especially  MRSA,  categorized  as a “serious  threat” by [CONTACT_6750]. 
The treatment  of S. aureus  BSI, particularly  drug-resistant  strains,  is challenging  due to the 
limited  number of treatment options, and the requirements  for longer  duration,  high dose 
treatment  regimens.   Both  vancomycin  and daptomycin,  the only antibiotics  indicated  for the 
treatment  of MRSA,  are associated  with dose-limiting  toxicities.   Evidence  suggests  that 
emerging  resistance to current  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_544493]  (e.g., MRSA  with vancomycin  minimum 
inhibitory concentration [MIC] >1.5 μg/mL ), intermediate vancomycin  resistance (VISA),  and 
high-level  vancomycin  resistance (VRSA) are associated  with worse  clinical  outcomes  
(Bayer, 2013).   Use of daptomycin,  an alternative to vancomycin,  has grown over the past 
decade.   Risk factors  for the emergence  of daptomycin  resistance include previous  
exposure  to vancomycin,  infection  with a MRSA  strain  with a vancomycin  MIC of 2 μg/mL  
or greater,  and treatment  with insufficient  doses  of vancomycin  (Moise  et al, 2008;  Rose  et 
al, 2007;  Fowler  et al, 2006).  
As noted by [CONTACT_544542] (2005), while the introduction  of penicillin  to treat S. aureus  
BSI drastically  decreased  the case fatality  rate (CFR) of S. aureus  BSI from  ~80%  in the pre-
antibiotic  era, CFRs  reported over recent  decades  have  plateaued  in the ~15-50% range  
(Fowler  et al, 2005).  This continued  high mortality  rate may be, at least in part, reflective  of 
a relative  plateau  in antibiotic efficacy.   Hence,  there  is a medical  need  for novel,  highly  
effective,  targeted  new treatments  for S. aureus  BSI, with limited  propensity  for resistance 
and with the potential  for synergistic efficacy  and reduced  resistance when  used in 
combination with existing  agents.   A treatment  that would  target  all forms  of S. aureus  BSI 
would offer advantages  over a treatment  specific for specific  strains  (e.g., MRSA)  by 
[CONTACT_544543],  without  the need  to first determine  the 
susceptibility  of the S. aureus  strain.   Thus,  a therapeutic  agent,  such as CF-[ADDRESS_711947] of care  antibiotics  due to: (1) its novel  mechanism  
of action;  (2) bactericidal  activity  against  antibiotic -resistant  S. aureus ; (3) rapid  onset  of 
antibacterial  activity  both in vitro  and in vivo ; (4) narrow  lytic spectrum  of action;  (5) potent  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711948]  biofilms;  (6) synergistic  activity  with standard of care  antibiotics  (oxacillin,  
vancomycin,  and daptomycin ; (7) low  propensity  to  develop  bacterial  resistance;  and (8) 
ability  to protect  against  the emergence  of resistance to standard of care  antibiotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_544494].   CF-[ADDRESS_711949]  S. aureus.  
Full details of the background and development of CF -301 are available in the Investigator's 
Brochure. 
7.1.5. Preclinical Studies  
The efficacy of CF -301 was tested in two murine S. aureus  bacteremia models. CF -301 was 
administered as a single or multiple doses, either alone or in combination with SOC antibiotics  
(daptomycin, vancomycin or oxacillin).  Results from these studies demonstrated that:  
• CF-301 was e ffective in mouse bacteremia and neutropenic thigh infection models either as a 
single- agent or in combination with daptomycin , vancomycin, or oxacillin . In a rat endocarditis 
model, CF -301 wa s effective in combination with daptomycin . 
• CF-[ADDRESS_711950] en in 
tissues and the survival of mice in models of S. aureus bacteremia (including infections with a 
biofilm component), compared with antibiotic monotherapy . 
• CF-[ADDRESS_711951] S. aureus  biofilm in a mouse S. aureus infected 
catheter implant model alone  and in combination with daptomycin.  
• AUC/MIC is the PK -PD index most predictive of efficacy in the murine neutropenic thigh 
infection model . AUC/MIC values >1.5 and > 0.5 are supportive of efficacy as a single- agent 
and in combinati on with daptomycin, vancomycin, and oxacillin . 
Using the mouse neutropenic thigh infection model, AUC/MIC was determined to be the PK/PD 
index most predictive of efficacy of CF -301 administered either alone or in combination with 
daptomycin, vancomycin or oxacillin .  
• The minimal AUC/MIC ratios required to achieve bactericidal efficacy for CF -301 as a 
single- agent was ≥1.5 and CF -301 in combination with daptomycin was ≥0.3 and with 
vancomycin or oxacillin was ≥0.5.  In the mouse neutropenic thigh infection model with a catheter biofilm implant, a similar AUC/MIC value of ≥ 0.5 was determined to be correlated 
with efficacy.  
Target Attainment analysis utilizing population PK modeling for the purpose of supporting CF-301 dose selection for Phase 2 clinical eval uation was performed and demonstrates that in 
patients with S. aureus  BSIs, doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, given as a 2 -hour infusion (in 
the presence of SOC antibacterial therapy  (e.g., daptomycin), are predicted to be efficacious . 
Nonclinical studies  have been conducted to support clinical development: (1 .) Pharmacokinetic 
and distribution studies; (2.) Safety pharmacology studies were conducted under GLP in rats and 
Protocol CF -301-102-4

 38  
    dogs to assess the effects of CF -301 on the central nervous system ( CNS ) as well as 
cardiova scular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]; (3.) single- dose and repeat -dose GLP toxicology studies 
conducted in rats and dogs; (2) genotoxicity study (Ames); (4.) special toxicity studies; and (5. ) 
exploratory studies to determine the key PK parameter (AUC or C max) most correlated with 
toxicity.  The proposed route of administration and dosing regimen in human cl inical trials is a 
single 2 -hour IV infusion.  Therefore, the GLP in vivo  rat and dog nonclinical toxicology studies 
utilized 2 -hour IV infusions.  The  rat was identified as the more sensitive toxicity species.   A 
summary of these studies is provided below. 
• CF-301 is a therapeutic protein, which like other proteins undergoes catabolism by [CONTACT_544544], wit hout the need for metabolic enzymes, 
such as cytochromes  and are not  actively transported across membranes . Therefore, t he 
potential for drug -drug interactions with CF -301 is low . Further, beca use CF -301 undergoes 
catabolism  in multiple organ, excretion in urine is not a route of elimination and was not found 
and is not expected in humans. 
• The half -life of CF -301 was short (< 1 hour in rats and 1.2- 2.93 hours in dogs) and clearance 
was higher than the GFR in both species.  CF -301 distributed over total body water in both rats 
and dogs , indicating that CF -301 is distributed outside of the vascular space. There was no 
accumulation of CF -301 following 7 consecutive days of IV QD dosing via 2- hour infusion.  
• CF-[ADDRESS_711952] three 
doses administered one week apart and was shown to be secondary to ADA formation.  A 
similar response was not observed after a single administration, even at a high dose.   
• Following single doses of CF -301 in rats up to 25 mg/kg, anti -CF-301 antibodies were 
detected  14 days after dosing , with increasing numbers of positive samples identified with 
increasing dose s.  Following 7 daily repeated doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day  in rats and dogs, 
titers of anti -CF-301 antibodies were detectable in a few animals on Day  8 (following last 
dose) and increased in incidence and titer by [CONTACT_46062] [ADDRESS_711953] to the timeline of appearance of 
ADA.   
• Data from a GLP single- dose rat toxicity study.  The following key observations were made:  
o Perivascular/adventitial findings surrounding the pulmonary arteries , the primary 
toxicological observation  following a singl e 2-hour IV infusion, occurred at a low 
incidence and minimal severity at 10 and 25 mg/kg and resolved d uring a [ADDRESS_711954] level ( NOEL ) was 2.5 mg/kg following a single dose in the rat (the 
most sensitive species) and tr anslates to a human dose of 0.4 mg/kg.  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711955] level ( NOAEL ) was 25 mg/kg  following a single dose in 
the rat.  
• In 7-day GLP repeat -dose toxicity studies, dose -dependent adventitial finding s in both rats 
and dogs were the dose -limiting  toxicity observations .  Compared to a single dose of CF -301 
where the adventitial finding was of low incidence, minimal severity, and reversible at dose 
of ≤ 25 mg/kg, following repeated doses of CF -301, the adventitial finding increased in 
incidence, sev erity, and tissue distribution in  medium to larger blood vessels of multiple 
tissues. There was evidence of reversibility of the lesions as well as progression to chronicity 
of the lesions at higher doses of ≥  10 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs , following a [ADDRESS_711956] -
infusion treatment -free recovery period.  
• A series of special toxicity studies was conducted  and demonstrated that:   
o Enzymatically -active CF -301 produced the adventitial vascular reactions whereas 
enzymatically -inactive CF -301 did not; and  
o CF-[ADDRESS_711957] 
and Lewis rats. However , the precise nature of the hypersensitivity response (Type I or 
Type III) w as not definitively identified . Studies in rodents may not necessarily be 
predictive for humans in terms of the nature of hypersensitivity reactions ( Finkelman, 
2007).  See  information on clinical immunogenicity in S ections 7.1.6 and 7.2 and the IB . 
• A series of exploratory studies in the rat w as performed to identify the PK parameter mos t 
predictive of adventitial/perivascular findings in the great vessels of the cardio -pulmonary 
circulation and to more accurately predict the exposures associated with this finding. The 
goal of these investigations was to support the dose rationale for the Phase [ADDRESS_711958] 
associated with an observation of an arterial adventitial/ perivascular finding in the 
pulmonary arteries.  
• The exposure limit at the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544495] 1 study was based on the 
NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg in the  rat that showed a C max value  of 1940 ng/mL. The associated 
AUC 0-24 was 2520 ng•h/mL.  These values were derived from a single rat TK study with only 
18 rats. Along with the FIH Phase 1  study , several more toxicology studies were conducted 
that brought up t he total number of rats to 270 and dogs to 78. Cross -species PK modeling of 
the totality if the TK data was performed to better define the exposure levels at the Cmax and 
AUC at the rat NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg:  
o Based on this collective analysis , the predicted mean AUC 0-24 was 3596 ng •h/mL and the 
predicted mean C max was 1754 ng/mL following a single 2.5 mg/kg 2 -hour infusion of 
CF-301 (the rat NOEL dose).  
In summary , the efficacy and safety of CF -[ADDRESS_711959] mouse models of efficacy, t arget attainment simulations were performed. These

    showed that in patients with S. aureus  BSIs, doses  of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, give n as a 
2-hour infusion (in the presence of SOC antibacterial therapy  (e.g., daptomyci n, vancomycin, or 
oxacillin ), are predicted to be efficacious.  The toxicity of CF -[ADDRESS_711960] been shown to provide  exposure below the predicted C max and AUC values at the rat 
NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg.  
Additional detail on the preclinical studies  can be found in the CF -301 Investigator’s Brochure. 
7.1.6. Clinical Studies  
CF-301 has been  evaluated in one Phase 1 clinical study, CF -301-101, which was a double -blind, 
randomized, study to evaluate the safety, toler ability, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of single, 
escalating IV doses of CF -[ADDRESS_711961] (DSMB) reviewed safety and PK  data at  pre-specified time points throughout the study and rendered a 
recommendation to the Sponsor as to whether or not dosi ng should progress as planned. 
A total of 143 males and females were screened for participation in the study and 97 of those potential sub jects were screened for the presence of CF -301-specific antidrug antibody [ADA], 
CF-301-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE], and ex vivo CF -301-specific basophil activation test 
[BAT].  Thirte en potential s ubjects were excluded due to positive ADA, 5 were excl uded due to 
positive BAT, and 1 was excluded due to positive BAT and IgE.  A total of 20 healthy male and 
female subjec ts were enrolled in the study.  Thirteen subjects received active drug CF -301 
(4 subjects at the 0.04 mg/kg/dose level; 4 subjects at the 0.12 mg/kg/dose level; 4 subjects at the 0.25 mg/kg/dose level; and [ADDRESS_711962] at the 0.4  mg/kg/dose level), and 7 subjects received 
placebo .   
CF-301 was generally safe and well tolerated during study CF -301-101.  There were no deaths, 
no serious adverse events  (SAEs), and no discontinuations due to adverse events ( AEs) during 
the study.  There were no infusion reactions or adverse events of hypersensitivity related to 
CF-301 reported.  A total of 5 non- serious AEs were reported by 4 subjects:  [ADDRESS_711963] infection and viral infection.  All TEAEs were mild in intensity and resolved.  Only 1 treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) 
(headache in the CF -301 group) was considered related to study drug.  The number of TEAEs 
observed in the placebo and CF -301 groups was similar and the incidence of AEs among 
subjects who received CF -301 was not dose -dependent. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of CF -301 are summarized in Table 3.  After IV infusion of CF -301, 
plasma concentrations and PK parameters (C
max and AUC) inc reased in a linear and dose  
proportional manner with a slope less  than 1, i.e., for a 2- fold increase in dose , AUC or C max 
increased by 1.75 -fold.  However, there was no evidence of a plateau in exposures by [CONTACT_544545].  The geometric mean  (GM)  t½ ranged from 
4.[ADDRESS_711964] values ranging from 4.33 to 14.7 hours across the 
4 cohorts with no apparent relationship to dose.

Results of immunogenicity testing showed that a total of 9 of 13 subjects (69%) dosed with 
CF-301 developed CF -301-specific ADA  (7 by  [CONTACT_2006] 28 and 2 by [CONTACT_2006] 90) .  ADA titers at Day 28 
were variable and ranged from 1:10 to 1:2560, and were waning or absent by [CONTACT_2006] 180.  Only [ADDRESS_711965] ( BAT ).  Consideration of this 
single, transient low -level signal for CF -301-reactive IgE, along with the lack of any signal from 
the CF ‑301-specific BA T, suggests a low risk for allergic- type hypersensitivity.  
In conclusion, CF -301 was generally well tolerated at doses of 0.04, 0.12, 0.25, and 
0.4 mg/kg/dose, and no clinical adverse safety signals were observed.   The increase in plasma 
AUC and C
max of C F-301 across the dose range of 0.04 to 0.4 mg/kg/dose was less than dose -
proportional with no evidence of a plateau in exposures.  Whi le 69% of subjects developed 
CF-301-specific ADA, no correlation between ADA titers and either IgE or BAT was observed.  
ADA response signals were decreasing or absent by [CONTACT_2006] 180.  T here was no detectable CF -301 
in urine . 
Additional detail on Study CF -301-101 can be found in the CF -301 Investigator’s Brochure.  
7.2. Risks and Benefits  
Pre-clinical  pharmacology and toxicity studies  (Section 7.1.5) indicate that a single dose of 
CF-301 at 0.25mg/kg administered to patients with S. aureus BSIs including endocarditis is 
anticipated to be an efficacious dose with exposures well below the levels which were associated with toxicity in animal models.  Animal infection model results are considered to be highly predictive of human efficacy in antibacterials.  Furthermore, the Phase 1, single ascend ing dose 
clinical study of CF -301 demonstrated CF -301 to be well tolerated, with no adverse clinical 
safety s ignals, with a linear PK profile at the intended dose for use in this Phase 2 (0.25 mg/kg).  
The Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and PK of CF -301 in addition to  
SOC antibacterial therapy in patients with complicated S. aureus  BSIs (bacteremia) including 

Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 42  
    endocarditis.  As previously described (Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3), S. aureus BSIs including 
endocarditis are highly morbid conditions, which result in substantial morbidity and mortality 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_544496], SOC antistaphylococcal antibiotics.  An important objective of the Phase 2 study is to evaluate whether CF -301 in addition to SOC antibacterial therapy  improves 
clinical outcomes i n these patients compared to SOC alone.  As such, all patients in this study 
will be treated with SOC antibacterial therapy for S. aureus  BSI or endocarditis based on current 
guidelines.  The therapeutic benefits and side effects of SOC antibacterial agent s are documented 
in the prescribing information and published literature.  
Patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of CF -301 or placebo in addition to  SOC 
antibacterial therapy , and no patients in the study will be treated with the experimental  therapy, 
CF-301, alone.  Together with the favorable safety and tolerability profile in Phase 1, a single 
dose of CF -301 may provide additional clinical benefit over and above the benefit of SOC 
treatment, which allows for a positive benefit/risk ratio.  
Since this is the first time that CF -[ADDRESS_711966].  All patients will be dosed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544497], 
physical examinations, vital signs, 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical safety laboratory 
tests, and immunological tests.  Patients will  be directly observed during CF -301/placebo 
infusion, and vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate) will be performed approximately every 30 to 40 minutes during the infusion and at approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the infusion.  An independent DSMB will review unblinded safety data throughout the 
study as defined in the DSMB charter.  
As CF -301 is a protein- based therapeutic, and therefore hypersensitivity is possible, patients will 
be monitored closely for immunologic responses to CF -301 both clinically and by [CONTACT_544546] -301- specif ic ADA  and CF -301-specific IgE.  Importantly, in the Phase 1 
study, no hypersensitivity related to CF -301 was observed.  Furthermore, the incidence and 
magnitude of pre -existing (pre -dose) CF -301- specitic- IgE in CF -301-naïve healthy subjects and 
patients w ith S. aureus  bacteremia has been evaluated and found to be low.  Taken together, this 
provides strong evidence to support the conclusion that the risk of immediate, IgE- mediated, 
allergic reaction to CF -[ADDRESS_711967] measurable pre -existing (pre -dose) CF -301-specific ADAs, the clinical relevance 
of these findings is unknown.  The current study consists of only a single dose of CF -301.  
Patients will be dosed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544498] -301/placebo infusion, 
and vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate) will be performed approximately 
every [ADDRESS_711968] clinical signs and symptoms of allergic reactions to CF -301, the 
infusion should be stopped immediately and vital signs checked; if hypotension or oxygen desaturation are present with or without skin flushing, hives, or rash, epi[INVESTIGATOR_544499] (Section  11.2.3).  Treatments for acute allergic 
hype rsensitivity reactions should be provided in accordance with standard medical practice.  
Overall, based on risk/benefit analysis, the Sponsor considers the current study to be appropriate in the planned population.

    7.3. Population to be Studied 
Adult patients wi th S. aureus  BSI including endocarditis  will be included in this study.  
7.4. Rationale for Route and Dose  
CF-301 will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 2 hours  and is not expected to be orally 
bioavailable.  
CF-301 was shown to be effective as a single dose when given in combination with SOC 
antibacterial therapy in eradicating S. aureus  in the neutropenic murine thigh infection models 
(standard models for assessing anti -infective drug PK/PD parameters [Louie et al.,  2001]) as  well 
as in other  in vitro  and in vivo models of activity.  A population PK analysis was performed on 
the data from the CF -301-[ADDRESS_711969] that the majority  of 
patients in Study CF -301-102 who would receive a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg CF -301 as a 
2-hour IV infusion in combination with SOC antibacterial therapy are expected to achieve 
AUC/MIC ratios that are equal to or greater than the efficacious AUC/MIC ratios of 0.5 (i.e., the 
ratio established in  a neutropenic thigh model  to be efficacious when CF -301 was given with 
daptomycin ).  PK/PD modeling of the available animal and human data support a target 
efficacious d ose in humans to be between 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg.  T herefore, a single dose of 
0.25 mg/kg CF -301 administered as a 2 -hour infusion in combination with SOC antibacterial 
therapy is anticipated to achieve the desired AUC/MIC ratio of 0.5 or greater in >80% of patients for isolates with an MIC of ≤  2 µg /ml. 
The GLP single- dose toxicity study in rats (Study CF -301-054) established a 2.5 mg/kg dose 
given as a 2 -hour IV infusion in rats as the NOEL.  Initially at t he IND application, the only 
available TK/toxicity data was from Study CF -301-052 which was a single daily dose  in 72 rats  
that determined an AUC
0-inf of 2270 ng•h/mL and a C max of 1900 ng/mL associated with this 
NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg.  Additional  TK and toxicity studies have been performed in order to 
refine the understanding of the critical C max and AUC exposures associated with adventitial 
findings that were observed in pulmonary arteries of rats following single 2 -hour IV infusion at 
doses abov e the NOEL dose.  
Cross -species population PK modeling on pooled data from available TK and toxicity studies in 
both the rat s (n=27) and dog s (n=78).  The analysis  support  that a CF -301 NOEL dose of 
2.5 mg/kg in rats is associated with an AUC 0-24 of 3600 ng •h/mL and a C max of 1750 ng/mL.  
Further, interrogation of all rat and dog toxicity data by [CONTACT_544547] a 2 -hour IV infusion of 
CF-301 at doses above the 2.5 mg/kg NOEL .  Neural Network analysis provides a  method for 
analyzing data with minimal assumption about the nature and type of relationships between variables and allow inclusion of all available variables in one analysis without the need for user 
selection and provide an additional level assessment compared to conventional statistical 
analysis.  
The population PK modeling data (animal and human) support that a singl e dose of CF -301 
≤ 0.4 mg/kg administered  as a 2 -hour IV infusion would not exceed the AUC and C
max limits  
associated with NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg 2- hour infusion in rats  and would, therefore, be

Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 44  
    expected to be well tolerated and not associated with adverse clinical effects.  Single doses of 
CF-301 at 0.25 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg administered as 2- hour IV infusions were assessed in study 
CF-301-101 and were well tolerated, although the 0.4 mg/kg dose was only administered to one 
subject.  Interpretive criteria i ndicate that the majority of contemporary clinical S. aureus  isolates 
have an MIC <  2 µg/ml, and are predicted to be susceptible to CF -301 at 0.25 mg/kg and 
0.4 mg/kg doses in humans. 
From a benefit/risk perspective, the selected dose of 0.25 mg/kg for the  current study  is expected 
to maintain AUC/MIC ratios of > 0.5, which is well above the expected efficacious threshold 
established in animal efficacy studies, and is expected to result in exposures in humans (AUC 
and C max) that are approximately two -fold l ower than the exposures ass ociated with the NOEL in 
rats. 
Therefore, based on the safety, efficacy, and PK results of study CF -301-101 and cross -species 
population PK modeling, t he clinical efficacy and safety of the CF -301 0.25 mg/kg dose in the 
current s tudy is predicted to be efficacious by [CONTACT_31577]/PD target attainment modeling and is predicted 
to be well within the safety limit of exposure based on PK/TK modeling.  
The modeling of the data described in the paragraphs above demonstrates that a single dose of 
0.25 mg/kg in humans may be needed to achieve target AUC:MIC ratios of ≥ 0.5 in > 80% 
patients for isolates with an MIC of > 2 μg/mL .  Modeling of the PK data supports that a single 
dose of 0.4 mg/kg of CF -301 administered as a 2 -hour IV infusion would not exceed the 
modeled AUC 0-24 of 3600 ng•h/mL or C max 1750 ng/mL exposure limits associated with the 
NOEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg established in the rat following a 2 -hour I V infusion, as described 
above. 
Following a review of the 0.25 mg/kg dose data from the Phase 2 study by [CONTACT_4318] (based on 
predefined criteria described in a DSMB charter ), if the observed AUC 0-24 turn out to be 
significantly lower (by >25%) or higher than the target AUCs predicted from the study CF-301-101, the DSMB may recommend that the d ose of CF -301 may be adjusted in order to 
achieve exposure targets.  
7.5. Rationale for Inclusion of Patients with Renal Impairment  
Patients with renal insufficiency are at high risk for infection with complicated S. aureus  BSI; 
therefore, it is anticipated that  patients with renal insufficiency may derive benefit from a new 
therapeutic agent that may provide additional benefit above SOC alone.  Therefore, patients with 
renal insufficiency are an important patient population in which to study the safety, efficacy , and 
PK of CF -301 on a background on SOC antibacterial therapy.  
CF-301 is a recombinant protein with a molecular mass of approximate 26 kDa.  Measurement of 
CF-301 levels in urine of healthy subjects in Study CF -301-101 determi ned a negligible amount 
(<0.1% the dose) of CF -301 excreted in urine.  The lack of urinary excretion of CF -301 is 
consistent with the expected route of elimination of endogenous and biotechnology -derived 
proteins via tissue catabolism resulting in degradation to small peptides and in dividual amino 
acids (S6R1).  
In a biodistribution study of Iodine -131 radio -labeled CF -301 in mice, IV administration of 
131-I-CF-301, resulted in detection of CF -301 in multiple tissues (CF -301-023).  The kidneys had 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711970] level of CF -301, followed by [CONTACT_4852], spleen, stomach, lung, and blood that was 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_544500] -301 in the majority of organs, including the kidney, 
suggesting rapid clearance of CF -301 from the blood and catabolism by [CONTACT_544548]. This is 
consistent wi th normal catabolism of protein and peptides (Meibohm and Zhou, 2012; Czock et 
al, 2012; Maack, 1979; Meier et al, 2004; lshimitsu et al, 1994).  Furthermore, literature reviews 
reveal that even in subjects with severe renal impairment, the capacity for catabolism of peptides and small proteins (e.g., < 60 kDa), remains substantial (>50% remaining capacity).  
Based on the collective CF -301 nonclinical and clinical data and published literature, the main 
route of elimination for CF -301 is understood to be cat abolism and not urinary excretion. Also, 
even patients with severe renal impairment, retain substantial capacity for protein catabolism 
(Meibohm and Zhou, 2012; Czock et al, 2012; Maack, 1979; Meier et al, 2004; lshimitsu et al, 
1994). Thus, CF -301 dosing in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (defined as 
creatinine clearance 30 to 80 mL/min) was not expected  to substantial ly impact CF -301 plasma 
levels.  
Given the single- dose administration paradigm of CF -301, and the potential benefit of CF -301 to 
patients with renal insufficiency who are at risk for complicated S. aureus  BSIs, inclusion of 
patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency including  patients undergoing dialysis was 
initially  planned at a single- dose level of 0.25 mg/kg.  Based on the DSMB’s review of PK 
exposure data, patients with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min (including patients on dialysis)  
will receive a dose of 0.12 mg/kg.  In view of the spleen ’s role as a major organ for CF -301 
catabolism, subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min who are asplenic were  excluded from 
the study  under prior versions of the protocol and subjects with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min 
who are asplenic will be excluded  under this amendment .  Enrollment and subsequent tolerability 
and clinical outcome of these patients will be closely monitored as a component of DSMB 
activities , as described in the DSMB charter .  In patients on hemo dialysis, CF -301/ placebo will 
be administered either ≥ 8 hours prior to dialysis or ≥  [ADDRESS_711971] the safety of patients in this study, and allow for continued evaluation of CF -301 in 
this important population.  
7.6. Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulatory and Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) requirements.

Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711972] from blood culture specimens collected within 72  hours prior to randomization are 
eligible for the study.  
Approximately 115 patients will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
• Group 1: CF -301 in addition to  SOC antibacterial therapy (70 patients) 
• Group 2: Placebo in addition to SOC antibacterial therapy (45 patients) 
Patients who are randomized will receive a single dose of CF -301 or placebo (at the doses 
described in Section 9.4) over a 2- hour infusion in addition to appropriat e SOC antibacterial 
therapy.  
Standard- of-care antibacterial therapy will be selected by [CONTACT_544549], treatment guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011; Baddour et al., 2015), and other local 
guidelines.  Standard -of-care ag ents include daptomycin and vancomycin for MRSA and 
semi -synthetic penicillins (e.g., nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxicillin, flucloxacillin) and first -generation 
cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) for MSSA.  If susceptibility is not known at the time of 
randomiz ation, the patient should be treated empi[INVESTIGATOR_544501]; if prevalence of MRSA is high, empi[INVESTIGATOR_544483].  Once 
susceptibility data are available, SOC may be changed at the investigator’s discretion based on 
susceptibility results to one of the SOC options described above.  Standard- of-care should be 
administered at the doses and durations speci fied in the manufacturer’s prescribing information, 
treatment guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011; Baddour et al., 2015), other local guidelines, and clinical 
practice.  The suggested duration of SOC treatment is 28 to 42 days for complicated bacteremia 
and/or endocarditis  and 42 to 84 days for osteomyelitis .  Patients with known or suspected 
uncomplicated bacteremia are not eligible for the study; however, if a randomized patient is 
subsequently determined to have uncomplicated bacteremia, the suggested duration of SOC 
treatment is approximately  [ADDRESS_711973] be removed or changed and replaced at a different site as soon as possible within 72  hours 
after randomization.  In patients with central venous catheters (CVCs), ultra sounds to evaluate 
clots in the vein are recommended  within [ADDRESS_711974] one aerobic blood culture  
will be collected daily during the study until negative for 2  consecutive days and at Days  7 and 
14 after CF -301/placebo administration.  Additional blood cultures will be performed as

    clinically indicated.  Blood cultures should be collected from a peripheral venipuncture site when 
possible. 
Physical examinations will be performed at screening, daily through Day 7 and on Day 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, at EOT, and at TOC.  The physical examina tions will include a 
close evaluation for any new areas of pain or signs of metastases; new signs  should trigger 
diagnostic testing for metastatic foci.  
All patients should have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within [ADDRESS_711975] a 
follow -up TTE between Days 7 and 14; where possible, a transesophageal echocardiogram 
(TEE) should also be performed (Baddour et al., 2015; Habib et al., 2010; Habib et al., 2015).  
TEEs are strongly recommended in patients with body mass index (BMI) > 30.  The site will 
provide all echocardiograms to the central echocardiography laboratory.  
Safety monitoring will include AE monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECGs, clinical safety laboratory tests, and immunological monitoring.  Safety 
monitoring  will be performed during the core study from screening through TOC, and a 
long- term follow -up will occur at Day 180 after CF -301/placebo administration.  An independent 
DSMB will review unblinded safety data throughout the core study as defined in the DSMB charter.  
Blood samples for PK will be collected.  
Clinical response will be assessed by [CONTACT_093].  The  Adjudi cation Committee will assess 
clinical response at predefined intervals.  The efficacy analysis of clinical response will be based 
on the Adjudication Committee’s assessment.  
9.2. Number of Patients  
Approximately 115 patients with S. aureus  BSI will be randomized (3:2) to receive a single dose 
of CF -301 or placebo. 
In a study of Staphylococcus aureus  bacteremia and endocarditis, 61.7% and 60.9% of patients 
receiving daptomycin and standard of care therapy in the modified intent to treat population, 
respectively, were considered a clinical success at the end of therapy  (Fowler et al., 2006).  The 
median duration of therapy was [ADDRESS_711976] 
of care group.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume an expected clinical improvem ent or response 
rate of 60% in placebo group.

    9.3. Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 115 patients will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
• Group 1: CF -301 (70 patients) 
• Group 2: Placebo (45 patients)  
9.4. Dosing and Dose  Adjustment Criteria  
Study Drug 
CF-301 a nd placebo will be provided as  sterile injectable solution s in 10 mL vials.  Each vial of 
CF-301 will contain 4.0 mL of CF -301 (10 mg/mL).  Placebo (vehicle control) is similar  in 
appearance to CF -301, but does not contain the active ingredient.  CF -301 and placebo will be 
diluted as s pecified in the Pharmacy Manual and administered  as a 2 -hour IV infusion. 
The dosing scheme is as follows:  
• CF-301 will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg , with a maximum dose  of 30 mg for 
patients who  weigh ≥  120 kg.  
• Patients with creatinine clearance of <  60 mL/min (including patients on dialysis)  will 
receive a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, with a maximum dose  of 15 mg for patients in this subset who 
weigh ≥  125 kg.  In patients on hemo dialysis, CF -301/placebo will be administered either 
≥ 8 hours prior to hemo dialysis or ≥  4 hours after the end of hemo dialysis.  
• Patients who are > 50 years of age will receive a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, with a maximum dose 
of 15 mg for patients in this subset who weigh ≥ 125 kg.  
If analyses by [CONTACT_544550] 0.4 mg/kg 
based on accrued PK exposure data in specific patient demographic groups , these will be 
described in Administrative Amendments or Clarification Letters to the protocol.  If the accrued PK data suggest the need for an i ncrease in dose above the 0.4 mg/kg dose defined in the original 
protocol, then a protocol amendment will be issued.  
Patients must be directly observed during CF -301/placebo infusion, and vital signs (blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate) will be perform ed approximately every [ADDRESS_711978] clinical signs and symptoms of allergic reactions to CF -301, the infusion 
should be stopped immediately an d vital signs checked; if hypotension or oxygen desaturation 
are present with or without skin flushing, hives, or rash, epi[INVESTIGATOR_544499].  Additional treatments for sequelae of suspected anaphylactic 
reaction  should be provided in accordance with standard medical practice.  If a patient 
experiences signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (Simons, et al., 2011 ; Table 4), 
blood samples for serum tryptase and CF -301- specific IgE will be collected as soon as possible 
within [ADDRESS_711979] 
practice at the site, treatment guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011; Baddour et al., 2015), and other local 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711980] -of-care agents include daptomycin and vancomycin for MRSA and 
semi -synthetic penicillins (e.g., nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxicillin, flucloxacillin) and first -generation 
cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) for MSSA.   Note : pati ents who are receiving teicoplanin, 
linezolid, telavancin, ceftaroline fosamil, and/or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim are eligible for 
the study provided that treatment is switched  to a SOC agent.  
If susceptibility is not known at the time of randomization,  the patient should be treated 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_544502]; if prevalence 
of MRSA is high, empi[INVESTIGATOR_544503].  Once susceptibility data are available, SOC may be 
changed at the investigator’s discretion based on susceptibility results to one of the SOC options 
described above.  
Standard- of-care should be administered at the doses and durations specified in  the 
manufacturer’s prescribing information, treatment guidelines ( Liu et al., 2011; Baddour et al., 
2015), other local guidelines, and clinical practice.  
The suggested duration of SOC treatment is 28 to 42 days for complicated bacteremia and/or endocardit is and 42 to 84 days for osteomyelitis .  Patients with known or suspected 
uncomplicated bacteremia are not eligible for the study; however, if a randomized patient is 
subsequently determined to have uncomplicated bacteremia, the suggested duration of SOC 
treatment is approximately 14 days.  The  investigator will determine diagnosis at screening and 
during the study to determine treatment duration.  
Recommended doses for SOC antibacterial agents are as follows:  
• Nafcillin or equivalent : 12 g every 24 hours divided into 4 to 6 infusions daily  
• Cefazolin: 6 g every 24 hours divided into 3 infusions daily  
• Vancomycin: 30 mg/kg every 24 hours divided into every 12 hour (q12h) dosing with 
vancomycin tro ugh levels being 10 to 20 µg/mL.  Vancomycin dosing should be adjusted 
based on trough levels.  It is rec ommended that trough levels are repeated after 
adjustment of vancomycin dosing.  Vancomycin trough levels will be collected in the CRF.   Since red man syndrome is a known side effect of vancomycin, do not administer 
vancomycin at the same time as study dru g.  Study drug should be administered either 
prior to the start of vancomycin infusion or a minimum of 2 hours after vancomycin infusion is complete.  
• Daptomycin : 6 to 8 mg/kg once daily  
The manufacturer’s prescribing information for the SOC antibacterial agents should be 
referenced for full dosing information.

discontinuation include  any of the following:  
• Patient is unable or unwilling to complete the study drug infusion  
• Patient withdraws informed consent at any time during study drug infusion  
• Clinical signs and symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to CF -301 (see 
Section  11.2.3 for procedures to be performed in the event of anaphylaxis ) 
• AE (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further infusion of study drug in 
the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Sponsor  
• The Investigator considers that it is in the patient’s best interest not to continue the study 
drug infusion  
• Other medical reaso n, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor  
Patients who  discontinue  from study drug (i.e., have the infusion stopped before the full dose is 
administered) should continue to participate in study visits unless consent was withdrawn.  
10.3.2. Discontinuation  from the Study  
Reasons for discontinuation during the core study or during the long- term follow -up include  any 
of the following:  
• Patient is unable or unwilling to adhere to the protocol  
• Patient is unable to return for the long -term follow -up (Day 180 only)  
• Patient withdraw s informed consent  
• AE (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further participation in the study in the judgment of the Investigator  and/or Sponsor  
• Patient lost to follow -up [Note: v ital status (whether the p atient is alive or dead, or last 
known alive date) will be obtained when a patient is deemed to be lost to follow -up 
(Section 12.14)].  
• The Investigator considers that it is in the patient’s best interest not to continue participation in the study  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor  
The reasons for withdraw from the core study and during the long- term follow -up will be 
collected separately on the CRF.  The ability of the patient to return for the Day 180 visit is not required for enrollment in the study, but the visit is highly encouraged; patients who  are unable 
to return for the visit  should be contact[CONTACT_279265]  (Section  11.3).  If a patient 
completes the core study,  but does not return for the long -term follow -up, he/she will be 
considered as having completed the core study.

    11. SCHEDULE OF OBSERVATIONS  
The study flow chart is provided in Section 3 and a study schematic i s provided in Section  3.  
The study procedures performed at each visit are described in the subsections below.  
11.1. Study Duration 
Patients will receive a single dose o f CF-301 or placebo in addition to SOC antibacterial therapy.  
The duration of SOC will generally be from 28 to 84 days based on the patient’s diagnosis  (28 to 
42 days for complicated bacteremia/endocarditis and 42 to 84 days for osteomyelitis) , the 
investigator’s discretion, treatment guidelines, and standard practice.  
Each patient is expected to complete the core study (through TOC) in approximately 6 to 
10 weeks, including screening, randomization, an estimated duration of approximately 28 to 
42 da ys SOC, EOT visit, and TOC at  28-days after the end of SOC treatment . Patients with 
osteomyelitis are expected to complete the core study (through TOC) in approximately 10 to 16 weeks, since estimated duration of SOC is 42 to 84 days.  
The study includes a long- term follow -up visit at Day 180 after CF -301/placebo administration 
for collection of an immunogenicity sample and assessment of SAEs and re -infection .  The 
ability of the patient to return for the Day 180 visit is not required for enrollment in the s tudy, but 
the visit is highly encouraged.  With the long -term follow -up through Day 180 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, the total study duration is approximately 25 weeks.  
11.2. Core Study  
11.2.1. Screening  
Patients will be screened to determine whether or not they  meet the eligibility criteria for the 
study.  P atients should be  randomized as soon as possible  after  confirmation of study eligibility .  
However, to provide flexibility, screening assessments may be performed within 24  hours before 
randomization.  For the purposes of the visit schedule,  screening is considered Day ˗1. 
The qualifying  blood culture collected within 72 hours prior to randomization that supports study 
eligibility will be collected in the eCRF  and the isolate will be sent to the central laboratory 
whenever possible  (Section 12.12).  In addition, two aerobic blood cultures are collected at 
screening, as d escribed below.  
If local laboratory test  results from the patient’s routine care are available from the 72  hours 
before  screening , these  may be used to support study eligibility determination  (Section 12.13). 
If the patient had an echocardiogram performed prior to enrollment in the study for the current 
infection, this will be provided to the central echocardiography laboratory  (Section 12.8). 
The following procedures  will be performed at the time of Screening : 
• Informed consent  (see Section 12.1)  
• Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Medical history for the prior 1 year 
• Risk factors for complicated S. aureus BSI  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 58  
    • Diagnosis  
• Local laboratory testing, if needed for eligibility determination (see Section 12.13), and to 
determine serum creatinine to calculate creatinine clearance by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault formula  using 
ideal weight for patients with BMI ≥  30 kg/m2 (Section  12.2) to determine the dose of study 
drug. 
• 12-lead ECG  
• Complete physical examination  (Section 12.6), inc luding body weight and height.  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and temperature).  If more than one 
measurement is taken on the day assessment, the highest value for temperature and most 
abnormal value for other vital signs  should be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Symptoms attributable to S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis  
• Two aerobic blood cultures  preferably from [ADDRESS_711988] 
30 minutes apart and as close to the start of study drug dosing as possible (collected via peripheral venipuncture when possible ).  Results of a ll blood cultures (including blood cultures 
that are positive or negative for S. aureus ) will be entered in the eCR F and S. aureus isolates 
will be sent to the central laboratory (Section  12.12) 
• Urine  or serum  β-hCG pregnancy test for women of reproductive pot ential only (performed 
locally study eligibilit y; see Section 12.13  and Inclusion Criteria in Section 10.1)  
• AE assessment from the time informed consent is obtained  
• Medication review  
11.2.2. Randomization  
Patients who are screened and determined to be eligible for the study will be randomized via an 
interactive web  response system (IWRS).  For the purposes of the visit structure, the day of 
CF-301/placebo dosing  considered Day 1 of the study.  Dosing should occur as soon as possible 
after randomization and within 24 hours of randomization.  The following procedures  will be 
performed on the day of randomization:  
• Collect components of Apache II score.  Certain components of the Apache II score will be 
performed locally and collected on the CRF ( including oxygenation, Glasgow Coma Scale, 
and chronic health points ) and other components will be obtained from  central laboratory data.  
• Blood and urine samples for clinical safety laboratory tests pre -dose and approximately 2 to 
4 hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion (for the first 17 patients randomized). (sent 
to the central laboratory; see S ection 12.13) 
• Blood sample for serum pregnancy test for women of reproductive potential only (sent to the central laboratory; see Sect ion 12.13).  
• 12-lead ECG  at approximately 2 to 4 hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion (for the 
first 17 patients randomized)  
• Targeted physical examination  (Section 12.6).  Note: if the physical examination at screening 
was performed within 3 hours of randomization, it does not need to be repeated.  
• Vital signs : 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 59  
    • Temperature.  If more than one measurement is taken on the day of randomization , the 
highest temperature should be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate approximately every 30 to 40  minutes 
during the infusion and at approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the infus ion. 
• Symptoms attributable to S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis  
• An aerobic blood culture  collected prior to CF -301/placebo dosing  (collected via peripheral 
venipuncture when possible ).  All  blood culture ( including blood cultures that are positive or 
negative for S. aureus ) will be entered in the eCRF and S. aureus  isolates will be sent to the 
central laboratory (Section  12.12) 
• Intravenous catheters known or suspected t o be infected must be removed or changed and 
replaced at a different site as soon as possible within 72  hours after  randomization  
• All patients should have a TTE within [ADDRESS_711989] ration of study drug.  If the patient had an echocardiogram 
performed prior to the study that was intended to evaluate the current infection, it will be sent 
to the central echocardiography laboratory and the TTE within 3 days of randomization does not nee d to be performed.  TEEs are strongly recommended in patients with BMI > 30
 kg/m2.  
The site will provide all echocardiograms to the central echocardiography laboratory.  
• Ultrasounds to evaluate clots in the vein are recommended  within 48 hours after randomization  
in patients with CVCs . 
• Blood samples for PK at the time points described in Section  12.16.  
• Blood samples for immunogenicity sam ples (ADA, IgE) and optional future research collected 
pre-dose (to be sent to the central laboratory (Section 12.13).  Note: future use samples will 
NOT be collect ed from patients in Israel.  
• CF-301/placebo dosing .  Patients must be directly observed during CF -301/placebo infusion  
(see Section 11.2.3).  
• AE assessment  
• Medication review  
11.2.3. Study Drug  
Patients will receive a single dose of study drug (CF -301 or placebo) as described in Section 9.4.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Allergic Reactions  / Anaphylaxis  
Patients must be directly observed during CF -301/placebo infusion, and vital signs (blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate) will be performed approximately every [ADDRESS_711990] clinical signs and symptoms of allergic reactions to CF -301, the infusion 
should be stopped immediately and vital signs checked; if hypotension or oxygen desaturation are present with or without skin flushing, hives, or ras h, epi[INVESTIGATOR_544505].  Additional treatments for sequelae of suspected anaphylactic 
reaction  should be provided in accordance with s tandard medical practice.  
If a patient experiences signs and symptoms consisten t with anaphylaxis as described  in Table 4, 
blood samples for serum tryptase and CF -301- specific IgE will be collected as soon as possible 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 60  
    within 2  hours.  If the serum tryptase sample is positive or equivocal, the sample may also be 
tested for β -tryptase. Another blood sample for serum tryptase will be collected 2 weeks later.   
Collection of these samples is important to further support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.  
Anaphylaxis should be reported as an SAE (see Section  14). 
Table 4:  Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylax is is highly likely when any one  of the following three criteria is fulfilled  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (e.g. 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) OR  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergena for that 
patient  (minutes to several hours)  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized urticaria, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdomi nal pain, vomiting)

a. Or other trigger, for example, immunologic but IgE -independent, or non -immunologic (direct) mast cell activation.  
11.2.4. Standard -of-Care  Antibacterial Therapy  
Standard- of-care antibacterial therapy will be administered as described in Section 9.[ADDRESS_711991] information on the entire course of SOC antibacteria l treatment  for the 
patient’s current epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] S. aureus BSI/endocarditis , including SOC received prior to patient’s 
entry in the study.  
For the purposes of the visit schedule , the day of CF -301/placebo dosing  is considered Day 1 of 
the study and each su bsequent day during SOC is considered a sequential study day (i.e., Day 2, 
Day 3, Day 4, etc.). 
There is a ±1 -day window around the procedures performed on Days 7 and 14. 
The following procedures will be performed during SOC:  
• Diagnosis  assessment on Day 7  
• Blood and urine samples for clinical safety laboratory tests on Day 2 and weekly during SOC 
(sent to the central laboratory; see Section 12.13) 
• 12-lead ECG  on Day 2  
• Targeted physical examinations (Section 12.6) daily through Day 7.

 61  
    • Vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and temperature) daily for inpatient s 
(and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and Day 14 
visits, and weekly thereafter] ).  If more than one measurement is taken on a given day, the 
highest value for temperature and most abnormal value for other vit al signs  should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
• Symptoms attributable to S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis assessed daily for inpatients (and at 
weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and Day 14 visits, 
and weekly thereafter] ). 
• An aerobic blood culture  collected daily until negative for 2  consecutive days and at Days  7 
and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration.  Additional blood cultures will be performed as 
clinically indicated.  Blood cultures should be collected from a peripher al venipuncture site 
when possible.  Results of a ll blood cultures (including blood cultures that are positive or 
negative for S. aureus ) will be entered in the eCRF and S. aureus  isolates will be sent to the 
central laboratory (Section 12.12) 
• If not done at randomization, intravenous catheters known or suspected to be infected must be 
removed or changed and replaced at a different site as soon as possible within 72  hours after 
randomization  
• If not done at randomization, a ll patients should have a TTE within 3 days of randomization.  
If the patient had an echocardiogram performed prior to the study that was intended to evaluate 
the current infection, it will be sent t o the central echocardiography laboratory and the TTE 
within 3 days of randomization does not need to be performed.  TEEs are strongly recommended in patients with BMI > 30
 kg/m2.  The site will provide all echocardiograms to 
the central echocardiography laboratory.  
• If not done at randomization, ultrasounds to evaluate clots in the vein are recommended within 
48 hours after randomization in patients with CVCs . 
• Blood samples for PK at the time points described in  Section  12.16.  
• Blood samples for immunogenicity samples (CF -301 ADA & IgE) on Day 14 (to be sent to 
the central laboratory (Section 12.13). 
• Blood samples for optional future research on Day 2 and Day 7 (to be sent to the central 
laboratory (Section 12.13).  Note: future use samples will NOT be collected from patients in 
Israel.  
• AE assessment daily  
• Medication review daily  
• Clinical outcome assessment on Day 7 and Day 14 (Section 12.15) 
11.2.5. End of Standard -of-Care  
A visit will be performed on or within 2 days after the end of SOC.  For the purposes of the visit schedule, this visit is termed the “EOT” visit.  
The following procedures will be performed at the EOT:  
• Blood and urine samples for clinical safety laboratory tests (sent to the central laboratory; see Section 12.13)  
• 12-lead ECG  
Protocol CF -301-102-4

 62  
    • Complete p hysical examination  (Section 12.6) 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and temperature).  If more than one 
measurement is taken  on the day assessment , the highest value for temperature and most 
abnormal value for other vital signs  should be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Symptoms attributable to S. aureus  BSI/endocarditis . 
• Blood cultures as clinically indicated.  Blood cultures should be collected from a peripheral 
venipuncture site w hen possible.  Results of a ll blood cultures (including blood cultures that 
are positive or negative for S. aureus ) will be entered in the eCRF and S. aureus  isolates will 
be sent to the central laboratory (Section 12.12). 
• Blood sample for serum pregnancy test for women  of reproductive potential only (sent to the 
central laboratory; see Section 12.13).  
• Blood samples for immunogenicity samples (CF -301 ADA & IgE) (to be sent to th e central 
laboratory (Section 12.13).  
• Blood samples  for optional future research.  Note: future use samples will NOT  be collected 
from patients in Israel.  
• AE assessment  
• Medication review  
• Clinical outcome assessment (Section 12.15) 
Every attempt must be made to ensure the patient returns for the EOT visit, including offering 
support to the patient to facilitate return for the visit (e.g., reimbursement of travel expens es).  If 
extenuating circumstances prevent the patient from returning to the study site for the EOT visit, the site must contact [CONTACT_544554].  In the event the EOT visit is  conducted over the 
phone, the site should collect information on signs/symptoms of infection, SOC antibacterial therapy, concomitant medications, and AEs.  The investigator should make an assessment of 
clinical outcome based on the data collected.  If the patient is at another facility (e.g., nursing 
home, another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), the site should obtain medical records from that facility wh enever 
possible. 
11.2.6. Test-of-Cure  
A test -of-cure visit will be performed 28 days (±  4 days) after the last day of SOC antibacterial 
therapy.  F or the purposes of the visit schedule, this visit is termed the “TOC ” visit.  The 
procedures to  be performed at TOC  are the same as the EOT procedures, listed above in 
Section  11.2.5.  
Every attempt must be made to ensure the patient returns for the TOC visit, including offering  
support to the patient to facilitate return for the visit (e.g., reimbursement of travel expenses).  If 
extenuating circumstances prevent the patient from returning to the study site for the TOC visit, 
the site must contact [CONTACT_544555].  In the event the TOC visit is  conducted over 
the phone, the site sh ould collect information on signs/symptoms of infection, SOC antibacterial 
therapy, concomitant medications, and AEs .  The investigator should make an assessment of 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 63  
    clinical outcome based on the data collected.  If the patient is at another facility (e.g.,  nursing 
home, another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), the site should obtain medical records from that facility whe never 
possible. 
11.3. Immunogenicity Follow -up 
The study includes a long -term follow -up visit at Day 180 (± 14 days)  after CF -301/placebo 
administration for collection  of an immunogenicity sample and assessment of SAEs and 
re-infection .  The ability of the patient to return for the Day 180 visit is not required for 
enrollment in the study, but the visit is highly encouraged  and the site may offer support for the 
patient  to facilitate return for the visit  (e.g., reimbursement of travel expenses).   
The following procedures will be performed at the Day 180 visit: 
• Blood samples for CF -301 ADA & IgE  will be collected and sent to the central 
laboratory (Section 12.13).  
• Re-infection between TOC and Day 180 will be assessed by [CONTACT_544556] m eet the definition of response at TOC  (Section 12.15;  Table 6).  
• Blood cultures should be performed between TOC and Day 180 as clinically indicated.  
Results of a ll blood cultures (including blood cultures that are positive or negative for S. 
aureus ) will be entered in the eCRF and  S. aureus  isolates will be sent to the central 
laboratory (Section 12.12).  
• All SAEs will be collected through Day  180. 
• Vital status (whether the patient is alive or dead , or last known alive date ) will be 
obtained  when a patient is deemed to be lost to follow -up and for all patients at Day  180.  
The patient’s vital status should be determined using available sources (e.g., the patient’s 
relatives, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and/or public records) as permissible based on local laws and 
regulations.  
For patients who  are unable to return for the vis it, relapse, S AE information, and vital status  may 
be obtained via phone or email.  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711992] be in accordance with all applicable 
ethical and regulatory requirements.  
It is anticipated, by [CONTACT_544557], unconscious state, etc.  Therefore, in a situation where a patient  is unable to 
provide consent for him/herself, informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_544558], which must comply with an individual country’s local laws and ethics 
committees regulating the enrollment of incapacitat ed adults into clinical trials.  
This process must be expedited to ensure that securing a representative’s consent does not lead to 
delays that may result in increased risk or delayed medical treatment to the patient.  
Therefore, the following will be applied as long as local laws allow:  
• Consent from a legal (LR) or authorized (AR) or legally authorized representative (LAR) or next of kin or legally appointed individual in person or judge or specifically appointed lawyer for this purpose as required by [CONTACT_427];  
• In extreme and urgent circumstances when emergent action is required to save the life of the 
person concerned, restore good health or allevia te suffering, it is understood that the 
presumed will of the patien t will be determined by a physician and documented based on 
his/her knowledge of the study subject. The physician will follow the process required by 
[CONTACT_544559].   Note: under the FDA 
regulations, the type of consent described in this bullet is only allowed when the research is 
reviewed under the exception from informed consent as emergency research (21 CFR 50.24).  
Therefore, for enrollment at sites in the [LOCATION_002], informed consent should be given by 
[CONTACT_76409] a LAR.  
When consent is obtained remotely (by [CONTACT_6791], scanned copy, etc.) according to local regulations via a LR / LAR / AR / next of kin / legally appointed individual, an original signature [CONTACT_544584].  
Patient s enrolled in the study on the basis of consent by a LR / LAR / AR / next of kin / legally 
appointed individual / independent physician or by a physician will be given the opportuni ty to 
provide written confirmatory consent when and if they become able to do so and if the local regulat ions allow and/or require this.  If the subject declines to confirm consent, he/she will be 
withdrawn from the study at the point where he/she declines  consent.  
In addition, where local regulatory and ethics committees allow, advance consent may be obtained prior to study entry in an attempt to obtain personal consent from the patient themselves.  
Should a patient  who is enrolled in the study on the basis  of advance consent subsequently 
become unable to make medical decisions for him/herself, then the patient 's legally acceptable 
next of kin / LAR / LR / AR should be informed of the patient 's participation in the trial.

    The above guidelines apply to all areas of the protocol where Informed Consent is referenced.  
12.2. Cockcroft -Gault  
Estimated creatinine clearance is calculated by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault  formula as follows:  
 
In patients with BMI < 30  kg/m2: 
Estimated creatinine clearance = [(140 -  age) x weight in kg] /[72 x serum creatinine in 
mg/dL] [x 0.85 if female].  
In patients with BMI ≥ 30  kg/m2: 
Estimated creatinine clearance = [(140 -  age) x ideal body weight in kg]/[72 x serum 
creatinine in mg/dL] [x  0.85 if female].  
o For height in inches: Ideal body weight = 2 .3 kg x each inch over 5 feet + W  
o For height in cm: Ideal body weight = 0.9 kilograms × (height (cm) − 152) + W  
W = 50 kg for males; 45.5 kg for females  
12.3. Medical History  
A complete medical history for 1 year prior to screening will be recorded for each pati ent.  
Medical history will include previous and current medical diagnoses and major surgical procedures.  
12.4. Diagnosis  
The investigator will determine diagnosis at screening and during the study to determine 
treatment duration.  Diagnosis definitions are provided in Section  23.1).  
12.5. Apache II score  
Certain components of the Apache II score will be determined locally  (including oxygenation, 
Glasgow Coma Scale, and chronic health points) on the day of randomization and collected on 
the eCR F and other components will be obtained from  central laboratory data.  
12.6. Physical Examination  
Physical examination will be performed at screening, daily through  Day 7 and on Day 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, at EOT, and at TOC.   
Complete physical examinations will be performed at screening, Day 14, EOT, and TOC.   
Complete  physical examination s include, but are  not limited to, evaluation of the head, ey es, 
ears, nose, throat  (HEENT) , neck, lungs, heart , chest, abdomen, extremities, neurological status, 
skin for any evidence of emboli, palpation for signs of pain, a nd any other notable conditions . 
Weight and height will be measured at screening.  If it is  not possible to measure weight and 
height at screening, a recently available historical weight and height can be used.  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 66  
    Targeted physical examinations will be performed daily through Day 7.  Targeted physical 
examinations include evaluation for complicatio ns of BSI, HEENT, lungs, heart, skin for any 
evidence of emboli, and palpation  for signs of pain. 
Pain on physical examinations should trigger diagnostic testing for metastatic foci.  
12.7. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening, at approximately 2 t o 4 hours after the start of 
CF-301/placebo infusion (for the first 17 patients randomized), on Day 2, at EOT, and at TOC.  
Heart rate, PR interval, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTCF values will be recorded on the eCRF.  Any 
clinically relevant ab normality will be recorded as an adverse event and will be followed to 
resolution/satisfaction.  
12.8. Echocardiogra m 
All patients should have a TTE within [ADDRESS_711993] a follow -up TTE between Days 7 
and 14; where possible, a TEE should also be performed (Baddour et al., 2015; Habib et al., 
2010; Habib et al., 2015).  TEEs are strongly recommended in patients with BMI > 30
 kg/m2.  
The site will provide all echocardiograms to the central echocardiography laboratory .  The 
central echocardiography laboratory will review the echocardiograms for diagnostic evaluation of valvular function and other parameters. 
12.9. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be performed at screening, approximately every 30 to 40 minutes during CF-301/placebo infusion and at approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the infusion, daily during 
SOC for inpatients (and at weekly scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the 
Day 7 and Day 14 visits, and weekly thereafter] ), at EOT, and at TOC.  Vital signs will include 
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate during infusion and blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], heart rate, and temperature at all other time poin ts.  If more than one measurement is taken 
on the day assessment, the highest value for temperature and most abnormal value for other vital 
signs should be recorded in the eCRF.  
12.10.  Symptoms  of Infection  
The investigator will assess symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, fatigue, confusion, and 
pain associated with metastatic foci) at screening, daily during SOC for inpatients (and at weekly 
scheduled visits for patients who are discharged  [i.e., at the Day 7 and Day 14 visits, and weekly 
thereafter] ), at EOT, and at TOC.   The investigator will determine if symptoms are attributable to 
S. aureus BSI/endocarditis .  The investigator will assess symptom s as follows:  
Absent   
Mild  Awareness of sign or symptom , but easily tolerated  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 67  
    Moderate  Inter feres  with normal activities  and may require minimal intervention  
Severe Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal activities  and/or 
requires significant medical intervention  
12.11.  Management of IV Catheters  
Intravenous catheters known or suspected to be infected must be removed or changed and 
replaced at a different site as soon as possible within [ADDRESS_711994] t o identify S. aureus  if it is available at the site 
(Section  23.3).  
The qualifying  blood culture collected within [ADDRESS_711995] one 
aerobic blood culture will be collected daily during the study until negative for 2  consecutive 
days and at Days  7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration.  Additional blood cultures will 
be performed as clinically indicated.  Blood cultures should be collected from a peripheral 
venipuncture site when possibl e.  Results from a ll blood cultures performed during the study 
(from the qualifying blood culture through to Day 180), including blood cultures that are positive 
or negative for S. aureus , should be entered in the eCRF.  S. aureus  isolates, including the i solate 
from the qualifying blood culture, are sent to the central lab.  
The study site’s local microbiology laboratory will perform identification and in vitro  
susceptibility testing  to SOC antibiotics according to local practices .  The investigator should 
ensure that all S. aureus  isolates obtained from all cultures performed during the study period 
(and wherever possible, the isolate from the initial positive culture for S. aureus ) are sent to the 
central microbiology laboratory, as described in Section 23.3 and the laboratory manual.  The 
central microbiology laboratory will repeat the identification and perform in vitro  susceptibility 
testing of isolates in batches  for the purposes of the final study analysis; the central microbiology 
laboratory will not be providing ‘real -time’ results.  Further evaluation to identify the potential 
mechanism of resistance may be performed.  
The use of FDA -cleared or CE -IVD c ertified rapid diagnostic  tests to identify S. aureus  may be 
employed to reduce the amount of prior empi[INVESTIGATOR_544506].  Patients  may be enrolled based on a positive result from a rapid 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_711996] negative result for S. aureus  or missing blood 
culture at screening should continue to be followed in the study for safety assessments.  
12.13.  Laboratory Testing 
12.13.1. Central Laboratory 
The laboratory  tests that will be performed by [CONTACT_544560]  23.4.  The details for sample collection, preparation, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_544507] a separate laboratory manual.  The following samples will be 
collected for sending  to the central laboratory:  
• Blood and urine samples will be collected for s afety laboratory tests (biochemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) at randomization (pre -dose), at approximately 
2 to 4 hours after the start of CF -301/placebo infusion (for the first 17 patients 
randomized), on Day 2, weekly during SOC, at EOT, and at TOC.  
• Blood samples for serum pregnancy testing will be collected at randomization , EOT, and 
TOC (female patients of reproductive potential).   The pregnancy test that qualif ies the 
patient for study eligibility is performed locally, as described under Section 12.13.2.  
• Blood samples will be collected for CF 301 -specific anti -drug antibody (ADA) and IgE at 
randomization (pre -dose), Day 14, at EOT, at TOC, and on Day 180 after CF 301/placebo 
administration.  
• If a patient experiences signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (Simons, et al., 
2011; Section [IP_ADDRESS]), blood samples for serum tryptase and CF -301-specific IgE will 
be collected as soon as possible within 2  hours.  If the serum tryptase sample is positive 
or equivocal, the sample may also be tested for β -tryptase. Another blood sample for 
serum tryptase will be collected 2 weeks later.  
• If the patient agrees in the informed consent to have blood stored for optional future 
research (e.g., cytokine and chemokine assays and/ or biomarker evaluation), 2 samples 
(1 serum and 1 plasma) will be collected at randomization (pre -dose), 12 to 24 hours after 
CF-301/placebo dosing, on Day 7, and at EOT and TOC.  Note: future use samples will 
NOT  be collected from patients in Israel.  
12.13.2. Local Laboratory  
Limited safety laboratory tests  may need to be  performed by [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory at 
screening so that timely results are available for study eligibility determination.  If laboratory safety results are already available within the [ADDRESS_711997]- of-
care/routine testing, these results may be used to support eligibility determination.  The 
laboratory tests that are required to be available locally for eligibility determination are those that 
are part of the incl usion/exclusion criteria, as follows:  
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 69  
    • Serum  creatinine to calculate creatinine clearance by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault formula  using 
ideal body weight in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (Section  12.2) to determine the dose 
of study drug 
• Urine  or serum  pregnancy test ( for women of reproductive potential ; see inclusion 
criteria)  
• FSH (to confirm postmenopausal status as applicable; see inclu sion criteria)  
Other safety laboratory tests may be performed locally at the investigator’s discretion to assess 
the patient in general for study eligibility.   During the study, a dditional clinical laboratory safety 
testing should be performed at the site’ s local laboratory per the site’s standard of care for 
routine clinical management of the patient.  
12.14.  Vital Status  
Vital status (whether the patient is alive or dead, or last known alive date) will be obtained at 
Day [ADDRESS_711998]  to follow -up.  The patient’s vital status should be 
determined using available sources (e.g., the patient’s relatives, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and/or public records) as permissible based on local laws and regulations.  
12.15.  Contraception  
Contraception requirements ar e described in the Inclusion Criteria (Section 10.1).  
The manufacturer’s prescribing information for the SOC antibacterial agents should be 
referenced for informat ion related to pregnancy and contraception.  
12.16.  Efficacy Outcome Assessments  
Clinical and microbiological outcome will be assessed at Days 7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo 
administration, at EOT, and at TOC.  
Clinical Outcome:  Clinical outcome will be assessed by [CONTACT_544561] 5.  The signs and 
symptoms evaluated for clinical outcome assessments are presence of shortness of breath, 
sweating, fatigue, confusion, pain associated with metastatic foci, fever, leukocytosis, leukopenia, bandemia , tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. 
Re-infection will be assessed at Day 180 after CF -301/placebo administration  for patients who 
meet the definition of response at TOC ( Table 5).  Re -infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_544562].  The definition of re- infection is 
provided in Table 6.

    12.17.  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for PK assessment of CF -301 in 3 subsets of patients as listed 
below.  Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from patients in both the CF -301 group and 
the placebo group to maintain the blind.  Blood samples for PK may be collected by [CONTACT_544563] a central IV catheter.  For s amples < [ADDRESS_712002] be collected from a different site than the site of infusion.   The s pecific details 
pertaining to sample collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_544508] . 
• PK Subset 1 :  A m inimum of approximately 17 patients and up to approximately 
34 patients ( 30%) will give serial PK samples at the following time points:  pre- dose, 
0.5 (30 minutes), 1.5 (1 hour 30 minutes), 2, 2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes), 3, 4, 8, 14, 24, 
and 48 hours after the start of study drug infusion.  The sponsor will determine if 
additional patients will give serial PK samples  in Subset 1  based on ongoing review of 
accrued PK data, and the number of patients giving limited PK samples (Subsets 2 and 3 
below) will be reduced accordingly.  Note: PK Subset 1 will not be conducted in Israel.  
• PK Subset 2 :  Approximately 40 patients (35%) will have  limited PK samples collected 
at the following time points:  2.25 (2 hours 15 minutes), 3, 8, and 24 hours after the start 
of study drug infusion.  
• PK Subset 3 :  Approximately 40 patients (35%) will have  limited PK samples collected 
at the following time points:  2.25  (2 hours 15 minutes), 4, 8, and 24 hours after t he start 
of study drug infusion.  
Permitted time windows are as follows:  
• ± 10 minutes around the samples at 0.5 and 1.5 hours after the start of infusion  
• ˗ 10 minutes before the sample at the end of infusion (the sample is to be drawn before 
the infusion is  complete and can be obtained up to [ADDRESS_712003] clock time should be recorded).  
• ± 10 minutes around the samples at 2.25, 3, and 4 hours after the start of infusion  
• ± 1 hour around the sample at 8 hours after the start of infusion  
• ± 2 hours around the samples at 14 and 24 hours after the start of infusion.  
• ± 4 hours around the sample at 48 hours after the start of infusion. 
PK parameters of CF -301 will be assessed from patients with serial PK sampling, including 
maximum plasma concentrations (C max), time to C max (Tmax), elimination half -life (T 1/2), 
clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vz), and area under the curve (AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞). 
12.18.  Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
The PK/PD parameters include AUC 0-24hr/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), C max/MIC, 
and %Time > MIC  over a 24 -hour period.  PK/PD parameters will be calculated for patients who  
have MICs available.

After the first approximately [ADDRESS_712005] received the CF -301 0.25 mg/kg or placebo single 
2-hour infusion and have PK data available, the DSMB will assess the exposures in this initial 
group of patients, as detailed in the DSMB Charter .  If the mean exposure to CF -301 is 
significantly lower (e.g., by >  25%) or higher than the mean exposure in hea lthy volunteers in 
Study CF -301-101 dosed at 0.25 mg/kg (i.e., the target safe and efficacious exposure), then the 
DSMB may recommend dose adjust ment of CF -301 to achieve the planned exposure target  that 
was established to be safe and is expected to be efficacious (refer to Section  7.1.5 for toxicology 
data and animal PK/PD data) .  Additional DSMB reviews are described in the DSMB charter.   
Enrollment will not be halted during the conduct of DSMB  review s.  No formal efficacy analys es 
will be conducted at the  time of these reviews ; however, descriptive summary tables of key 
efficacy endpoints ma y be provided to support assessment of benefit/risk.   If analyses by [CONTACT_544564] 0.4 mg/kg  based on accrued PK 
exposure data in specific patient demographic groups , these will be described in Administrat ive 
Amendments or Clarification Letters to the protocol.  If the accrued PK data suggest the need for 
an increase in dose above the 0.4 mg/kg dose defined in the original protocol, then a protocol 
amendment will be issued.  
12.20.  Adjudication Committee  
An independent blinded Adjudication Committee will adjudicate the Day 7  diagnosis , and this 
adjudicated  diagnosis will be considered the final diagnosis to be used for the analysis.  In 
addition, c linical response and re -infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_544565].  The efficacy analysis of clinical response and re -infection will be based on 
the Adju dication Committee’s assessment .  The role  of the Adjudication Committee and 
procedures for adjudi cation are described in the Adjudication Committee Charter .

and/or prepared infusion may contain small visible particles.  Therefore, the pharmacist/study staff responsible for preparing study drug will not be involved in any other study procedures or assessments.  Measures will be put into place (e.g., covering the infusion bag) to ensure the study staff administering the study drug are not unblinded.  Additional details are provided in a separate Pharmacy Manual.  
The specified  dose  and volume  of CF -301 or placebo  will be calculated  for individual patients  
and diluted as specified in the Pharmacy Manual .  The patient’s  weight  at screening  will be used  
to calculate the  mg/kg do se of study  drug.  If it is not possible to measure weight at screening, a

Investigator may assign  some  of the  drug  accountability  duties  to an appropriate qualified 
pharmacist  or designee.  Inventory and accountability  records  must be  maintained  and must be  
readily  available for inspection by [CONTACT_544566].  
The Investigator or designee will  be expected  to collect  and retain all  used, unused, and  partially  
used containers  of study  drug until the end of the  study.  The Investigator or designee must  
maintain  records  that document:  
• investigational  product delivery  to the  study  site 
• the inventory  at the site 
• use by [CONTACT_544567] , including  injection  vials  from each  supply  dispensed  
These records  should include  dates,  quantities,  batch/serial  numbers  (if available),  and the unique

    14. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
14.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
14.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or cl inical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Examples of AEs are as follows:  
• Changes in the general condition of the patien t 
• Subjective symptoms offered by [CONTACT_544568] t 
• Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_62244]  
• All diseases that occur after the start of the study including a change in severity or frequency of preexisting disease .  NOTE:  the clinical outcome of the disease under study 
is collect ed as an efficacy endpoint and an outcome of non- response is not an AE . 
• All clinically relevant new abnormalities in laboratory values or clinically relevant physical findings that  occur during the study. NOTE: laboratory values that are abnormal 
but not  of clinical significance are not to be reported as AEs  
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE that fulfil ls one or more of the following:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life- threatening  (i.e. an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event th at may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
14.2. Timeframe for Collecting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected during the core study, from the time of consent through 
TOC.   After completion of the core study, all SAEs will be collected during the long -term 
follow -up through Day  180.  For patients who  are unable to return for the Day [ADDRESS_712012] for 
each AE (unrelated or related).  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical 
judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_544569] -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_712013].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE 
should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for 
suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relations hip between the investigational product and the 
occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “ related .” 
14.4. Study Endpoints  
Study endpoints of efficacy non -response  would not ordinarily be reported as AEs .  Serious AEs 
with an outcome of  death which are a component of a  study endpoint (e.g. , all-cause mortality)  
must be reported as SAEs.  
14.5. Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity (or intensity) of each AE will be assessed according to the following scale:  
Mild  Awareness of sign or symptom , but easily tolerated  
Moderate  Interferes  with normal activities  and may require minimal intervention  
Severe  Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal activities  and/or 
requires significant medical intervention  
Clarification of the difference in mean ing between “severe” and “serious”  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or 
functioning  (as defined in Section 14.1.2 above).  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
14.6. Events of Clinical Interest  
Any AE that results in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544514] 24  hours. 
14.7. Overdose  
An overdose occurs if a patient has taken, accidentally or intentionally, study drug in a dose exceeding that prescribed by [CONTACT_760].  An overdose (and any associated AE) must be 
reported within [ADDRESS_712014] be 
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.  If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor.  At the completion of the pregnancy, the investig ator will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 81  
    SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the invest igator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
14.9. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if the nature of the AE is not consistent with what is listed in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  Reports which add significant information on specificity or 
severity of a known, already documented serious adverse drug re action constitute unexpected 
events.   
EXAMPLES :  hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB 
referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and 
cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator’s brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
14.10.  Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
An AE associated with the use of the study drug which is serious, unexpected, and study  drug 
related.  
14.11.  SAE Reporting  
All SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the SAE.  SAEs are reported through the electronic data capture (EDC) system or backup paper SAE report form.  
The SAE report should provide as much of the  required information as is available at the time.   
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: patient identification, 
reporting source, causality, and an event outcome.  
Other procedural and contact [CONTACT_544570] .  Any event that is serious, study drug 
related, and unexpected as assessed by [CONTACT_544571].  The 
Investigator will be responsible for reporting all SAEs that require reporting to the local IRB/ IEC 
in accordance with its regulations and guidelines.  
Investigators will be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety 
Reports) that occur during the clinical trial.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC 
of these additional SAEs.  
14.12.  AE and SAE Follow -up 
All AEs and SAEs will be followed to resolution (the patient’s health has returned to his or her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal) or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of 
the event), or the event i s otherwise explained, regardless of whether the patient is still 
participating in the study.  All appropriate therapeutic measures should be undertaken and 
recorded.  Where appropriate, medical  tests and examinations will be performed to document 
resoluti on of the event(s).

    15. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock and 
unblinding of the Core Study, and analyses of data.  Descriptive statistics, including the numbers 
and percentages for categorical vari ables, and the numbers, means, standard deviations (SD), 
medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided  by [CONTACT_6490].  Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual patien t’s data will be 
produced.  
15.1. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are:  
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  includes all randomized patients  regardless of whether 
or not the patient received study drug (CF -301 or placebo). 
• The Safety Population  includes all patients who receive any amount of study drug (CF -301 or 
placebo) . 
• The M icrobiological In tent-to-Treat (mITT) P opulation includes all patients who : 
1. Had documented S. aureus  BSI and/or endocarditis based on a blood culture collected  
within 72 hours of randomization and  
2. Received any amount of study drug.  
The mITT population is the primary analysis population for the efficacy analyses.  
• The Clinically Evaluable (CE) Population includes all patients who:  
1. Have confirmed clinical diagnosis of S. aureus BSI and/or endocarditis  
2. Received adequate course of antibacterial therap y, as defined in SAP.  
3. Have sufficient information to determine clinical outcome at the visit  (i.e., not 
indeterminate) . 
4. Have no additional confounding factors, as described in the SAP.  
• The Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) P opulation includes all patients who  are in the mITT 
and CE  Population and:  
1. For Day 7 and Day 14 only : Had a culture performed at the visit . 
• The PK Population includes a ll randomized patients who provide PK sam ples. 
15.2. Patient Population and Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, and discontinuations from the study drug and the study will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Demographics, medical and surgical history, baseline 
assessment of signs and symptoms of S. aureus  BSI/endocardi tis, BSI risk factors, diagnosis, 
APACHE II score, microbiological assessment and study drug administration will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
15.3. Safety  Analysis  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_544532] (TEAEs), clinical laboratory evaluations (biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and temperature) and ECGs.  Abnormal physical 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_712015] dose of study drug through TOC.  Safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety 
Population and subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical D ictionary of Regulatory Activities.  The 
incidence of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT), by [CONTACT_2946], PT and relationship to study drug, and by [CONTACT_2946], PT and severity.  Serious AEs and TEAEs that lead to discontinuation o f the study drug will al so be presented by [CONTACT_3592].  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory, vital signs and ECG parameters, including change from baseline, will be presented by [CONTACT_544533] -
baseline value.  Incidences of potentially clinically significant (meeting predefined criteria 
specified in the SAP)  clinical laboratory results, vital signs and ECG parameters will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_544534] -baseline value.  
15.4. Efficacy Analysis  
For all efficacy analyses, patient data will be summarized in the group to wh ich the patient was 
randomized.  T he primary efficacy outcome is clinical improvement or response at Day 14 after 
CF-301/placebo administration  in th e mITT Population .  The number and percentage of patients 
with an improvement/response, no response, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_6490].  Exact 2- sided 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of the clinical 
improvement/response rates in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -
Pearson method.  The clinical improvement/response rate will be compared between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test.  Statistical significance will be based on a two -sided  
alpha level of 0.05. 
The number and percentage of patients with a clinical outcome of improvement/response, no response, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544535] 7 after 
CF-301/placebo administration, at EOT, and at TOC  in the mITT Popu lation .  Exact 2- sided 
95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of the clinical improvement/response rates in 
each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson method.  Statistical 
comparisons between the treatment groups will be co nducted using Fisher's exact test and 
p-values will be provided as explora tive statistics.  
The number and percentage of patients with a microbiological response of clearance of bacteremia, ongoing bacteremia, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544572] 7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration  in the mITT Population .  The number and 
percentage of patients with a microbiological outcome of eradication/presumptive eradication, 
persistence/presumptive persistence, and indeterminate will be determined by [CONTACT_544573] .  Exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals for the point 
estimates of the clearance of bacteremia or microbiological eradication/presumptive eradication rates in each treatment group will  be determined using the Clopper- Pearson method.  Statistical 
comparisons between the treatment groups will be conducted using Fisher's exact test and p-values will be provided as explora tive statistics.  
Additional exploratory efficacy analyses will be conducted to support the efficacy findings for 
the primary and secondary outcomes.  Kaplan- Meier methods will be utilized to determine the 
time to clearance of bacteremia and time to defervesence in the mITT Population.  Time to 
Protocol CF -301-102-4 
Protocol Amendment #4   June 22, 2018  
 84  
    clearance of bacteremia will be defined as the date/time from study drug administration  to the 
date/time of the first negative blood culture of the two negative blood cultures taken on 
2 consecutive days .  Time to defervesence will be determined only in those patients who had a 
fever at baseline and will be defined as the date/time from study drug administration to the 
date/time of the first oral temperature equivalent < 38.0°C (< 100.4°F) using the highest 
temperature value on a given  day.  For both time to clearance of bacteremia and time to 
defervesence, patients whose SOC for BSI was changed by [CONTACT_1583] a SOC antibacterial agent, 
switching to a different SOC antibacterial agent, or increasing the dose of SOC due to persistence, worsening , or recurrence of S. aureus  BSI, died prior to clearance of 
bacteremia/defervesence or withdrew from the study prior to clearance of 
bacteremia/defervesence will be censored at the date/time of the SOC change, death or study 
withdrawal, respectively.  
All-cause mortality through TOC in the ITT Population and microbiological relapse at EOT, 
TOC , and Day [ADDRESS_712016] 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates of all -cause mortality and 
microbiological relapse  in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson 
method.   
Clinical improvement (Day 7 and Day 14), clinical response (EOT and TOC), clearance of 
bacteremia (Day 7 and Day 14) and microbiological eradication/presumed eradication (EOT and 
TOC) will be summarized separately for patients with MSSA and MRSA in the mITT population. Exact 2- sided 95% confidence intervals for the point estimates will be determined 
using the Clopper- Pearson method. 
Additio nal exploratory analyses will be described in the SAP.  
15.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Data collected from Subset 1 will be used to determine the following PK parameters:  C max, Tmax, 
T1/2, CL, Vz, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞.  These values along with the listings for plasma 
concentrations from all 3 subsets (Subsets 1 to  3) will be reported in the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR). 
All PK data collected in this study (Subsets 1, 2, and 3) will be pooled with the PK data collected 
from the previous Phase  1 study (Protocol CF -301-101) to update the previously developed 
population PK model ; this will be reported in a separate report, which will include the target 
attainment analysis.  The population PK and target attainment analyses will be described in a separate analysis plan.  
15.6. Pharmacodynamics Analysis  
PK/PD analysis will be conducted to determine the AUC 0-24hr/MIC, C max/MIC, and %Time > 
MIC ratios.  PK/PD parameters of CF -[ADDRESS_712017] MICs 
available.  Exposure response will be evaluated for efficacy and safety endpoints and will be detailed in a separate analysis plan  (as described above in the Section 15.5).

    15.7. Handling of Missing Data  
For the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, patients with missing data are assigned a 
response of indeterminate.  In the mITT population, indeterminate outcomes are included in the 
denominator for the calc ulation of the outcome rate.  Thus, a response of indeterminate is 
analyzed the same as a response of non -response or failure for the clinical outcome or ongoing 
bacteremia or persistence/presumed persistence for microbiological outcome.  
Handling of other missing data will be described in the SAP.

• Verify the accuracy and completeness of CRFs  
• Assure that all protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled  
• Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  
The Investigator must allow the Study Monitors to periodically review, at mutually convenient  
times during the study and after the study has been completed, all CRFs and office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and laboratory records supporting the participation of each patient  in the study.  The CRFs and other 
documentation supporting the study must be kept up- to-date by [CONTACT_488309].   These study materials must be available for review by [CONTACT_153670], and/or other qualified representatives of ContraFect, at each monitoring visit. 
The Study Monitor will review th e various records of the study (e CRFs, patient  medical and 
laboratory records, and other pertinent data).  The Study Monitor will verify the e CRF data 
against original source documentation for accuracy and completeness.  The study monitor will 
identify dat a discrepancies and collaborate with the Investigator and research staff to resolve the 
discrepancies in a timely manner.  Protocol deviations will also be identified and recorded.  The 
Study Monitor will ensure that each issue identified during a monitori ng visit is appropriately 
documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the Monitoring Plan’s 
requirements.

    23. APPENDICES  
23.1. Appendix 1: Diagnosis Definitions  
The investigator will determine diagnosis at screening and on Day 7 to determine SOC treatment 
duration.  An independent blinded Adjudication Committee will adjudicate the Day 7 diagnosis, 
and this adjudicated diagnosis will be considered the final diagnos is to be used for the analysis.  
The diagnosis definitions that will be used by [CONTACT_544579].  
Diagnosis  Definition  
S. aureus  
endocarditis  Definite or possible endocarditis based on the Modified Duke Criteria  (Li, et al. 
2000), as defined below.  
 
1. Definite  diagnosis: presence of 2 major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor criteria, 
or 
2. Possible  diagnosis:1 major criterion and 1 minor criterion, or 3 minor cr iteria  
 
Major and minor criteria are as follows:  
 
A. Major clinical criteria:  
1. Blood cultures positive for endocarditis:  
a. S. aureus  (in the absence of a primary focus) identified from 2 separate 
blood cultures  
b. Microorganisms consistent with endocarditis identi fied from persistently 
positive blood cultures (at least 2 positive cultures of blood samples drawn > 12 hours apart, or positive results of all of 3 or a majority of 
4 or more separate blood cultures [with first and last samples drawn at 
least 1 hour apar t]) 
2. Evidence of endocardial involvement:  
a. Echocardiogram positive for infective endocarditis with pendulum -like 
intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, or in the path of 
regurgitant jets  
b. New valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting 
murmur not a sufficient criterion) when confirmed by [CONTACT_6751]  
 
B. Minor clinical criteria:  
1. Predisposition to endocarditis, such as predisposing heart condition, or 
intravenous drug use  
2. Fever, defined as oral temperature equivalent > 38.0°C (> 100.4°F)  
3. Vascular phenomena, such as conjunctival hemorrhage, and Janeway’s lesions  
4. Immunologic phenomena, such as glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, Roth’s 
spots, and rheumatoid factor  
5. Microbiologic evidence: positive blood cultures for S. aureus  but with no 
major clinical criterion met or serologic evidence of active infection  
 
Left-sided endocarditis : involvement of mitral  and/or aortic valve  
Right -sided endocarditis : involvement of pulmon ic and/or tricuspid value  
Left- and right -sided endocarditis : involvement of mitral and/or aortic valve AND 
pulmon ic and/or tricuspid value

    23.3. Appendix 3: Microbiological Sample Collection and Processing  
Patients who meet all screening criteria and have blood culture positive for S. aureus  determined 
by [CONTACT_544538] -positive cocci in 
clusters plus positive tube coagulase test from blood culture specimens collected within [ADDRESS_712027] one 
aerobic blood culture will be collected daily during the study until negative for 2  consecutive 
days and at Days  7 and 14 after CF -301/placebo administration.  Additional blood cultures will 
be performed as clinically indicated.  Cultures should be taken from a  peripheral venipuncture 
site when possible using proper skin decontamination.  
Blood samples must be transported to the local microbiology laboratory as soon as possible and incubated within less than 24 hours of collection.  Each set (taken from diffe rent peripheral 
venipunctures) should be processed separately.  
Organism Identification  
When growth is present in the blood culture bottle, a Gram stain must be performed.  
Gram -positive cocci in clusters are indicative of a presumptive staphylococcal infection.  For this 
study, rapid identification and differentiation of S. aureus from coagulase -negative staphylococci 
is critical to patient enrollment.  Local microbiology labs are encouraged to utilize the direct tube coagulase test when available.  Patient s may be enrolled if their Gram stain shows Gram -positive 
cocci in clusters and the direct tube coagulase test is positive after [ADDRESS_712028] Name

Blood must be directly inoculated on non- selective agar medium (e.g. tryptic soy agar + 5% 
sheep blood) to confirm organism identification and purity.  Organisms must b e isolated in pure 
culture and identified according to the local laboratory’s standard o perating procedures.  Only 
S. aureus  strains will be sent to the designated central microbiology laboratory for confirmation 
of identification and standardized susceptibility testing.  
Results of G ram stain, organism identification , and rapid diagnostic tes ting will be recorded on

    Susceptibility Testing  
Susceptibility testing of S. aureus  should be performed according to the local laboratory’s 
standard operating procedures and in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical and 
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and/or European Committee on Antimicrobial 
Susceptibility Testing  (EUCAST ).  At a minimum, the local laboratory should test 
susceptibilities to daptomycin, vancomycin, and oxacillin or cefoxi tin (CLSI  recommended 
surrogate for oxacillin to detect MRSA ). 
Results of susceptibility testing will  be recorded on the CRF.  
Archiving an d Shipment of Isolates 
All S. aureus  strains will be stored frozen at - 70°C in duplicate (in a non- automatic defrost 
freezer) at the site’s local microbiology laboratory as backup samples.  The  S. aureus  isolates 
will be shipped to the designated central m icrobiology laboratory as directed in a separate central 
microbiology laboratory manual .  Backup isolates will remain in storage at the site until 
notification from ContraFect.  The sites local microbiology laboratory must maintain a shipment 
tracking log for each subject.  This log should contain the subject number, specimen collection 
date/time, local lab accession number, genus /species and date of shipment.

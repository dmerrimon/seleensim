January 9, [ADDRESS_437971] become a significant public health problem 
throughout the [LOCATION_002].  These infections span a wide range in severity from superficial skin 
abscesses to invasive pyomyositis, severe necrotizing pneumonia and fatal septicemia [7-11].  Recurrent S. 
aureus  SSTI are problematic and recurrence rates have been reported in up to 50% of pediatric patients 
[12-16]. Recurrent S. aureus  infections requiring emergency center c are is common and accounts for 
significant utilization of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256944] [17].  The incidence of S. aureus  SSTI has risen dramatically over 
the past decade [18], such that cellulitis and soft tissue abscesses are the most frequent primary  diagnoses 
associated with S. aureus.  In 2005, there were 14.2 million outpatient clinic visits for SSTI (48.1 visits/1000 
in the US) compared with just 8.6 million visits (32.1 visits/1000) in 1997 [18].  Due to this substantial 
burden, MRSA is a top priority for the Institute of Medicine’s Comparative Effectiveness R esearch Program 
[19].  The annual economic burden of MRSA infection in the [LOCATION_002] is approximately $14 billion [20].  
At SJH and MMC in Springfield, Illinois, we have seen a significant increase in the number of pediatric ED 
and EC visits. In the last five years there has been an average of [ADDRESS_437972] frequently in the anterior nares, but it can also 
colonize  the axilla, inguinal fold, rectum, and throat  [5, 21].  S. aureus  nasal colonization is a risk factor for 
SSTI development [22-25].  Multiple sites of S. aureus  colonization have been found to be related to higher 
recurrence rates [26].  Increased rates of SSTI have been described among U.S. military personnel 
colonized with CA -MRSA ;  soldiers with CA -MRSA nasal colonization had a 10 -fold greater risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_352121] S. aureus  (MSSA ) [23].  Endogenous 
colonization is important in the transmission and pathogenesis of CA -MRSA infection but behavioral and 
environmental factors may be equally important [27].   
 
Management of CA -S. aureus  abscesses  
 It is controversial w hether abscesses requiring incision and drainage also require antibiotics  [28].  
The frequency of antibiotic prescription in S. aureus  SSTI is still common as described in the literature [29]. 
Creech et al surveyed over 100 Pediatric Infectious Diseases Consultants and found that all of them 
(N=197) prescribed antibiotics; no provider reported using incision and  drainage alone without antibiotic 
therapy [30]. Mc Neil et al reported an almost 95% rate of antibiotic prescription among children with S. 
aureus  SSTI at [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [31].  
In a study done by [CONTACT_352129], patients with SSTIs caused by [CONTACT_352130].  Patients with CA -MRSA SSTI who received antibiotics in addition to incision and drainage ha d a 
greater treatment success rate (infection cure) than those managed with incision and drainage alone (95% 
versus 87%, P =.001) [32].  In a randomized trial by [CONTACT_352131], treatment failure rates for CA -MRSA skin 
abscesses were similar after incision and drainage between patients who received antibiotics and those 
given a placebo.  However, at 10 -day follow -up, new lesions formed in 2 6.4% of cases in the placebo group 
and only 12.9% of cases in the antibiotic group [12].  Schmitz et al s howed a similar incidence of treatment 
failure in adult patients with uncomplicated abscesses receiving trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole versus 
placebo (17% vs 26%, P=.12); but at 30 -day follow -up the incidence of new lesions was lower in the 
antibiotic group  compared to the placebo group (9% vs 28%, P=.02) [33].  
 
Significance for our community  
 Recurrent S. aureus  SSTI have become a major source of morbidity in our pediatric population.  Like 
other areas of the [LOCATION_002], our community has seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of skin and 
soft tissue infections among previously healthy children.  At SJH the  number of pediatric ED visits related to 
SSTI increased more than fifty percent in the last [ADDRESS_437973] of managing S. aureus  abscess without antibiotics on ongoing S. aureus  colonization and recurrent 
infection requires fur ther study .  This study seeks to examine whether the management of initial S. aur eus 
abscesses with incision and drainage in addition to antibiotic therapy is an effective means of preventing 
recurrent infection.  The prolonged longitudinal follow -up of th is study is a unique characteristic that will 
enable us to capture data about recurrences of infections.  
 
APPROACH/ PRELIMINARY DATA  
 
Risk factors for S. aureus  SSTI  
  
MRSA colonization confers risk for SSTI : A prevalence study of S. aureus  nasal colonization in the 
St. Louis pediatric population was performed by [CONTACT_212857]. ; 1300 children ages birth to 18 years  were 
enrolled .  The rates of MRSA and MSSA nasal colonization were 2.5% and 25.5%, respectively [10].  To 
investigate  the relationship between S. aureus  nasal colonization and subsequent SSTI , the 1300 children 
enrolled in the above prevalence study were followed for one year,  during which the  overall  incidence of 
SSTI was 13%.  Baseline MRSA colonization conferred risk for subsequent SSTI  (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.8, 
11.9) [10].  Another study performed by [CONTACT_352132] S. aureus  colonization sites were 
related with higher recurrence rates [26]. 
  
Household member  with SSTI : S. aureus  SSTI 
cluster in households.  In a study performed by [CONTACT_352133], SSTI in a household contact [CONTACT_352134] 
(Figure 1 ) [22].   
 
Colonization pressure  is a Risk Factor for 
subsequent SSTI : Colonization pressure (CP) is a 
measure used in healthcare settings to determine the 
magnitude of the microorganism reservoir.  MRSA CP 
has been shown to predict infections in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] [34].  
During my fellowship at Washington University under 
the mentorship of Stephanie Fritz, MD, MSCI, I participated in a study aimed to app ly the concept of CP to 
the community setting by [CONTACT_352135].  We demons trated that high MRSA CP in households was associated with persistent MRSA 
colonization in pediatric patients.  We found a relationship between S. aureus  household CP and a history 
of SSTI in household contacts in the year prior [35].  Figure 1

repeated 2 -8 weeks later (for 194 patients).  Of the 147 patients with MRSA colonization at screening who 
provid ed a follow -up culture, those pre scribed an antibiotic for  MRSA were less likely to be MRSA 
colonized at follow -up than those who were not prescribed an antibiotic (39% v s 100%, p=0.01).  The 
likelihood of MRSA colonization also varied depending on  which antibiotic was prescribed.  Patients 
prescribed clindamycin were less likely to be MRSA colonized than those prescribed TMP -SMX (30% v s 
54%, p=0.01).   Patients prescribed an antibiotic active against MRSA were less likely to have a recurrent 
SSTI over the subsequent  year than patient s who were not prescribed an antibiotic (aOR=0.32, 95% CI 
0.12, 0.90) [36]. 
 
Experimental Design and Methods  
  
Patient recruitment :  This is a prospe ctive case -control study that will be performed by [CONTACT_352136], MMC ED, SIU General Pediatrics 
Clinics and the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of M edicine.  
Children who present to SJH or MMC through the ED or SIU Pediatrics clinics with a skin abscess (first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_352122]) will be assessed for study  eligibility .  Cases are defined as patients with a S. aureus  
skin abscess who had incision and drainage AND had appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy.  Controls are 
defined as patients with S. aureus  skin abscesses who had incision and drainage and did NOT have 
systemic antibiotic therapy.  This is a non -interven tional study and treatment of skin abscesses will be at 
discretion of the treating physician.  We expect to complete patient enrollment in six months with a six 
month follow -up period (see timeline, Figure 2 ).  Members of the study team (Principal Investig ator (PI), 
and Research Coordinator) will  obtain access to  SJH and MMC  ED computerized patient tracking  boards to 
monitor for potential candidates/participants .  In addition w e also plan to approach the SIU ED resident s and 
attending physicians  at MMC ED a nd the SIU Pediatrics Residents and Faculty from General Pediatrics 
Clinics to request notification when a potentially eligible patient is treated.  We will also  get access to the 
SIU Pediatrics clinic schedules to look for potential candidates.  A copy of  the approved protocol will be 
given to the attending physicians  and residents so  that they are aware of the study requirements .  A 
member of the study team (PI [INVESTIGATOR_352123]) will then approach the patient and his or her parent 
or legal guardian  to discuss his or her  participation in this study.

Inclusion criteria :  (1) Children 6 month s to 18 years presenting with a skin abscess .  (2) Positive 
MRSA or MSSA culture from previous or current abscess  
 
Exclusion criteria :  (1) Immunodeficiency;  (2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171440] 14 days ; (3) Use of  
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] , clorhexidine  or bleach water baths  in the last month; (4) Systemic antibacterial therapy with anti -
staphylococcal activity within the prior 14 days.  
 
Assent will be obtai ned from children greater than 7 years of age.   Informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient’s parent or legal guardian.  The study protocol was approved by [CONTACT_352137] (SIU) Institutional Review Board (IRB).   Risks for participa ting in the study are minimal; the only 
intervention that will be done is collection of body surfaces swabs.  
  
Data Collection :  At study enrollment, a detailed questionnaire will be administered to identify risk 
factors for S. aureus  colonization, infection, and transmission.  Clinical data will be collected as well to track 
clinical signs at the time of presentation (vital signs, body site of infection, size of abscess, presence of 
systemic symptoms, type of incision and drainage, an tibiotic use, type of packing applied).  In addition, 
colonization swabs from the nose, axilla, inguinal folds and wound isolate will be collected and transported 
to [CONTACT_352140]’s laboratory at Washington University.  Longitudinal study visits will  be conducted  at 
the SIU Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic  one month following enrollment for research purposes only by [CONTACT_976] 
[INVESTIGATOR_352124].  At this visit, a follow -up questionnaire will be administered inquiring about 
new, recurrent, or r elapsed infection .  Colonization swabs will be obtained and transported to [CONTACT_259408]’s 
laboratory.  Also history of any household members with any recent SSTI will be asked.  Follow -up phone 
calls will be administered at 3, [ADDRESS_437975] data regarding whether the individual sought medical care (and if 
so, the location where medical care was sought), the date of infection, the body site of infection, t he bacteria 
causing infection, if known, whether the individual required a drainage procedure, surgery, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and whether the participant received antibiotics, oral or intravenous.  If the patient sought 
medical care, records from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l and/or provider’s office will be obtained for verification.  Again, 
question about any household member having an SSTI will be made.  Throughout the longitudinal study, we 
will ask participants to contact [CONTACT_352138] a SSTI.   The participant will be directed to seek medical 
treatment from their primary healthcare provider.   
 
Microbiology :  Colonization swabs will be obtained at enrollment and at the 1 month follow -up visit 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_352125], axilla and inguinal fo lds.  Four swabs will be used for 
each participant (1 each for both nostrils , both axillae , and both sides of the groin  and the  abscess site).  
Specimens will be collected with Copan E -swab TM Collection and Transport System to evaluate S. aureus  
colonizat ion.  This is a liquid -based multipurpose collection and transport system that maintains viability of 
aerobic, anaerobic and fastidious bacteria for [ADDRESS_437976]. Stephanie Fritz for microbiologic studies.  If wound isolates from initial infection and 
a recurrence are available, they will be requested at the microbiology laboratory at SJH or MMC.  After 
arrival, specimens will be incubated overnight in tryptic soy broth with 6.5% NaCl at 35°C.  A sample of the 
broth will be plated to mannitol salt agar and incubated for 24 -48 hours.  Following confirmatory testing for 
S. aureus  [37], susceptibility testing for cefoxitin  (a surrogate for methicillin resistance) and 9 other 
antibiotics will be determined by [CONTACT_222302] -Bauer disk diffusion, in accordance with published guidelines [37].  
Inducible clindamycin resistance will be tested [38].  All isolates will be stored in glycero l at -20ºC.  
 
Sample size :  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_352126], 
having them return for 1 follow -up visit, and collaborating with Washington University for future 
Figure 3:  Monthly Study Accrual Rates  investigations. Our goal is to get preliminary data.  According to available billing records (ICD -9 codes), 
since 2010, there ha s been in average 130  pediatric visits per month at SJH, MMC ED and Express Cares 
secondary to SSTI.  Our goal is to recruit 50 patients in 12 months, which means that we will need about a 
30% success rate for recruitment  (Figure 3 ).  A sample size estimate was performed to evaluate the power 
in the study.  Considering an incidence of recurrent SSTI of 50% in patients who did not receive antibiot ic 
therapy, a 60 -75% percent reduction of recurrent SSTI (12 -20% incidence) can be shown with 50 -80% 
power.  
 
Data Analysis Plan  
 Data on S. aureus  identification will be 
collected from Washington University School of 
Medicine and recorded, along with questionnaire 
and clinical variables, on a data collection form by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_352127].  Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20, will be used 
for data analysis.  
Descriptive Statistics will be computed for all 
study variables.  Continuous variables will be 
described with measures o f central tendency 
(mean, median ) and dispersion (range, standard 
deviation).  Categorical variables will be 
summarized as frequencies and percentages.  
We will calculate the frequencies/  
percentages for patient demographics, clinical 
characteristics, basel ine questionnaire, follow -up 
questionnaires, and S. aureus  colonization (nose, 
axilla, and inguinal folds) for each group: 1) 
Systemic antibiotic therapy 2) No systemic antibiotic 
therapy.  Characteristics will be compared using 
independent t -tests for con tinuous variables and 
Chi-squared tests of independence for categorical 
variables. Significance will be assumed when p < 
0.05 or the 95% confidence interval.  
 
 
Specific Aim 1:  
Primary outcome:  
To determine overall  colonization status in children presenti ng with S. aureus  abscesses who do and do not 
receive systemic antibiotic therapy at two time points (baseline and 1 month); a hierarchical logistic 
regression model will be used with colonization status as the outcome.  Follow -up tests will be utilized wh en 
necessary.  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
1. To determine colonization status at each body site  (nose, axilla and inguinal folds) independently in 
children presenting with S. aureus abscesses who do and do not receive systemic antibiotic therapy 
at two time points (baseline and 1 month) ; a hierarchical logistic regression model will be used with 
colonization status as the outcome at each body site.  
2. A chi -squared test of independence will be used to determine if there is an association between 
colonization (determine d at baseline) and presence of abscess at 1 month.   7-8 patients will enroll in the study 
per month  12 patients eligible for study 
enrollment  100 patients per month present 
to SJH-MMC ED or  PCP clinics  
with SSTI  
Enrollment acceptance: 65%  SSTI culture positive for S. aureus : 70%  Screening acceptance: 
80% Capture rate for 
screening: 30%  
21 patients will be approached 
for study screening  
17 patients will be screened  70 patients undergo drainage 
procedure  
 
 
Specific Aim 2:  
Primary outcome:  
To measure incidence of SA recurrent skin and soft tissue infections at 3 months in patients who did or did 
not receive systemic antibiotic therapy. A binary logistic regression will be performed to see if antibiotic 
therapy is associated with SSTI at 3 months after adjusting for covariates.  
 
Secondary outcomes:   
1. To measure incidence of SA recurrent skin and soft tissue infections at 1, 6 and 12 months 
independently in  patients who did and did not receive systemic antibiotic therapy.   Separate logistic 
regressions will be performed (at each time point) to see if antibiotic therapy is associated with SSTI 
after adjusting for covariates.  
2. In order to assess the trend of SSTI’s over [ADDRESS_437977] 
for trend to determine if there are more SSTI’s in the following year for patients colonized 
(determined at baseline).  
 
Specific Aim 3:  
Primary outcome:  
To measure S. aureus antibiotic resistance in patients who did and did not receive systemic antibiotics, we 
will use a chi -squared test of independence to compare antibiotic resistance between patients who did and 
did not receive antibiotic therapy.  
 
Potential limitations :  
 Recruitment success rate is estimated to be around 30% in order to collect  the desired patient 
sample (50 patients) in a 1 year period ; this is based on a  prior study in which the same population was 
targeted [39]. We recognize the complexity of having patients come to clinic for research purposes only in 
follow up.  SIU School of Medicine’s D epartment of Pediatrics is providing funds to complete the study 
beyond the 12 month period.  Patient reimbu rsement of a $20 check will be given at the follow -up visit for 
study purposes, without any charges to medical insurance.  In previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_2296], we 
had had a high longitudinal retention rate when the same incentive was given [39, 40].  Specimens will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_352139] .  The surface area swabbed and the pressure 
used will be standardized for all participants.  We have validated the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_352128].  We would like to evaluate whether shipment of the 
swabs can be done in a timely manner and whether the length of time required for shipment impacts the 
ability to successfully recover microorganisms.  Reaching participant for follow -up phone calls ma y be a 
challenge, especially at 6 and 12 months after study enrollment; thus , we will obtain multiple methods of 
contact [CONTACT_182437].  A source of bias that we will have is the variability in the treating physician’s 
decision to administer antibio tics or not.  Adjusting for possible confounding factors and covariates will be 
made but these factors will not play a role in the primary outcome which is S. aureus  colonization.  
 
Conclusion : The Research Seed Grant , RSG , is an important step in achieving  my career goal of 
becoming an independent investigator at SIU and will offer me a tremendous opportunit y to help our patient 
population .  The goal of this project is to obtain preliminary data  which will allow me to apply for future 
external funding to be  able to recruit more patients and to show a statistical significan ce.  Recurrent S. 
aureus  SSTI have become a major source of morbidity in our pediatric population.  Decreasing the number 
of recurrent SSTI will decrease ED and PCP clinic visits  and will  benefit our public health.

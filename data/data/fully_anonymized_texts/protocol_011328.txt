[ADDRESS_616760] Summary/Abstract Tissue ischemia (lack of blood flow) is one of the main causes of pressure injury. It is inevitable during bed-ridden condition or prolonged surgery procedure in the operating room. Previous studies demonstrated that the protective mechanisms of alternating pressure (AP) on pressure injury include redistribution of surface pressure, and allowing more blood supplies while lying on the support surface. The Dabir AP overlay is low profile yet possesses similar characteristics as other AP mattresses on the market. The objective of this study is to evaluate the protective mechanisms of Dabir AP overlay on weight bearing tissue of people with chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). Our central hypothesis is that the Dabir AP overlay will cause lower amount of interface pressure and allow more skin blood flow during weight bearing as compared to regular operation room (OR) overlay. In addition, people with SCI will have better tolerance to prolonged weight bearing after preconditioned with the Dabir AP overlay. This study will be repeated measures design, with subjects acting as their own control. Fifteen adults with chronic SCI will be recruited from the Greater Chicago area. Each subject will undergo two study protocols: lying on AP overlay followed by [CONTACT_480045] (40 minutes each), and lying on OR overlay for [ADDRESS_616761] of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 5 of 30 April 4, 2017 2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  Tissue ischemia is one of the main etiologies of pressure injury.[ADDRESS_616762] injury (SCI), or prolonged surgery procedure in the operating room. Active alternating pressure (AP) mattresses are covered by [CONTACT_480046]/large stage 2/ stage 3 pressure injuries to relief interface pressure and prevent recurrence of pressure injuries.2 Previous studies demonstrated that the protective mechanisms of AP on pressure injury include redistribution of surface pressure, and allowing more blood supplies while lying on the support surface.3–5 The Dabir AP overlay (DabirAIRTM, Dabir Surfaces Inc., Hardwood Heights, IL) is low profile yet possesses similar characteristics as other AP mattresses on the market; it is intended for clinical use, such as operation room (OR) where AP mattresses may not be an option. We expect Dabir AP overlay will be beneficial to people at risk of pressure injury by [CONTACT_480047].   In addition to pressure redistribution and increasing blood supplies, we also postulate that the if an AP overlay will be beneficial to the weight-bearing skin by [CONTACT_480048]-term ischemia, i.e. when air cells inflate. Ischemic preconditioning is a method used to prevent tissue damage caused by [CONTACT_480049], such as stroke and myocardial infarction,[ADDRESS_616763] of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 6 of 30 April 4, 2017 Heat hyperemia is an objective and non-invasive method to quantify the degree of impaired thermoregulation. It is characterized by a biphasic pattern with an initial peak (initiated by [CONTACT_480050]), followed by a brief nadir and a plateau phase (mediated by [CONTACT_480051]).[ADDRESS_616764] OR overlay, we might be able to fill the gap of current research by [CONTACT_480052]. 3.0 Objectives/Aims The objective of this study is to evaluate the protective mechanisms of Dabir AP overlay on weight bearing tissue of people with chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). Our central hypothesis is that the Dabir AP overlay will cause lower amount of interface pressure and allow more skin blood flow during weight bearing as compared to regular OR overlay. In addition, people with SCI will have better tolerance to prolonged weight bearing after preconditioned with the Dabir AP overlay.   There are three aims (with related hypotheses) for this study: Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of pressure redistribution with Dabir AP overlay.  Hypothesis 1. Our participants will demonstrate lower interface pressure at sacrum and heel when lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 40 minutes on Dabir AP overlay as compared to that on regular OR overlay (AliMed®).  Aim 2: To examine the severity of tissue ischemia with the use of Dabir AP overlay. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 7 of 30 April 4, 2017 Hypothesis 2a. Our participants will demonstrate greater skin blood flow at sacrum and heel when lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 40 minutes on Dabir AP overlay as compared to that on regular OR overlay. Hypothesis 1b. Our participants will demonstrate smaller reactive hyperemic response at sacrum and heel after being relieved from 40 minutes of lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_480019].  Aim 3: To assess the feasibility of utilizing Dabir AP overlay for ischemic preconditioning for prolonged weight bearing condition. Hypothesis 3. With 40 minutes of preconditioning using the Dabir AP overlay, our participants will demonstrate smaller reactive hyperemic response at sacrum and heel after being relieved from the regular OR overlay as compared to that without preconditioning. 4.0 Eligibility Twenty people with chronic SCI will be recruited from the Greater Chicago area. The eligibility of the subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_480053].  4.1 Inclusion Criteria • Males and females 18-64 years old • have had spi[INVESTIGATOR_480020] • have injury level at T10 or above • not ambulatory and use a wheelchair for mobility • non smokers or able to refrain from smoking four hours prior to and during the study  4.2 Exclusion Criteria • current pressure ulcer • history of diabetes mellitus • history of cardiovascular diseases • history of hypertension • history of pulmonary diseases • pregnant women (based on screening and pregnancy testing) • non-English speakers  4.[ADDRESS_616765] Enrollment Subjects will be eligible to participate in this study if they meet the study criteria as determined by [CONTACT_480054]-to-face screening procedures.   Telephone Screening Procedure (approximately 15 minutes) Subjects will be recruited from the Greater Chicago area through study flyers. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_480021]. Questions regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to determine the eligibility based on the telephone screening script. Results of the telephone screening will be documented in Forms A, B, C1, C2, and D. If the potential subject is not eligible, results and confidential information will be destroyed immediately. All potential subjects will be scheduled to a study visit at the UIC Applied Health Sciences Building room [ADDRESS_616766] and refrain from smoking four hours prior to and during the study, and refrain from consuming any caffeinated foods/drinks for 12 hours prior to the study.   Face-to-face Screening Procedure (approximately 30 minutes) Upon arrival for the study visit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480022]. A consent form with details of all procedures, risks and benefits will be provided to the potential subject. Once the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480023], the subject will proceed to face-to-face screening. During the face-to-face screening procedure, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480024] E1. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_480025], sensation and autonomic function after spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. The remaining sensation, motor, and autonomic function are standard physical examination for people with SCI in the clinic. The remaining sensation will be tested with the key personnel performing light touch of the skin below the level of injury (as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480026] E2), and the motor function will be tested with the key personnel instructing subject to perform joint movement below the level of injury. Results of the remaining sensation and motor function will be documented in form E2. The autonomic function will be tested by [CONTACT_480055], ability to sense the changes in temperature, bladder function, bowel movement and sexual function, and results will be documented in form E3. If the subject demonstrates normal heart rate and blood pressure, the subject will proceed with the study procedures. Women of childbearing age will also be screened for pregnancy using a urine pregnancy test strip.  Women who are pregnant will not be eligible to participate. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version [ADDRESS_616767] as his/her own control. Each subject will undergo the two protocols in the experimental procedures: AP protocol and Control protocol. To ensure the order of the two protocols are randomized, the order of AP and Control protocols will be determined by [CONTACT_480056]. We will start with a pool of total 20 envelopes ([ADDRESS_616768]). Once the envelope is drawn from the pool, it will not return to the pool.  Study Procedures (Research purpose). After enrollment, subjects will proceed to the following procedures: 1) experimental procedures, 2) vascular control measures, 3) pressure mappi[INVESTIGATOR_480027] 4) blood withdraw. 1) Experimental procedure (approximately 4.5 hours) Each subject will undergo two study protocols: AP and control (figure 1), and the order of the protocols will be randomized as described previously. A 30-minute washout period will be provided in between the two protocols. Two Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) flat probes (moor instrument, Wilmington, DE) will be taped to the sacrum and one heel to collect the skin blood flow response throughout both AP and control protocols. A whole body pressure mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816] (Xsensor, Xsensor Technology Corp., Alberta, Canada)  will be used between the subject and the overlay to collect the inter pressure data. For the AP cycle, we will use four 10-minute cycles (5 minutes of high pressure and 5 minutes of low pressure). AP protocol: The subject will first lie on his/her side quietly for [ADDRESS_616769] will then lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_480028] 40 minutes followed by [CONTACT_480057] 30 minutes for the second reactive hyperemic response.  Control protocol: The subject will first lie on his/her side quietly for [ADDRESS_616770] the baseline skin blood flow, followed by [CONTACT_480058][INVESTIGATOR_480029] (AliMed®) for [ADDRESS_616771] of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 10 of 30 April 4, 2017  2) Vascular control measures (approximately 30 minutes) The PI, or key personnel will then collect the vascular control measures, including the heat hyperemic (HH) blood flow response, and the skin vasomotor response. A non-invasive combined laser Doppler and white light reflectance spectroscopy (LDF-WLRS) probe (CP2T-1000, Moor Instrument, Wilmington, DE) will be used for both measures.  HH blood flow response will be measured at the sacrum and one heel while the subject is in side-lying position. Figure 2 demonstrates the HH measurement setting. HH will be induced with the heater at the tip of the probe head (41°C for 5 minutes). This HH measure will take approximately 7 minutes (2 min-baseline, 5 min-heating) per location. In total, the HH measures will take up to 15 minutes to complete. The skin vasomotor response will be induced using cutaneous electrical stimulation (3-10 mA, 0.2-1.0 ms pulses at 20 Hz, 1 s trains) delivered via 1 cm Ag-AgCl surface electrodes applied bilaterally (4 cm apart) to the forehead (above lesion) and the abdominal wall (below lesion) while the subject is in a semi-reclined position.[ADDRESS_616772] will be in a semi-reclined position (about 30° from horizontal plane) during this protocol, and it will take up to 15 minutes to complete this protocol.

The pressure mappi[INVESTIGATOR_480032]. 4) Blood withdraw (approximately 15 minutes) The key personnel will draw venous blood samples (total 20 mL) via venipuncture for standard blood tests, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), plasma glucose, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations (i.e. total-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein). The rationale for making these measurements is to collect potential covariates that might affect skin blood flow responses. Blood samples not used to probe for blood sugar and lipid profile tests will be stored up to five years (or until exhausted) for further analyses, since latest trend in literatures demonstrated metabolic syndrome after spi[INVESTIGATOR_480033].13 7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits Expected Risks Overall, potential risks associated with participation in the study are unlikely and of low risk. Subjects will be advised to speak with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480034]. Potential risks associated with the non-invasive protocols of our study are as followed: 1) Emotional stress: The risk of having emotional stress with our telephone screening procedure and examination of remaining sensation, motor and autonomic function is no more than minimal. Participants may feel uncomfortable answering personal health related questions. The examinations of remaining sensation, motor and autonomic function are regularly performed at the physician’s office. Participants may feel uncomfortable that he or she could not feel or move the body below the level of injury. In addition, female subjects may feel added emotional stress if their screening pregnancy test results are positive and they were unaware that they were pregnant.   2) Discomfort: The risk of having discomfort with our heart rate, blood pressure, exams is no more than minimal. These examinations are regularly performed at the physician’s office. Participants may feel discomfort caused by [CONTACT_480059]. 3) Localized Ischemia. The risk of tissue ischemia associated with reactive hyperemia (caused by [CONTACT_480060]) is low. Reactive 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 12 of 30 April 4, 2017 hyperemia is a normal physiological response induced by [CONTACT_69506]-term non-damaging ischemia of the loaded area. The amount of pressure expected on sacrum and heels is very low (~60mmHg) and for a short period of time (40 minutes), which simulates the amount of pressure lying or sitting on a mattress or seat cushion. The amount, duration and area of localized pressure on the skin is within the current clinical practice guideline of pressure ulcer prevention, which is making turning the patient in bed every two hours. The skin breakdown risk associated with lying on OR or AP overlay is considered as rare (less than 1 out of 100 people). 4) Localized Heating. The risk of burn associated with heat hyperemia is low. Heat hyperemia will be induced by [CONTACT_69506]-term heating of the skin. The temperature of heating is very low (41°C or 106°F) and for a short period of time (5 minutes). This temperature and duration is far lower and shorter than the therapeutic hot packs used regularly in clinic (45-54°C) for more than 10 minutes covering the whole joint or lower back. Previous published literatures that investigated microcirculatory response in people with SCI induced heat hyperemia with 20-30 minutes heating at 41°C. No tissue burn or damage to the skin was noted in these published studies. The amount and duration of localized heating of the skin is far shorter than that causing burn of the skin. The skin breakdown risk associated with the heating protocol is considered as rare (less than 1 out of 100 people). 5) Electrical Stimulation. The risk of skin or muscle damage associated with electrical stimulation is low. The skin vasomotor response will be induced using cutaneous electrical stimulation (3-10 mA, 0.2-1.0 ms pulses at 20 Hz, 1 s trains) delivered via 1 cm Ag-AgCl surface electrodes applied bilaterally (4 cm apart) to the forehead (above lesion) and the abdominal wall (below lesion). This is a standard protocol used to measure the sympathetic outflow of the microcirculatory response. The same protocol was used in previous studies on chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_387800], and no damage to the skin or underlying muscle was noted. Electrical stimulation at a higher intensity and duration (10-50mA for 10 minutes) is one of the standard clinical practice protocol in nerve stimulation and pain reduction for patients with SCI. Therefore the skin or muscle damage associated with electrical stimulation is considered as rare (less than 1 out of 100 people). 6) Skin Blood Flow (SBF) and Tissue Oxygenation Testing will be performed using an FDA cleared non-invasive device.  The amount of energy used with the laser light during the measurement is similar to that of a bar code scanner, and the white light is similar to that of ordinary daylight. 7) Bruising and swelling with venipuncture The risks of drawing blood from a vein includes discomfort at the site of the needle stick, possible bruising and swelling around the site of the needle stick is minimal. The risks of infection is very rare, and feeling faint from this procedure is uncommon. 8) Bare skin measurements. Bare skin measurements will be collected during this study. Some of the locations for the measurements, such as the sacrum 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 13 of 30 April 4, 2017 (low back) is very private, so the subject may feel embarrassed.  A bed sheet will be provided to cover the subjects upon request. 9) Breach of confidentiality. The risk of breach of confidentiality is minimal since the only key to link subject ID and confidential information is locked in the file cabinet of the PI’s locked office. The key will only be accessible to the PI’s team. All other data is only coded with a subject ID in hard copy and electronic files. All hard copy files with subject ID only will be stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s locked laboratory, which is three floors away from the PI’s office. All electronic data do not contain any confidential information, and they will be stored on the laptop used to collect data, and the hard drive located in the PI’s Laboratory. Both computers are password protected, and the data are only accessible to the PI’s team. All study personnel are trained in the maintenance of security and confidentiality of research data. Benefits.  There is no direct benefit for the participants in this study, however findings from these participants will help us understand the potential benefit of the Dabir AP overlay as compared to the regular OR overlay, and the potential use of Dabir AP overlay on ischemia-preconditioning. 8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures Three sets of data (and one biological sample) will be collected from the subjects. The following listed the details of data procurement, storage, and encryption: All data will be stored at UIC, and data will not be shared or stored at Schwab. 1) Confidential information (hard copy only): Confidential information that includes direct identifiers such as name, date of birth and phone number will be recorded on Form A. A subject ID (code) will be assigned to the subject by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_480035]. Form A will serve as the key to the code. Form G is the compensation form.  Participants will be asked to sign the form once the payment is received. Form A and G will be stored in a locked file cabinet in PI’s locked office (UIC Applied Health Science Building, Rm 506H).  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480036]. A portable lock cash box will be used to transport Form A and G between the DHSP building and Department of Physical Therapy. Form A and G will be stored up to five years and destroyed afterwards so that all data will be de-identified for future analyses only.  2) Paper-based data (hard copy and excel spread sheet) will be coded using the subject ID on forms: B, C, D, E and F. These forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet in PI’s locked laboratory (UIC Applied Health Science Building, Rm 272; different from the room that stores Forms A and G). The PI’s team will be responsible for incorporating data on these forms to an excel 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 14 of 30 April 4, 2017 spreadsheet for further statistical analyses. Two layers of encryption will be used to ensure the security of excel file. These coded data will be stored up to seven years after completion of this study.  3) Skin blood flow data (electronic text file generated automatically with data acquisition system): Skin blood flow data will be collected directly via the LDF. These analog signals are automatically stored on the UIC laptop used for data collection. Only [CONTACT_480066]’s team can log on to the password protection laptop to collect and access the blood flow and tissue oxygenation data. The assigned subject ID will be the only identifier of the data set collected from each subject. These coded data will be stored up to seven years after completion of this study.  4) Blood sample: The blood samples not used to probe for blood glucose and lipid profile will be stored coded at co-investigator [CONTACT_17912]’ lab (UIC Applied Health Science Building, Rm 106). [CONTACT_17912] will not have access to the key of the code.    5) Urine sample:  Urine will be collected from women of childbearing age for pregnancy testing during visit one for eligibility screening.  Any urine remaining after the testing will be disposed of.  9.0 Data Analysis The MatLab program (The MathWorks Natick, MA) will be used to process the skin blood flow signal. The signals will be analyzed with two signal processing methods to characterize the responses in both time and frequency domains. Details of both methods were published previously by [CONTACT_978].14  1) Exponential curve-fitting technique:  To select the time-domain parameters of the reactive hyperemia and heat hyperemia objectively. A tenth ordered Cheby[CONTACT_480061] I low pass filter (with cut off frequency at 0.15 Hz) will be applied to remove the noise caused by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_480037].[ADDRESS_616773] squares model to fit the filtered reactive and heat hyperemic curves, and all parameters (including peak, time to peak, area under curve of reactive hyperemia; and first peak, second peak and time to first and second peaks, area under curve of heat hyperemia) will be derived from the fit curves. 2) Time-frequency analysis: To further examine the different control mechanisms of SBF by [CONTACT_480062]. Short-time Fourier transform will be used to decompose the signal by [CONTACT_480063]-time segments (windows), then computed Fourier analysis within each segment to calculate 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 15 of 30 April 4, 2017 spectral densities. A 256-sample Hanning window (512 seconds) will be used to compute the spectrogram. Please see section 12.[ADDRESS_616774]. Tzen will check all the data within two days of collection (paper and electronic formats). If the study team encounter any issues related to data collection, [CONTACT_480066] is available through phone calls to address the concerns. [CONTACT_480066] will meet with her team every two weeks to check the laboratory notes and monitor the study regularly.   11.0 Data and Safety Monitoring The PI [INVESTIGATOR_37105] (Tzen) will be responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this study. [CONTACT_480066] will meet with the research team every two weeks to monitor the overall conduct of the study (including issues with safety, ethics, recruitment, retention, adequacy of study design to achieve the specific aims) and provide feedback to the study team for the possible protocol amendments, and input from this study on future studies. Serious adverse events are not expected, but all such events will be reported according to the UIC IRB, and will be handled with the standard of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines including informing the PI, and IRB within [ADDRESS_616775] copy of Form A, which is locked in the file cabinet of the PI’s locked office. All other data is only coded with a subject ID in hard copy and electronic file. All hard copy files with subject ID only will be stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s locked laboratory, which is three floors away from the PI’s office. All electronic data are also coded and encrypted using Symantec software, and they will be stored on the laptop used to collect data, and the hard drive located in the PI’s laboratory. Both computers are password protected, and the data are only accessible to the PI’s team. All study personnel are trained in the maintenance of security and confidentiality of research data.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Effect of alternating pressure overlay on weight bearing tissue tolerance in people with SCI  Version 2 Page 16 of 30 April 4, 2017 12.0 Statistical Considerations For aims 1 and 2, paired t-tests will be computed to compare the interface pressure and skin blood flow during 40 minutes of AP overlay (AP protocol) vs. OR overlay (Ctrl protocol). Paired t-tests will also be used to compare the reactive hyperemic response during RH1 (AP protocol) vs. RH (Ctrl protocol). For aim 3, paired t-tests will be computed to compare the skin blood flow during OR overlay (AP protocol) vs. OR overlay (Ctrl protocol), and the reactive hyperemic response during RH2 (AP protocol) vs. RH (Ctrl protocol). SPSS will be used for all statistical analyses. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will test the study on [ADDRESS_616776] decease during this study, we propose to recruit up to 20 subjects for this study. 13.0 Regulatory Requirements 13.1 Informed Consent  Oral consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_480064].  Eligible subjects will be scheduled for a study visit where written informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study procedures. The PI’s team is responsible for obtaining the signed consent form. The PI’s team members were trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_480038], including thorough explanation of the research protocols and allowing potential subjects sufficient amount of time to ask any questions and to make the decision in participating in this study. To ensure the quality of the informed consent process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480039], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_480040].

Document Date: 12-19-[ADDRESS_1171776], the team’s qualifications and our research environment. They also had some concerns, which we have 
addressed in the revised proposal and below.
Significance:
Rev. 3 (R3): “premise for the … between-group difference in reward-induced activation of insular
 and ventral 
striatum is not sufficiently elaborated.” Refs 16 & 17 do not support hypothesis of changes in ventral striatum.
Response:  We have revised hypotheses regarding the insula but not the ventral striatum based on new 
preliminary data showing between-group activation differences in insula, putamen and ACC (not ventral 
striatum) in 
high-risk (HR) vs. low-risk (LR) and control groups (see section C.3.3. Preliminary Studies). 
R3: “The need for the formulation of two mutually exclusive hypotheses (HR>LR  and LR>HR) is not clear.” 
Response:  We have clarified our aims and hypotheses to focus on single hypotheses: 1) group differences 
in baseline activation (We hypothesize HR>LR based on new
 preliminary data), and 2) group differences in 
effect of MAS-XR (We hypothesize greater reduction in activation for the HR vs. LR groups). 
Investigator(s):
R2: Since [CONTACT_843219] is not listed under key personal, “concern that expertise with ACR is lacking.” “Is there a 
member of the team qualified to administer the ACR 
task?”
Response:  [CONTACT_843220] is added as key personnel. [CONTACT_843221] also has extensive experience administering ACR  
in children and will train a research associate to run ACR training of study participants.
Approach:
R1, R3: concern regarding whether [ADDRESS_1171777] response. 
Rationale for 3 week period is based on pre-clinical study.” 
Response:  There are no published data regarding treatment effects on activation of the brain reward  
system. We will test for changes following 3 weeks of stimulant treatment, which has produced changes in 
activation in adults with ADHD (Yang et al., 2016, ref 66 in the proposal). 
R1: concern re: possible confounding effects of family history of SUD (allowed in the high risk but not  low risk 
group. 
Response:  Ideally we might add a positive family history-only group, but this would exceed  the scope of a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study. We will therefore exclude SUD family history for the LR and HR groups.
R1: Much of the inclusion and exclusion crit eria and recruitment/retention strategies were in Human Subjects.
Response:  This is now included in the main document.
R1: Unequal number of males and females will be recruited, no analysis of sex effects.
Response:  Sex will be included as a covariate.
R1: Practice effects are not discussed.
Response:  Prelim. data (4 subjects scanned 2X with no intervening intervention) show no practice effects.
R2: Preferable to pre-specify the washout period for all subjects on non-stimulant
 treatments.
Response:  A 2-week washout period is now specified. 
R2: Inconsistency regarding family history of SUD in 1st degree relatives (pg 53 vs. C.2.2).
Response:  We clarified that FH is excluded in both the HR and LR groups.
R2: Reference is made to pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], but a
 small section on Preliminary Studies is included  with no data.
Response:  We now include a graph summarizing our preliminary data.
R3: The power analysis is not sufficiently elaborated.
Response:  We revised the power analyses section.
R3: The section “Dose
 titration” indicates that some patients may receive different doses of MAS-XR. No 
statistical control for dose variation is proposed. 
Response:  A variable for dose is now added into the analyses.
R3: outcome changes might be a result of the acute and/or  extended effects of treatment. Time from the last 
medication dose and the scan is not provided.
Response:  There will be a 6-8h interval between drug administration and scanning (now  specified). Thus, 
activation changes detected on 2nd scan will reflect changes during treatment rather than acute drug effects.  
R3: minor: a number of mistakes/typos.
 Response:  They have been corrected.

Among youth with vulnerability for the development of substance use disorders (SUD), those  with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD) or severe oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) 
are considered to be at highest risk1. Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) and mixed amphetamine 
salts (MAS), and a variety of non-stimulants, have established efficacy for ADHD - but response is greater for 
stimulants than non-stimulants2. Basic science studies have shown sensitizing effects of MPH on the brain 
reward system3 in animal models of SUD risk4,5, with MPH-exposed animals having greater self-administration 
of cocaine6 – which is a cause for concern. However, a recent large meta-analysis found that stimulants can be 
used in youth with ADHD without increasing SUD later in life7; other studies point to benefits of stimulants in 
treating CD8. Yet, no studies have specifically examined stimulant safety in the context of SUD risk status in 
humans. Thus, a question of major clinical import remains: can stimulants can be used safely in youth with 
ADHD and high risk for SUD, or should they be withheld due concerns about increased risk for later SUD?  
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers an opportunity to examine the effects of stimulant 
medications on the biology of SUD risk in youth
 with ADHD prior to exposure to drugs of abuse9. Emerging 
findings implicate behavioral disinhibition, heightened sensitivity to reward10, and decreased connectivity 
between the behavioral control and reward systems11-[ADDRESS_1171778] been 
linked to problematic drug use14,15 - suggesting that SUD risk is characterized by [CONTACT_843174], but enhanced hedonic properties of rewards. Of note, recent findings indicate that purported 
neurobiological manifestations of SUD risk may precede the appearance of clinical manifestations9. Yet there 
are only a few studies reporting on activation changes after administration of stimulants, with discordant 
findings; for instance Rubia et al. (2009)16 showed that MPH decreased baseline hyperactvation in OFC in 
ADHD while Minuzo et al. (2013)17 reported that MPH increased baseline hypoactvation in nucleus accumbens 
(NAcc) for ADHD vs controls. Yet, while subjects in these studies had ADHD, they did not necessarily have 
increased risk for SUD, and the findings were not examined in relation to relative risk for SUD. Importantly, 
preliminary data from our group suggest that youth with ADHD at high risk (HR) and low risk (LR) for SUD 
differ from controls in relation to reward processing, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_843175], as well as activation in the reward system on fMRI. These findings highlight the importance of 
specifically studying the effects of stimulant medication in youth with ADHD and HR for SUD in contrast with 
those at LR for SUD. Currently, there are no studies which use fMRI to examine youth at HR vs. LR before and 
after stimulant treatment.  This design would be highly informative for assessing effects of stimulants on the 
biology underlying SUD risk. 
We propose to study the effects of 3 weeks of treatment with mixed amphetamine salts extended release 
(MAS-XR) on the brain reward system in youth with ADHD only (LR) vs. ADHD + CD or severe ODD (HR). We 
will study 36 youth naïve to stimulant treatment and drugs of abuse (18 per risk group) ages 7– 12 years. LR 
and HR subjects will be assessed with clinical and neuropsychological measures and will be subjected to fMRI 
scans twice – before and after [ADDRESS_1171779] (ACR) task developed by [CONTACT_27156], which has a unique 
component of unexpected non-reward18. Combining prediction error analyses with purported activation 
differences on this particular component of the ACR will offer a novel approach to assess differences between 
youth at different risk levels for SUD. Importantly, our event-related design will distinguish increased effort and 
associated anticipatory activation (positive effects) from increased hedonics of reward (a potentially deleterious 
effect).
Aim 1 (Primary).  To compare  the effect  of MAS-XR  on activation  in the brain  reward  system  in LR vs. HR 
participants  with ADHD.  Hypotheses:  1a) Based  on our preliminary  data the HR group  will show  greater 
baseline  activation  than the LR group  during  the ACR  task in the insula,  putamen,  and anterior  cingulate  gyrus 
(ACC);  1b) Based  on prior findings  of stimulant  effects  on baseline  hyperactivation  in ADHD16, we hypothesize 
that MAS-XR  will reduce  the activation  in the brain  reward  system  for both groups,  with greater  magnitude  of 
change  in HR youth.  Given  discordant  reports  in the literature16-28, it is possible  that MAS-XR  will increase  the 
baseline  activation  in both groups  or may increase  the activation  in one group  but not the other.  
Aim 2 (Exploratory).  We will examine the relationship between behavioral measures and changes  in activation 
in the reward system. We hypothesize that changes on behavioral measures will correlate with changes in 
brain activation during the Expected Reward and Unexpected Non-Reward components of the ACR task. We 
will specifically examine: a) positive and negative prediction error measures computed from the behavioral data 
from the ACR task; b) measures of sensitivity to reward and punishment assessed by [CONTACT_843176]/BAS; and c) positive and negative urgency assessed by [CONTACT_843177].

A. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE.  Vulnerability to substance use disorder (SUD) has been
conceptualized as an imbalance between the functions of the brain reward and behavioral inhibition systems29.
Drug-seeking behavior is linked to the
 highly rewarding properties of addictive substances, which produce a
preference to drugs over alternative naturally occurring rewards, so drug-associated stimuli acquire heightened
ability to motivate behaviors. An important recent review concludes that adolescents with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behavior disorders (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or
conduct disorder (CD)) exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to rewards in the context of a persistent pattern of
behavioral disinhibition10, and therefore are at heightened risk for SUD. Stimulant medications - the accepted
first-line treatment for ADHD - have known abuse potential; moreover, there are concerns about possible
sensitizing effects of stimulants on the function and development of the brain reward system. Findings from
multiple preclinical studies demonstrate the potential of addictive drugs to alter brain organization in networks
involved in the processing of incentive motivation and reward30-38, and show that neuroadaptations that
accompany the development of addiction render the brain reward system hypersensitive (“sensitized”) to drugs
and drug-associated stimuli39. Moreover, animal studies have shown that stimulants enhance drug-
seeking/self-administration, whereas non-stimulants diminish those behaviors6,40. Similarly, human studies
have shown robust effects of stimulants on behavior41,42 and differential effects of methylphenidate (MPH) vs.
atomoxetine (ATX) on brain activation in the context of reward43.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_843152], naturalistic studies have failed to consistently document an association between 
stimulant treatment and SUD risk - some have shown protective associations44-46, others predisposing 
associations47-49; and others no association50-52. Though it is tempting to conclude that there is little risk of SUD 
due to stimulant treatment, there is good reason to not summarily accept this conclusion. First, most existing 
studies have sample sizes of ~100 participants; this is insufficient to examine the association between 
stimulant treatment and SUD, which occurs at relatively low frequency even in high risk (HR) samples53. 
Second, longitudinal studies tend to under-recruit HR individuals – for instance the MTA sample had low rates 
of comorbid CD (e.g. 8%) compared to the 20-25% figure reported by [CONTACT_2312]54. Third, longitudinal studies 
cannot randomly assign subjects to long-term medication vs. non-medication treatment due to ethical 
considerations, and there is inconsistent duration of exposure to medication and dose7. Fourth, naturalistic 
studies which pair clinical measures with imaging to assess the impact of treatment on the brain do not align 
the timelines for assessment and imaging with treatment – which means that they cannot specifically assess 
the impact of treatment. Most importantly, no study has examined the possible differential effects of stimulant 
treatment in youth with ADHD at relatively HR and low risk (LR) for SUD. This is problematic, because 
treatment might increase risk only in the subgroup of children who might be especially vulnerable. 
Yet, even if one accepts the importance of conducting a study of stimulant exposure and SUD risk, the 
question remains 
as to how to define risk and how to best measure it. While there is relative convergence 
regarding the importance of “reward sensitivity” and “sensitization to reward” as proxies of SUD risk, there is 
considerable disagreement about how to measure these constructs. A question of particular importance is 
whether to prioritize the study of behavioral or brain-based measures in relation to SUD risk. Of note, Robinson 
and Berridge6 argue that behavioral indices of sensitization are important only as secondary measures, to 
illustrate the consequences of underlying neuroadaptive processes linked to SUD. Other recent research has 
shown  that imaging  biomarkers  and clinical  factors  may have  different  roles  as predictors  of treatment 
outcome55-57. Together, this evidence suggests that brain-based measures should be prioritized. Most 
importantly, it is thought that underlying physiological abnormalities can be indexed before the full development 
of the clinical phenotype9, meaning that these fMRI-derived biomarkers might be more sensitive to determining 
risk (i.e. before SUD onset). Thus, to best understand the neurobiological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_843153], it is 
essential to study the effects of exposure to abusable substances on the brain reward system in youth who are 
naïve to such exposure, and examining possible differential effects in youth at relatively HR vs. LR for SUD.  
The examination of reward processing in ADHD has so far produced  inconsistent results regarding which brain 
regions are activated by [CONTACT_843178], and also the direction of activation in ADHD compared to 
controls. A number of studies have shown activation in NAcc during reward anticipation21,[ADDRESS_1171780] 
outcome23,24 ; other regions have been indexed by [CONTACT_843179], including ACC25,26, orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC)27,28, and insula18. Several small studies have reported that ADHD is associated with under-activation in 
ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)19, and negative correlations of activation with 
behavioral measures of impulsivity58. In contrast, a recent larger study in adolescents and young adults with 
ADHD found hyper-activation in VS20. Of note, reports  on activation changes in the brain reward system after

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171781] shown discordant findings; for instance Rubia et  al. (2009)16 showed that MPH 
decreased baseline hyperactvation in OFC in ADHD while Minuzo et al. (2013)[ADDRESS_1171782] specifically 
examined subgroups of individuals with ADHD at HR vs LR for SUD, with the exception of one study from our  
group that showed higher activation in HR vs LR participants in the caudate and insula18.  In summary, the 
existing literature fails to demonstrate any consistent patterns of activation differences; individuals with ADHD 
may exhibit either higher or lower activation in a widely distributed set of brain regions, and the findings may 
differ in relation to reward anticipation or outcome.  Yet, existing studies have not separately examined 
individuals with ADHD at HR and LR for SUD. 
Summary. This study of drug-naïve youth at LR and HR for SUD studied pre- and post-treatment with 
amphetamine stimulants would 
provide important preliminary data for a larger scale investigation of reward-
related risk and protective effects of stimulants. fMRI will be used to determine whether brief treatment with 
stimulants yields differential effects on activation in the brain reward system in youth at HR vs. LR for SUD. 
Additionally, the degree to which changes in brain activation are linked to measures of ADHD and ODD/CD 
symptoms and reward sensitivity pre- and post-treatment will provide important information regarding the 
functional consequences of treatment. This proposal  builds  on two important  and innovative  characteristics  1) 
a strong  translational  paradigm;  and 2) imaging  techniques  capable  of quantifying  functions  in distributed 
neural  circuits  to index  imaging  biomarkers  as indicators  of treatment  outcome.  The goals of the proposed 
research are in concert with NIDA priorities which “encourage studies…to explore the relationship(s) between 
neural circuitry and treatment and prevention effects, and in particular, how behavioral targets might be 
affected by [CONTACT_843180], and how that information might be used to improve 
targeted treatment and prevention intervention development, that translate to  reduced morbidity and mortality.” 
B. INNOVATION The most innovative aspect of this proposal is its use of a translational design to investigate a
clinical question of considerable importance that cannot be answered using a more traditional longitudinal
approach.  The decision to conduct a neuroimaging treatment trial of MAS-XR in drug-naïve LR vs. HR youth
with ADHD builds 
directly from findings in animal and human studies suggesting dysfunction in neural circuits
regulating reward processing, the observation that stimulants may be associated with potentially adverse
behavioral outcomes (i.e. increased drug self-administration6 and higher relapse rates in adults with ADHD
receiving stimulants42), and the recently articulated imperative to prioritize the study of biomarker predictors of
risk. This would be the first study to examine the influence of stimulant treatment on the brain reward system in
drug-naïve children at LR vs. HR for SUD, and thereby [CONTACT_843181]. Further, it will use a validated fMRI task (i.e., Anticipation, Conflict Reward (ACR)18), which
is developmentally sensitive and uses a novel approach to model reward mechanisms, including specific task
components to measure the potentially divergent effects of reward anticipation and outcome. We will further
examine changes in brain activation in relation to clinical symptoms and validated measures of reward
sensitivity obtained outside the scanner, which will allow us to more extensively determine the effects of
stimulant treatment on reward processing in context of clinical features. No study to date has explored changes
in the activation of the reward system in drug-naïve children with ADHD subdivided into those with relatively LR
and HR for later SUD, and related these changes in activation to  behavioral/neuropsychological measures.
C. APPROACH.
C.1. Overview.  The objectives  of this study  are to  examine the effects  of treatment with  mixed amphetamine  
salts extended release (MAS-XR) on reward processing in youth with ADHD at HR and LR for SUD, and to  
delineate risk in relation to underlying neurobiological and clinical features. We will recruit 48 youth ages 7-12 
with ADHD+CD or severe ODD and treat 42 of these with MAS-XR for 3 weeks. We estimate a dropout rate of  
~15%, and expect  36 youth (18  per risk group) to complete treatment  and 2 successful scans. Activation  
changes from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in components of the reward system (e.g. VS, OFC, insula)  
will be assessed via fMRI. Ratings of ADHD symptoms will be obtained weekly; secondary neuropsychological  
and clinical measures of SUD risk will be obtained at baseline and EOT.
Successful completion of this study will  illustrate the different effects  of stimulant treatment (e.g.  MAS-XR) on 
reward processing and activation  during fMRI in youth with ADHD at HR vs. LR  for SUD. We  will make 
inferences regarding risk for  substance  abuse based on  the presence  or absence  of differential effects of 
treatment on reward-related  activation in relation to  SUD risk status. If  treatment produces similar changes in 
the reward system in participants at LR and HR, there should be no concern about increased risk for SUD with

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171783], studying the effects of stimulants in  young, drug-naïve  youth reduces the  risk of both  
naturalistic exposure  to drugs of abuse  and stimulant treatment of  ADHD (both  of which  are exclusionary).  
Further, our experience with fMRI  studies in youth with ADHD suggests that by [CONTACT_654] 8 approximately  90% of  
participants can successfully complete  both mock and actual scans.  Age-related differences  in the BOLD  
signal will be used as a covariate.
C.2.2. Rationale for Risk Group Definition. Studying LR vs. HR children will allow us to examine the effects of  
treatment on activation in the brain reward system as a function of risk status and determine whether MAS-XR  
may impact the reward system similarly or uniquely in HR vs. LR youth. Childhood ADHD has been associated  
with increased rates of drug abuse in adolescence; however, comorbid CD and severe ODD, which frequently  
co-occur with childhood ADHD, account for most of this association1. Therefore, children who have ADHD and 
CD or severe ODD (ODD +  2 symptoms of  CD) will constitute the HR group. We will not require  overt  
aggression, as this co-varies with CD and severe ODD. We considered requiring both FH and CD/severe ODD  
to define the HR group, but this would limit  feasibility of recruitment. Moreover, CD has been found  to be a 
better independent predictor of later substance abuse than FH of SUD in youth with ADHD59. Finally, choosing  
CD/severe ODD rather than FH to define the HR group offers an  important  clinical  advantage, as stimulants  
are often used to treat ODD/CD symptoms in youth with ADHD8. Because the LR group cannot have + FH of  
SUD, we will exclude FH in first degree relatives in both the LR and HR groups (so the groups are balanced). A  
review of our MACRO sample shows that out of 90 youth with ADHD, 53 (57%) had comorbid ODD with no FH  
of SUD, which indicates that we will be able to recruit a sufficient number of HR youth for this study.
C.2.3. Rationale for the use of  MAS vs. MPH.  All stimulants (e.g. MPH, MAS,  cocaine) activate both the  
sympathetic and  central nervous systems to  heighten arousal, increase behavioral activation, and, when  
delivered rapi[INVESTIGATOR_843154],  create a long  lasting  state  of euphoria60. While similar, these effects  differ  
between different classes of stimulants – e.g., existing evidence suggests that MPH-induced changes in brain  
dopamine and its metabolites are  consistent  with changes induced  by [CONTACT_843182]; however the  
magnitude of the dose-dependent increase in both the dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_843155]61. Therefore, we selected to use 
MAS for the current proposal due to: 1) stronger effects on brain chemistry that may be closer to the effects of  
drugs of abuse, and 2) potential use of AMP as replacement therapy in the treatment of cocaine abuse62.
C.2.4. Rationale for the Treatment Design. We propose an open label study of MAS-XR because the contrasts  
of interest  are between the two  SUD risk groups, and placebo  is not needed. Available  reports show  BOLD  
changes with single dose stimulant challenge16,[ADDRESS_1171784]  that 3 weeks is a sufficient  
amount of time to  show changes on fMRI; it is also not too long to  substantially increase cost and risk for  
dropout. In our prior experience with MPH/ATX comparison trials, the  dropout rate was 18%  for a 4-month  
protocol and 10% for a 6-week  protocol. Ideally we might have included  a control group to  assess  practice  
effects, but that would be prohibitive for the scope and budget for this proposal. Data from [ADDRESS_1171785] (ACR)  task.  The fMRI task  to be  used in this  
protocol (ACR) was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jin Fan (co-I)  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_843156]. The task has  several important  
features: 1) it is developmentally appropriate, and the  value of  using child-friendly designs  to help keep 
children engaged has been amply recognized67; 2) it balances task length and the requisite number of different  
events (e.g.,  cues, flankers,  reward outcomes), thus decreasing  burden and maximizing task completion; 3) it  
has a novel unexpected non-reward  component that can be used to conduct exploratory analyses of  reward  
processing in relation to negative outcomes  (i.e., negative prediction error); and 4) it has been  shown to  
successfully index changes in activation in the brain reward system in relation to stimulant administration63.
C.3.  Feasibility of Study Design (includes preliminary studies).

C.4.3 Study Periods
Study Period I: Screening/baseline (Visits 1–2). The 1st and 2nd visits both involve assessment; the 2nd visit also 
includes the  baseline  fMRI scan. Subjects will  have  a “mock scan” at  the 1st visit, following established 
guidelines76. We anticipate that the assessment procedures can be completed in 2 study visits within 14 days. 
The screening period can be lengthened to accommodate washout of a non-stimulant drug if this is required. 
Study Period II: 2 Week Treatment Block (Days 0 to 21) . Subjects will receive open label treatment with MAS-
XR for 3 weeks. Medication will be titrated using  a fixed dose approach, with doses that mimic those used in 
clinical practice. The two  assigned doses are 0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg,  with an option to increase to  1.0 
mg/kg if needed. At study completion,  participants  will complete the post-treatment  fMRI  scan and all clinical 
measures. There will be 2 visits during this period - one after 1 week of treatment and one at 3 weeks (EOT). 
There will be a phone visit at the end of the second treatment week, though subjects can be seen if necessary.  
C.4.4. Study medication and medication administration. Subjects treated with non-stimulants will be required to  
be off  medication for 2 weeks prior  to the scan.  We will  purchase MAS–XR, an extended release generic  
amphetamine formulation. Subjects will begin at 0.25 mg/kg  and increase to  0.5 mg/kg after one week. This  
dose can be reached (within ~5 mg) using 2 capsules of  commercially available  doses. Those  who cannot  
increase the dose due to AEs will be allowed to maintain their dose and be evaluated for a dose increase after  
2 weeks. Subjects who experience difficulty with symptom control  can titrate  to a higher dose  if need be 
(maximum 1 mg/kg). Subjects who increase their dose and experience AEs will be allowed to lower their dose.  
Subjects will receive MAS–XR on the day of the second scan approximately 6-8hrs before scan.C.3.3. Preliminary Studies. Our publications show that the ACR
task can successfully recruit regions within reward network
during reward outcomes
 and that reward-related activation is
elevated in youth at HR for SUD18. We have also successfully
treated and scanned youth with ADHD treated with MPH vs.
ATX68. New data show demonstrable higher activation in HR vs
LR/controls in insula, ACC and putamen during Unexpected
Non-reward outcome of the ACR (Figure 1).
C.4.  Methods and Procedures. C.4.1. Sample.  We will recruit
48 prospective subjects 
and randomize 42 who meet
inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete the baseline fMRI scan

C.4.5. Measurement and  Management  of Adverse Effects (AEs).  AE ratings will be  collected at  baseline and 
each medication visit, using open-ended reporting and  the Barkley stimulant  side effect scale73. We also  
monitor for changes  in pulse and blood pressure, and suicidal behavior (see below). All AEs  are logged and  
reported to the IRB; profiles of  AEs are  reviewed by [CONTACT_843184].  We have  conducted similar trials  
using stimulants for years and have never had to modify the protocol due to AEs.
C.4.6. Data  Management.  Demographic and clinical  data will be recorded on  paper forms, de-identified, and 
translated to a Microsoft  access database.  MRI data will  be uploaded  to the Mount Sinai High  Performance  
Computing system, identified by [CONTACT_32819]; imaging data will be backed up to a hard drive.

C.5.1 Measures to Characterize the Sample. KSADS or C-
DISC)69 (~45-90 minutes ).  The C-DISC and KSADS assesses current and past psychopathology according 
to DSM criteria. Dimensions of psychopathology. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)74 (~30 minutes ). The 
CBCL is a validated and well-established broad-band parent-report scale, which will be used to characterize 
the sample. ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS).  Investigator interview with parent (~15-20 minutes ); teacher 
report70.  SNAP ODD/CD (parent/teacher)71 (~5-10 minutes ); The SNAP is a comprehensive 90 item 
rating scale for ADHD and ODD/CD. It will be used to operationalize inclusion criteria for the ADHD children 
and serve as a measure of treatment response. To minimize burden we will use only the ODD and CD items. 
Symptom Severity: Clinical Global Impressions - Severity Scale (CGI-S)75 (~2 – 5 minutes ). The CGI is a 
clinician rated 7-point scale completed by [CONTACT_843185]. The 
companion CGI-Improvement scale (CGI-I) will be used to rate improvement from baseline to end of treatment. 
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence for Children (WASI)72 (~20 minutes ). Substance Use. Urine 
toxicology will be obtained at baseline to ensure that no substances of abuse are being used by [CONTACT_2252]. 
Prenatal exposure to alcohol/drugs, assessed via the Pregnancy and Birth Questionnaire76 (completed by 
[CONTACT_7071]) (~5 min). Family History of psychiatric disorders and SUD.  Family History Assessment Module 
(FHAM)77 (~25 min) is a semi-structured diagnostic interview conducted with the parent. Medical Status.  We 
obtain height, weight, hand dominance78, sexual development assessed by [CONTACT_843186]-report scale for 
puberty79 and a physical examination at baseline. We screen for individual and family cardiovascular risk, and 
obtain additional consultation as necessary, including ECG, to document of safety for study participation. 
C.5.2.Tolerability:  ASSERS [Barkley Stimulant Side Effect Rating Scale73] (~5 minutes).  Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating  Scale (C-SSRS)80 (~5 minutes) . Heart rate and BP (~5 minutes) and open ended 
report of AEs and concomitant medications (~2-5 minutes) will be obtained at baseline and each treatment 
visit (weeks 1–6).
C.5.3  Secondary (Behavioral) Measures:  Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Scale (BIS/BAS)81 (~10–15 minutes)  
is a validated 20-item scale that has been shown to correlate with activation in reward circuits82. Kirby [CONTACT_843187]83 (~10–15 minutes)  is a validated test which assesses temporal (delay) discounting; the  
temporal discount parameter has been shown to correlate with the activation in the reward brain circuitry in 
adolescents84. UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale consists of 45 items using a 4-point Likert scale and has 4 
subscales: Urgency, Lack of Premeditation and Perseverance and Sensation Seeking785.

C.7. Neuroimaging Methods
C.7.1. Neuroimaging Procedures.  Equipment. The Siemens 3T MAGNETOM  Skyra is an FDA approved 3
Tesla human MRI scanner. It has a short and open bore (173 cm system length with 70 cm Open Bore
Design). The magnet is equipped with actively shielded echo-planar capable Siemens (SONATA) whole-body
gradient coils and Siemens CASCADE gradient amplifiers. A Siemens 32ch head coil is also available for
improved signal-to-noise ratio in the cortical area, and increased parallel imaging capability.

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171788] outcome. It consists of four
 32-trial blocks, each 6 minutes long.
There are 2 cue types (reward/non-reward) followed by [CONTACT_424979]/incongruent flankers: both cue and flanker
trials are counterbalanced and are fully orthogonal. Participants are required to respond as quickly as they can
to the direction of the central arrowhead while ignoring the flankers. Correct responses in trials beginning with
reward cues yield $[ADDRESS_1171789] or slow responses are followed by a $1 loss. The ACR task provides
only 25% money wins and introduces reward violation (unexpected non reward) in 25% of the trials, which
results in strongly engagement of the insula, ACC and also putamen  predominantly during reward outcomes.
C.8. Data Analysis
C.8.1. First level (within-subject) analyses will be conducted for each participant with a general linear model
(GLM) to quantify
 the relationship between the observed event-related BOLD signals and regressors encoding
expected trial-specific responses. The design matrix will be comprised of 12 regressors: 2 for cue (reward vs.
non-reward) x 2 for target type (congruent or incongruent flankers) x 3 for outcome-related effects (reward,
non-reward, punishment). There are [ADDRESS_1171790]: reward following reward cue, non-reward
following reward cue, non-reward following non-reward cue, or punishment for an incorrect/missing response.
C.8.2.  Group-level Statistical Analysis.   Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations (SD), etc.) for
all variables of interest will be computed and compared by [CONTACT_15914] t test for continuous variables or Chi-square
test for categorical variables. Group statistical analyses of the imaging data will be performed using a GLM
from SPM. The GLM is written as Y=XB+E, where Y is a matrix with a series of multivariate measurements, X
is a design matrix, B is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated and E is a matrix
containing errors or noise. The errors are usually assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution86,87.
Primary Aim. Hypotheses 1a) HR will show greater activation than LR at baseline will  be tested via F-test of the 
voxel-based whole 
brain activation with one-way ANCOVA with group (HR, LR) as the between-subjects 
factor; age, sex, and IQ are nuisance covariates.: 1b) MAS-XR treatment will reduce activation in both groups, 
with greater magnitude of change in HR youth, will  be tested via F-tests with  ANCOVA of the voxel-based 
whole brain activation controlling for time (baseline, post-treatment) with groups (HR, LR) with age, sex, IQ and 
medication dose as covariates. We will use t-tests to examine 1) differences in activation at baseline and 2) 
activation differences at end of treatment between HR and LR in specific ROIs. The voxel-based Z statistic 
images will be thresholded using clusters determined by Z>2.3 and a cluster corrected significance threshold 
of p<0.05. 
Exploratory Aim.  We will conduct correlation analyses between pre to post- treatment measures of activation 
in the reward 
system and scores on the behavioral measures collected outside the scanner (i.e., Kirby, 
BIS/BAS, UPPS) to examine the direction and magnitude of correlations between brain function and behavior. 
C.8.4. Power analyses.  The main power considerations for the primary aim are related to the ability to detect
differences in activation 
between the two groups pre- to post treatment. We estimated power using Monte
Carlo simulations (10,000 draws per model), with α = 0.05, for all models. With a between subjects factor (2-
levels; LR, HR) and 4 covariates (age, sex, IQ, dose level ), we were able to recover large effects sizes (f = .80-
1.0) for the between group factor with [ADDRESS_1171791] sizes of d =.2-3 with 4-5 independent
nuisance covariates (age, sex, IQ, does), and baseline covariates with a correlation of .35 in the model.
C.8.5. Expected outcomes/interpretation of findings.  Reduced reward-related activation after treatment with
MAS-XR would suggest that the drug may reduce
 SUD risk by [CONTACT_843188]; this
finding should be amplified by [CONTACT_843189]. The degree of correlation between brain activation and behavioral measures will inform as
to which behavioral scales are most appropriate to use in our planned R01.
C.8.6. Potential problems.  It is possible that treatment with MAS-XR will yield activation changes in the
opposite direction from what was hypothesized – i.e., increased rather than decreased
 activation in the HR
group. Although against the hypothesis advanced here, this finding would be of considerable interest, as it
would suggest that stimulants might be associated with increased rather than decreased risk of SUD in youth
at HR for SUD. This would then become the subject of a subsequent large scale study.

Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children
Inclusion of Women 
There are  no gender restrictions for this  study;  we will recruit both  males and females.  Due to the gender 
distribution between males and females with ADHD diagnosis in youth, we expect a somewhat larger number 
of males (estimate between 3 males to every 1 or 2 females). We expect the gender ratio to more heavily favor 
males in the group with  ADHD + CD/severe/ODD, and to  be more balanced in the ADHD only  group. The 
control group will be recruited to reflect the age and sex characteristics of the clinical sample.
The sex ratio of the parents who will provide assessment information about their children  (and also their 
families) will  be 75 - 90%  female. Although ~50%  of our  cases  have a father or father figure who is involved, 
and although encourage participation from both parents (especially  during the baseline  and end of  treatment 
assessments), we most  often only see the mother.  Ongoing  medication visits are  almost always  conducted 
with the mother  and child. In  rare circumstance,  a father  or grandfather will be  the primary contact [CONTACT_843191], although in those instances we also solicit information from the mother.  
Inclusion of Minorities 
Because we are located in a large urban area, there is ample minority representation.  Findings from previous 
research studies conducted by [CONTACT_843192] 40% 
Hispanic, 30% African-American, 20% Caucasian and 10% of Asian or mixed ancestry.  It is expected  that a 
similar representation will be seen  in the proposed study.  The sample is also  likely to vary with regard  to 
socioeconomic status (SES).  Using the Hollingshead’s scale (Hollingshead, 1975) for rating SES, the median 
SES in our samples is 4, though  participants  span  the full range from 1 - 6. This SES distribution closely 
matches the ethnic and SES make-up of the region in [LOCATION_001] City where the research is being conducted.  
Inclusion of Children
The participants in this study will be children and pre-pubescent adolescents.  Our specific age range 
(7-12) was guided by [CONTACT_2296]’s experience conducting fMRI studies in youth with ADHD and risk for 
substance abuse. By [CONTACT_449738], there is a growing risk of substance abuse and potential for pregnancy 
among females with behavioral problems (both exclusory condition) and thus a significantly increased 
risk of attrition at screening.

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171796] Recruitment and Retention .  Participants in the two groups will be recruited from 
multiple sources, including the Mount Sinai Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient clinics 
(see letter from [CONTACT_32830]), community-based programs (see letters from [CONTACT_843222],), the Mount 
Sinai General Pediatric Clinic, and the Center for Addictive Disorders (see letter from [CONTACT_843223]). 
[CONTACT_838235]’s previous experience with imaging adolescents with ADHD indicates that, by 
[CONTACT_843193]-screening, it is possible to limit the number of enrolled subjects who are 
“screen failures” to 15% - either because they don’t meet the study criteria or because they 
cannot perform the fMRI scans. We have not had difficulty recruiting normal controls for 
neuroimaging protocols; we anticipate the need to recruit 35 to obtain a final n of 30 controls 
with completed assessments and an fMRI scan. All together, we anticipate pre-screening a total 
of ~[ADDRESS_1171797] built in an estimated 
15% attrition rate in the treatment trial, mainly due to poor tolerability or lack of response. This 
number is based on our current experience in fMRI treatment studies in youth with ADHD, 
including a randomized parallel group fMRI treatment study of atomoxetine and 
methylphenidate. However, we will over-recruit if we do not meet our expected end of treatment 
numbers. We expect that given our history of successful recruitment of children with ADHD and 
paid advertising, we should be able to reach the final number of 36 participants at risk (i.e. 18 
per cell) with full clinical and fMRI data at baseline and post-treatment. We anticipate being able 
to evaluate [ADDRESS_1171798] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171802] potential for
benefit by [CONTACT_7661] a thorough structured clinical evaluation, and receiving treatment with an FDA-
approved medication. Aspects of the testing protocol may prove beneficial to healthy controls,
although the battery is not designed to specifically benefit this group. The potential risks are:
5.1.  Clinical trial  
There is some risk to participation in the trial, since children and adolescents will receive 
treatment with MAS-XR 
which is commercially available FDA - approved treatment for ADHD. 
Common side effects include: insomnia, loss of appetite, irritability, headache, occasional 
dysphoria, and tics. Other more serious adverse effects such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_843157]. 
It is inevitable that in a study such as this, which includes treatment of youth with ADHD, with 
one subgroup deemed to be at high risk for SUD based on the presence of a comorbid 
disruptive behavior disorder, there may be problems which require management (emergency or 
otherwise). For routine management issues of the sort to be expected with this population, we 
are providing case management. For problems related to medication tolerability or safety, the 
treatment visit window can be shortened to as little as three days if tolerability at any dose of 
either medication is poor. For more emergent problems, we will utilize a version of the MTA 
(Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD) ASAP (i.e., Adjunct Services, Attrition 
Prevention) manual93. The ASAP manual lays out a procedure for assessing crisis situations, 
and allows for a pre-determined number of non-directive, supportive counseling sessions to help 
patients and families respond to crises. To address potential problems from lack of response to 
the study medications (both are FDA-approved and, in general, are considered to be quite 
effective for treating ADHD, but some individuals may not respond to or tolerate the rug to which 
they are randomized), we will offer open treatment after the completion of the randomized trial, 
using any treatment approach that seems indicated.  If none of the above methods are 
successful in managing the problem, we will encourage subjects to discontinue the trial if it is 
not in their best interest to remain as participants. 
Emergent events need not be related to the trial. One example is real or perceived child abuse, 
maltreatment or neglect. Current ongoing abuse or neglect is an exclusionary criterion for the 
study. However, if abuse is suspected after enrollment, we will, as mandatory reporters, make a 
report to the appropriate agency. Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_843158] (depending on the situation), but confirmed abuse will result in 
termination from the study.  
The other potential risks and discomforts for subjects are, in general, minimal. No discomfort is 
expected with psychological examinations or clinical interviews. 
Additional risks are related to confidentiality of personal information. Every effort is made to 
protect confidentiality. All individual information obtained will be held strictly confidential. No 
information that might in any way lead to the identification of the source will be made public. All 
raw data from the study will be kept in locked files and identified by [CONTACT_409646]; names, 
addresses, and any other identifying information of study individuals or families will be kept in an 
entirely separate, locked location. The consent forms will be stored in a separate and secure 
location from data obtained using the other data collection methods. All study data will be used

End Date:12/18/[ADDRESS_1171803] (ACR) task; we estimate that the fMRI 
sessions, including the structural scans required for co-registration, will require about 40 
minutes to complete. We will use the MRI facilities of the Mount Sinai Translational and 
Molecular Imaging Institute. Images will be acquired on a Skyra 3.0 Tesla magnet using a 
gradient echo T2*weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) (See Approach section) with a blood 
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. All MRI procedures combined will require 
approximately 1 hour of scan time. Based on our experience and feedback from similar 
populations, the imaging tasks are considered fun and enjoyable, and do not induce distress. 
There are very few potential risks to participation.   The MRI scan requires the participant to lay 
still with his/her
 head in a tunnel-like device.  The procedure is painless and not uncomfortable. 
A small proportion of participants (about 3%) have difficulty tolerating the procedure because of 
claustrophobia.  If a participant becomes upset by [CONTACT_164532], the study will be terminated.  
There is no evidence that MRI is in any way harmful or has adverse effects.  The Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has set recommendations for exposure in MRI studies and this study 
satisfies those criteria.  Persons not suited for this study include those who have cardiac 
pacemakers, neural pacemakers, surgical clips in the brain or blood vessels, surgically 
implanted metal plates, screws or pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], cochlear implants, or metal objects in their body, 
especially in the eye.  Dental fillings do not present a problem. Some subjects find the loudness 
of the oscillating gradients during image acquisition to be discomforting, but the noise level is 
below FDA guidelines of [ADDRESS_1171804] the child warm up to the experience of being in 
the MRI scanner by [CONTACT_7661] a “mock scan” before the actual scan takes place. This provides the 
child experience with the scanner environment, including lying inside the MRI tube and 
performing the task, and accommodating to the noise which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_843159]. 
There also are potential risks from the tasks, which are in general minimal.  The animation used 
in the ACR 
task offers neutral images that are unlikely to be upsetting to participants, however, 
all participants will be shown a subset of comparable stimuli outside the scanner and will be 
exposed to practice versions of the task they will undergo in the scanner and are provided with 
the opportunity to withdraw from the study if they find the task aversive.

 subjects :
6.1.1. Children.  Children are considered to be vulnerable subjects; therefore, the Mount Sinai 
Medical Center Certification of Assent procedure will be used.  The investigator will explain the 
protocol to the child in a developmentally appropriate manner.  If the child agrees to participate, 
he/she will be asked about the protocol by [CONTACT_843194], who is not related to the 
child and is not involved in the study (e.g., a clinic nurse, clinician; administrative assistant; or 
staff from other research groups).  This individual will certify in writing that the child indeed

understands the protocol and assents to participation (and that this assent is free of coercion). If 
assent is not obtained, evaluation will  not commence even if the parent  consents.  In addition, 
the clinicians and  other  personnel involved  in this study will be trained in the management and 
interviewing of children. 
6.1.2. Financially disadvantaged persons .  The study population is expected to include subjects 
from all financial and social strata.  We will not exclude a subject based on financial parameters 
nor will we ask for a payment for the evaluation.  The reimbursement (for baseline assessment 
and two scans) for subjects’ time is enough to cover transportation fees and a lunch at 
the time of the interview, but is not coercive in that it does not constitute an 
unreasonably high incentive for participation - even for financially disadvantaged persons. 
6.2.  Recruitment.   Participants and their  parents will be clearly  told that participation in the 
present study is voluntary and that they can choose not to participate and still receive treatment 
in the Mount Sinai clinic  or another treatment facility of their choosing.  We also aim to reduce 
the boredom of the fMRI scan by [CONTACT_843195]-friendly tasks, which appeal to the child’s potential 
interest in doing the scan when they are considering whether or not to participate, and maintain 
the child’s interest  in performing the tasks properly during the procedure.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_843160], and that the majority are  interested  in 
participating and would  participate again if asked.  In addition, very few children who can 
successfully complete the scan ask not to do the procedure again. 
6.2.1. Informed Consent.  Participants will be pre-screened  prior to the first  visit to inform the 
adolescents and caregivers about  the research trial and to  identify basic  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. If participants wish to enroll in the study, consent forms will be sent to the home so the 
caregivers can  review  them. Enough  time is given for the  caregiver to read the consent form 
and discuss it with  a family  member  or the current care provider, if so desired.  Prior to the 
initiation of study procedures, the consent form is read and explained to the participant and his 
or her caregiver by [CONTACT_1720] a delegate.  The consent form includes the purpose and 
description of  the study procedures as well  as the potential risks and discomforts, 
cost/reimbursements, compensation for  injury, confidentiality, voluntary participation, 
alternatives to  participation, potential termination of participation,  financial disclosures of 
interest, and names of contact [CONTACT_122473]. Following a review of the consent form, all participants 
and their caregivers will be queried about distinct aspects of the study, and the time involved in 
the various procedures, to ensure they were paying attention  to the description of the 
procedures and understood what they heard and read in the consent document.  After a 
thorough description of the research, including the  risks and benefits and the  alternatives to 
participation, the parent or caregiver is asked to  sign the consent form if they freely consent to 
the procedures of  the study.  The caregiver will  also sign Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) forms, which indicate to the caregiver how information regarding the 
participant is disclosed.  A witness, not associated with the research study team, will meet with 
the adolescent independently and sign and  date the MSSM “Certification of  Assent of Minor” 
form to document that the child freely assented to participate. The MSSM Certification of Assent 
form is used  for ALL children, regardless of  age, to document  assent was freely given without 
coercion.  The caregiver and the research  study delegate obtaining the consent will  sign the 
consent form.
6.2.2.  Compensation.  
All participant  payments  are in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_843161].  To reimburse the families for 
time away from work we will pay compensation for the completion of the fMRI scan in the 
amount of $[ADDRESS_1171805] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H

The average payout for the tasks is ~$20. All in-person interview payments and earnings from 
the tasks (won and to be paid on the same day) will be paid on the day of the interview 
either in cash or gift certificate. Depending on IRB requirements, children/youth may 
receive gift certificates instead of cash, or a combination of cash and gift certificates the 
day of their visits. We will offer compensation for public transportation in the amount of 
$[ADDRESS_1171806] in a dedicated room, not in the waiting area, so that subjects would 
feel less compelled to answer questions or to “behave”.  When indicated, children who 
will not feel safe alone will be interviewed together with the parent.
6.3.2  Discovery of previously unreported abuse:  This will be discussed immediately with 
the participant and family and reported as indicated and in accordance with NY State law.  
Cases will be managed immediately by a board certified child psychiatrist, who is a 
member of the research team or when indicated, by [CONTACT_843196]. The child will not be 
discharged until safety is established in accordance with prevailing clinical practice.  In 
cases where safety cannot be established, the child will be taken for further evaluation in the 
pediatric emergency room.
6.3.3.  Suicidal or homicidal ideation revealed during the course of evaluation:  A board certified 
child psychiatrist, who is a member of the research team, will evaluate the child and 
if necessary, the adolescent will be taken to the emergency room for additional 
evaluation.  Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_843162], the primary decision with respect 
to possible hospi[INVESTIGATOR_843163]/liaison team, which 
conducts the emergency room evaluation, and not by [CONTACT_5051]. This will ensure 
that all decisions regarding management reflect the clinical needs of the participant, and not 
any considerations in relation to the research. 
6.3.4.  Discovery of a previously unknown psychiatric disorder during evaluation:  If safety 
is compromised or could potentially be compromised, the information will be reviewed with 
the family by [CONTACT_24478]-PIs or one of the Co-Is. If there is no threat to safety and the newly 
discovered disorder represents a contraindication to participation (e.g., the discovery of a Major 
Depressive Disorder with no psychotic features and no suicidality), the parent and the 
child will be counseled accordingly and encouraged to seek help.  If the parent agrees 
to seek further treatment, a referral for further evaluation will immediately be made.  Research 
participants can often be seen for a reduced fee in the child psychiatry outpatient clinic. 
A range of other potential sites for clinical follow-up will also be offered. Participants referred 
to clinical services within Mount Sinai will receive standard-of-care treatment, which may 
include psychotherapy or medications. Decisions related to possible treatments will be made 
by [CONTACT_15370](s) at the outpatient clinic, or other clinical site.
6.3.5.  Management of transient anxiety that may be caused by [CONTACT_364346]/procedures: 
This will be managed immediately by [CONTACT_5051], including attempts to better understand 
the source of the problem, and to provide acute intervention as required. Should any

intervention be made by [CONTACT_5051], the participant/family will not be responsible for 
payment for this intervention.  It is very unlikely that more than one brief session will be needed 
for the treatment of anxiety caused by [CONTACT_364346], should it occur.  However, in the case 
of pre-existing psychopathology that may make any anxiety which arises more resistant to 
intervention, the child will either be immediately evaluated by [CONTACT_843197]/liaison team or 
referred to the Mount Sinai outpatient clinic. Participation in the study will be suspended if this 
occurs, and not resumed unless and until the child and family agree to continue the research 
evaluation, and the evaluating clinician agrees that proceeding with the research evaluation is 
not contraindicated.
6.3.6. Positive urine toxicology: Both parent(s) and child will  be informed during the informed 
consent procedure that a urine toxicology test will be part of the initial evaluation, and that if 
there is a positive finding, the result of the test will be revealed to both the child and the parent. 
If this occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_843164] (e.g. child psychiatrist, psychologist) will 
counsel the family and discuss options for further action. Since positive urine toxicology is an 
exclusionary criterion for study participation, participants who have positive urine toxicology 
tests will be discontinued from the study. 
6.4.  Clinical trial.    
6.4.1. General Issues. All interviewers will receive  thorough and rigorous training on all aspects 
of interview administration, confidentiality, subject recruitment and acceptable methods of 
interviewer-subject interaction. All responses will be held confidential, to the extent permitted by 
[CONTACT_2371], including from the treatment/court authorities and other family members. Interviewees will 
be informed that reports or observations of suspected child abuse may require reporting to Child 
Protective Services and that information about other possible threats to the child (such as 
suicidality) may need to be reported to parents/guardians. Parents and youth are informed 
before the start of the interview that any threat of harm to or by a minor child will have to be 
reported to the parent and that any threat of child abuse or homicidal threat must be reported to 
the appropriate authorities. Parents will be told of any serious threat or harm to their child. All 
limits to confidentiality will be explained to all participants and their parents during the consent 
process. Even though the participants read the consent/assent forms, the specific sections of 
the consent form addressing these issues will be read to parents and children. Specifically, they 
will be told that we will protect the participant's confidentiality and that we will not share any 
personal information collected. Parents will be explicitly informed that they cannot have access 
to any of the research self-report data, including information collected about their child's 
substance use or other high risk behaviors, unless their child is in imminent danger and/or it is 
clinically determined that they need an intervention that requires parental consent.
6.4.2. Medications.  The medication to be used in this study is FDA-approved for the treatment 
of ADHD. While some would argue that stimulants are more effective in both risk groups to be 
studied, others would argue that non-stimulants might be preferable, either as a general rule or 
specifically in high risk subjects. As a rule, non-stimulants are considered a more appropriate 
first choice in youth who are currently abusing drugs, but there are no guidelines about whether 
to use stimulants or non-stimulants in children with ADHD + comorbid ODD/CD. Many would 
say that stimulants are more effective and should be used in this population; others might favor 
non-stimulants. It is clear that there is room for both clinical judgment and the different opi[INVESTIGATOR_843165]. However, with specific regard to randomization in this study, stimulant medication is 
indicated in the subject groups being treated and appropriate to use. 
6.4.3. Dose titration. We use an escalating, dose-optimizing approach that incorporates 
measures of clinical 
response and tolerability, and is maximally responsive to the clinical needs 
Contact [CONTACT_4002]/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H
Protection of Human Subjects
 Page 77

End Date:12/18/2024

of participants. If there is inadequate response and tolerability is excellent the dose will be 
increased. If response is deemed to be excellent (and tolerability at least good), the dose will be 
maintained. If an initial excellent response is not maintained, the dose can be increased. 
Likewise, if the medication is not adequately tolerated, we will either maintain the dose (i.e., 
allowing additional time to accommodate) or lower the dose. If tolerability improves, we will 
increase the dose until optimal response is reached (i.e., CGI-S rating of 1 or 2).
6.4.4. Monitoring and managing problems in titration. Children will be monitored closely during 
the study, with weekly visits during medication titration and treatment. The interval between 
visits and the schedule of dose changes can be altered if clinically warranted. For example, if 
there is a problem with tolerability or an adverse event that prevents dose escalation, the 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_843166]. If titration is slowed in order to 
accommodate to adverse effects, but tolerability is subsequently achieved, the duration of the 
trial can be extended. In addition, the visit window can be increased or decreased (by 3 - 4 days 
in either direction) as clinically warranted.   
6.4.5. Clinical emergencies: Clinical  emergencies are defined as any situation where a subject 
expresses or shows: 1) potential for harmful behavior (to self or other), such as suicidal ideation 
or behavior or threat of violence/homicide; 2) serious emotional distress; or 3) impairment of 
reality testing (e.g., unable to communicate coherently, illogical response, hallucinations). If a 
subject manifests behaviors that constitute a clinical emergency either during an interview or at 
another time, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_843167] a thorough review of the situation. If it is deemed that further or 
additional interventions are required that cannot be offered by [CONTACT_1758], an appropriate referral 
will be made. This study also uses a procedure called ASAP (Adjunct Services/ Attrition 
Prevention) utilized in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD93, which offers 
two sessions of
 supportive, non-directive counseling and/or problem solving for patients who 
experience difficulties in the trial, which require emergent intervention but do not reach the 
threshold for referral to an outside provider. Often, this procedure helps youth and parents to 
make a plan during an immediate crisis period, without having to drop out of the trial.  However, 
we will encourage participants to drop out if there are substantive clinical problems of an 
emergent or time sensitive nature that cannot be addressed within the trial. 
6.4.6. Discontinuation from the study:   Subjects may withdraw at any time or be withdrawn 
should contraindications to 
continued participation develop. Subjects will be terminated early if 
there is: 1) Intolerance to study drug that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_29874]; 2) worsening 
of symptoms which poses serious risks to the subject or others; 3) significant medical or 
psychiatric complications, even if not related to the study drug. 
6.4.7. Poor Adherence:   We track medication dispensed, taken and returned at each visit.  
Subjects who are 
non-adherent are counseled regarding proper use of the medication. Subjects 
who are repeatedly non-compliant may be withdrawn from study. In our experience, this rarely is 
necessary. 
6.4.8. Dropouts:   Subjects who do not complete at least 3 weeks of randomized medication are 
considered dropouts. Subjects 
who prematurely discontinue the trial will be encouraged to 
complete their fMRI scan.
6.4.9.  Clinical Support/Back-up:
As in all our studies, we routinely have clinical back-up available, so that if necessary, a 
psychiatric consultation can 
be arranged immediately, especially in cases of suicidal or 
homicidal concern. All interviewers will be thoroughly trained in appropriate response to 
reported or otherwise presented clinical issues. Also, during MRI procedures, Drs. Newcorn and

Ivanov (Co-PIs on this protocol) will be available for immediate consultation, if necessary. In 
cases of suspected abuse, the interviewer will obtain specific information, which will then be 
transmitted to the Principal Investigators, who will consult and decide what action must be 
taken. We will also provide all study parents with a list of local mental health/substance abuse 
services and family support organizations. 
We have a well-established protocol for addressing situations that may indicate an issue of 
clinical concern, or 
which may pose a threat of harm to either the youth or the parent. If a threat 
of harm to the child is reported, the parent will be told before leaving the Study Center. If the 
threat is urgent (e.g., current suicidality or threat of violence), one of the study clinicians may be 
called directly to intervene. If need be, the family may be referred to the Mount Sinai emergency 
room. All cases involving past or present threat of harm to a minor child (e.g., suicidality, 
bullying), even if help has been obtained, are discussed with the parent. In all cases of clinical 
concern, interviewers must fill out a clinical report before leaving the Study Center and, if the 
issue is not urgent, must contact [CONTACT_843198] [ADDRESS_1171807] the study team clinicians, who then 
call the family directly. In cases of suspected abuse, the Principal Investigator(s) will consult and 
decide to see what action should be taken. In cases where a participant may become distressed 
during the interview, they will be offered the opportunity to stop the interview for a while or, if 
they wish, to complete the interview at another time. If they wish, they can also speak with one 
of the study administrators and/or clinicians.
Drs. Newcorn and Ivanov (the study Co-PIs) have established relations with the Child 
Psychiatry Consultation Liaison, the Psychiatric ER and the Child and Adolescent inpatient 
services and will personally facilitate the needed assessment and procedures including 
emergency room evaluations to establish child’s safety and possible emergency admissions if 
that is indicated. 
In addition, our team has developed a network of referral sources for youths in need for 
treatment, including both prevention and treatment agencies within the Mount Sinai Health Care 
system and in the larger [LOCATION_001] City area. Therefore, any individual case of reporting and/or 
manifesting a need for prevention or treatment services would get individually tailored referral 
meeting his/her and the family needs. 
6.5.  Risks associated with MRI scanning:   There are few serious risks associated with the 
MRI procedure.  The
 best protection against these risks is having a well-trained staff who are 
comfortable working with children and who are familiar with MRI procedures and working in the 
imaging environment.  Participants will be carefully screened to insure that they have no metal 
implants or other characteristics that would preclude MRI scanning.  In addition, prior to the 
scan, all metal jewelry, body pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], hairclips, belts, etc. will be removed, as well as, wallets, 
keys and any other objects that represent a potential risk in the highly magnetized MRI 
environment.  Staff will also be well-versed in ethical standards and will be instructed that if a 
participant wants to terminate the study, that is what should be done.  We use cartoon images 
as stimuli during the functional scans, and play cartoons or movies for the children during 
anatomical scans.  This tends to increase the level of engagement. The children will enter the 
scanner in the presence of their parents, and the procedures will be explained to them while 
they are being prepped for scanning. In addition, participants will be given time to acclimate to 
the scanner. There is always at least one member of the study staff present with a child during a 
scan; in cases where scanning is anticipated to be less easily negotiated, [ADDRESS_1171808] had an opportunity to 
acclimate to the fMRI procedures prior to the day of the scan through participation in a “mock

scan” procedure – which simulates the fMRI experience.  
The MRI 
portion of the study presents possible minimal risks. Though for most people the MRI 
presents very few
 physical risks, certain factors may increase the risk. MRI scanning has been 
demonstrated to have potentially negative effects when performed on people who have metal-
based tattoos (although this is not a problem with recently obtained tattoos), transdermal 
patches, or metallic objects or electronics that cannot be removed (for instance, metal fillings, 
internal electronic devices, etc.). Persons with such risk factors (except non-reactive tattoos) 
must be appropriately screened and excluded from completing the study because participation 
might be dangerous for them. For those subjects who do not possess the above 
contraindications for scanning, the risks posed from MRI scanning are of two types: 1) potential 
discomfort or distress during scanning, and 2) the possibility of anatomic abnormalities being 
discovered in the course of scanning (See #5 below). The first risk—fear or discomfort from 
scanning—is generally greater for young people than for adults. However, we are very 
experienced in scanning children, and we have developed a very child-friendly facility and 
scanning protocol. Still, it is possible that some subjects might experience minor distress by [CONTACT_843199]. This possibility will be minimized, first by 
[CONTACT_843200] a mock scanner, where the rules for the tasks will be 
explained and the experience of being in a scanner will be simulated (e.g. playing scanner 
noises) to acclimate the child to the scanner environment. Other strategies include requirement 
of inserting ear protective devices, using a mirror that enables a view outside the scanner, and 
using experienced technicians who will monitor all subjects for distress and reassure 
participants when necessary. In the event that a participant becomes anxious during a scan, the 
study will be halted. Participants will be able to communicate with the technician at all times 
using the intercom system should they have concerns or questions during the procedure or to 
request that a scan be terminated or suspended. The subject will be in full view of the operator 
at all times. Additionally, participants with fear of enclosed spaces will be excluded from the 
study. 
The risks from the scanner itself can be classified into one of five categories: a) Acoustic Noise 
Levels, b) Gradient 
or Time-Varying Magnetic Fields, c) Radiofrequency (RF) Magnetic Fields, 
d) Static Magnetic Fields, and e) Other.
i) Acoustic Noise Levels : The acoustic noise associated with MR imaging is related to the
mechanical movement of the gradient coils during the scanning process. The acoustic noise
levels perceived by [CONTACT_843201] 3.0 Tesla magnet
constitutes a non-significant risk; specifically, our system will not be operated in a way that will
present more noise to human subjects than is recommended by [CONTACT_843202].
ii) Time-Varying Magnetic Fields: The concern about the time-varying magnetic fields used in
MRI is that these can, in some instances, induce stimulation of peripheral nerves, thereby
[CONTACT_843203] 'twitching' or 'tingling.’ In very rare instances, this nerve
stimulation can be painful. The gradients used in our Skyra 3.[ADDRESS_1171809] that poses non-significant risk to the
participant.
iii) Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): MRI scanning induces some heating of body tissues. This
specific absorption rate (SAR) that determines heating is the amount of radiofrequency (RF)
Contact [CONTACT_4002]/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H

energy deposited (typi[INVESTIGATOR_58015] a coil or “helmet”-like apparatus placed over the subject’s head) 
per Center volume of tissue per Center time. The SAR for RF radiation is primarily related to the 
amplitude of RF power, the duration of the RF pulse, the type of RF coil used, the frequency of 
RF radiation, the resistivity of the tissue, the configuration of the anatomical region being 
examined, and several other parameters. FDA Guidelines:  "The following are levels of concern 
at which the 
reviewer shall exercise appropriate actions to ensure that the safety of the device is 
substantially equivalent to a predicate device: A) If SAR = 0.4 W/kg whole body; and if SAR= 
8.0 W/kg spatial peak in any 1 gram of tissue; and if SAR = 3.2 W/kg averaged over the head: 
below level of concern. Or B) If exposure to radiofrequency magnetic fields is insufficient to 
produce a core temperature increase in excess of 1°C and localized heating to greater than 
38°C in the head, 39°C in the trunk and 40°C in the extremities: below level of concern. The 
parameter SAR cited above must be shown to fall below either of the two levels of concern by 
[CONTACT_843204]."  Because all experiments performed on the 3.[ADDRESS_1171810], this criterion for classification of NSR is satisfied.
iv) Static Magnetic Fields: The possible risks of static magnetic fields have received much
attention in the lay press, but scientific consensus on these risks has yet to be fully reached.
The FDA has deemed that systems operating at 8.[ADDRESS_1171811]. Children with these objects will be identified, as described above, and
excluded from the scan.
This category of risk applies to work conducted around superconducting magnets of any kind 
(including standard clinical diagnostic MRI Centers). It is not unique to our 3.[ADDRESS_1171812] been considered to 
represent a non-significant risk by [CONTACT_1622]. The static magnetic field of our system (3.0 Tesla) 
is therefore to be classified as posing non-significant risk to human subjects.
v) Other Potential Risks: The physical confinement and isolation produced by [CONTACT_843205], although in our past experience, subjects generally tolerate the
procedures well.
vi) Incidental findings on MRI: Another possible risk stems from incidental findings that might be
detected during scanning. The probability of an incidental finding that might lead to the
diagnosis of an unknown abnormality is greater than zero. All subjects will be alerted to this
possibility during the consent process. Though the type of scan used does not, in general, give
adequate information for a clinical quality-read (of which subjects will be informed), if the MRI
technologist or experimenter sees something concerning, a radiologist will read the scan for
potential gross abnormalities and will report any such findings to the PI, so that the subject may
be notified in a timely and appropriate fashion. If an incidental finding arises, parents will be
advised to consult with their child’s physician for further evaluation.
If a subject is injured as a result of participation in this research study, emergency care, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and outpatient 
care will be made available by [CONTACT_843206]/family as medical expenses. No money will be provided by [CONTACT_843207] a research-related injury. See also “Protection against Risk”

consent, protocol violations, the occurrence and handling of adverse events, and patient outcomes. This 
information will be provided for review by [CONTACT_600979]. The DSMB will review this information in 
blinded fashion; randomization codes will only be examined if there is serious consideration of altering the 
study design in any way. The DSMB review protects subjects because it oversees the implementation of good 
clinical and research practices, and monitors the safety of the trial. The DSMB will meet annually and write a 
report to describe its findings. This report will be shared with the site PIs and filed with the IRB. 
6.7.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
a) External DSMB
A DSMB will be put in place to review the conduct and safety considerations of the trial.
b)
Composition of the DSMB
The committee for the clinical trial will consist of two clinical researchers who are not directly involved in this 
project and who have no stake in the outcome of the study. The two members of the DSMB will be 
psychiatrists who have extensive experience with clinical trials with stimulant and non-stimulant medications for 
ADHD, and expertise in incorporating fMRI biomarkers into these trials. DSMB members will be compliant with 
OMB guidelines, will not be employees of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and will have no conflict of 
interest with this research.
c) Procedures and Responsibilities of the DSMB
Two to four weeks prior to  each DSMB meeting, the senior coordinator and data manager will prepare a report 
to be reviewed during that meeting, under the direction and supervision of the PIs. The report will include the 
number of participants who signed consent for the study and were randomized, the number of post-
randomization dropouts, reasons for these dropouts, and any safety concerns, adverse events, etc. An up-to-
date consent form will be provided, as well as a summary of measures taken to protect confidentiality (e.g., 
data and tape storage, use of coded ID numbers, etc.)  The Study Coordinators will also prepare a report 
summarizing any new data/evidence that might alter the risk/benefit ratio for participating in the study (e.g., 
newly published studies, etc.)  Data will be presented to the DSMB in such a way as to maintain patient 
confidentiality.
The DSMB will meet via conference call yearly.  At an initial meeting, the DSMB will review the research 
protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring. The DSMB will issue an annual report that summarizes:
(1) All serious and unexpected adverse events (for example, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838206]) or other
unanticipated problems that 
involve risk to study participants or others, and whether these appeared related to
the study-based interventions or research assessment protocols. Reports will not specifically disclose the
treatment arm of the study unless this disclosure is required for safety reasons.  Note that any serious adverse
event (SAE) will be reported to the local IRBs and to the DSMB within a [ADDRESS_1171815]
regulations.
(2) The committee’s judgments as to whether participants’ safety, privacy, and confidentiality have been
consistently assured by [CONTACT_473];
(3)
The committee’s review of the study’s progress toward recruitment goals and participant retention/attrition
rates;
(4) Its 
review of new scientific literature pertinent to the safety of participants or the ethics of research
participation (for example, new therapeutic or imaging developments);
(5) Its recommendations as to whether risk/benefit ratios have changed to the extent that the trial should be
modified or discontinued. Specific recommendations for protocol modifications will be elaborated, with the
accompanying rationale for each.
The DSMB reports will be filed with the PIs, who will file them immediately with the IRB. This information is also 
included in the annual progress report to NIH. The reports will enumerate the dates that the committee met and 
its explicit procedures for monitoring participants’ safety and confidentiality, and data integrity during the

project. 
6.8. Safety Monitoring Plan:  This protocol presents minor increase over minimal risk to the subjects. The 
medications to be used in the study are well-established and considered to be safe; serious adverse events 
are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, they will be reported in writing within 24 hours 
to the local IRB. The initial SAE report will be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a completed SAE report to both 
institutions. In the event that a participant either withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to 
discontinue a participant due to an SAE, the participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_427160] 1) a resolution is reached, i.e., the problem requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673440], 2) the SAE is determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or 
3) the SAE results in death. Outcome of SAEs will be periodically reported to NIDA. A summary of the SAEs
that occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to NIH.
The PIs will be responsible for evaluating the adverse events and study data at regular intervals and determine 
whether the adverse 
event affects the Risk/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol 
or consent form are required. During the review process, the PIs will evaluate whether the study should 
continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, continue or close to enrollment. Either the PIs or the 
IRB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications. The review of all adverse events

4.1. Brief Summary
Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD)  
 are known to have elevated risk for adolescent-onset substance use disorders (SUD), and those with comorbid ADHD +  
 ODD/CD are at greatest risk.  Stimulant medications such as extended release mixed amphetamine salts (MAS-XR) and  
 non-stimulant medications (e.g. atomoxetine or guanfacine) have established efficacy for ADHD and are also beneficial for  
 ODD/CD. However, stimulants have direct effects on the brain reward system, and abnormal reward processing is thought to  
 mediate addiction vulnerability. Although longitudinal studies have not shown increased SUD risk in youth with ADHD treated  
 with stimulants, it remains unknown whether stimulants might have differential effects on reward processing in high risk (HR)  
 vs. low risk (LR) populations.   
fMRI offers a cost effective method of evaluating covert effects of stimulant medications for youth with ADHD and SUD risk by  
 [CONTACT_206287]- to post-treatment changes in activation in the brain reward system that predate exposure to drugs of abuse.  
 This approach is supported by [CONTACT_843212], which indicate altered (mostly elevated) sensitivity in the reward system  
 in youth at-risk for SUD; high activation in the reward system has in turn been linked to problem drug use. However, to date,  
 no study has examined changes in the reward system with stimulant treatment in youth with ADHD and high vs. low risk  
 for SUD, who have never been exposed to stimulant treatment or drugs of abuse. Such research could provide important  
 knowledge regarding the biological basis of addiction vulnerability and guide treatment selection.        
Our team is in an excellent position to study differences in activation in the brain reward system during fMRI before and after   
treatment with MAS-XR in young children ( 7-12 years old) with ADHD, who are naïve to both stimulant treatment and drugs   
of abuse, divided into LR (i.e., ADHD only) and HR (i.e., ADHD + ODD/CD) groups. We will confirm that youth with ADHD/HR 
status have exaggerated activation in the reward network compared to ADHD/LR youth and controls, and test competing   
hypotheses regarding the effects of the two medications on the brain reward system, and across the different risk groups.   
This protocol is innovative in its approach to study young, drug-naïve children at various levels of SUD risk, and is highly   
significant in its use of neuroimaging to delineate possible differential effects of stimulant and non-stimulant medications on   
reward processing in youth with ADHD and HR vs. LR for SUD as a biomarker of treatment-related risk. This research will   
substantially advance our understanding of the biological basis of vulnerability for addiction, and aid in the development of   
treatment recommendations for youth with ADHD and varying levels of SUD risk.
4.2. Study Design
4.2.a. Narrative Study Description
Childhood ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are considered risk  
 factors for subsequent substance abuse, and youth with both ADHD and ODD/CD are at greatest risk. However, the  
 effects of treatment of ADHD with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate (MPH) and mixed amphetamine salts  
 (MAS) on risk for substance abuse are poorly understood. We propose to use fMRI to study the effects of extended   
release mixed amphetamine salts (MAS-XR) in drug-naïve youth 7-12 years at low risk (i.e., ADHD only) and high risk   
(i.e., ADHD + ODD/CD) for substance abuse on the brain reward system, to better understand the potential impact of   
these medications on an aspect of brain functioning which is thought to underlie vulnerability to substance abuse.

Type Name [CONTACT_843218] a
behavioral 'ACR' taskPre and Post [ADDRESS_1171818] outcome. It consists of four 32-trial
blocks, each 6 minutes long. There are 2 cue
types (reward/non-reward) followed by [CONTACT_424979]/
incongruent flankers: both cue and flanker trials
are counterbalanced and are fully orthogonal.
Participants are required to respond as quickly as
they can to the direction of the central arrowhead
while ignoring the flankers. Correct responses in
trials beginning with reward cues yield $[ADDRESS_1171819] or slow responses are followed by a $1
loss. The ACR task provides only 25% money
wins and introduces reward violation (unexpected
non reward) in 25% of the trials, which results in
strongly engagement of the insula, ACC and also
putamen predominantly during reward outcomes.

system in youth with ADHD only (LR) vs. ADHD + CD or severe ODD (HR). We will study 36 
treatment- and drug-naïve youth (18 per risk group) ages 7 – 12 years. LR and HR subjects will 
be assessed with clinical and neuropsychological measures and will be subjected to fMRI scans 
twice – before and after 3 weeks of treatment with mixed amphetamine salts- extended release 
(MAS-XR). The fMRI scans will be conducted while participants perform the Anticipation, 
Reward, Conflict (ACR) task developed by [CONTACT_27156], which has a unique component of 
unexpected non-reward. Combining prediction error analyses with purported activation 
differences on this particular component of the ACR will offer a never before explored approach 
to assess differences between youth at different risk levels for SUD. Importantly, our event-
related design will distinguish increased effort and associated anticipatory activation (a positive 
effect) from increased hedonics of reward (a potentially deleterious effect).
Study design 
This is an open label trial which will recruit two groups of drug naïve youth ages 7-12. The Low 
Risk (LR) group will consist of children diagnosed with ADHD only and the High Risk (HR) group 
will consist of children diagnosed with ADHD and severe ODD or CD. Both groups will receive 
treatment with Mixed Amphetamine slats (MAS-XR) and will undergo two fMRI scans – the first 
scan will be performed before treatment and the second will be performed after [ADDRESS_1171821]  line medication for 
the treatment of ADHD and has known abuse potential
Study Period  I: Screening/baseline (Visits 1–2).  The 1st and 2nd visits  both involve assessment; 
the 2nd visit also includes  the baseline fMRI  scan.  Subjects will have a “mock scan”  at the 1st 
visit, following established guidelines.  We anticipate that  the assessment procedures can be 
completed in 2 study visits within 14 days.  The screening period can  be lengthened  to 
accommodate washout of a non-stimulant drug if this is required. 
Study Period II: 2 Week Treatment  Block (Days 0 to 21).  Subjects will  receive open label 
treatment with MAS-XR  for 3 weeks.  Medication  will be titrated  using a fixed dose approach, 
with doses  that mimic those used in clinical practice. The two  assigned  doses are 0.25 mg/kg 
and 0.5 mg/kg, with an option  to increase to  1.0 mg/kg if needed. At study completion, 
participants will complete the post-treatment fMRI scan and all clinical measures. There will be 2 
visits during this period - one after 1 week of treatment and one at 3 weeks (EOT). There will be 
a phone visit at  the end of the  second  treatment week, though  subjects can  be seen if 
necessary.  
Study medication and  medication administration.  Subject  treated with  non-stimulants  will be 
required to be off medication for 2 weeks prior to scan. We will purchase MAS–XR, an extended 
release generic amphetamine formulation. Subjects will begin at 0.25 mg/kg and increase to 0.[ADDRESS_1171822] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H

mg/kg after one week. This dose can be reached (within ~5 mg) using 2 capsules of 
commercially available doses. Those who cannot increase the dose due to AEs will be allowed 
to maintain their dose and be evaluated for a dose increase after 2 weeks. Subjects who 
experience difficulty with symptom control can titrate to a higher dose if need be (maximum 1 
mg/kg). Subjects who increase their dose and experience AEs will be allowed to lower their 
dose. Subjects will receive MAS–XR on the day of the second scan approximately 6-8hrs before 
scan. 
Data Analysis
First level (within-subject) analyses will be conducted for each participant with a general linear 
model (GLM) to
 quantify the relationship between the observed event-related BOLD signals and 
regressors encoding expected trial-specific responses. The design matrix will be comprised of 
12 regressors: 2 for cue (reward vs. non-reward) x 2 for target type (congruent or incongruent 
flankers) x 3 for outcome-related effects (reward, non-reward, punishment). There are [ADDRESS_1171823]: reward following reward cue, non-reward following reward cue, 
non-reward following non-reward cue, or punishment for an incorrect/missing response.
Group-level Statistical Analysis.   Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations (SD), 
etc.) for all variables of interest will be computed and compared by [CONTACT_15914] t test for continuous 
variables or Chi-square test for categorical variables. Group statistical analyses of the imaging 
data will be performed using a GLM from SPM. The GLM is written as Y=XB+E, where Y is a 
matrix with a series of multivariate measurements, X is a design matrix, B is a matrix containing 
parameters that are usually to be estimated and E is a matrix containing errors or noise. The 
errors are usually assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution 
Primary Aim. We will test two hypotheses: 1a)  the HR group  will show  greater  baseline 
activation  than LR (during  the ACR  task)  in the insula,  putamen,  and ACC);  1b) MAS-XR 
treatment  will reduce  the activation  in the brain  reward  system  for both groups,  possibly  in 
greater  magnitude  for HR. We will run F-tests of the voxel-based whole brain activation pattern 
with ANCOVA controlling 
for time (baseline, post-treatment) with two groups (HR, LR) with age, 
sex, IQ and medication dose level included as covariates. We will run independent t-test to 
compare activation at baseline and at and of treatment between HR vs. LR participants. The 
voxel-based Z statistic images will be thresholded using clusters determined by Z>2.3 and a 
cluster corrected significance threshold of p<0.05. 
Exploratory Aim.  We will conduct correlation analyses between pre to post- treatment 
measures of activation 
in the reward system and scores on the behavioral measures collected 
outside the scanner (i.e., Kirby, BIS/BAS, UPPS) to examine the direction and magnitude of 
correlations between brain function and behavior. 
Power analyses.  The main power considerations for the primary aim are related to the ability to 
detect differences in 
activation between the two groups pre- to post treatment. We estimated 
power using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 draws per model), with α = 0.05, for all models. 
With a between subjects factor (2-levels; LR, HR) and 4 covariates (age, sex, IQ, dose level), 
we were able to recover large effects sizes (f = .80-1.0) for the between group factor with [ADDRESS_1171824] sizes of 
d =.2-3 with 4-5 independent nuisance covariates (age, sex, IQ, does), and baseline covariates 
with a correlation of .[ADDRESS_1171825] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_709311], Jeffrey H

Dissemination plan 
The Co-Principal Investigators are committed to the development of large, shared data bases 
which can be used to study the
 neurobiological basis of substance abuse risk. This is very much 
in line with the current efforts of NIDA to launch the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 
(ABCD) Study, which we feel the proposed research will complement and augment. We 
appreciate that the public dissemination of our scientific results will potentially facilitate the 
creation of collaborative efforts, with outside investigators playing an important role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_843169]. Research data will be shared 
according to the most recent NIH guidelines (http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/rt_guide_final.html). 
We are mindful that the rights and privacy of people who participate in research must be 
protected at all times, that
 there is the need to protect patentable and other proprietary data, 
and that restrictions on data sharing may be imposed by [CONTACT_182838]. In this 
regard, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is and will remain HIPAA compliant, and 
therefore any datasets resulting from human participant research will be free of any identifiers 
that would permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to 
deductive disclosure of individual subjects. 
Timelines for distribution of data will vary depending on the nature of the data to be shared and 
any required restrictions. In addition to communication
 channels such as speaking 
engagements and publications, data may be distributed by a number of electronic methods, 
including web-based databases, datasets, and spreadsheets, or via electronic media such as 
CDs, DVDs, and tape. The method(s) of distribution employed will be determined at a later date.

2.2 Background & 
Rationale , 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data  
 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a mechanical circulatory support 
device u sed temporary in critically ill patients with heart and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_399926]. Briefly, ECMO is a form of 
cardiopulmonary life -support where blood is extracted from the vascular system (i.e., 
peripheral or cent ral vein) and circulated by a mechanical pump while it is 
oxygenated and re -infused into the patient’s circulation.   ECMO can be used in two 
different configurations depending on the patient’s requirement: veno -venous (VV -
ECMO) when only respi[INVESTIGATOR_399927] -arterial (VA -ECMO) for 
cardiac and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (1). Although controversial until 2009, t he clinical 
benefit of ECMO therapy was substantiated  when the CESAR study, a multicent er, 
randomized controlled trial that included adult patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
demonstrated an increased survival without disability at 6 -month follow -up (2). Since 
then, ECMO has been increasingly used worldwide in pediatric and adult patients, 
and remarkable technological improvements (e.g., innovative device design, 
cannula , oxygenators) have been made , resulting in improved clinical outcomes (3). 
 
At our large tertiary care trauma center, we perform VV -ECMO or VA -ECMO in an 
increasing number of critically ill adult patients each year ( n=60 in 2019). With more 
adult patients receiving ECMO support, there is a need to u nderstand how ECMO 
circuits affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) and disposition of drugs. ECMO is not a 
disease -modifying treatment, and its effectiveness relies on the effect of other 
interventions , such as antibiotics in patients with severe infections wher e optimal 
exposure is crucial for treatment success. It is well known that critically ill patients 
may experience alterations in antibiotic  PK, and as a result,  dosing modifications are 
generally required (4). Multiple in vitro  and in vivo studies have shown that ECMO 
may further alter the PK of certain antibiotics by [CONTACT_399929] (5). Intrinsic drug 
properties such as lipop hilicity and protein binding appear to be pre dictive of this 
artificial loss, presumably due to drug adsorption and sequestration within the 
oxygenator circuit, increases in compensatory volume of distribution and even 
changes  in total body clearance (6-9). However, these specific drug properties may 
      MISP: Protocol  3 Version :  07/07/2021  not always be predictive; a recent ex vivo study with ceftolozane observed 92% loss 
in the circuit over 24 hours even though this antibiotic is neither lipophilic nor h ighly 
protein bound (10).  Other factors related with the ECMO circuit itself such as the 
type of pump and presence of oxygenator ha ve been also associated with antibiotic 
loss (9,10) .  In contrast, some investigators largely conclude that antibiotic 
exposures are minimally altered by [CONTACT_399930] (11-13). In light of this 
inconsistent data, the sequestration and clinical PK of individual antibiotics should be 
assessed to confirm optimal dosing in this patient popu lation.  
 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam (Recarbrio®, [COMPANY_006] & Co, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) is a 
novel carbapenem/β -lactamase inhibitor combination recently approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam has enhanced 
activity against multidrug resistant Gram -negative bacteri a, including imipenem  
resistant strains (14). As a result of its potent activity against multidrug -resistant 
pathogens, it is reasonable to surmise that imipen em/cilastatin/relebactam will be 
prescribed to treat serious infections in critically ill patients, including those who are 
supported on ECMO. Optimizing the dosing regimen in critically ill patients receiving 
ECMO will be paramount to achieving successful  clinical response and minimizing 
the risk of resistance development. Both imipenem and relebactam have low protein 
binding (~20%) and low octanoal/partition coefficients (Log P: -3.8 to -0.86 and -3.1 
to -1.1, respectively), which suggests that drug dispo sition should be minimally 
affected by [CONTACT_119927] (15-17). However, Jaruratanasirikul and colleagues compared 
imipenem PK parameters between 10 critically ill patients on ECMO and 18 similarly 
ill patients not supported by [CONTACT_119927] (18). They observed that ECMO, or the 
underlying physiological state produced by [CONTACT_13114], resulted in a significantly higher total 
volume of distribution (33.4 ± 13.9 L vs. 21.3 ± 15.0 L) and significantly lower  total 
body clearance (10.0 ± 10.5 L/h vs. 21.5 ± 9.6 L/h). The authors suggest that these 
alterations may require dosing modifications (i.e., 1 g q6h) to maintain optimal 
pharm acodynamic exposure . It should be noted, however, that the PK parameters in 
the studied ECMO patients were within the range of imipenem PK values observed 
in other critically ill patients without ECMO, suggesting that the patients may not 
have been evenly matched  for comparison  (19). Moreover, there are currently no 
data evaluating the disposition of relebactam in patients supported by [CONTACT_119927]. We 
propose a clinical pharmacokinetic  study  to determine imipenem and relebactam 
exposure  in critically ill patients supported by [CONTACT_119927].  
 
2.3 Study Design  
 The study will be a prospec tive, open -label, single -center, phase 1b PK study of 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in eight  critically ill adult patients receiving ECMO 
support at Hartford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. PK analyses will be conducted to assess exposure 
attainment in these eight  ECMO patient s. 
 
The study protocol and informed consent documents will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) at Hartford H ealthcare .   All study 
subjects, or their next of kin, will be required to provide written consent in order to 
particip ate in the study. Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam will not be given as a 
treatment. Therefore, all patients will receive other antibiotics as necessary to treat 
any ongoing infection if present.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_504074]. ECMO is prescribed in ap proximately 60 critically ill adult patients each 
year, split between  use of VV -ECMO and VA -ECMO.    We anticipate t hat the 
      MISP: Protocol  4 Version :  07/07/2021  majority of patients with sepsis who qualify for this study to be receiving VV -ECMO.  
 
Study population  
The study population will include eight  critically ill adult patients (>/= 18 years of age) 
receiving ECMO support in the medical or surgical int ensive care units at Hartford 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients with documented or presumed  infection are eligible. Any patient 
with infection will be treated with standard antibiotics by [CONTACT_399931]. To 
ensure representation of patients across the renal funct ion spectrum to be included

Multiply by 0.85 for female patients  
 
a Ideal body weight (IBW, kg): Males = 50 + [2.3 × (Height (in) - 60)]; Females = 45.5 
+ [2.3 × (Height (in) - 60)] 
b For patients with total body weight (TBW) that is greater than 20% over  IBW, use 
adjusted body weight (ABW, kg): IBW + 0.4*(TBW -IBW)  
c If TBW is less than IBW, use TBW in equation  
 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam Administration  
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam will be dosed according to current prescribing 
information based on c reatinine clearance (20). Four to six doses of 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam , each infused over 0.5 hours,  will be admin istered to 
achieve steady -state . The dose will be prepared according to manufacturer 
recommendations in precisely 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride.  
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam must be administered through a perip heral 
intravenous catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter, central line, or port -a-
catheter, whichever is determined to be most appropriate by [CONTACT_399934].  Participants will also receive standard 
intravenous antibiotic therapy (excluding generic or branded intravenous imipenem) 
to treat their suspected infection, as determined by [CONTACT_399935].  No 
      MISP: Protocol  6 Version :  07/07/2021  other intravenous medications will b e co -administered with 
imipenem/cilastatin/ relebactam.  
 
 
Study Day 1  
• Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be 
recorded within 15 minutes prior to starting the study drug infusion.  
• Participants will receive imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam as described above. 
Exact start a nd stop times will be recorded in military time.   
• Identify, assess, and record any new adverse events or Serious Adverse 
Events (SAE)  
• Concomitant medications will be recorded.  
• Blood samples will be collected as described below.  
 
Study Day 2  
• Participants w ill receive imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam as described above. 
Exact start and stop times will be recorded in military time.   
• Blood samples will be collected as described below.  
• Concomitant medications will be recorded.  
• Clinical Assessments:  
• Perform a com plete physical examination  
• Record resting pulse, blood pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; oxygen saturation 
(by [CONTACT_7852]), including rate of supplemental oxygen (i.e., FiO2); 
ventilator support; and highest (or lowest if hypothermia) daily temperature 
(oral, rectal, tympanic, or core) measured  
• Identify, assess, and record any new adverse ev ents or SAE  
• Laboratory Assessments:  
• Collect the following labs within [ADDRESS_504078] blood 
sample collection: serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,  glucose, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, albumin, total protein, complete blood 
count (CBC) with differential, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphate, alanine aminotransferase, aspartame aminotransferase, and 
urine analysis with m icroscopy.   
 
Sample Collection  
Blood sampl es (4 mL) will be collected in  K2EDTA vacutainer s before the first 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam dose (i.e., blank), and at 0.[ADDRESS_504079] dose, and then at 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 ho urs after the start of the 
final dose, when concentrations are expected to be at steady -state. All b lood 
samples will be collected pre -oxygenator. Additionally, protein bindin g will be 
determined at the 0.5 hour time  point of the final dose. The timing of all blood 
samples should be +/ - 5 minutes of protocol defined time, except for the 0.5 hour 
(peak  concentration), which can be + 5 minutes the end of infusion and should be 
collected as close to the end of the infusion as possible.  
 
Processing of clinical samples  
Blood samples  will be immediately stored on ice and centrifuged within 30 minutes 
of collection at 4º C and 1 300 x g for 10 minutes to separate the plasma. 
Immediately after centrifugation, 1.0 mL of plasma from each sample will be 
transferred (usi ng a 1.0 mL pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]) to a previously labeled cryovial containing 1.0 
mL of plasma stabilizer (2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)). A second 1.0 
mL of plasma will be added to a second cryovial (labeled with stabilizer) to have a 
back -up sample. Ther eafter, cryovials will be capped and inverted at least six times 
to mix the pl asma with the stabilizer. T he cryovials will be stored at -80º C until 
concentration determination. No more than 60 minutes should elapse between the 
blood draw and freezing of p lasma sample.  
      MISP: Protocol  7 Version :  07/07/2021   
Protein Binding determination  
An additional 10ml blood sample  will be collected for imipenem and relebactam 
protein binding determination at time points described above . Plasma will be 
separated by [CONTACT_399936]. Ap proximately 0.9 mL of plasma 
will be loaded in an ultrafiltration device (Centrifree®, [COMPANY_006] Millipore Ltd., Ireland) 
and centrifuged for 45 minutes at 10º C at 2,000 x g to obtain an ultrafiltrate 
containing only  free-drug concentrations. Protein binding will be conducted in 
triplicate.  The ultrafiltrate volume will be measured, transferred to a cryovial and 
then, an equal volume of the stabilizer will be added  (confirmation of processing 
instructions for protein -free imipenem and relebactam will be provi ded by Q2 
Solutions, Ithaca, NY) . The cryovials will be stored at -80º C until concentration 
determination. The final protein percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_399937] 100 (%).

2.7 Statistical 
Analysis and 
Sample Size 
Justification  Data Collection  
Patient demographics, medical/surgical histo ry, concomitant medications, and 
adverse event data will be collected throughout the study on a provided case report 
form.  Protected Health Information (PHI) will be maintained at CAIRD.   
 
Imipenem and Relebactam Concentration Determination  
Cryovials containing plasma and protein free filtrate will be overnight shipped on 
dry ice to Q2 Solutions (Ithaca, NY) for imipenem and relebactam concentration 
determination.  The back -up vial will be shipped separately.  Imipenem and 
relebactam concentrations will b e determined by a liquid chromat ography mass 
spectrometry assay .   
 
 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Non-compartmental  
Non-compartmental modeling will be conducted using WinNonlin (Pharsight 
Corporation, Cary, NC) using the latest version licensed for the laborat ory.  All 
concentration time curves will be plotted for visual inspection.  The following 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated for imipenem and relebactam in each 
of the 8 participants.  The maximum concentration (C max) will be the highest 
concentr ation observed for the concentration time profile of each participant.  The 
time to maximum concentration (T max) will be the observed sampling time of the C max.  
The minimum concentration (C min) will be the lowest concentration observed for the 
concentrati on time profile of each participant that occurs after the observed C max.  
Lambda ( z) will be the resulting slope of the regression line of best fit.  Half -life (T 1/2) 
will be calculated as ln(2)/ z.  Area under the curve for the dosing interval (AUC 0-) 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_1690]/log trapezoidal rule (linear during increasing 
concentrations, log during decreasing concentrations), where  is the dosing interval 
for the drug studied. The AUC to infinity (AUC INF) will be calculated as the AUC 
extrapolat ed to infinity by [CONTACT_8028]: AUC + C last/z. Clearance (CL) will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_50726]/AUC 0-.  The volume of distribution based on the terminal 
elimination phase (V z) will be estimated by [CONTACT_50726]/( z*AUC 0-).   
 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Imipenem  and relebactam concentrations will be co-modeled using the non -
parametric adaptive grid program (NPAG) with adaptive gamma in the Pmetrics 
      MISP: Protocol  8 Version :  07/07/2021  package for R (Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics, Los 
Angeles, CA) using either a one or two  compartment model.  Appropriate model 
selection will be based on visual inspection, observed versus predicted plots, and 
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The effect of specific body size descriptors 
(actual body weight, ideal body weight, body mass ind ex, body surface area) ,  
calculated CrCL , and ECMO flow rate  will be analyzed for correlation with 
pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., CL and volume of distribution).  By [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a 
similar proportion of participants with creatinine clearance above and below  60 
ml/min, a variable range of clearance values will be represented in the population 
analyses.  
 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
The free imipenem and relebactam concentration of each of the eight participants 
will be assessed for free time above the MIC ( fT>MIC , applied for imipenem ) and 
free area under the curve to MIC ( fAUC/MIC , applied for relebactam ) exposure using  
the imipenem susceptibility breakpoint of 2 µg/mL  for Pseudomonas aeruginosa .  
 
Sample Size  
No target sample size is provided statistically as th is will be a descriptive and 
exploratory study.  Therefore, this study will enroll eight  critically ill adult patients on 
ECMO support based primarily on empi[INVESTIGATOR_399928]. This 
number is considered sufficient to meet the study objec tives.

Requirements  Recarbrio® (Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam ) 1.25g vials (n= 50 vials)  
2.9 Adverse 
Experience 
Reporting  Safety and Adverse Event Monitoring  
Participants will be monitored for any sign or symptom of adverse ev ents (AE) 
throughout the course of the study. Unanticipated, life -threatening or fatal adverse 
events will be reported to the IRB, the manufacturer, and the Food and Drug 
Administration according to federal guidelines. All adverse events requiring medical 
attention will be treated by [CONTACT_399938].   For the purpose of this study, an adverse event will be defined as any 
pathologic or unintended change in the structure (signs), function (symptoms), or 
chemistry ( laboratory values) of the body associated with the use of the study drug, 
whether or not considered drug related, and will be categorized as one of the 
following:   
 
• MILD – present, but easily tolerated  
• MODERATE – discomfort that interferes with usual acti vities  
• SEVERE – incapacitating, inability to work or do usual activities  
 
Relationship of the AE to the study medication (i.e., causality) will be evaluated 
according to the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], as one of the following:  
 
• Concurrent condition – unrelated  to study drug  
• REMOTE adverse drug event – little or no temporal relationship to study 
drug 
• POSSIBLE adverse drug event – temporal relationship to study drug  
• PROBABLE adverse drug event – commonly associated with study drug  
• DEFINTE adverse drug event – reappeared on re -challenge of study 
drug 
 
All SAEs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board, sponsor, and the Food 
      MISP: Protocol  9 Version :  07/07/2021  and Drug Administration according to Federal and local guidelines. A serious 
adverse event will be defined as any adverse event that r esults in death, is 
immediately life -threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is an important 
medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the previously mentioned outcomes.

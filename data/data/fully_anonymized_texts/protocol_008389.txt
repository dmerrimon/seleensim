TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  5 2 PRÉCIS  
2.1 Study  Title :  TRAIN- AD ( Trial  to Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home 
residents with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias ) 
2.[ADDRESS_1226342] a cluster randomized controlled trial of an education and training intervention on 
infection management outcomes of 480 residents with advanced dementia (N=240/arm) in 24 
[LOCATION_011]- area nursing homes ( NHs) (N=12/arm).  
2.3 Design and Outcomes  
2.4 Design  
36 month cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)  to evaluate a multicomponent intervention 
that me rges best practices in infectious diseases  and palliative care to improve infection 
management for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_877671] 
(LRIs)  among 480 advanced dementia residents (240/a rm) living in 24 [LOCATION_011] area nursing 
homes (NHs)  (12/arm). Randomization and intervention implementation will be at the facility 
level. Outcomes will be measured at the resident level.   
2.5 Outcomes  
The following 12 -month outcomes related to suspected UTIs and LRIs will be compared 
between the intervention and control arms (usual care):  
PRIMARY OUTCOME :  
I. Total number of antimicrobial courses for suspected UTIs and LRIs/person -year  
 
SECONDARY OUTCOMES:  
II. Number of antimicrobial courses prescribed for suspected UTIs and LRIs when minimal criteria for treatment initiation we re absent based on consensus  guidelines/person- year  
III. Advance care planning about infection management over 12 months  defined as a 
documented discussions between proxies and providers  or a new advance directives to 
withhold antimicrobials  by [CONTACT_877725], int ramuscular, or intravenous.  
IV. Number of burdensome procedures used to evaluate suspected LRIs and UTIs (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410], bladder catheterization, chest x -ray, and blood draws)/person -year.  
2.6 Interventions and Duration  
Each facility will participate for a total of 27 months, including a 3 -month start -up/planning 
period and 24 month intervention implementation (intervention NHs only) and data collection period. Residents will be enrolled during the first 12- months at each facility, and each resident 
will be followed for up to 12 months. 
The intervention has two main components, provider training and proxy education. 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  6 1. Provider Training: Multifaceted approach to education of providers with direct care 
responsibilities for patients with advanced dementia.  Components include:  
a. In-person training 
b. On-line course  
c. Infection management algorithms  
d. Guidelines for communicating  with  proxies  
e. Prescribing feedback  
2. Proxy Education:  A booklet mailed to proxies of residents with advanced dementia 
describing issues related to infection management in a dvanced d ementia upon resident 
enrollment in study.  
2.7 Sample Size and  Population  
The study sample will included 480 NH resident with advanced dementia (N=240/arm). See 
statistical analytic protocol (SAP) for a full explanation of sample size calculations.

5 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
5.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The advanced stage of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is characterized by [CONTACT_877726], which prior work suggests are widely mismanaged. Antimicrobials are extensively 
prescribed, most often without evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main factor leading to multidrug - resistant organisms (MDROs); a g rowing public health 
threat. Moreover, the benefits of antimicrobials remain unclear for patients with advanced dementia, for whom infections are often a terminal event and comfort is most commonly the goal of care.  
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  12 In 2015, our group completed the S tudy of Pathogen R esistance and E xposure to A ntimicrobials 
in Dementia ( SPREAD) which prospectively examined antimicrobial use and MDRO 
acquisition in 363 NH residents with advanced dementia.9, 22 Antimicrobials were prescribed for 
72% of suspected infections, but only 44% of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_877675] -based criteria for 
treatment.[ADDRESS_1226359] (UTIs) and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (LRIs) accounted for 94% 
of mistreated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Criteria were more likely to be met when the residents’ proxies were 
counseled about antimicrobials. Two-  thirds of residents were colonized with MDROs. 
Antimicrobial use was the major risk factor for MDRO acquisition. Motivated by [CONTACT_497969], we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (NIH R21) of a multi -faceted intervention to improve  management of 
suspected UTIs and LRIs. Unlike standard NH antimicrobial stewardship programs .
18,[ADDRESS_1226360] practices in infectious diseases and palliative care, and targeted this 
unique population for whom the need and opportunity to improve infection management are 
particularly compelling.  
5.1.1 Epid emiology  
In the Choices, Attitudes, Strategies and Care of Advanced Dementia (CASCADE) study, led by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mitchell, 41% of participating  NH residents  with advanced dementia had suspected 
pneumonias and 53% had febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_17767] 18 months. 1 In SPREAD, we found 66% of NH 
residents with advanced dementia had suspected infections over [ADDRESS_1226361] often UTIs and 
LRIs. 9 Approximately 50% of advanced dementia patients are di agnosed with pneumonia in the 
last 2 weeks of life.8, 9 The 6 -month mortality rate following pneumonia is 50%. 1, 34 
Antimicrobial use is extensive.6, 8, 35 -37 In prospective studies, 52- 66% of NH residents with 
advanced dementia received antimicrobials ov er 12 months, and 42% in the last 2 weeks of life.9, 
37 Much of this use may be inappropriate as antimicrobials are often started without adequate 
clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. 9-15, 23, 38   Infections are often treated 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_877676] (e.g., cultures). Thus, the Society for 
Healthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_877677].
13  
5.1.2 Advanced dementia patients are reservoirs for multidrug resista nt organisms (MDROs  
The emergence of MDROs is a major public health threat,39-44 and growing concern in NHs.14, 16, 
19, 45 -47 Between 43 -62% of NH residents are colonized with either methicillin -resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin- resistant enteroc occi, or multidrug -resistant gram -negative 
bacteria.48, [ADDRESS_1226362] MDROs than other residents. 17 In 
SPREAD, we found 64% of the cohort was colonized with MDROs over [ADDRESS_1226363] risk factor for MDRO acquisition,49, 51, 53, 60 -64 Thus, 
reducing  antimicrobial misuse in advanced dementia is a key opportunity to limit MDROs 
colonization in the NH setting.  
5.1.3 Benefits and burdens of treatment  
Two potential benefits may motivate treating  suspected infections in advanced dementia; 
prolonging life and sym ptom relief. In the absence of RCTs, observational studies help inform 
decision -making regarding these outcomes.6, 21, [ADDRESS_1226364] on survival.21  
Both the work -up and treatment of infections can be burdensome for these frail patients.69  In 
SPREAD, 74% of suspected infections involved a bladder catheterizati on, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410], 
blood draw, or chest x -ray. [ADDRESS_1226365] align with the goals of care:  
A-quarter of all treatment decisions faced by [CONTACT_877727]. 76 Given the burdens and questionable benefits of antimicrobials, infection 
management should be approached using a framework of shared decision- making similar to 
other end- of-life treatment choices.77-80  This approach requires adherence not only to infecti ous 
disease guidelines, but also to the goals of care (e.g., life prolongation or comfort). In prior work, over 90% of proxies state comfort is the goal of care.
1, 9 For these patients, the burdens of 
assessing and treating infections may outweigh the bene fits, particularly when the likelihood of a 
bacterial infection is low.  
Several features characterize optimal shared decision -making. Ideally, counseling should be done 
as part of advance care planning rather than at the time of a crisis, and preferences documented in advance directives, such as the Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form. 
[ADDRESS_1226366] infections in end- stage disease, apprised of what an 
appropriate evaluation entails, and cautioned about common pi[INVESTIGATOR_877678] (e.g., asymptomatic bacteriuria). The benefits and burdens of evaluating and treating suspected infections should be presented, and the option of a purely palliative approach described (e.g., analgesics, ant ipyretics). Finally, providers should help proxies align the 
management approach with the goal of care. If the goal is to optimize comfort, it is reasonable to suggest that no evaluation be initiated for infections and palliation provided. For the minority  of 
patients for whom the goal remains to prolong life, evaluation and treatment is reasonable but only when there is adequate clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Optimal decision -
making does not routinely occur in practice, but when it doe s, data suggest care is improved. In 
SPREAD, only 45% of proxies were asked about preferences for antimicrobial use, and only 34% were counseled to expect infections or about treatment options. However, when they were counseled, minimal criteria for initia ting antimicrobials were more likely to be met. 
9 
5.1.5 Interventions to improve infection management in advanced dementia:  
The need to improve infection management in the general NH setting is well- recognized, 10, 24 as 
reflected in The Centers for Disease Con trol’s (CDC) recent call to expand antimicrobial 
stewardship activities in NHs.[ADDRESS_1226367] target the  many interacting factors that influence NH care, and engage key 
stakeholders (e.g., medical providers, nurses, families, administrators) in learning, communication, self -monitoring, and on- going adaption. 
86, 87, 91, 92 One pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a quality 
improvement program incorporating these features in 12 NHs significantly reduced antimicrobial prescriptions . 
86, 87  
5.1.6 Summary of significance.  
The significance is summarized as follows: 1. Advanced dementia is a leading cause of death. Most patients receive thei r care in NHs; 2. Advanced dementia residents are commonly 
suspected of having infections, for which antimicrobials are extensively prescribed. Minimal criteria to support a bacterial infection are absent for most treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; 3. These residents are reservoirs for MRDOs. Antimicrobial use is the main risk factor for MDRO colonization; 4. 
As these residents are in the terminal phase of dementia, they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials, especially when the likelihood of a bacterial infection is low; 5. Comfort is the goal of care for > 90% of these residents. The burdens associated with work- up and treatment of 
infections, generally do not promote comfort; 6. Most proxies are not counseled about infection management, but when they are, antimic robials are more likely to be used in accordance with 
guidelines; 7. NH interventions to improve infection management can be successfully tested in RCTs, but to be sustainable they must target the many factors that influence NH care, 8. Traditional NH antimicrobial stewardship programs do not include patient preferences or palliative care principles; and 9. TRAIN -AD builds  on prior work and address the existing  gaps, 
by [CONTACT_877728] -of-the-art methodology for cluster RCTs 
95, [ADDRESS_1226368] 
practices in infectious diseases and palliative care in a unique population for whom the need and opportunity to improve infection management i s especially compelling.  
With this foundation and leveraging a network of NHs and research infrastructure established in 4 prior NIH R01s, TRAIN -AD (Trial to Reduce Antimicrobial Use In Nursing home residents 
with Alzheimer’s disease and other Dementias),  is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
an intervention to improve infection management in advanced dementia. All intervention components integrate infectious disease and palliative care principles.

TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  15 dementia  residin g in 24 (12 Control/12 Intervention) participating [LOCATION_011] area nursing homes .  
The unit of randomization is the facility but the unit of analysis is the patient, clustered within 
the facility. The intervention will be implemented facility -wide, thus all pa tients with advanced 
dementia, cared for in the NHs during the 24- month implementation period are potential subjects 
in this study .  Data will be obtained from bi -monthly chart review of enrolled eligible  residents 
for up to 12 months. 
Outcomes to be compa red between patients in the intervention and control NHs include:  total 
number of antimicrobial courses for suspected UTIs and LRIs/person- year (primary outcome)  
over 12 months in the intervention vs. control (usual care) arms (Aim 1), number of 
antimicro bial courses prescribed for suspected UTIs and LRIs when minimal criteria for 
treatment initiation are absent based on consensus guidelines/person- year (secondary outcome) 
in the intervention vs. control arm over 12 months.(Aim 2), and : i. advance care pl anning about 
infection management (e.g., documented discussions between proxies and providers, advance directives to withhold antimicrobials), and ii. Number of burdensome procedures used to evaluate suspected LRIs and UTIs (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410], bladder cath eterization, chest x -ray, blood

7.1.1 Facility  inclusion criteria  
1) More than 60 beds  
2) Within 60 miles of [LOCATION_011] 
7.1.2 Resident inclusion eligibility  criteria  
• Age > or = to 60 years  
• A diagnosis of dementia (any type)  
• Global Deterioration Scale (G DS) score of 7   
• NH length of stay >90 days  
• An individual who can communicate in English has been formally or informally de signated as a

7.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
7.3.1 Facility Enrollment 
A total of 24 [LOCATION_011] area NHs will be recruited from a pool of 95 eligible NHs in the [LOCATION_011] area. NHs will be recruited,  randomized and enrolled in to the study in groups of 6 (3 Control / 3 
Intervention) every [ADDRESS_1226372] s the NHs’ administrators by [CONTACT_877729] . Face to face meetings to further explain the study are held  with 
administrators upon request.  
One month before the three- month planning period is scheduled to start, the list of 6 newly 
recruited homes will be randomiz ed.  (see SAP f or details on randomization procedures).  
Immediately following randomization, the project director contacts  each facility informing them 
of their study assignment and initiating the 3- month planning procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Facility Randomization and Stratification Procedures:  See SAP  
7.3.[ADDRESS_1226373] obtained an IRB waiver of individual authorization for disclosure of personal health information (PHI) to screen and identify eligible residents.  At the start of the study and every [ADDRESS_1226374] director’s ( PD’s ) 
contact [CONTACT_877730].  In addition, flyers wil l be posted in ALL 
participating facilities (control and intervention) explaining  that the study is being conducted and 
that it includes data collection from the charts of residents with advanced dementia. The flyers will include contact [CONTACT_528351] e PD to ask further questions and an opportunity for 
proxies to “opt -out”.  If proxies  do not contact [CONTACT_877731] , the resident will be 
enrolled  and included in bi -monthly chart review with data abstraction .  
PHI will not be removed from the fa cility. For purposes of recording and tracking eligible 
residents, s tudy IDs will be assigned to eligible residents at the point of eligibility screening.  A 
code  sheet containing the names  associated with assigned  study IDs will be stored in a secure 
location  within the participating NH.  
8 STUDY INTERVENTIONS ADMINISTRATION AND DURATION 
The entire trial will be conducted over. 36 month, each intervention facility will be involved for 
27 months which includes 3 months planning period 24 months of intervention implementation in each intervention  NH (See below) .  At each facility residents will be enrolled for the first [ADDRESS_1226375] infections in advanced dementia patients.  In 
partnership with NH leadership, the intervention is rolled out as a new program within the facility. There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education.  Intervention components aimed at the provider include: Professionally led infection management training seminars, online infection management course, and infection management guidance algorithms.  Additionally participating pres cribing providers will be sent 
bimonthly infection management feedback reports.  Proxy Education is completed by [CONTACT_877732].    
 
8.1 Provider- directed Interventions  
Provider Training: Multifaceted approach to education of providers with direct care 
responsibilities for patients with advanced dementia.  Tr aining initiatives focus on appropriate 
diagnosis and treatment of suspected UTIs and LRIs in patients with advanced dementia.  All 
training initiatives include application of recommended diagnostic criteria, inclusion of goals of care in development of treatment plan, and provider communication training to optimize communication with healthcare  proxies throughout the process.  Communication training 
provided in the seminar and online course is further reinforced with provision of a communication tips pocket card. 
8.1.1 In-person training: 
At each NH during the start -up period and q6 months during the 24 month implementation 
period, the research team including a PI [INVESTIGATOR_877680],  and one or both PDs will 
lead on -site 1 -hour group training seminars to present principles of infection management in 
advanced dementia, intervention components, and approaches to proxy counseling. Seminars will include a didactic presentation, open discussion, and communication training for common challenging scenarios (e.g., proxy requesting a resident get antimicrobials when treatment is not clinically indicat ed).  To enhance sustainability, TRAIN- AD site champi[INVESTIGATOR_877681]/her to co- lead on -going sessions and be an on- site resource to 
reinforce the intervention principles. Providers that are unable to attend the on- site training will 
be offered a condensed 1:1 training session at their convenience.  

TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  19 [IP_ADDRESS]  Targeted attendees  
All providers with primary care responsibilities for residents with advanced dementia (e.g., 
medical providers (physicians, NPs, PAs, nurses) and other key individuals (e.g., Director of Nursing (DON), infection control monitor) will be t argeted to attend the seminars.  See section 
7.1.3 for description of provider eligibility criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Materials  
Invited providers will be sent a training seminar packet pr ior to the seminar which includes items 
presented in the seminar and will serve as an ongoing resource for participants , and for those 
unable to attend, the in- person training.  
8.1.2 On-line course  
The “Infection Management in Advanced Dementia" on- line course i s being offered through the 
Harvard Medical School Department of Continuing Education (HMS DCE) and has been  
approved for CME credit. The PIs created this peer -reviewed course through an iterative process 
with experts in infectious diseases, palliative car e, and geriatrics. The self -directed course 
consists of 4 virtual patient cases, 2 for UTIs and 2 for LRIs, with 3- 4 multiple choice 
questions/case , and 3 communication training videos embedded within the course . Participants 
receive response- specific, evi dence -based feedback, and complete a 12 -item multiple -choice 
pre/post knowledge test. Providers  including RNs, LPNs, NPs, PAs and MDs  with direct care 
responsibilities for advanced dementia residents will be targeted to complete the course. Instructions on how to access the course will be in the orientation package and reviewed at the initial training. Participating providers will receive $50 from the research team 1 CME credit for completing the course for which the usual $[ADDRESS_1226376] providers .  Several strategies will be used to 
promote timely completion.   Weekly  reminders will be sent by [CONTACT_877733]- participant s for up 
to 1 month (mail/email)  and t he site champi[INVESTIGATOR_877682].  
8.1.3 Algorithms  
Algorithms guiding appropriate antimicrobial initiation for suspected UTIs and LRIs that 
integrate palliative care principles and patient preferences are used throughout the training program and displayed throughout intervention NHs t o reinforce provider learning .  Laminated 
5” X 7” pocket reference cards with the algorithms, will be given to providers in their orientation material packet  and made available throughout the study.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1226377] racted from the charts, 
including: 1. Proportion of residents given antimicrobials for suspected LRIs and UTIs when minimal criteria were absent in prior 2 months, and which criteria were absent, 2. Benchmarking 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  20 of inappropriately treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_877683], and 3. Time trends for these parameters.   
8.2 Proxy Education:  
The goal for proxy education is to promote informed decision- making for resident care that it is 
concordant with preferences, which is also desired goal for high quality nursing home care. At 
the time of resident enrollment, English -speaking proxies of enrolled residents will be sent a 
booklet written by [CONTACT_22888] -PIs, professionally reviewed and translated into 6th grade reading level 
that explains in a lay fashion:  i. the nature of urinary and respi[INVESTIGATOR_877684], ii. Treatment options (antimicrobials vs. only comfort care), iii. Concerns about antimicrobial overuse, and iv. Features  of appropriate antimicrobial use. Proxies will be sent the 
booklet following resident screening and encouraged to discuss infections in advanced dementia 
with their family member’s direct care providers .   
8.3 Handling of Study Interventions  
Intervention Imp lementation : The implementation plan aims to strike a balance between 
maximizing intervention adherence, and sustainability. While its components emphasize a 
standardized approach to UTIs and LRI  management , NHs will have the opportunity to adapt 
implementation to their own environment.  To increase likely program success , the research team 
will encourage ongoing communication between providers and proxies regarding infection management planning, and encourage integration of aspects of the  infection managem ent 
program into NHs’ quality improvement programming.  Various supports will be put in place to help sustain the program  and support the NH implementation team.  These supports include 
provision of information support for the site champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458].  A compendium  of reference and 
guidance materials is provided to each site.  Additionally, the research team will be available to site champi[INVESTIGATOR_877685].   Finally , members of the research implementation  team will meet with the NH implementation 
and leadership team every [ADDRESS_1226378] director contacts the administrator to inform them of the facility’s research assignment , facilitate a brief environmental scan questionnaire , and schedule a 
brief (30 minute) in- service for the l eadership team and staff to introduce them to the study and 
data collection procedures .  At the start of data collection , flyers informing residents and family 
members about the study will be posted throughout the facility . 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1226379] director contacts the administrator of the intervention NH and informs them of their study assignment.  She reminds him/her of the implications of the intervention assignment, asks him or her to select a site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] a nd facilitates completion of 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, [ADDRESS_1226380] to implement them within the NH.  
The following activities will occur during the 3 month planning period within intervention facilities:   
1. Identify TRAIN -AD site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  
2. Completion of infection management questionnaire  
3. Develop impleme ntation plan with NH leadership during [ADDRESS_1226381] final facility set- up (e.g., hang  posters of algorithms  and study flyers throughout 
NH).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Identifica tion of site champi[INVESTIGATOR_877686], each NH will designate at least one champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . This individual 
needs to be someone engaged in infection management who  understands the special concerns of 
advanced dementia residents. The site champ ion will most likely be either the DON, individual 
responsible for infection control, or nurse directing dementia care. The site champi[INVESTIGATOR_877687].  He or she serves as a primary contact [CONTACT_877734].

• Help t ailor TRAIN -AD to NH culture  
• Identify and motivate providers  
• Facilitate training seminars  
• Review prescribing feedback reports  
• Encourage infection management discussions in care planning  
• Integrate program into quality improvement activities  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Development of i mplementation plan with NH leadership  
Successful program planning and implementation depends on teamwork between members of the facility team and the research team.  This starts with the [ADDRESS_1226382] monthly to review and optimize plan for program roll -
out.  Throughout the program, the research team will work with members of the facility team to optimize the program within the facility and to support program activities within the facility.   
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  22 [IP_ADDRESS]  Identify targeted providers  
See section 7.1.3 for description of provider eligibility criteria. Prior to the program’s i nitial

advanced dementia who will be targeted to complete the t raining seminar and on- line course  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Provide orientation pack ets, conduct training seminars, and introduce on- line course to targeted 
providers  
Two weeks prior to all training seminars, the project director will send orientation packets to targeted providers .  Each provider will be invited to attend one of the seminars where the 
TRAIN -AD program and components will be reviewed in detail.  Providers will be asked to 
utilize reference materials and participate in the online course within one month of receiving the course invitation. Group seminars will be conducted at the NH twice the same day to reach various shifts .  One on one  sessions will be arranged for providers unable to attend the group 
training.   The first training seminar marks the official start of the intervention period within each 
facility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conduct final facility set -up (e.g., hang posters of algorithms and study flyers throughout NH).

8.6 Concomitant Interventions  
Following randomization, but prior to initiation of intervention period, the PD conducts a structured survey with senior administrator s in all control and intervention facilities to ascertain 
information the facility’s infection management activities , advance care planning practices, and 
palliative care/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249]. R egardless of whether or not participating facilities engage in a 
separate antimicrobial stewardship program s during our intervention period, all randomized NHs 
will be retained in the analyses in accordance with intention -to-treat principles.  
8.7 Intervention  fidelity 
Our approach fidelity monitoring reflects an attempt to balance intervention adherence with a pragmatic approach to implementation. All targeted providers will be sent the orientation package (printed training material, laminated cards with algorithms), and be exposed to the algorithms posters strategically place in the NH. We will aim for >90% attendance of providers at either an initial group training group or 1:1 session and 70% completion of the on- line course. 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, [ADDRESS_1226386] of eligible nursing homes for recruitment. Prior to recruitment 
efforts, NH characteristics that may be relevant to advanced dementia care,  were abstracted from 
the Medicare Nursing Home Compare, including: the number of beds, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based, special 
care dem entia unit, nursing and nursing assistant hours/resident/day, and number of deficiencies 
on state inspections. Long -term Care: Facts on Care in the US ( http://www.ltcfocus.org/ ) is also 
used to gather information about potentially eligible NHs that will he lp balance factors for the 
randomization procedures (see SAP), including number of beds, number of residents with 
advanced cognitive impairment, and number of Black residents .  Administrators of participating 
facilities are al so asked whether NPs/PAs are o n staff and whether there is an open or c losed 
medical staff.  At the time of initial enrollment and e very 12 months during the implementation 
period, f ollowing randomization, but prior to initiation of intervention period, the PD conducts a 
structured wri tten survey with senior administrators in all control and intervention facilities to 
ascertain information the facility’s infection management activities, advance care planning practices, and palliative care/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].  
9.2 Resident assessments  
Resident  data will be collected by [CONTACT_877738] . All data will be obtained from 
the residents’ charts except for functional status  and proxy ability to communicate in English, 
which will be ascertained in a [ADDRESS_1226387] ed from the medical 
records of enrolled residents every 2 months for up to 12 months , unless the resident passes or 
the proxy requests to opt out during that time.  Their charts are  abstracted at baseline, q2months, 
and within 30 days of death to determine  whether antimicrobials were prescribed. If a treated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_324508] a suspected LRI or UTI, documented signs/symptoms will be ascertained to assess 
whether minimal criteria to start antimicrobials were present. Procedures used to evaluate these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (chest x -rays, bladder catheterization, blood draws, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410]), and documented 
advance care planning about infection management (provider/proxy discussions and advance directives to withhold antimicrobials) will also be collected.  A 1-minute nurse int erview at 
baseline will also be done to assess the resident’s functional status. 
Demographic:  (baseline) age, gender, race, ethnicity, length of NH stay, residing in a special care 
dementia unit, and proxy contact [CONTACT_3031] (for mailing booklet) and rela tionship to resident.  
 
Medical co -morbidity : (baseline) All active medical diagnoses.  
Functional status: (baseline; nurse) Bedford Alzheimer’s N ursing Severity -Subscale (BANS 
range, 7 -28; higher score worse disability ) 
 
Antimicrobial exposure:  (q2months, death) While analyses focus on treatment of suspected LRIs 
and UTIs, details about all antimicrobial courses will be ascertained from the medication administration records, including; suspected diagnoses, administration dates, agent, dose, route, 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  26 and pres cribing provider. There are many ways to quantify antimicrobial exposure. We chose 
number of courses/person- years as our primary outcome as it best captures the intent of the 
intervention which is to reduce antimicrobial initiation. A course will be define d as starting an 
antimicrobial after a > 3 -day treatment -free interval. Multiple antimicrobials given 
simultaneously for an epi[INVESTIGATOR_877704]. For 
descriptive purposes, we will also quantify antimicrobial exposure as days of therapy (DOT)/person -days.  
Treated suspected UTIs and LRIs : (q2months, death): Documented  details will be collected for 
treated suspected UTIs and LRIs, including: i. vital signs, mental status changes, localized signs and symptoms (e.g., lun g sounds, cough, hematuria), ii. procedures used to evaluate including 
bladder catheterizations, chest x -rays, blood draws, iii. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410] (admission or emergency 
room (ER), and vi. treatment discussions between providers and proxies. Signs and sym ptoms 
will be used to determine whether minimal criteria to initiate antimicrobials were met as operationalized in SPREAD and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Advance care planning:  (baseline, q2months, death). The occurrence and date of advance care 
planning events will be ascertained from all available documentation (e.g., progress notes physician orders, POLST forms) and will include: discussions between providers and proxies about infection management and new directives to withhold antimicrobials (intravenous, intramus cular and/or oral) will be ascertained. Do -not-resuscitate and do -not-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_877705].  
Devices:  (baseline, q2months, death) feeding tubes, foley catheters

9.2.1 Consenting Procedure  (also see sections 7 and 16.2)  
In accordance with federal guidelines, the HSL IRB granted a waiver of informed consent for the 
participation of both providers and residents (i.e., from proxies) based on: i. The determination of 
minimal risk, ii. The trial could not be practically conducted without the waiver. The NH is the unit of randomization and the intervention will be implemented as a new program for all advanced dementia residents. Including all eligible residents (versus only those consenting) reflects how the intervention would be used in the “real -world,” thus enhances the trial’s 
generalizability and inter pretability, and iii. The trial does not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects. Providers and proxies will have the opportunity to opt out  at the start and 
throughout the implementation period, as described in S ection 7.

10.1 Sources of Data  
Residents’ NH record : The residents’ medical record containing information collected for routine 
clinical care will be abstracted at the baseline, q 2month and death assessments for up to 12 months. The following information will be obtained from the chart: demographic inform ation, 
antimicrobial exposure and prescribing provider, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_877706], medical comorbidity, advance care planning, devices, health care utilization, acute medical illnesses, and death date.  
Nurse interviews:  During screening  procedures, nurses will be asked to identify subjects who 
meet criteria for Global Deterioration Stage 7. For enrolled residents, at baseline only, nurses will be asked to rate the functional status of the patients using the Bedford Alzheimer’s Nursing Severity -Subscale during a 1- minute interview.  
  
On-line course:  Individual provider completion of the on- line course will be tracked.  
NH residents, proxies, and NH providers (intervention arm only) will be assigned a study number known only to the co- principal investigators (PIs) and research assistants (RAs). NH 
providers in t he intervention arm will be g iven a unique username [CONTACT_877752]-

40% mortality rate over one year. Thus, while deaths will be reported to the Data Safety Monitor , they are not considered an adverse event. The intervention does not involve any direct 
treatment of residents. Treatment of suspected inf ections is ultimately at the discretion of the 
nursing home primary care provider. Nonetheless, as part of this study, every 2 months, we will be collecting data from the residents ’ charts about the rates of suspected urinary and respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], tr eatment of these infections, and appropriateness of that treatments as defined by [CONTACT_877739].  
11.2 Potential psychosocial (non -medical) risks, discomforts, inconveniences of study 
procedures  
We do not anticipate any potential psycho -social risks discomforts or inconveniences of study 
procedures beyond those encountered in usual care practices.  The intervention provides 
information for proxies about infections in advanced dementia resident s to promote informed 
decision -making that it is concordant with preferences, which is also desired goal for high 
quality nursing home care. The intervention was very well -received with no adverse events in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Thus, we believe the intervention does not incur any greater distress than usual practice. Second, data collection conforms to the definition of minimal risk. No direct input from the residents or proxies is needed to complete any data for this study. All resident data are already being coll ected as part of routine medical care with the exception of the 1 -minute nursing 
interview at baseline to quantify the resident’s functional status for descriptive purposes.  All resident data are entered into a password protected encrypted software system  using unique study 
identifiers.  The data sheet linking residents with unique study ids is maintained in a separate secure system location at the discretion of the study site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].  
 One additional potential burden of this study is the time commitment of the NH staff to assist with eligible subject identification, which involves 1 -minute baseline nursing interviews, and 
intervention implementation. We will make every effort to minimize staff burden. Staff at the ~[ADDRESS_1226394] participated in our prior large studies that used similar methods to recruit residents with advanced dementia felt the procedures were not too onerous. Based on our experience, the baseline nursing interview to quantify functional status is expected to take ~[ADDRESS_1226395] these interviews at times that are convenient for the nurses. Some burden will 
be experienced by [CONTACT_877740] -AD site champi[INVESTIGATOR_60099] 15- 20 targeted providers/N H (12 -16 
nurses, 1- 3 physicians, 0- 3 NPs/PAs) in the [ADDRESS_1226396] to the time 
required for initial training, completion of the on -line education course, use of algorithms to 
guide antimicrobial initiation, and review of prescribing feed back reports. All training 
procedures will be done at the convenience of these providers. Their involvement is voluntary. Group seminars will be conducted twice the same day to reach various shifts, and 1:1 sessions will be arranged for providers unable to attend the group training. The on- line course can also be 
done at the providers’ convenience.

13.[ADDRESS_1226405] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent and HIPAA waiver applications  have been reviewed and 
TRAIN -AD protocol June 30, 2017  35 approved by [CONTACT_877747]’s IRB.  Continuation of study is contingent on annual review 
and approval by [CONTACT_1201].  Any changes to study protocol or materials will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to implement ation.   
14.2 Informed Consent Forms  
A waiver of informed consent and HIPAA Waiver of Patient Authorization was approved by [CONTACT_137656], and Hebrew  Senior Life’s Institutional Review Board, based on federal guidelines  45 CFR 
46.116(d)):  
1. The research involves no mor e than minimal risk to the participants;  
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants;  
3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and  
4. Whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation.  
14.2.1 The study meets criteria for minimal risk as per HHS 45 CFR 45.102:  
“Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research  are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or 
during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.”  
Explanation  
First, TRAIN -AD is an education and training program rolled out at the facility level which 
promotes the general recommendations of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that NHs engage in antimicrobial stewardship activities as a standard of care.  The educational content of the program is aligned with CDC recommendations for  antimicrobial prescribing based on 
national consensus guidelines, intended to improve infection management for residents with advanced dementia.  The program also provides information for proxies about infections in advanced dementia residents to promote informed decision- making that is patient- centered and 
consistent with goals for patient care.  At no point will members of the research team have direct contact [CONTACT_877748].  
Second,  data collection conforms to the defi nition of minimal risk. Data collected for research 
purposes will be obtained through bimonthly review and abstraction from the charts of enrolled residents and a single 1 -minute nursing interview at baseline to quantify the resident’s functional 
status fo r descriptive purposes. Research data will be maintained in an encrypted, password 
protected database which uses unique study IDs for all enrolled residents and proxies. The code sheet linking study subjects with study IDs will be kept in a secure location  within the 
participating NH.  
14.2.[ADDRESS_1226406] practices for infection management and CMS recommendations for antimicrobial stewardship within nursing homes.  The program promotes the provision of patient -centered care 
in an effort to improve care quality, but individual treatment decisions remain entirely at the discretion of the residents’ medical providers.  Research team members have no direct contact 
[CONTACT_877749] -AD protocol June 30, 2017  36 with residents or proxies and all. With the exception of the 1- minute nurse interview to 
characterize functional status, all resident data will be obtained from residents’ existing  s medical 
record, and recorded in the secure research database using unique study identifiers.  Study 
information is mailed to proxies of eligible residents and posted throughout the facility.  
Residents’ healthcare proxies can opt -out of allowing the res earch team to include resident data 
in the study at any time.  
14.2.[ADDRESS_1226407] of the intervention as it is implemented in the real world.  
14.2.4 Whenever appropriate, the participants will b e provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation :  
Upon the study’s conclusion, results and publications will be provided by [CONTACT_877750], as well as proxies of residents with advanced dementi a, as 
requested.  
14.3 Participant Confidentiality  
This trial has been granted a HIPAA Waiver of Requirement for Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information for Research Purposes from the Hebrew Senior Life IRB.   In order 
to preserve confidentia lity, subjects will be assigned a study number known only to the RAs PDs 
and site champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] . All physical documentation and IT assets are stored in a locked areas within 
the participating NHs and within  HSL, monitored 24- hours a day by [CONTACT_367888], and 
accessible only by [CONTACT_877751]. Access to the HSL cooperate computer network is strictly prohibited and all electronic research data will be stored on dedicated IFAR systems located on our private network. Access to these data will be limited to study personnel on a “need to know” basis. If a NH resident is deemed ineligible for the study, all personal health information obtained for screening purposes will be destroyed as soon as possible. 
15 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.  
16 ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Ethical consideration for the PROVEN trial will be in  accordanc e with the Federal Policy for the

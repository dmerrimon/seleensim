Statistical Analysis
 
The analysis populations consist of the
 
following
:
 

 
The Randomized Population will include all randomized subjects. 
Subjects will be allocated to the treatment arm they are randomized 
to for a particular Treatment Period o
f analysis.
 

 
The Full Analysis Population (FAP)
: 
all randomized subjects who 
receive 
at least 
1 dose of study drug. The FAP is the primary 
efficacy analysis population. 
Subjects will be allocated to the 
treatment arm they are randomized to for a particular 
Treatment 
Period of analysis.
 

 
The Safety Population: those subject
s
 
in the FAP,
 
but subjects will 
be allocated to the treatment arm
 
by [CONTACT_186233]
.
 

 
The Per Protocol Population: those subjects in the FAP completing at 
least [ADDRESS_220038] the interpretation of 
the primary efficacy endpoint. These violations will be identified by 
[CONTACT_186234]
.
 
Subjects will be 
allocated to 
the treatment arm they are randomized to for a particular Treatment 
Period of analysis.
 

 
Open Label Extension Population: those subjects receiving at least 1 
dose of open label treatment.

psoriasis
 
and 125 million people

(

Psoriasis Foundation, 2014
)
. 
 
Up to 30
%
 
of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis
 
(PsA)
, which 
causes pain, stiffness
,
 
and swelling in and around the joints. Psoriatic ar
thritis can 
develop at any time, but it most commonly appears betw
een the ages of 30 and 
50. Gene
s
, the immune system
,
 
and environmental factors are all believed to play 
a role in the onset of the disease. Early recognition, diagnosis
,
 
and treatment of 
PsA
 
are critical to relieve pain and inflammation and help prevent progressive 
joint damage.

Amendment 1
 
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
is a naturally occurring cytokine that plays an 
important role in the 
inflammatory processes of 
immune
-
mediated inflammatory 
diseases (IM
ID
s
) 
such as PsO, 
PsA, 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA),
 
polyarticular 
JIA
,
 
e
nthesitis
-
related arthritis, 
axial spondyloarthritis
, 
a
nkylosing 
s
pondylitis (AS)
, 
axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS
, 
psoriasis, 
Crohn’s disease (CD),
 
ulcerative colitis (UC)
,
 
and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA
)
. Elevated
 
levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of subjects 
with 
PsO
 
and other IMIDs
 
(
Kruege, Krane, Carter, & Gottlieb, 1990
)
 
(
B
rotas,
 
Cunha, Lago, Machado, & Carneir, 2012
)
 
(
Keystone & Ware, 2010
)
. Two disti
nct 
tumor necrosis factor
 
receptors (TNFRs), a 55
 
kilodalton protein and a 
75
 
kilodalton protein (p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules
 
on cell 
surfaces and in soluble forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon 
binding to either cell surface TNFR
.
 
Accumulating evidence suggests differential 
effects of p75 TNFR in the pathogenesis of inflam
matory and autoimmune 
disorder
s
 
(
Bluml, Scheinecker, Smolen, & Redlich, 2012
)
. 
In addition to soluble 
t
umor necrosis factor
 
alpha
 
(
TNFα
)
, its precursor form
,
 
transmembrane 
t
umor 
necrosis factor
 
alpha
 
(mTNFα)
,
 
is involv
ed in the inflammatory response
 
(
Horiuchi, Mitoma, Harashima, Tsukamoto, & Shimoda, 2010
)
.
 
Adalimumab
 
inhibits binding of TNFα, but not 
t
umo
r necrosis factor
 
beta 
(TNFβ), to cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFRs, rendering TNFα 
biologically inactive. 
 
Humira
 
was approved by [CONTACT_941] U
nited 
S
tates Food and Drug Administration
 
(
FDA
)
 
in 2002 for RA. 
Humira
 
is indicated for reducing signs 
and symptoms, inducing 
major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and 
improving physical function in adult patients with m
oderate to severe active RA. 
Humira
 
can be used alone or in combination with 
methotrexate
 
or other non
-
biologic disease modifying 
anti
-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Subsequently 
Humira
 
has been approved for PsA, AS, JIA, 
PsO, 
CD, and UC 
(
[COMPANY_013] US,
 
2014
)
 
as follows:
  
 

 
PsA: 
Humira
 
is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting
 
the 
progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult 
patients with active 
PsA
. 
Humira
 
can be used alone or in combination with 
non
-
biologic DMARDs.
 

 
AS: 
Humira
 
is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients 
with ac
tive 
AS
.
 

 
JIA: 
Humira
 
is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately 
to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 
2
 
years of age and 
older. 
Humira
 
can be used alone or in combination with 
methotrexate

Development of 
CHS

1420
 
Unlike generic drugs
, 
which are relatively simple chemica
l structures, biologic 
drugs are manufactured in cultured cells and vary lot to lot depending on the 
culture conditions. Because of these variations, biologic drugs cannot be 
considered “identical
,
” but may be con
sidered “biosimilar
.
” 
Determination of 
bios
imilarity is akin to determining the similarity of identical twins. Whereas 
identical twins are genetically identical, there may be minor differences in 
appearance, such as height or weight, which would allow them to be identified as 
unique and separate

t biosimilar

Relationship to Stu
dy Drug
 
The assessment of the relationship of an 
AE
 
to the administration of study drug 
(yes, no) is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the eCRF.
 
No
 
(unrelated, not related, no relation
, p
robably unrelat
ed
)
:
 
The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the 
AE
 
rules out a causal relationship and another cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.
 
Yes
 
(
possibly 
related
, 
related
)
:
 
 
Th
e time course between administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the 
AE
 
is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
can be identified (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.).
 
The following factors should als
o be considered:
 

 
Temporal sequence from drug administration;
 
Event should occur after study drug is given. The length of time from drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
 

 
Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseas
es;
 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and 
course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may 
have.
 

 
Concomitant medication;
 
Other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives 
sh
ould be examined to determine whether any of them might be 
recognized to cause the event in question.
 

 
Known response pattern for this class of drug;
 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response 
is likely to be a class effect.
 

 
Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses; and
 
Exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186219] a logical and better explanation for the event.
 

 
Pharmacology and 
PK
 
of the test drug
.
 
 
Known properties (absorption, distribution
, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the test drug should be considered.
 
Unexpected AEs 
–
 
An unexpected 
AE
 
is an experience not previously reported or 
an

Determination
 
of Sample Si
ze
 
Approximately 
500
 
subjects will be 
randomized
 
and treated for
 
this trial
 
(
approximately 
2
50
 
per arm
 
in 
Treatment Period
 
1
)
.
 
The sample size 
was determined to show comparable efficacy for the following 
endpoint based upon
 
the 
PASI
 
at Week
 
12
:
 

 
T
he percent
ages of subjects in each group, CHS
-
1420 and 
Humira
, 
achieving PASI
-
75 at Week 12
 
For the proportion of subjects achieving a 
PASI
-
75
, it has been assumed that 
7
0
% 
of subjects will be responders in both the reference group, 
Humira
, and the CHS
-
1420
 
group. T
he sample size will 
produce
 
9
0
% power to establish equivalence 
at 
the 5% alpha level (2
-
sided) 
with an equivalence margin of 1
5
% (absolute). 
Subjects who 
lack a PASI assessment at
 
Week 12 will be considered 
non
-
responders in the primary 
analys
e
s
.
 
 
The marg
in for equivalence has been based statistically 
on
 
the study results from 
Menter (2008)
 
and to a lesser extent Gordon (2006)
.  At 12 weeks,  
Menter had 
PASI
-
75 responses of 
68% (
554/814
)
 
for Humira and 
5% (
20/398
)
 
for control.  
This results in a treatment 
effect of approximately 63% (absolute).  A lower 95% 
confidence bound (2
-
sided)
 
for the difference in response rates
 
can be calculated 
to be 
59%. The proposed 15% margin for demonstrating equivalence is much 
smaller than 
the demonstrated benefit associated
 
with Humira.
 
Though Gordon (2006) was a considerably smaller study, at 12 weeks 
this study
 
had similar PASI
-
75 responses of
 
71% (
70/99
)
 
for Humira and
 
19%
 
(
9/48
)
 
for 
control.  This results in a treatment effect of approximately 52% (absolute). 
  
Pooling G
ordon and Menter using the method of Der Simonian and Laird, yields a 
lower bound on 
the
 
treatment effect of 
at least 50%
 
which also supports the use of 
a 15% equivalence margin.

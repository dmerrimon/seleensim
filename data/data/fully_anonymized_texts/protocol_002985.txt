HSR190012 :  Evaluation of accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with 
end stage renal disease (ESRD) on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD).

Page Number: [ADDRESS_665355].   
Recent advances in continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and availability of commercial CGM 
products to patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes has made the use of CGM more widespread (1).  CGMs work by [CONTACT_1299] a probe underneath the skin of a patient, into the interstitial space.  The probe is an electroenzymatic sensor which uses glucose oxidase to 
break down glucose to create hydrogen peroxidase and other elements.  Hydrogen 
peroxidase then interacts with a base metal layer of the sensor and is oxidized, which results in release of electrons which creates a current.  The current is proportional to the glucose concentration.  The current is measured by [CONTACT_513594] a calculated glucose 
concentration to a receiving device (2).  Substances that are widely distributed in body water, and thereby [CONTACT_513595], potentially affect this technology.  Acetaminophen a nd aspi[INVESTIGATOR_513591] (3); however, more recently developed CGMs such as the Dexcom G6, were able to demonstrate no interference by [CONTACT_58086] (4). Patients with end stage renal diseas e (ESRD) who are on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
undergo fluid shifts between the interstitial fluid and intravascular space during dialysis treatments.  They are also often uremic and have metabolic acidosis (5).  These fluid shifts, uremia, acidosis, and volume overload (increase in interstitial fluid volume due to ESRD) have the potential to impact the performance of the most advanced and commercially 
available CGMs; however, use of CGM in these patients has not yet been st udied (3).  
Moderate to severe CKD is associated with both increase in insulin resistance and decrease 
in insulin clearance, which results in often unpredictable and labile glucose concentrations and increased risk of hypoglycemia in these patients (6). Us e of CGM, and potentially hybrid 
closed loop insulin delivery systems that are dependent on accurate continuous glucose monitoring, has the potential to improve glucose control and quality of life in these patients (7).  We feel this study will be valuable  in collecting preliminary data needed with the goal 
of validating the use of CGM in this patient population.  
 
Objectives/Hypothesis  
Our specific aim is to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_513592] (CGM) in End Stage Re nal Disease (ESRD) patients on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD).  
Accuracy will be assessed by [CONTACT_513596] (MARD) between CGM values and concurrent finger stick or venous  blood glucose (CBG) in these patients during 
hem odialysis, and on non -dialysis days.   
 
Primary Hypotheses:  The MARD between CGM sensor glucose and CBG will be larger on non- HD 
days than during dialysis.

Page Number: 2 of 9 1.  Will controls be used?  
Yes – patients are their own controls.   
 
►IF YES, explain the kind of controls to be used.  
Accuracy of CGM during HD session will be compared to the accuracy of the CGM on the 
same patient when they are not in HD session.   
 
2. What is the study design?  
Prospective cohort study using blinded 10-day CGM in [ADDRESS_665356] a 
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Will attempt to recruit 
approximately 15 participants who use insulin therapy though this is not exclusi onary. 
Patients will be requested to perform finger stick blood glucose ( FSBG ) values using a study 
glucometer 7 times daily at home (before meals, 2 hours after meals, and at bedtime)  for 10 
days . A study team member will obtain  approximately 12 blood samples from the existing HD 
IV line during each (three) HD session the CGM sensor is worn.  These blood samples will be 
immediately processed using the i- STAT System.  While the goal is to have the subject 
participate in three hemodialysis sessions, two sessions will be acceptable and not considered a study deviation.  
 
3. Does the study involve a placebo?  
No 
 
►IF YES, provide a justification for the use of a placebo

2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
This is a prospective cohort study of [ADDRESS_665357] interstitial blood glucose every 5 minutes.  The CGM sensor will be collected 10 days after placement of the sensor.  The patients will also check venous  blood glucose using a provided 
glucometer seven times daily on non -HD day s.  During HD sessions, a study team member will 
measure blood glucose with the use of an i-STAT System  point of care machine approximately 
10-12 times at the following intervals:  q15 minutes x [ADDRESS_665358] and store the results of finger 
stick blood glucose values which will be collected  each day ( 10 days ) after placement of the

Page Number: [ADDRESS_665360].  If interested, a member of the study 
team will discuss the study in detail and obtain informed consent.  Pre -screening 
inclusion/ exclusion questions regarding their possible eligibility for the trial may be re viewed.  
 
Upon consent, the study team member will review the subject’s i nclusion/ exclusion criteria will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_513598] . The study team member will 
review the subject’s medical history and medications.   A serum  pregnancy  test will be performed 
for women who are of child -bearing potential.  If a subject is pregnant, they will be withdrawn 
from the study and be advised to seek further confirmation from their primary provider.  If the subject m eets all criteria, they may continue with the CGM training  visit on the same day or at a 
later date.   Fingerstick and i- STAT  System  blood glucose values are for study purposes only. 
Treatment recommendations will not be provided.  
 The most recent Hemoglob in A1c value that is collected for standard of care and is either dated 
prior to the study start date or within the data collection period if the duration between the collection date and study start date is greater than 3 months.  
 
Day 1 (Visit 2):  
Day [ADDRESS_665361]’s dialysis session, the 
study team will insert a DexCom G6 CGM sensor into the participant’s abdomen and educate the subject on the use of the DexCom G6 CGM. The CGM will be blinded to both the study physician 
and participant during the course of study participation – there will be no visible readings during 
the subject’s participation in the study. Selected study team members may incidentally see sensor values when downloading the CGM data. CGM supplies and CGM user’s guide will be provided to the participant. Patients will be given a  study  glucometer, testing supplies, and a 
scale to measure body weight  each day . They will be taught how to use the study glucometer and 
informed of the schedule for fingerstick monitoring that will occur during the [ADDRESS_665362].  
 
Non -Dialysis Days (Days 2, 3, 7, 9, 10):  
On days that the subject does not have dialysis, they will perform [ADDRESS_665363].   
 
Dialysis Days (Days 4, 6, 8, 11):  
On days that the subject has dialysis, they will attend their regularly scheduled dialysis session 
and perform that run with no change from standard care.  During the session, 10 -12 samples ( 1.5

results  (e.g. weekly basic  metabolic panel, etc…), dialysis run information  (including dextrose 
concentration of the dialysate) , vital signs including height and weight, and other clinically 
relevant medical information.  Estimated blood loss will be 20 cc per HD session and 60cc per  study 
period.  Glucose values collected during the dialysis session will not be used for treatment 
purposes.  
 
At Home:  
Participants will perform [ADDRESS_665365] participate in three hemodialysis sessions, two sessions will 
be acceptable and not considered a study deviation.   
 
Final Study Visit (Day 11)  
At the final study visit, subjects will  remove the CGM sensor from their abdomen. The sensor 
will be discarded. The CGM transmitter will be returned to the study team. They will  
discontinue all use of other study equipment (e.g.  study  glucometer, scale, etc…) and return all 
study supplies to th e study team.  Subjects will continue with their standard care for their end-
stage renal disease and diabetes management.  
 The CGM equipment stores  the blood glucose values on the transmitter.  The study glucometer 
will be downloaded by [CONTACT_513599].    Weigh diaries will be completed .

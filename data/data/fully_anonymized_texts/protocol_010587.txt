Title:Pragmatic Return to Effective Dental Infection Control through Triage and 
Testing
Précis:We will conduct a feasibility study to develop and test out procedures for 
improved triage and COVID-19 testing in dental practices so as to improve 
the safety of Dental Health Care Workers (DHCW.)   This is one of several 
feasibility studies to be conducted in Rutgers dental clinics and in dental 
offices which participate in the National Dental Practice Based Research 
Network (PBRN).  These studies will assess the feasibility of implementing 
COVID-related procedures in the dental setting and may provide 
preliminary data to inform a larger network-wide study grant application.
Objectives:Primary:  The primary objective of this study is to determine willingness of 
dental health care workers to participate in a study and to test survey 
instruments and logistics developed for a NIH clinical study evaluating the 
impact of COVID-19 testing and enhanced triage in dental offices.  
Population: This study will take place at Rutgers University School of Dental Medicine.  
Up to twenty (20) DHCW (faculty and staff) will be recruited in the Rutgers 
School of Dental Medicine’s dental clinics.  Only adults will be recruited.  
Number of Sites: One (1)  
Description of 
Intervention:Viral, antigen and antibody COVID-19 tests will be administered to Dental 
Care Health Workers (DCHW).  In addition, the use of pulse oximeters will 
be added to the dental health care worker triage protocol.   
Study Duration: 8 months (6 months for data collection; 2 months for analysis)
Subject Participation 
Duration:DHCW subjects will participate in the study for one month with up to an 
additional four weeks from time of signed consent to start-of-study 
timepoint.

Based on NIDCR Observational Protocol Template v4.0–20190909 Page 11 of 442 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
2.1 Background Information
Description of Problem:  
        The COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-[ADDRESS_507577] 
thought to be through droplets but soon it became clear that the virus could be spread by [CONTACT_17304] [5,6]. 
Many dental procedures require the mechanical preparation of hard and soft tissue using high speed 
handpi[INVESTIGATOR_402589]. The extent to which 
dentally-generated aerosols linger within operatories has not been clearly tested but it is certain that both 
dentists, dental assistants and hygienists will be exposed to significant aerosol sprays derived from patients’ 
oral cavities [7]. As we learn more about COVID-19 and viral transmission we understand that infection and 
spread of the virus is due to the viral load (or dose) and the time of contact [8,9]. 
Uniqueness of Dental Practice:  Unlike many procedures in medicine, dental/patient contact [CONTACT_402617] [10]. Furthermore, 
a dental procedure can often take as long as [ADDRESS_507578] and 
patient is inevitable. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_402590] (PPE) that includes N95 masks, face shields, 
gowns, and high-speed suction, viral spread from infected patients is unavoidable. This suggests that the 
only safe solution for maintaining the health and well-being of dental professionals in the time of COVID-19 
pandemic is removing virus infected patients from their offices [11]. 
    Waiting Rooms and Airflow: Obvious issues confronting dental practices have been discussed, 
however, waiting rooms with patients, bathrooms and passageways are all additional areas within offices 
that can be of concern. Further, the airflow in confined office spaces where patients can be waiting for [ADDRESS_507579] varied 
presentation and severity, and may be life threatening especially in patients with pre-existing conditions 
[21-23].  
    Solutions: One way of providing the security that dental offices are safe for both the dental professional 
and patient is by [CONTACT_402618]-CoV-[ADDRESS_507580] neutralizing 
antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  These solutions, at this moment, appear to be impractical particularly 
if the virus affects a very small percentage of the population and testing is inaccurate. A solution to this 
problem is imperative both for the safety and security both the patient and dental professional. But what’s 
to be done? How do we achieve our goal of providing a safe and secure environment that allows for routine 
dental care? 
Several challenges exist to routine and comprehensive testing: the costs, turnaround time (maximum 
practical utility is perhaps derived from a simple, rapid, accurate, inexpensive point-of-care test that is not 
technically demanding, such a test has not yet been validated). This proposal compares the use of one 
such candidate POC test with the current screening gold-standard.
     Conclusions: Every day that goes by, patients are not receiving dental services because of a SARS-
CoV-2  transmission concern. Understanding risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a dental 
practice and the effective use of testing and other practice modifications could dramatically reduce the risk, 
making both dental health care providers and patients comfortable with seeking/providing essential dental 
services.  This proposal is designed to develop procedures that address this serious problem and test the 
feasibility of these procedures in a pragmatic manner to address with this existing insurmountable problem 
that can affect the future of dental practice and the dental health we have come to expect.

Protocol X01 DE030407-01 11/3/2021
Based on NIDCR Observational Protocol Template v4.0–20190909 Page 12 of 442.2 Rationale
    Typi[INVESTIGATOR_402591] [12,13]. Dental patients who may be asymptomatic for medical problems are seen routinely in dental 
offices and can be screened for the early phases of medical disease during routine dental visits. For 
example, blood pressure monitoring and simple blood test for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels can 
be performed in dental offices for referral to physicians for further assessment [18,19]. This ready access 
to vulnerable patients can be considered as value-added should dental health professionals provide 
augmented diagnostic benefit to patients who are unaware of their need for medical intervention. However, 
in this time of uncertainty dentistry has been impacted by [CONTACT_402619]-19, that can compromise the willingness of dental professionals to open their dental practices [20]. 
    Little is Known Regarding the Effectiveness COVID-19 Triage in Dental Practice:  Little is known 
about the effectiveness of triage protocols which have been recommended by [CONTACT_6750].  For example, most 
offices are using temporal thermometers, yet many are uncalibrated.  In addition, screening questions 
continue to evolve, and the veracity of patient responses remains unverified. 
    Little is Known Regarding the Impact of COVID-19 Testing in Dental Practice:  Little is known about 
the value of testing and about the willingness of DHCW to implement SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_507581] effective use of such testing. 
The following questions need to be answered:
Perception of safety and comfort: Will patients and DHCW in an office with testing feel safer and 
be more comfortable delivering care during a COVID-19 or other infectious disease pandemic?  
Testing preference: Do DHCW and patients prefer POC testing rather than testing that requires 
laboratory processing? 
Effectiveness of triage: Is the triage protocol being followed today effective or do patients and 
DHCW respond negatively to COVID-[ADDRESS_507582] from work?
Effectiveness of triage methods: Are objective measures such as temperature and pulse oximeter 
readings effective in identifying “asymptomatic” cases?
2.2.1 Potential Risks
This research involves testing procedures with varying degrees of risk to the study participants. 
Saliva Test- minimal risk.  The saliva test is non-invasive, requires spi[INVESTIGATOR_17270] a tube, and is 
completed independently, without interaction with a member of the healthcare team.
Nasal swab- minimal risk. The nasal swab involves insertion of a swab into the forward part of the 
nasal cavity by a member of the healthcare team, which may cause slight discomfort to the 
participant.  
Tongue swab – minimal risk.  The tongue swab involves running a tongue cell collector across 
the top of the tongue which may cause slight discomfort to the participant.
Finger prick- minimal risk. A finger prick test is a procedure in which a finger is pricked with a 
lancet to obtain a small quantity of capi[INVESTIGATOR_402592]. The site, free of surface arterial 
flow, where the blood is to be collected is sterilized with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_17272], and the skin is 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_17273] a sterile lancet.  There is a slight risk of discomfort from the lancet stick and irritation 
or infection in the area the lancet punctured the skin.

5.3 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention
Target Sample Size: 20 dental care health workers.
Target Sample Size by [CONTACT_17313], Race, Ethnicity, and Age:  Study population will be drawn from faculty 
and staff at the Rutgers School of Dental Medicine.  All will be English speaking.  Age range will be 
between 18 and 100 years of age.  Racial and ethnicity background will be reflective of the respective 
populations at the Rutgers Schools of Dental Medicine with about 52% being African American and 33% 
Hispanic.
Study Population:  The DHCW study population will be residents, faculty and staff working at the 
Rutgers School of Dental Medicine.  
Inclusion of Women and Minorities and Individuals of All Ages: 
Women:  Women will be included in this study.  Pregnant women are not excluded from 
participating.
Minorities:  Minorities will be included in this study.  
Recruitment Strategies:  All the DHCWs participating in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_402597]/faculty at 
Rutgers School of Dental Medicine- mirroring the future design where the dental director of the 
participating practice-based research network will reach out to his staff to enroll study subjects, here too, 
the clinic director (GS) and coinvestigators (SA and RF) will reach out staff/faculty in the same clinic to 
invite study participants. The study aspects will be discussed in department clinical discussions- there are 
some overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_402598]. If DHCWs express interest, copi[INVESTIGATOR_402599]. Co-investigators 
GS, SA and RF as well as the research staff, PU are all in the same department and are approachable for 
any clarifications. In addition, flyers will be displayed in the department office and clinic space. Enrollment 
and study participation will be strictly voluntary. 
If 20 dental health care workers cannot be recruited in the Oral Medicine clinic, recruitment will expand to 
the school’s other clinics.  It is not anticipated that there will be difficulties recruiting sufficient dental 
health care workers and patients.  
Participants will be batched in groups of 5-10 and scheduled for study start at a convenient time in the 
clinic (in a manner that does not disrupt patient care). Thus, at that time itself, it will be feasible to identify

Protocol X01 DE030407-01 11/3/2021
Based on NIDCR Observational Protocol Template v4.0–20190909 Page 21 of 44and communicate every time point in the study. Because the enrolled participants are expected to be 
present at work otherwise (unless scheduled out, in which case, the flexibility in scheduling the time 
points will allow re-scheduling a particular missed time-point), contact[CONTACT_30697] a subject to schedule/remind of 
a study visit will be convenient. 
Retention:  In order to minimize loss of study participants and/or incomplete data collection, the following 
activities will take place:
The Research Clinical Director will work with the Research Assistants responsible for enrolling 
subjects and enable completion of surveys on REDCap. Both the director, coinvestigators (GS, 
SA and RF) and research staff (PU) are part of the same clinic and hence are optimally situated 
to discuss about the study. 2 iPads and ‘crayons’ are available for use by [CONTACT_36801]. 
The coinvestigators and research staff will provide iPads for collecting survey responses. Each 
participant will be able to log their responses in REDCap under the appropriate subject ID.
Participants will receive compensation.  
Compensation and Scheduled Payments:  Dental Health Care Workers who complete the protocol, 
including the end-of-study survey will receive $[ADDRESS_507598] positive for COVID-19 may still be able to complete study time-point 
even if required to self-isolate per his/her physician’s advice. If not the testing, at least the surveys can be 
completed at return to work. Completion of all study-related surveys will enable full compensation.
Additional Plans to Minimize Loss of Follow-up and Missing Data:  The following will minimize loss of 
follow-up and/or missing data:
When appropriate, REDCap survey data fields are set to “required”.  
REDCAP validation rules on data fields to limit responses to valid responses
5.4 Participant Withdrawal or Discontinuation from Study 
Procedures/Intervention
5.4.1 Reasons for Participant Withdrawal or Discontinuation from Study 
Procedures/Intervention
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.
An investigator may discontinue an individual’s participation in an intervention or withdraw an individual 
from the study if:
The participant has a serious adverse event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant.
The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.
5.4.2Handling of Participant Withdrawals from Study 
Participants may withdraw participation consent at any time, either verbally or in writing. Participants who 
further withdraw their consent for the use of data already collected must do so in writing. The Research 
Clinical Director or Research Assistant will interview the participant and document the withdrawal of 
consent using the Consent Withdrawn Received Form in the REDCap system.  Participants who withdraw 
will not be replaced.

Study procedures are limited to surveys and collecting samples.  We therefore expect few, if any study 
related serious adverse events.  In the rare event that a serious adverse event were to occur, an 
Unanticipated Problem form would be completed and SAE reporting timelines would be followed. 
8.1.1 Unanticipated Problems
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:
unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;
related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and
suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)
Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the 
event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.
If a SAE becomes known, the Research Clinical Director will immediately notify the study PI. The 
Research Clinical Director will record the event in the REDCap Unanticipated Problem Form based upon 
information obtained.  
8.2 Reporting Procedures
8.2.1 Unanticipated Problem Reporting 
Incidents or events that meet the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) criteria for UPs require 
the creation and completion of a UP report form.  
OHRP recommends that investigators include the following information when reporting an adverse event, 
or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:
appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name, 
and the IRB project number;
a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem; 
a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported that are not SAEs will be reported 
using the following timeline:  
Unanticipated problems that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, and no 
later than within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.
All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within one 
month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.
. All unanticipated problems will be reported to NIDCR concurrently with reporting to the IRB. These 
reports will be made to NIDCR’s centralized reporting system via the Clinical Research Operations and 
Management Support (CROMS) contractor.

Quality Management (QM) measures will occur throughout this study to ensure adherence to protocol and 
collection of high quality data.  QM activities include those measures done as part of daily standard 
operating procedures by [CONTACT_402636].  QM activities 
will include activities undertaken at defined intervals to check that QM activities are taking place and 
study-related documents are up-to-date.  
Staff Training
Training of all staff will be conducted and recorded in training logs.  Each staff member has been 
identified by [CONTACT_10757].  Records of completed training will be maintained in each study member’s study 
personnel file kept on the SDM PREDICT box drive, Personnel Qualifications folder.

General Overall 
(Study Purpose, Goals and Protocol)All Study Personnel
REDCap System Training Research Clinical Directors and Research Assistants
Daily Operating Procedures
Quality management measures have been built into Clinical Protocol Core and site procedures.  
Subject Completion Review
As this is a feasibility study, reviews of surveys and case reports to ensure completeness will not be 
completed, rather the number/percentage of incomplete survey’s and forms will be analyzed as an 
outcome measure.  Consent forms will be reviewed for completeness at the mid-study visit for DHCW 
subjects and as part of the end-of-visit survey for patient subjects.
Data Management Controls
REDCap is a rich system which enables privileging, required data element entry and required data 
validation to be embedded into daily operations.  
Privileging:  Every study staff member will be assigned a role which carries specific 
read/write/edit/delete privileges.  Staff member will be assigned a role providing minimal rights 
sufficient to perform his/her responsibilities.
Structured Data:  Whenever possible, data will be collected via structured data responses rather 
than free-text.  Structured data requires a respondent to check a valid response.  
Data Validation:  Data fields will be established limiting responses to those that are reasonable.  
For example, year of birth would have a range of 2002 (corresponding to age 18 – the youngest 
eligible) to 1920 (corresponding to age 100 – more than sufficient to cover the age range of 
individuals having impacted 3rd molars extracted.)
Required Fields:  Whenever appropriate, fields have been made required so as to ensure 
completed forms and questionnaires.
Structured responses are required for the CRFs so only valid responses can be recorded.  In addition, 
REDCap has been programmed with all responses being required at time of completion. Validation rules 
are employed where possible.

15.6 Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a 
research protocol that is under the investigator's control and that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
Upon discovery, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_402614].
A protocol violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, 
safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. Protocol 
Violations must be submitted for Full Board IRB review. If the deviation meets any of the following criteria, 
it is considered a protocol violation.
Protocol deviations and protocol violations can be broken down into the following two categories: Minor 
deviation or violation OR Major deviation or violation.
Minor Deviations and/or Minor Violations: A minor deviation or minor violation is viewed by [CONTACT_402639], compromise the integrity of study data 
and/or affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the study. Minor deviations or violations will 
be reviewed under expedited procedures by a single reviewer. The reviewer will determine 
whether the event is accepted as a minor deviation/violation and can recommend a corrective 
course of action. The deviation will be sent to the fully convened IRB meeting where the board 
will discuss and determine if any additional actions are required, where applicable and as 
necessary. If the event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a minor deviation or 
minor violation: Examples (Minor)
Major Deviations and/or Major Violations: A major deviation or violation is viewed by [CONTACT_402640], affect the integrity of study data and/or affect a subject’s 
willingness to participate in the study. Major protocol deviations/violations are treated as 
noncompliance. These reports will be reviewed at the fully convened IRB meeting where the 
board will discuss the major deviations and/or major violations and determine of the appropriate 
course of action. If the event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a major deviation 
or major violation: Examples (Major)
All deviations and violations from the protocol will be recorded on the Protocol Deviation/Violation 
Reporting Form no later than [ADDRESS_507627] Steering Committee Meeting.

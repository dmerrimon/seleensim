Study Rationale:  
Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is a rare, life- threatening, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism 
characterized by [CONTACT_349594] (MoCo). Molybdenum 
cofactor is essential for prope r functioning of the enzymes sulfite oxidase (SO), xanthine oxidoreductase, and 
aldehyde oxidase. The loss of SO activity is responsible for the severe and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_838130] . Less frequently, older infants and children may present with neurologic 
symptoms related to MoCD such as seizures, movement disorder and developmental delay/disability that appear s to 
have a less rapi[INVESTIGATOR_838131].    
A
lthough there are three types of MoCD, two- thirds of MoCD patients have Type A, which is due to a mutation in 
the MOCS1  gene localized on chromosome 6p21. 2. In MoCD Type A, the first of four  synthetic steps in the 
formation of molybdenum cofactor is interrupted, and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cannot be converted into cyclic 
pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Diagnosis of MoCD Type A in neonates is based on clinical and laboratory 
presentation (eg, seizures, exaggerated startle response, high -pi[INVESTIGATOR_128528], intracranial hemorrhage, axial hypotonia, 
limb hypertonia, feeding difficulties, elevated urinary sulfite and/or S -sulfocysteine [SSC], or low or absent uric acid 
in the urine or blood) and is then confirmed by [CONTACT_21920].  The clinical presentation after the neonatal period 
appears to be more heterogeneous and may progress less rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].   
T
he incidence of MoCD is estimated to be between 1/100,000 and 1/200, [ADDRESS_1164213] -suppression on electroencephalogram (EEG), 
exaggerated startle reactions, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, and feeding difficulties. Death commonly occurs in the neonata l period , and patients who survive that period may develop a severe static encephalopathy and 
developmental delays due to central nervous system (CNS) injury, including subcortical cystic cavitation, 
hydrocephalus, diffuse cortical atrophy, and basal ganglia injury. At present, there is no cure for MoCD.  
R
esults from nonclinical pharmacology studies with ORGN001  suggest that the metabolic derangement in MoCD 
Type A could be corrected by [CONTACT_349596]. Restoration of MoC o biosynthesis and SO activity 
is expected to result in correction of the metabolic pathways that would otherwise lead to accumulation of toxic 
metabolites that cause CNS injury.  
T
hese results are supported by [CONTACT_838154] A treated with a recombinant 
Escherichia coli -derived cPMP product (rcPMP) from Colbourne Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Colbourne ; formerly 
known as Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmBH ), which has been administered on a named- patient basis following 
individual physician requests. Published individual case reports suggest that intravenous (IV) administration of rcPMP restores MoCo -dependent enzyme activities, reduces concentrations of disease biomarkers (eg, SSC in urine), 
and has the potential to improve neurologic outcome .

 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   In addi tion to clinical experience with rcPMP,  healthy volunteers received ORGN001  in a first -in-human study, 
ALXN1101 -MCD -101, in which ORGN001  was well tolerated at doses  administered IV.  
 
 
 
 
A
cross both cohorts, no deaths or life -thr eatening TEAEs occurred, and no one withdrew  due to a TEAE.  
 
 
T
o date, ORGN001  has been well -tolerated, and there have been no serious 
adverse reactions  with causality attributed to ORGN001  reported, and no patient has withdrawn or discontinued as a 
result of an adverse event (AE).  
 
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ORGN001  in neonate s, infants , and children with MoCD 
Type  A.  
Objectives  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ORGN001  in neonate, infant, and pediatric patients with  MoCD Type 
A who are either treatment -naïve or who have received compassionate use ORGN001  
 
Secondary:  
   
• To evaluate the effect of ORGN001  on growth and development  using age -appropriate assessments  
• To evaluate the effect of ORGN001  on pediatric measures of functional ability and activities of daily living  
  
 
   
Endpoints  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
• Overall survival  (OS)  
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
  
• Changes in g rowth parameters  (height, weight, body mass index [ BMI ], head circumference) through Month 
12 
• Feeding pattern  assessments through Month 12 
• Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised ( GMF CS-E&R ) results  through Month 
12 
• Assessments of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development
® – Third Edition (Bayley- III) Cognitive and Motor 
Scales as measured through Month 12 
o For children aged 3 and above, for whom the Bayley -III is no longer appropriate, the Wechsler 
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence – Fourth Edition (WPPSI -IV) will be 
administered.  
o For patients with severe developmental delay, the WPPSI may not be an appropriate assessment, and therefore, the Bayley -III may be administered instead.  
• Functional ability and activities of daily living, measured by [CONTACT_838155] (PEDI) through Month 12 
• Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM )-88 results through Month 12

Safety Endpoints:  
The type, frequency, severity, timing, and relationship to study drug to any AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and changes in 
vital signs, electrocardiograms, and safety laboratory tests  
Methodology:  
This Phase 2/3, multinational, multicenter, open -label study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily 
IV administration of ORGN001  to neonates, infants, and children with MoCD Type A. For the purposes of this 
study, neonate patients are defined as those from 1 to 28 days of age  (inclusive) at the time of first ORGN001  dose 
administration , with d ay 1 of age corresponding to the day of birth. Infants are defined as those from 29 days to 
<2 years of age. Children are defined as those from 2 to 5 years  of age  (inclusive).  Patients must be treatment -naïve  
or may have previously received ORGN001 through the expanded  access program (EAP) . 
In neonate patients with signs and symptoms consistent with MoCD Type A , treatment should be initiated as soon as 
feasible, in an effort to prevent the irreversible neurologic damage that is expected to occur.  
 
• Eligible neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of MoCD Type A will undergo Screening/Baseline assessments  
(eg, brain imaging) prior to or as soon as possible after birth and prior to receiving their first daily IV 
inf
usion of ORGN001 . Given the life -threatening and devastating nature of the disease and the potential for 
a favorable benefit :risk profile for treatment with ORGN001 , patients with a prenatal diagnosis may be 
treated prior to onset of signs and symptoms associated with MoCD Type A. Ad
ditionally, if it is not 
possible to obtain brain imaging prior to treatment, the priority would be to treat the neonate and obtain 
brain imaging as soon as feasible afterwards. For those patients, the patient’s legal guardians (per count 
ry-specific requirement) may be asked prior to delivery to provide informed consent for participation 
in the study.   
 
 
• Eli
gible neonates who do not have a prenatal diagnosis of MoCD Type A but who have onset of the signs 
and symptoms that may serve as the basis for diagnosis will undergo Screening/Baseline assessments as soon as possible prior to receiving their first daily IV infusion of ORGN001 . Data from procedures 
conducted as part of standard  of care prior to study participation may be collected as part of Medical 
History. Genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD Type  A may be obtained after initiation of 
ORGN001  therapy.

 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   Eligible patient s beyond the neonatal period with genetically confirmed evidence of MoCD Type A, a biochemical 
profile , and clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_838132] A may also be enrolled following completion of 
Screening/Baseline assessments . Data from procedures conducted as part of standard of care prior to study 
participation may be collected as part of Medical History. Genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD Type  A 
may be obtained after initiation of ORGN001 therapy  in certain cases . 
 
In all patients, ORGN001  will be  administered daily from Day 1 of the study. Completion of a brain MRI may be 
d
elayed until after the initiation of ORGN001  if not feasible to complete prior to study drug initiation.  
 
 patients will continue to 
re
ceive daily infusions of ORGN001  at home  
 and will return to the clinic for study visits for safety, efficacy, and PK assessments.  
 A Saf
ety Review Committee (SRC) and an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review 
safety , efficacy, and PK data for this study periodically and will be consulted on an ad hoc basis for individual cases. 
Continuation of ORGN001  treatment will be based on treating physician assessment as well as recommendations by 
[CONTACT_838156]: risk assessment for each patient.  
 
 Patients with a genetic diagnosis other than MoCD Type A will be discontinued from ORGN001  treatment as they 
are not expected to receive any treatment benefit. Patients who discontinue prematurely from treatment will be followed for 28  days, . 
 
Dose Selection Strategy: A population PK (PopPK) -base
 d approach has been utilized to create a dosing scheme that 
targets the higher end of the originally acceptable exposure range for ORGN001  (no observable adverse effect level 
[NOAEL]: AUC 
 at the highest dose studied in the original toxicology study that was limited 
by [CONTACT_838157] . Since then, higher doses have been studied and were all well tolerated in rats and dogs using an 
improved IV formulation.  
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
A PopPK model was derived to characterize ORGN001  cl inical PK in healthy adult volunteers (Study ALXN1101-
MCD -101) and children with MoCD Type A (Study ALXN1101 -MCD -201). Due to 
 renal clearance of 
ORGN 001 in adult s (Study ALXN1101 -MCD -101), a function was included to account for the expected impact of

ittee [DMC] review of data prior to the first dose adjustment for each patient as well as subsequent periodic 
review of cumulative data); recommended dosing may follow the guidance in Table 3.  
The
 dosing strategy in Table 3 has been simplified compared to the original guidance. This is justified given 1) the 
m
uch greater safety margin with respect to the NOAEL described above; 2) the excellent safety profile of ORGN001 
thus far with all patients tolerating the maximum 1200  μg/kg dose well and no safety signals identified

2.1. Background
Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is a rare, life-threatening, autosomal recessive, inborn 
error of metabolism that is characterized by [CONTACT_838169] (MoCo). Molybdenum cofactor is essential for functioning of the 
enzymes sulphite oxidase (SO), xanthine oxidoreductase, and aldehyde oxidase activity (Schwarz 2009). The loss of SO activity is responsible for the severe and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_838136] ( Reiss 2003; Schwarz 2009 ). Less 
frequently, older infants and children may present with neurologic symptoms related to MoCD such as seizures, movement disorder, and developmental delay/disability that appears to have a less rapi[INVESTIGATOR_838131]. 
Although t here are three  types of MoCD, two-thirds of MoCD patients have Type A, which is 
due to a mutation in the MOCS1  gene localized on chromosome 6p21.2. In MoCD Type A, the 
first of four synthetic steps in the formation of molybdenum cofactor is interrupted, and 
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cannot be converted into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Diagnosis of MoCD Type A in neonates is based on clinical and laboratory presentation 
(eg, seizures, exaggerated startle response, high-pi[INVESTIGATOR_128528], intracranial hemorrhage, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, feeding difficulties, elevated urinary sulfite and/or S-sulfocysteine [SSC], or low or absent uric acid in the urine or blood) and is then confirmed by [CONTACT_21920]. 
The clinical presentation after the neonatal period appears to be more heterogeneou s and may 
progress less rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. 
The biosynthetic pathway for MoCo synthesis involves 3 major steps ; see Figure 1 
(Schwarz 2009) . 
Figure 1: The Metabolic Pathway for Molybdenum C ofactor 
T
he incidence of MoCD is estimated to be between 1/100,000 and 1/200,000 newborn babies 
worldwide ( Schwahn 2015). Affected individuals with MoCD Type A usually present as 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 40 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   neonates with  severe symptoms that are observed as part of standard clinical practice. These 
include, but are not limited to, intractable seizures, burst-suppression on multifocal epi[INVESTIGATOR_838137], exaggerated startle reactions, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, and feeding difficulties (Van der Knaap 2005; Johnson 2001; Vijayakumar 2011) . Death commonly occurs in 
the neonatal period and patients who survive that period may develop a severe static encephalopathy and developmental delays due to central nervous system (CNS) injury, including subcortical cystic cavitation, hydrocephalus, diffuse cortical atrophy, and basal ganglia injury. 
2.1.1. Treatment Options for MoCD Type A  
There is no available approved treatment for MoCD Type A. Current management strategies are 
symptomatic and aim to provide relief from MoCD Type A clinical manifestations as well as to provide palliative care. Administration of a diet with restrictions on the sulfur -containing amino 
acids cysteine, methionine, and taurine has been attempted in the related disorder of SO deficiency  (Touati 2000) . 
2.2. Rationale for the Study  
The previous Sponsor, Alexion Pharma GmbH (Alexion) developed ORGN001  (formerly known 
as ALXN1101) , a synthetic form of cPMP and a precursor molecule to MoCo, as a treatment for 
MoCD Type A. Responsibility for the development of ORGN001 in the treatment of MoCD Type A was  assumed by [CONTACT_349598], Inc, in September  2018. ORGN001  provides a 
therapeutic approach for the treatment of MoCD Type A that is intended to restore MoCo biosynthesis. Results from nonclinical pharmacology studies with ORGN001  suggest that the 
metabolic abnormality in MoCD Type A could be corrected by [CONTACT_838170], resulting in restoration of enzymatic activity and correction of the metabolic pathways 
that lead to accumulation of toxic metabolites that cause CNS injury.  
A comprehensive nonclinical package, including proof-of-concept in a knock-out mouse model, 
in v
itro and in vivo  sa fety pharmacology and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies (in rats and dogs), 
cytochrome inhibition/induction, metabolism characterization, and transporter profiling in 
various species, and a standard battery of toxicology studies in vitro  and in vivo  (rats and dogs), 
has been generated to support the clinical use of ORGN001 . Two additional Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) -compliant toxicity studies in juvenile animals  
 have been performed to support the use of ORGN001  in the target patient 
population. 
 
 
 
The use of ORGN001  as a p otential treatment for MoCD Type A is supported by [CONTACT_838171] a recombinant 
Escherichia coli -derived cPMP product (rcPMP) from Colbourne Pharmaceuticals GmbH 
(Colbourne ; formerly known as Orphat ec Pharmaceuticals GmBH )
 
. Published individual case 
repor
ts suggest that intravenous (IV) administration of rcPMP may restore MoCo-dependent 
enzyme activities, as evidenced by [CONTACT_838172]. Elevated urinary SSC concentrations observed before initiation of treatment were corrected with rcPMP substitution. Recombinant E.coli -derived cPMP substitution also resulted in improved 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 41 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   neurologic outcomes for patients with MoCD Type A (Veldman 2010a; Hitzert 2012a) . Safety 
data from published literature describing these patients has indicated that rcPMP infusions were 
well tolerated  (Veldman 2010a; Hitzert 2012a).  
Schwahn and colleagues reported on an observational, prospective cohort study of 16 neonates 
diagnosed with MoCD (11 Type A and 5 Type B) for up to 5 years that included patients 
reported by [CONTACT_838173]  (Schwahn 2015; Hitzert 2012a; Veldman 2010b; Veldman 
2010a; Veldman 2010a; Veldman 2010a) . Rapid, near-normalization of urinary biomarkers 
occurred within 2 days of rcPMP treatment but was only observed in patients with Type A disease. B iomarker response was maintained for up to 5 years on continued rcPMP treatment. 
Moreover, patients exhibite d clinical responses; seizure activity observed in [ADDRESS_1164232] stopped upon starting 
rcPMP in 8 patients. Three patients with MoCD Type A that were treated  with r cPMP  prior to 
the onset of severe encephalopathy did not develop clinically significant disability. Their initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans demonstrated  no signs of necrosis or c ystic lesions . 
After [ADDRESS_1164233] been 
associated with favo rable outcomes (Schwahn 2015; Hitzert 2012b) .  
Considering the identical molecular structures of ORGN001  and rcPMP, and the clinical results 
reported with rcPMP , it is anticipated that treatment with ORGN001  will benefit patients with 
MoCD Type A in Study ALXN1101- MCD -202 by [CONTACT_838174], restoring SO 
enzymatic activity , and resulting in reduc ed concentrations  of toxic metabolites (sulfite and 
SSC).  
2.3. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Within a few hours to days after birth, newborn infants with MoCD Type A present a severe 
clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], with profound and progressive neuronal damage. Death is common in the 
neonatal period, with a median survival of patients with MoCD of 3 years (M echler 2015) . 
Currently, no approved therapy is available for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A. 
Treatment strategies for individuals with this disorder are symptomatic and with a goal to provide relief from clinical disease manifestations and along with palliative care for the patient.  
Safety data from the completed Study ALXN1101- MCD -[ADDRESS_1164234] -in-human study, ALXN1101- MCD -101, in which ORGN001  was well -tolerated 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020

 Across both cohorts, no deaths or life-threatening TEAEs 
occurred, and no patient had to withdraw due to a TEAE.  
In vitr
o and preclinical studies have identified that ORGN001 has  phototoxic potential. Patients 
and caregivers are instructed to avoid direct sunlight and to use pre cautions when exposed to the 
sun. Protective measures include wearing of sunglasses, a hat, long sleeved shirts, long pants and 
the use of protective sunscreen.  
An ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_1164235] been no serious adverse reactions with causality 
attributed to ORGN001  reported, and no patient has withdrawn or discontinued as a result of an 
adverse event ( AE). 
Due
 to the life -threatening and debilitating nature of the disease, lack of treatment, and shortened 
life expectancy of these patients, there is a significant need to provide safe and effective 
treatment for patients with MoCD Type  A. A treatment paradigm that targets the underlying 
cause of the disease, the inability to synthesize MoCo from its precursor, GTP, may restore MoCo biosynthesis and SO function, and ameliorate MoCD disease progression. 
2.4. Rationale for Patient Population  
Preliminary data suggest that the metabolic derangement of MoCD starts in utero and patients 
demonstrate symptoms associated with sulfite toxicity within hours of birth  (Veldman 2010a; 
Hitzert 2012a) . This observation supports the premise that irreversible neurologic injury may 
occur very early in life and that immediate postnatal treatment with ORGN001  may alter the 
outcome of this devastating disorder. 
Selection of the patient population to determine ORGN001  efficacy and safety in Study 
ALXN1101- MCD -[ADDRESS_1164236] likely to benefit from 
ORGN001  treatment. Considerations were given to the age of onset of the disease and the extent 
of CNS injury at time of diagnosis and/or planned treatment. Consequently, the population  
initially identified  to be enrolled in Study ALXN1101- MCD -202 comprised patients from 1 to

(genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD Type A may be obtained after initiation of 
ORGN001 therapy in certain cases), biochemical profile, and clinical presentation consistent with MoCD Type A. 
2.5. Rationale for Proposed Dosing  
A population PK (PopPK)- based approach has been utilized to create a dosing scheme that 
targets the higher end of the originally acceptable exposure range for ORGN001 (NOAEL: area under the plasma concentration-time curve ) at the highest dose studied 
i 
n the original toxicology study that  was limited by [CONTACT_838176]. Since then , higher doses 
have been studied and were all well tolerated in rats and dogs using an improved IV formulation. A 
ccordingly, the revised NOAEL values in a  rat study  provide a considerable increase 
in the safety margins 
. 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
A PopPK model was derived to characterize ORGN001 clinical PK in healthy adult volunteers 
(
Study ALXN1101- MCD -101) and children with MoCD Type A (Study ALXN1101- MCD -201). 
Due to  renal clearance of ORGN001 in adults (Study ALXN1101- MC D-101), a function 
was included to account for the expected impact of renal function maturation (Rhodin 2009)  on 
ORGN001 PK in neonate patients. 
 
Dosing will be based upon the gestational age (GA) of the patient. Day 1 dosing for term (≥ 37 weeks GA) and preterm neonate (< 37 weeks GA) patients will begin with ORGN001 IV 
infusions of 700 and 525 μg/kg/day, respectively. Following Investigator and Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) reviews (as well as Data Monitoring Committee [DMC] review of data prior 
to the first dose adjustment for each patient as well as subsequent periodic review of cumulative data) , recommended dosing may follow the guidance in Table 9.  
The dosing strategy in Table 9 has been simplified compared to the original guidance. This is jus
tified given 1) the much greater safety margin with respect to the NOAEL in the 
 rat 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 44 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   study described above; 2) the excellent safety profile of ORGN001 thus far with all patients 
tolerating the maximum 1200 μg/kg/day  dose and no safety signals identified  
; and 3) the fact that dose increments  were well tolerated in Study

Doses may be adjusted based on drug- related AEs or changes in clinical parameters, laboratory 
data, or PK findings and will occur following consultation with the medical monitor and, if 
applicable, with the SRC. 
 
ORGN001 drug product has been developed for IV use. Administration via the parenteral route results in rapid and consistent onset of action necessary for treatment of neonatal patients with MoCD. The dose can be adapted to the last recorded body weight or body weights recorded by [CONTACT_838177]/or physician visits with appropriate documentation; the flexibility to 
adjust doses based on changes in body weight enable accurate dosing.  
2.6. Rationale for the Overall Design  
This is a Phase 2/3 open- label, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of ORGN001  
in neonates, infants, and children with MoCD Type A . 
A placebo -controlled study is not feasible or ethical due to the severity of the untreated disease 
a
nd reports of improved outcomes in MoCD Type A neonates treated with rcPMP; also, the lack 
of available treatment precludes inclusion of an active control arm. ORGN001  safety will be 
reviewed continuously, on an individual patient basis, as well as at a group level. An SRC, 
 
 
 will review all available safety, efficacy and PK data on a 
per
iodic basis.  
In ne
onate patients with signs and symptoms consistent with MoCD Type A, treatment should be 
initiated as soon as feasible, in an effort to prevent the irreversible neurologic damage that is 
expected to occur.  Less frequently, older infants and children may present with neurologic

4.1. Overall Study Design  
This Phase 2/3, multicenter, multinational, open -label study is designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of  daily IV  administration of  ORGN001  to neonates, infants, and children with MoCD 
Type A. For the purposes of this study, neonate patients are defined as those from 1 to 28 days of 
age (inclus ive) at the time of first ORGN001  administration , with day 1 of age corresponding to 
the day of birth. Infants are defined as those from 29 days to < 2 years. C hildren are defined as 
those from 2 years to 5 years (inclusive) at the time of informed consent .  
Eligible neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of MoCD Type A will undergo Screening/Baseline as
sessments (eg, brain imaging) prior to or as soon as possible after birth and prior to receiving 
the first IV infusion of ORGN001. Given the life- threatening an d devastating nature of the 
disease and the potential for a favorable benefit:risk profile for treatment with ORGN001, patients with a prenatal diagnosis may be treated prior to the onset of signs and symptoms 
associated with MoCD Type A. Additionally, if it is not possible to obtain brain imaging prior to 
treatment, the priority would be to treat the neonate and obtain brain imaging as soon as feasible afterwards. For those patients, the patient’s legal guardians (per country- specific requirements) 
may be asked to provide informed consent for participation in the study prior to delivery.
 
 
 
Eligible neonates who do not have a prenatal diagnosis of MoCD Type A but who have the onset of signs and symptoms that may serve as the basis for diagnosis will undergo Screening/Baseline assessments as soon as possible prior to receiving their first daily IV infusion of ORGN001 . Data 
from procedures conducted as part of standard of care prior to study participation may be collected as part of Medical History. Genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD Type A may be obtained after initiation of ORGN001  therapy. 
Eligible patients beyond the neonatal period with genetically confirmed evidence of MoCD Type A, a biochemical profile, and clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_838134]/Baseline assessments. Data from procedures conducted as 
part of standard of care prior to study participation may be collected as part of Medical History. 
Genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD Type A may be obtained after initiation of ORGN001 therapy in certain cases.  
This study will include a S creen
 ing Period, a 12-month Study Period, and a 2-year long- term 
Treatment Period (M
onths 13 through 36). Due to the rare nature of the disease and no currently 
ava
ilable treatment, patients  may continue to receive study 
drug until ORGN001 becomes commer cially available or development has stopped. For patients 
receiving ORGN001 past month 36, a safety visit will occur . Assessments 
performed during those visits are for the purposes of ongoing safety to receive ORGN001 and may only occur if ORGN001 is not yet commercially available for the patient.  
The s
tudy will enroll both term and preterm neonates as well as infants and children who meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. In neonates, due to the roles that renal clearance and body 
weight play in the PK of ORGN001 , dosing will be based upon the GA of the patient. Day 1 
dosing for term (≥  37 weeks GA)  and preterm neonate (< 37 weeks GA) patients will begin with 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020

 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   ORGN001  IV infusions of 700 μg/kg/day and 525 μg/kg/day, respectively. ORGN001  infusions 
should be administered every 24 hours ± 3 hours apart while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838138]. 
Based on the Investigator and SRC/DMC review of all available data prior to the first (Day 28) 
dose adjustment, each patient’s dose may be initially escalated on or before Day 28, with 
incremental adjustments up to 1200 μg/kg/day by [CONTACT_43380] 3. Post administration of the increas ed 
dose, patients will undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG) as well as PK sampling. If any dose is 
not tolerated, the dose will be reduced based on an ad hoc consultation with the SRC/DMC (also 
see Section 6.1.2 for rules on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_838139]).

No minimum or maximum number of patients is projected  for enrollment in the study.  
4.3. Study Assessments  
No study procedures may be performed prior to obtaining informed consent. Screening/Baseline 
and Day 1 assessments may all occur on the same day.  
For neonates born prior to 37 weeks of gestation, the Month 12 assessments will be performed at the target time point, adjusted for prematurity by [CONTACT_838179] -term gestation of 40 weeks. 
Results of all study assessments will be recorded in the appropriate case report form (CRF). Analyses of study assessments are described in Section 14. 
4.3.1. Demographic Data 
At Screening/Baseline, the patient’s date of birth, gender, gestational age, race, and ethnicity will be recorded. The date of first recognition of MoCD- associated signs or symptoms will be 
documented, as available.  
4.3.2. Genotype Assessment  
MoCD-related genotype data will be recorded at Screening/Baseline. If not available, a blood sample will be collected for genetic analysis of the MOCS1  gene. This sample should be 
collected at Screening/Baseline or as early as possible. Genotype of MoCD Type A will be verified as soon as possible but is not required before dosing is initiated. 
4.3.3. Medical History  
A complete medical history, including signs and symptoms of MoCD disease, complications 
during pregnancy, Apgar score, and any history of in- utero seizures, if available, must be 
recorded at Screening/Baseline for each patient.  
4.3.4. Family History 
Whether the patient has any siblings (living or deceased) with suspected or confirmed MoCD will be recorded as well as whether the sibling has participated in any other Origin -sponsored 
studies of MoCD. The degree of parental consanguinity and parental genotypes, if known, should be recorded. Information on parity, delivery type, and placental condition should also be captured. Family history, including the medical history for parents and siblings, will be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  
4.3.5. Physica l Examination 
A physical examination consistent with standard of care must be performed

ayley Scales of Infant Development (or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale 
of Intelligence – Fourth Edition ) 
The Bayley Scales of Infant Development – Third Edition  is a standardized and norm- referenced 
instrument that assesses developmental functioning of infants and children 1 month to 42 months of age; it consists of 5 scales, 3 of which are administered with child interaction by a qualified trained professional: the Cognitive Scale, the Language Scale (including the Receptive 
Communication and Expressive Communication subtests), and the Motor Scale (including the 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 55 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   Fine Motor and Gross Motor subtests). The Social -Emotional Scale and Adaptive Behavior Scale 
together form the Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behavior Questionnaire, which is completed 
by [CONTACT_7071], legal guardian, or primary caregiver but will not be administered as part of this study. The Bayley -III assessments must be performed in the order specified in the Bayley- III 
Manual.  
The Bayley -
III will be administered
 
, if applicable to  assess changes in 
gross motor, fine motor, and cognitive development.  
 
The Language Scale will be administered only to native English speakers in English-speaking countries. 
From raw scores, scaled scores  and developmental age equivalents can be calculated for the 
Cognitive, Receptive Communication, Expressive Communication, Fine Motor, and Gross 
Motor subtests. Scaled scores also can be used to calculate the Cognitive, Language, and Motor 
composite scores, percentile ranks, and confidence intervals (CIs). 
A qualified, trained professional will administer the Bayley -III.  
Please refer to the Bayley -III Manual for specific definitions of t erms and assessments (Bayley  
2005) . 
The WPPSI -IV may be used instead of the Bayley -III depending upon whether the Bayley- III is 
not appropriate for the patient; similarly, for patients developmentally delayed such that the 
WPPSI -IV is an inappropriate assessment, the Bayley -III will be used regardless of whether the 
child is aged 3 or above. 
4.3.13. Gross Motor Function Measure–[ADDRESS_1164242] be on the s ame day/time 
as the Bayley -III. 
Th
e GMFM -88 measures patient -initiated motor activities in 5 dimensions:  
• A: Lying and Rolling 
• B: Sitting  
• C: Crawlin g and Kneeling 
• D: Standing 
• E: Walking, Running, and Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_838141] 0 to 3, with 0 equaling “does not initiate,” and 3 equaling “completes 
item according to all descriptors.” A percent score can be obtained for each dimension, and for the total of all GMFM dimensions. Patients will be assessed  without orthoses or aids. 
Following scoring of the Bayley-III Gross Motor subtest, items that have duplicate positioning for the GMFM -88 will also be scored. The remaining GMFM- 88 items will then be administered 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 56 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   and scored. This is necessary to avoid positional redundancy, fatigue for the infant, and to ensure 
valid skill measurement of spontaneous gross motor skills. 
4.3.14. Gross Motor Functio n Classification System Expanded and Revised  
The GMFCS -E& R will be assessed 
 
, if applicable.  
 
The GMFCS -E&R  is a 5 -level (Level I through Level V) classification system of gross motor 
function of children and youth (up to 18 years of age), on the basis of self- initiated movement, 
with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility for children wi th impaired 
motor skills. Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive 
technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled 
mobility and, to a much lesser extent, quality of movement. The GMFCS- E&R  classifies gross 
motor functional capabilities and limitations as usual performance in the home, school, and 
community settings.  
Children who have motor functions similar to those classified in "Level I" can generally walk without restr ictions but tend to be limited in some of the more advanced motor skills. Children 
whose motor function has been classified at "Level V" have very little voluntary control of 
movement, have no means of independent mobility, are generally transported by [CONTACT_838180], 
and require assistance for all activities of daily living.  
4.3.15. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index 
The PEDI measures functional ability and activities of daily living, including self-care, mobility, 
and social function. The PEDI Functional Skills scales consist of 3 domains: 
• Self-Care: Getting Dressed, Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_838142], Home Tasks, and Eating and Mealtime 
• Mobility: Basic Movement and Transfers, Standing and Walking, Steps and Inclines, 
Running and Playing, and Wheelchair 
• Social: Interaction, Co mmunication, Everyday Cognition, and Self- Management 
Functional Skills scales  
The PEDI will be assessed  
, if applicable.  
 The PEDI must be performed only after completion of 
the Bayley -III and the GMFM -[ADDRESS_1164243] scores are available for 21  age groups, based on a child’s chronological age, 
and allow for evaluation of the child’s functioning relative to others of the same age. They have a 
mean of 50, with a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Scaled scores indicate performance along a 
continuum from 0-100, with increasing numbers representing increased functional performance. 
Scaled scores provide a means to evaluate a child’s current functional skills and progress in these skills over time. Scaled scores are especially helpful  in documenting improvements in functional 
skills for children not expected to exhibit or regain normative levels of functioning.

 Page 57 of 107  
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential   4.3.16. Ophthalmologic Examination 
Ophthalmologic evaluation  is to include the following: 
• Ocular history  
• External inspection of the eyes and lids  
• Ocular motility assessment  
• Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_838143]  
• Red reflex examination  
• Age-appropriate visual acuity  
• Attempt at ophthalmoscopy  
Vision assessment in children younger than 3 years or in any nonverbal child is accomplished by 
[CONTACT_838181]’s ability to fix and follow objects. A standard assessment strategy is to determine whether each eye can fixate on an object, maintain fixation, and then follow the object 
into various gaze positions. Failure to perform these maneuvers indicates signifi cant visual 
impairment. The assessment should be performed binocularly and then monocularly. 
If poor fixation and following is noted, a significant bilateral or unilateral eye or brain 
abnormality is suspected, and referral for more formal vision assessment is advisable. It is 
important to ensure that the child is awake and alert because disinterest or poor cooperation can mimic a poor vision response. 
Where feasible, visual acuity is documented for each eye in the clinical report form. Also, lens 
dislocation or subluxation is to be documented separately for each eye if present.  
4.3.17. Electroencephalogram and Seizure Activity  
Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are to be performed for those patients with documented or 
s
uspected seizure activity. Where feasible, a standard EEG 
 
 should be performed prior to the first infusion. If that timing is not possible, the 
E
EG may be performed within [ADDRESS_1164244] of care. 
The  
pa
tient’s parent/legal guardian will be given a diary to be used to record data regarding the 
frequency of seizures and any changes in anticonvulsants for the entire duration of the study. 
Th
e patient’s parent/legal guardian will be asked at every visit if there has been a presence of 
seizure activity or any change in seizure activity since the last study visit. Based on a review of 
the seizure diary as well as observation and review of neurologic examination findings, the 
Investigator/designee will determine if anticonvulsants, change in medication, or further 
neuroimaging is warranted.

4.3.20. Modified Glasgow Coma Scale for Infants and Children 
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical tool designed to assess coma and impaired 
consciousness. A modified GCS score of 12 in infants or children suggests a severe head injury, 
a score of 8 suggests need for intubation and ventilation, and a score of 6 suggests need for 
intracranial pressure monitoring (see Appendix C ). The modified GCS will be administered to 
pat
ients at every visit, within the first month of the study 
 
.

With agreement from the Sponsor, some Baseline assessments may be completed after dosing has begun due to urgency of study drug initiation.  
a For neonate patients born prior to 37 weeks of gestation, the Month 12 assessments will be performed at target time point, adjusted for prematurity by [CONTACT_838182] -term gestation of 40 weeks.  
b These assessments will be performed when any dose adjustment occurs: physical exam ination , vital signs, neurologic exam ination , ECG, PD sampling (blood), PK sampling, 
serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, evaluation for seizure activity, assessment of concomitant medications, assessment o f AEs. Electrocardiograms  should be performed 
prior to any blood draws or treatment administration scheduled for the same study visits.  
c  additional systolic and diastolic bloo d pr essure measurements are to be collected at approximately 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_1164245] -EOI.  
d Include complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
serum osmolality, and total serum albumin.  
e Include specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, blood and ketones (by [CONTACT_838183]), and urine protein to creatinine ratio.

COMMITTEE 
6.1. Safety Review Committee  
To monitor patient safety, data will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_18370] 
t
hroughout the study. 
 
 T
he SRC will review  
 data for each individual at the following time points: 
•
 
 in advance of the first dose adjustment  
 
• At any other time during the study, as requested by [CONTACT_9304], 
 
  
Note that the DMC also will review each patient’s record , prior 
t
o any study dose escalation . Further information on the DMC is available in 
Section 6.2
. 
 
 Based on SRC review of the available data,  
 
the SRC may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], increasing , decreasing, or maintaining (current dose) the dose 
of ORGN001 . 
The Investigator or Sponsor may also convene the SRC for unscheduled dose adjustments, based 
on drug- related AEs or changes in clinical parameters.  
6.1.1. Safety Criteria for Unscheduled Dose Adjustments  
Doses may be adjusted, based on drug- related AEs or changes in clinical parameters and 
laboratory data. Dose changes will occur following consultation with the medical monitor and, if applicable, with the SRC . If a patient has significant clinical worsening related to ORGN001  
dosing, the dose may be decreased, based on the patient’s clinical status and, if available, exposure data.  
6.1.2. Criteria for Adjustment or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_838145] a given child or group of children. This list is not 
comprehensive. Consideration of dose changes for each patient will be assessed individually by 
[CONTACT_510509], based on the patient’s clinical status and review with the medical monitor. 
• Scenario 1: Any study drug-related SAE that results in the death of a single patient 
Action : No further dose escalations will take place in any patient; pending evaluation, all 
other patients will maintain their current dose level and no new patient will be enrolled  in 
the study. A substantial amendment to the Clinical Trial Authorization will be submitted 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 66 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential  to the relevant Competent Authorities for approval prior to  restarting enrollment and  
allowing further dose escalations in the event that any study drug- related SAE results in 
the death of a single patient.  
• Scenario 2: One or more study drug- related SAEs in a single patient  
Action : If the treating physician, in c onsultation with the medical monitor, determines 
that a dose reduction could be expected to reduce the risk of the SAE and not increase the 
risk of MoCD-related symptoms, the patient may be treated with a lower dose of 
ORGN001 . Subsequent dose escalation for that patient may be considered, based on 
clinical assessment by [CONTACT_838184].  
• Scenario 3: The same study drug-related SAE occurs in 2 different patients. 
Action : In addition to the actions taken under Scenario 2, dosing in subsequent patients 
may be limited, to achieve concentrations below those observed in the patients with drug- related SAEs, patient to clinical assessment by [CONTACT_838185].  
• Scenario 4: P K exposure in a single patient exceeds the AUC NOAEL limit by 
[CONTACT_7809] 10% 
Action : The patient’s dose is reduced to a dose level that results in exposure that is below 
the NOAEL exposure.  
6.1.3. Criteria for Site or Study Termination  
For reasonable cause, th e Investigator, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC), 
or Sponsor may terminate the study at a given center, in which case, patient care would be 
transferred to a different Investigator. If all centers are terminated, patients would return to the 
care of their treating physicians. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study or 
investigational sites include, but are not limited to: 
• Discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study 
• Sponsor decision to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the ORGN001  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the approved protocol, pertinent guidelines, 
and/or regulations 
• Submission of false information knowingly from the Investigator to the Sponsor 
and/or regulatory authorities 
6.2. Data Monitoring Committee  
 
 
The DMC will have access  to all safety data, in 
accordance with its primary function of ensuring patient safety. The DMC may make 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 67 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential  recommendations to the Sponsor regarding safety issues, study conduct, and/or modifying, 
extending, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
 
 
The DMC will review each patient’s record , prior to any study 
dose e
scalation
 
. The SRC may request additional ad hoc DMC meetings, as 
needed.  
 
 
 
Each member of the DMC will be requ ired to sign a contract agreement, including 
confidentiality and financial disclosure statements, assuring no conflicts of interest, as a condition for membership on the committee. 
6.3. Definition of Study End 
The end of the study will be defined as the date of the last patient’s last visit.  
After Month 36, treatment with ORGN001  may be continued if determined to be clinically 
indicated . Due to the rare nature of the disease and no currently available treatment, patients 
exceeding 36 months of treatment may continue to receive study drug until ORGN001 becomes commercially available or development has stopped.

7.1. Patient Recruitment and Consent
Eligible patients will be identified via prenatal diagnosis of MoCD Type A, or as soon as 
possible after birth, based on genetic evaluation or, if no prenatal diagnosis is made, presentation 
of signs and symptoms consistent with MoCD Type A. The Investigator at each site will be 
responsible for discussing therapeutic options for the patient with his/her parent or legal guardian. 
Should a parent or legal guardian choose to enroll his/her child in this study, he/she will have to 
provide informed consent. Before recruitment and enrollment, the parent or legal guardian of each prospective patient will be given a full explanation of the study by [CONTACT_471144]/her designee and will be allowed to read the approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). After a 
comprehensive description of the protocol, review of the ICF, and all questions have been answered, the patient’s parent or legal guardian will have the opportunity to decide if he/she 
wants the child to participate in the study. Once the Investigator is assured that the patient’s 
parent or legal guardian understands the implications of participating in the study, written informed consent must be obtained. The site will keep the original ICF and provide a copy to the 
parent/legal guardian. After the ICF is signed, the patient will be assessed for eligibility for 
inclusion into the study. Informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any study- related procedures and may be obtained before the Screening/Baseline V isit.  
Legal guardians who have their child diagnosed with MoCD Type A prenatally may be asked to sign a separate ICF to allow study procedures to begin on their child as soon after birth as possible. 
7.2. Patient Inclusion Criteria  
Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria to be considered eligible for enrollment in this study. 
•Male or female neonatal patients (1 to 28 days of age [inclusive] at the time ofORGN001  administration , with day 1 of age corresponding to the day of birth), or
infant (29 days to < 2 years of age) or child (2 to 5 years of age [inclusive]) with
MoCD Type A, previously untreated with  ORGN001 or treated with ORGN001
through the EAP
•In neonates, diagnosis of MoCD Type A, based on:
−Prenatal genetic diagnosis, or
−Onset of clinical  and/or laboratory signs and symptoms consistent with MoCD
Type A (eg, seizures, exaggerated startle response, high-pi[INVESTIGATOR_128528], axial
hypotonia, limb hypertonia, feeding difficulties, elevated urinary sulfite and/or
SSC, elevated xanthine in urine or blood, or low or absent uric acid in the urine or
blood) within the first 28 days after birth
•In infants or children, diagnosis of MoCD Type A, based on:
Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 69 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential  − Confirmed genetic diagnosis (genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of MoCD 
Type A may be obtained after initiation of ORGN001 therapy in certain cases), biochemical profile, and clinical presentation consistent with MoCD Type A 
• Parent or legal guardian must have signed the ICF prior to any study procedures being performed  
7.3. Patient Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be excluded from participating in the study if they meet any of the following 
criteria:  
• Diagnosis other than MoCD Type A (may be determined after the initiation of study 
drug) 
• Condition that is considered by [CONTACT_723563] a contraindication to 
therapy, including evidence of abnormalities on brain imaging not attributable to MoCD, or that might otherwise inter fere with the patient’s participation in the study, 
pose any additional risk for the patient, or confound patient assessments 
• Antenatal and /or postnatal brain  imaging prior to initiation of treatment with 
ORGN001  that indicates cortical  or subcortical cystic encephalomalacia, clinically 
significant intracranial hemorrhage, or other abnormalities on brain imag ing 
determined by [CONTACT_838160] 
• mGCS for Infants and Children score of less than 7 for more than 24 hours (does not apply to children less than 1 day in age) 
7.4. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
The study staff should notify the Sponsor and the site monitor of all study withdrawals as soon as possible. The patient’s parent/legal guardians may withdraw consent at any time. Eve ry effort 
should be made to ensure that the patient’s parents/legal guardians are willing to comply with study participation, prior to conducting the Screening/Baseline procedures. 
Investigators may choose to discontinue a patient’s treatment due to an AE, as well as conditions 
or illnesses that preclude compliance with the protocol from the standpoint of the patient’s safety 
or wellbeing (safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons). Patients may be withdrawn from the 
study for reasons including, but not limited to:  
• Diagnosis other than MoCD Type A  
• The discretion of the I nvestigator, in consultation with the medical monitor/SRC, as 
appropriate, regarding an AE or other medical reason (eg, clinically significant Baseline abnormalities on MRI or brain ultr asound) 
• Patient (and/or parent or legal guardian) request 
• Patient and/or parent or legal guardian is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol requirements  
All patients who discontinue or are withdrawn from the study will be encouraged to complete the S
afety Follow-up Visits 
 following treatment discontinuation, 

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020

CRF and in the source records.  
For patients who are prematurely wit hdrawn from the study due to clinical findings (eg, AE[s]), 
the Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor’s medical monitor. In these patients, AEs 
leading to premature withdrawal must be followed until resolution of the event or the patient is 
determined to be medically stable, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
Patients who withdraw from the study will return to the care of their treating physician .

8.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Prior medications, defined as any drug or substance taken by [CONTACT_25701] [ADDRESS_1164250] study visit, will be recorded on the patient’s CRF.  
Prior procedures, defined as any therapeutic intervention (eg, surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) performed within [ADDRESS_1164251] ORGN001  dose (not to exclude the collection of data on relevant procedures as part of 
Medical History conducted more than 28 days prior to consent), and concomitant procedures, defined as any therapeutic intervention (eg, surgery/biopsy and  physical therapy) performed after 
the first ORGN001  dose drug until completion of the last study visit, will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF. If possible, elective surgical procedures should not be performed during the initial 12-month study period. 
ORGN001  is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in vitro ; therefore, 
concurrent administration of ORGN001  is unlikely to affect systemic exposure of other CYP 
substrates. CYP isoforms responsible for biotransformation of ORGN001  are unknown. 
Changes in a patient’s anticonvulsants, including the reason for the change, will be recorded. 
Adverse events related t o administration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_838146]. 
8.3. Treatment Adherence  
The Investigator or designee must ensure that the parent or legal guardian of each study patient is adequately informed of the study drug regimen required for compliance with the study protocol. Daily infusions of ORGN001  at home will be administered by [CONTACT_102]’s parent or legal 
guardian with the support, . If a

of study drug received, to whom dispensed (patient-by-patient accounting), and accounts of any study drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. 
Unless otherwise notified, all vials, both used and unused, must be saved for study drug 
accountability. At the end of the study, a final reconciliation must be made between the amount of study drug supplied, dispensed, and subsequently destroyed or returned to the Sponsor. 
A written explanation will be provided for any discrepancies. After reconciliation, the 
Investigator must destroy or return all unused vials of study drug, as instructed by [CONTACT_1034]. 
If any study drug supplies are to be destroyed at the site, the Investigator must obtain prior 
approval by [CONTACT_1034]. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor, in writing, of the method, the 
date, and the location of destruction. 
Destruction of unused vials of study drug by [CONTACT_838189], 
state, country, and local regulations. 
9.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
ORGN001  should be handled with care. Aseptic technique should be used for dose preparation. 
In the event of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], use universal precautions for clean-up. Dispose of any spi[INVESTIGATOR_838147]1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020

13.5. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
13.5.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or procedure, that occurs during the study. 
Exacerbations of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including eit her an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition, are all to be considered AEs. 
Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs. If an abnormal laboratory value is identified, 
Investigators are strongly encouraged to report a diagnosis, or a sign or symptom rather than an 
isolated abnormal test value. An abnormal test finding should be documented as an AE if any of the following conditions are met:  
• Is associated with a sign or symptom 
• Requires additional diagnostic testing (repeat tests are not considered additional testing)  
• Requires a medical or surgical intervention 
• Leads to a change in study dosing outside of the protocol-defined dosing or discontinuation from the study 
• Or does not meet any of the defined conditions, but the Investigator or Sponsor considers the result as clinically significant or meeting the definition  of an AE. 
This definition also includes signs or symptoms resulting from misuse or abuse of the product from drug overdose, drug withdrawal, medication error, as well as outside what is foreseen in the protocol, such as drug interactions and extravasation. 
An AE does not include the following:  

Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 82 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. –  Confidential  • Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], tooth extraction, and 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure i s the AE (eg, laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic gall bladder).  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected prior to the Screening/Baseline 
evaluation that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social, and/or convenience admissions)  
13.5.2. Detection of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting all AEs. All 
serious and nonserious AE information will be collected from the time informed consent is 
signed until study completion. 
Adverse events reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or parent or legal guardian, a nd/or identified in 
response to an open- ended question from study personnel, or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical 
examination, or other study procedures, must be collected and recorded as described in 
Section  13.5.3. 
13.5.3. Recording Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs, regardless of causal relationship, must be recorded and reported.  
For all AEs, the Investigator must obtain adequate information i n order to:  
• determine the AE outcome  
• determine if the event meets criteria for an SAE  
• assess the AE severity  
• determine AE causality  
Adverse events  must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical terms. Study personnel are 
to be advised to refrain from using abbreviations or acronyms.  
For each AE, record only the diagnosis on the AE page of the CRF. Do not report the characteristic signs and symptoms of the diagnosis as additional AEs.  
If a diagnosis is not available, record each sign and symptom as a n AE. When a diagnosis 
becomes available, study personnel are to update the AE page of the CRF with relevant diagnosis 
only. 
All AEs that later increase in frequency and/or severity (medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised by [CONTACT_737]) will be considered new AEs and will be recorded on a new line 
on the AE page or the CRF. For medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion), the condition/diagnosis leading to the procedure should be recorded 
as the AE (eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic 
gall bladder). Withdrawal due to an AE or SAE must be clearly differentiated from withdrawal 
due to other reasons.  
Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 83 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. –  Confidential  Initial AEs should be closed out, with an end da te consistent with the date that the AE increased 
in frequency and/or severity. The new AE should be recorded on a new line of the AE page, with 
onset date consistent with the date of increase in frequency and or severity.  
13.5.4. Definition of a Serious Adverse E vent 
Any AE that fulfills any one of the criteria listed below must be recorded as an SAE.  
An SAE or reaction is described as any untoward medical occurrence, that at any dose:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers 
to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18252] . (NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838148]. Adverse events  that are associated 
with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349587]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838149] t he following:  
a. rehabilitation/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]/nursing facility  
b. Emergency room/department visit  less than 24 hours in duration 
c. Elective or preplanned admission/surgery 
d. Protocol -specified admission, or admission for a pre -existing condition not associated 
with either a new AE or with worsening of a pre -existing AE  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Is an important medical event  
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may jeopardize the 
patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not re sult in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency.  
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated. Severity describes the intensity of an event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE, as described above.  
13.5.5. Severity Assessment  
An assessment of severity will be made by [CONTACT_349600]:  
• Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities.  
Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 84 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. –  Confidential  • Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_838150].  
13.5.6. Causality Assessment  
An Investigator causality assessment must be provided for all AEs. This assessment must be 
recorded in the CRF and an y additional forms, as appropriate. The definitions for the causality 
assessments are as follows:  
• Not related (unrelated): this relationship suggests that there is no causal association 
between study drug and the reported event.  
• Unlikely related: this rela tionship suggests that the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_838151] a cause other than the study drug, but attribution cannot be made with absolute 
certainty, and a relationship between the study drug and AE cannot be excluded with 
complete confidence.  
• Possibly related: this relationship suggests that treatment with study drug may have 
caused or contributed to the AE, ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604].  
• Probably related: this relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with study drug administration exists, and the likely causal association of the event with study dr ug. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of 
study drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the study drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the clinical experience of the Investigator.  
• Definitely related: temporal r elationship to the study drug. Other conditions 
(concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of 
disease state) do not appear to explain event, which corresponds with the known 
pharmaceutical profile, improves with study dr ug discontinuation, and/or reappears 
with study drug rechallenge. 
13.5.7. Outcome 
For all AEs, regardless of casual relationships, the Investigator must follow -up on the event 
outcome until the event or sequelae either resolves or stabilizes. 
If a patient experien ces an SAE with an outcome of death:  
• The SAE resulting in death should have an outcome documented as death/fatal, with 
an end date being the date  of death.  
Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 85 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. – Confidential  • If the patient had additional AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death, these 
events would be documented as ongoing with no end date. 
• Only one event should have an outcome of death/fatal, unless an autopsy report or Investigator states otherwise.  
13.5.8. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious  Adverse Event s to Sponsor 
All nonserious AEs must be recorded on the CRF upon awareness. 
All AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to determine if they meet criteria for an SAE. All 
SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately or within [ADDRESS_1164253] provide the following: 
• Clear identification of the Investigator/Reporter with full contact [CONTACT_3031], country 
and site number 
• Subject identification details (subject’s unique study identification number) 
• Investigational Medicinal Product(s) administration details (dose and dates) Seriousness criteria  
• appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed above  
• causality of the serious events 
• outcome of the serious events 
• medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information 
13.5.9. Sponsor  Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current Investigator 
Brochure as the Reference Safety document. Serious adverse event expectedness and reporting 
criteria will be determined by [CONTACT_838190].

15.1. Study Monitoring  
A Sponsor’s representative or designee may visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of facilities and equipment  
• Discuss with the Investigators and other personnel their responsibiliti es with regard to 
protocol adherence, and responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator, as appropriate. 
During the study, a Sponsor’s representative o r designee will have regular contact [CONTACT_838195]: 
• Provide information and support to the Investigators  
• Confirm that facilities and equipment remain acceptable  
• Confirm that all patients have been properly consented 
• Confir m drug accountability  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the CRFs, and that study drug accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of data in the CRFs with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to 
the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, 
clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor  
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs, and confirm that any SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor. Confirm that SAEs meeting criteria for reporting have been forwarded to th e IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigators or other staff needs information or advice.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, an EC, or an IRB may visit the 
site to perform au dits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit 
or inspection by [CONTACT_838196]- related 
activities and documents, to determine whether study- related activities were cond ucted, and 
whether data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported, according to the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Investigators and other study personnel must comply with all instructions and regulations 
specif ied in this protocol, and applicable ICH GCP guidelines, and must conduct this study in 
accordance with all local, federal, and regulatory agency regulations. 
In accordance with ICH guidelines, pediatric participation in these studies should occur in 
quali fied pediatric centers, with personnel who are properly trained and experienced in studying 
the pediatric population, and in evaluating and managing potential pediatric AEs. Site personnel should be knowledgeable and skilled in dealing with the pediatric population and its age-appropriate needs, and be encouraged to use measures that minimize discomfort from 
procedures (eg, topi[INVESTIGATOR_349590], use of indwelling catheters rather than repeated venipunctures for blood sampling, and collec tion of some protocol -specified blood 
samples when routine clinical samples are obtained).  
17.1. Ethics Review  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF, must be approved or given a 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_812104], as appropri ate. The Investigator must submit 
written approval to the Sponsor before he/she can enroll any patient into the study. 
No modifications to the protocol should be made without the approval of both the Investigator 
and the Sponsor. Changes that significantly affect patient safety, the scope of investigation, or 
scientific validity of the study will require IRB/EC notification prior to implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients. Any 
deviatio ns from protocol must be fully documented. The Investigator is responsible for 
informing the IRB or EC of any amendment to the protocol, in accordance with local 
requirements. In addition, the IRB or EC must approve all advertising used to recruit patients  for 
the study. The protocol must be reapproved by [CONTACT_812174], as local regulations require.  
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB/IEC with any reportable serious 
adverse drug reactions from a ny other study conducted with the study drug. The Sponsor will 
provide this information to the Investigator.  
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB 
or EC, according to local regulations and guidelin es. 
17.2. Written Informed Consent  
The Investigator at each center will ensure that the patient's parent or legal guardian is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and possible 
benefit of the study. The pa tient's parent or legal guardian also must be notified that he/she is 
free to discontinue his/her child from the study at any time. The parent or legal guardian should 
be given the opportunity to ask questions and time to consider the information provided.  
The signed and dated ICF must be obtained before conducting any study procedures.  
Protocol ALXN1101- MCD -202 Amendment 4 29 January 2020  
 
 Page 98 of 107 
 Origin Biosciences, Inc. –  Confidential  The Investigators must maintain the original, signed ICF. A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the patient's parent or legal guardian.  
Should new information become ava ilable during the study that might affect parent or legal 
guardian willingness to continue study participation, the parent or legal guardian will be notified in a timely manner about the new information and asked to sign a new ICF.  
17.3. Patient Data Protection  
Prior to performing any study- related procedures, the patient’s parent or legal guardian must 
authorize the release and use of protected health information, as required by [CONTACT_5737], federal, and regulatory agency law.

18.1. Inspection of Records  
The Sponsor or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits for the purpose of monitoring any 
aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, 
study drug stocks, drug accountability records, patient charts, study source documents, and other 
records relative to study conduct. 
18.2. Retention of Records  
The Investigator must maint ain all study -related documentation, in accordance with local 
retention requirements, for a period of [ADDRESS_1164255] permit access to such records. No records may be destroyed without 
Sponsor written approval. 
18.3. Retention of Biological Samples  
If a patient’s parent or legal guardian has provided consent for long-term storage of biological 
samples, and if permitted by [CONTACT_31665], any remaining samples will be stored at 
a central location for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1164256] pati ent’s last study visit, or longer, if 
requested by [CONTACT_12721].  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study samples and data for biochemical analysis will be single-coded. The link between a patient 
enrollment number and any biochemical results will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access. The link will be used to identify relevant samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlation of biochemical results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, 
and trace samples for destruction in the case of consent withdrawal, when the patient or 
consenting guardian has requested disposal/destruction of collected samples not yet analyzed. 
If a patient's parent or legal guardian withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, 
the samples will be destroyed , and the action will be documented. If samples are already 
analyzed, the Sponsor is not obliged to destroy results of this research.

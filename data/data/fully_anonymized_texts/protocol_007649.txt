 2 Primary 1. Pain during injection (1-10) 2. Pain during procedure (1-10)   Secondary 1. Bleeding requiring >[ADDRESS_178400] of care (lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Alternatively, if patient requests standard of care at any point, medication will be switched to this. Immediately following procedure, patient will be asked pain level on [ADDRESS_178401] of care will be noted. Bleeding level (Mild, moderate, or severe) will be noted. Mild is defined as not needing pressure to stop. Moderate is defined as needing five minutes or pressure to stop. Severe is defined as needing cautery or a pressure patch. Immediately following injection, patient will be asked pain level on 0 to 10 scale.   Statistical Plan   Pain of injection and pain of procedure are recorded on a categorical scale and compared using Student T-Tests. Percent of lesions requiring reinjection and percentage of lesions with “severe” bleeding were compared using Chi-square tests. To see if lesions size had any effect on these metrics, the lesions will be divided into < 1 mm, 1-5 mm, and > 5 mm, and analysis will be repeated on these groups.   References   1.

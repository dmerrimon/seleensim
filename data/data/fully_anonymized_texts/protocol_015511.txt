4 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Our long -term goal  is to identify strategies for the prevention and treatment of 
diabetes . Exercise is a key factor in mitigati ng diabetic complications. However, the 
molecular foundations  of the effects of exercise on diabetes are largely unknown  (Figure 
1). Our lab ’s specific focus is  the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) 
and its ligand (advanced glycation end products [AGE]).  Activation of RAGE , via binding 
of AGEs and other ligands, regula tes the development and progression of diabetic 
complications through persistent intercellular signaling (i.e.,  NF-Kβ) [1]. Targeting RAGE 
directly as a therapeutic strategy has largely been unsuccessful. However, RAGE 
signaling can be interrupted, in vivo,  by [CONTACT_17873]10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase  10) 
[2, 3] , thus creating a soluble isoform of RAGE (sRAGE) that is released from the cell and 
appears into the circulation [3]. Maintaining high levels of circulating sRA GE is 
advantageous as sRAGE  sequester s RAGE ligands and prevent cell signaling [4-8]. 
Isoforms of sRAGE (cleaved [cRAGE ] and endogenous secretory  [esRAGE ]), are 
decreased in inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D M) and coronary 
artery disease, while treatment with recombinant sRAGE, suppresses atherosclerosis 
and vascular dysfunction in animal models of diabetic coronary artery disease  [4, 9, 10] . 
Thus,  targeting mechanisms that promote sRAGE generation  are worth consideration for 
the prevention and treatment  of diabetic complications such as coronary artery disease  
and microvascular disease [9, 11] .

inflammatory signaling toprevail resulting inmicrovascular disease. Regulation ofADAM 10
expression and activity ismediated through exercise and acitretin treatment. Exercise increases
NAD:NADH ratio stimulating SIRT1 activity leading todeacetylation ofRARβ and subsequent
ADAM 10expression. Exercise also increases intracellular calcium, activating calcium sensitive
kinases tophosphorylate ADAM 10ata novel serine residue increasing ADAM 10catalytic activity
which cleaves membrane bound RAGE. Acitretin displaces all trans retinoic acid (atRA) from its
binding protein, CRABPI/II, allowing free atRA todiffuse into nucleus thus activating RXR/RARβ
binding. RXR/RARβ complex binds to the ADAM 10promoter, increasing ADAM 10expression.

Figure [ADDRESS_16789] mechanisms of ADAM10 mediated RAGE release  remain 
undefined, calcium related [2, 3]  and other signaling (SIRT1) impact  ADAM10  [12]. 
Aerobic exercise (AE) presents a unique model for mechanistic study of RAGE release  
as muscle contraction induces robust calcium signaling [13], activates SIRT1 [14-16], and 
provides stimuli for tissue remodeling and resolution of the metabolic profile  that drives 
inflammation [17-21]. Our preliminary data  show acute  AE increases muscle biopsy 
derived  ADAM10 activity  in lean healthy individuals . We have also show n acute  AE 
increases plasma cRAGE in obese, normal glucose tolerant, impaired glucose tolerant , 
and T2D M subjects, while chronic  AE (12  weeks) increases skeletal muscle ADAM10 
protein expression, and reduces RAGE protein expression in obese impaired glucose 
tolerant  subjects. These findings support the need to explore the effects and molecular 
foundations  of AE on AGE -RAGE biology in humans with T2DM.  
 
Rationale  
The rationale for this study  was generated using the existing literature base 
coupled with our preliminary data. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_17862] , we derived a n aerobic exercise  model to test our 
central hypothesis that skeletal muscle RAGE release  with regular physical activity (via 
ADAM10) is a quantitatively important source of sRAGE appearance into the circulation.  
Once the mechanisms of ADAM10 activation  and sRAGE generation are elucidated, 
progress towards the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications may be possible.  
 
Potential Risks and Benefits  
Overall, few potential risks exist. These relate to skeletal muscle biopsies, local 
anesthetic  delivery , blood draws, microdialysis  of muscle , glucose and insulin infusion, 
strenuous aerobic exercise, body composition  assessment  (DEXA scan), and data 
confidentiality . Specific details on these potential risks and strategies to mitigate their 
occurrence are discussed  in Assessment of Safety  and Adverse Events . 
The potential direct benefits include improved health as a result of exercise training 
and potential educational benefits associated with current health status, healthy eating, 
and exercise/physical activity.  Each participant  may gain knowledge of current health 
status as determined by [CONTACT_17874] . The benefit to society w ill include an 
improved understanding of the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) development and 
the treatment of diabetes and reduction  of cardiovascular disease risk . Data from this 
study may also help determine an effective approach  to prevent the progression of obesity 
and obesity -related disease s and inflammatory conditions . The minimal  potential  risks are 
outweighed by [CONTACT_17875].  
 
Study Objectives  
1)  Test the effects of chronic aerobic exercise versus standard care alone  on sRAGE in 
the circulation of adults with T2DM.  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
6 2) Test the effects of chronic aerobic exercise versus standard care  alone  on RAGE  in 
skeletal muscle  of adults with T2D M. 
 
Study Outcome s 
The global construct of this study is to provide insight into the role of aerobic 
exercise  on muscle health in the context of RAGE biology . Due to the implication of RAGE 
signaling, findings of this study may  guide the development of therapeutic modalities  for 
T2DM .  
 
Study Hypotheses  
Our central hypothesis is that skeletal muscle contributes to  sRAGE appearance 
in the circulation and maintenance of healthy levels of total sRAGE promotes 
cardiometabolic health . Therefore , two specific working hypotheses have been  proposed.  
1) Circulating sRAGE levels will increase following 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise 
training and this change will be related to reduced muscle RAGE expression and 
increases  in insulin sensitivity and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].  
2) Skeletal muscle expression of RAGE will decrease following 12 -weeks of aerobic 
exercise  training  and this change  will be related to increases  in circulating sRAGE,  
insulin sensitivity , and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
Figure 2  provides a  general  framework  of the study design. This 12-week clinical 
study  involve s the testing and training  of middle age to older ( 40 - 75 y), overweight or 
obese adults (BMI 26 - 44 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes  (T2DM) . Sixty subjects will be 
randomized to [ADDRESS_16790] care ( Aerobic Exercise 
group ; n=30 ) or standard care only (Control group; n=30) . Subjects randomized to the 
Control group will be given the option of  an off -label exercise intervention. Therefore, 
Control group participants will be allowed to enroll in the AE training group after 
completion of the original Control group trial period.  All subjects will  undergo the same 
baseline and post  testing for basal metabolic rate, maximal aerobic capa city (VO 2max), 
body composition , insulin sensitivity, and microdialysis sampling  coupled with muscle 
biopsies  during an acute aerobic exercise  trial before . 
Due to the complexity of this study , an interdisciplinary research team with 
experience in clinical trials, pathophysiology of, and research in obesity, insulin resistance 
and T2DM, vascular function, aerobic exercise  testing/training, clinical medicine, 
biotechnology , and advanced biostatistics  has been assembled . The research staff h as 
many years (> 10 y) of direct research  experience with human subjects and have been 
trained by [CONTACT_17876].

8 Primary Outcome Measure  
1) Quantify the change in basal circulating sRAGE  after 12 -weeks of supervised aerobic 
exercise training.  
Serum  will be separated from blood samples  collected in vacutainer tubes  via 
centrifugation before and after 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise training. sRAGE will 
be quantified in these serum  samples via ELISA ( Quantikine, Human RAGE 
Immunoassay ) per manufacture’s protocol . 
 
Secondary Outcome Measures  
1) Quantify the change in basal muscle RAGE  expression after 12 -weeks of supervised 
aerobic exercise training . 
Basal b iopsy derived skeletal muscle RAGE expression will be determined  from 
the vastus lateralis  before and after 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise training . RAGE 
expression will be quantified via Western Blot. Muscle samples (~10 mg) will be 
homogenized and protein concentration will be determined via BCA assay 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835]). Samples (20 μg protein ) will be diluted in SDS buffer, heated at 85 °C for 
5 min, resolved via SDS -PAGE (Bio -Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)  and 
transferred to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane . Blocking will occur for 1 h and 
primary antibody (RAGE ; Abcam, Cambr idge, MA ) incubation will occur overnight 
at 4 °C  and quantified vs a standard or total protein . 
 
2) Quantify the change in aerobic capacity ( VO 2max) after 12 -weeks of supervised 
aerobic exercise training . 
Maximal oxygen consumption ( VO 2max) will be established via indirect calorimetry 
during an incremental treadmill test (Cornell protocol ) before and after 12 -weeks 
of aerobic exercise training . Criteria, such as, rating of perceived exertion >18, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] >1.1 0, no further increase in VO 2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_17865], heart rate greater than age -predicted maximum, or volitional fatigue will 
be used to indicate a successful VO 2max was achieved.  
 
3) Quantify the change in insulin sensitivity  after 12 -weeks of supervised aerobic exercise 
training . 
Insulin sensitivity will be established via hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clam p 
before and after 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise training. After the initial basal period  
of this procedure , a primed -continuous infusion (40mU/m2/min) of human insulin 
will be initiated and maintained for a period of 120 min. Glucose levels will be 
clamped at 90 mg/dL by [CONTACT_2363] a variable glucose infusion (20% dextrose). Blood 
glucose will be measured every 5 min to monitor levels and used to adjus t the 
variable glucose infusion rat e. The clamp procedure will be completed after the 
120-min period of hyperinsulinemia or until steady state glucose concentration is 
achieved.

9 ELLIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT  
A total of 60 adults, (approximately 30 males and 30 females)  will complete  this 
study. Subjects must be weight stable (± 2 kg for ≥6 months) , sedentary (<30 min of 
exercise, 3 times per w eek), and free of any additional contraindications to participation 
in exercise testing or the training . Selection criteria will limit confounding influence on the 
study objectives  and exclude  subjects with conditions that may have unknown effects on 
metabolic function and the outcomes proposed or the ability to participate in the aerobic 
exercise intervention or testing procedures . Criteria will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_17877]/or study physician  and eligibility to participate  will be determined on a case by [CONTACT_17878] .

Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Subjects will be recruited from the greater Ann Arbor area  through multiple 
mechanisms. Primarily, study advertisements will be posted and distributed throughout 
the communities surrounding the University of Michigan . In addition, we will utilize our 
clinical collaborations within the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism  to strengthen 
our ability to identify and recruit potential volunteers. We plan to advertise  and seek 
potential volunteers  through  word of mouth,  the Data Office for Clinical and Transl ational 
Research , MDRC Diabetes Research Registry, the website of the School  of Kinesiology , 
newspaper,  postal mail, and social media outlets . In our previous studies, we have not 
experienced difficulty recruiting individuals for muscle biopsy or metabolic procedures.  
 
Screening P rocedures  
Initial screening of participants will occur via a website screening tool  or telephone 
interview . During this time, the study will be described in detail and we will obtain 
information about age, body mass index (BMI), smoking and physical activity status, 
current medical conditions, health status and medications , along with other eligibility 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
10 criteria . Subjects who meet the initial screening criteria will be scheduled fo r a complete 
screening at  the Michiga n Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) , Frankel Cardiovascular Center  
(CVC ), Domino Farms , or the Central Campus Recreation Building ( CCRB ). At this time, 
more specific details about the study will be provided along with answers to any questions. 
Each study procedure and all possible risks related to these procedures will be explained 
along with  sample exercise programs and explana tion of  the random ization methods of 
the study. Verb al and written informed consent  will be obtained during this initial visit 
according to the guidelines of our Institutional Review Board.  A study team member  will 
perform a comprehensive medical history . Additionally, participants will complete  a 
venipuncture blood draw and urine collection for laboratory assessment of complete blood 
count (CBCD), comprehensive metabolic panel (COMP), urinary analysis (UA), urinary 
microalbumin (UMA), hemoglobin A1C (A1C), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and 
lipid panel . Females will also be asked to provide urine for a pregnancy test (for pre -
menopausal women). In addition, participants will complete a supervised 12-lead resting 
electrocar diogram  and graded exercise stress test  (with VO 2) at the CVC  or Domino 
Farms . EKG test results will be reviewed by a study  physician . If any blood work or EKG 
results are clinically significant, the participant  will be  notified and  referred to their 
personal physician for additional evaluation prior to further consideration for participation 
in this study. Baseline food intake will be assessed from diet history including multiple 
replicate 24 -hour recalls to estimate usual intake, c ustomary eating pattern,  and food 
frequency questionnaires. After confirmation of the participant meeting all  inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, participants will be enrolled into the study intervention.  
 
STUDY INTERVENTION  
Intervention Description  
This study ’s intervention includes 12 weeks (1 week) of supervised aerobic 
exercise training for the group randomized to Aerobic Exercise. The Control group will not 
be subject to an intervention as they will receive standard care only (see Standard Care ). 
Subjects randomized to the Control group will be given the option of an off -label exercise 
intervention. Therefore, Control group participants will be allowed to enroll in the AE 
training group after completion of the original Control group trial period.  
 
Group  Assignment Procedure  
Following enrollment into the study, participants will be randomized into either the 
Aerobic Exercise group (n=30) or Control group  (n=[ADDRESS_16791] care for diabetes management.

11 Aerobic  Exercise Training  
Every AE training  session will be supervised by [CONTACT_17879] [22-28]. Training sessions will take place at the Central Campus 
Recreation Building  (CCRB) , Domino Farms, or other  University of Michigan recreation 
facility (e.g., North Campus Recreation Building)  approximately 5 days per week and 
include treadmill walking, cycling, elliptical , or other related mode s of exercise. Briefly, AE 
training will begin with a 2-week ramp -up, familiarization  period of progressing exercise 
intensity and duration.  Training intensity will progress from 55% VO 2max  for week 1 (40 
min session), to 60 -65% VO 2max  for week 2 (50 min session), to ~70% VO 2max for all 
other weeks (50 min session).  Subjects will perform a brief warm -up and cool-down (~5 
min each) that may include stretching  or other light  exercises for a total exercise time of 
60 min. Subjects will wear heart rate monitors during each training session to provide 
real-time feedback of target heart rate.  Intensity, duration, resting and exercise heart 
rates, and blood pressures will be recorded for each session . Exercise duration and 
intensity may be adjusted at the discretion of the PI, Co -I, or study  team member. Follow -
up VO 2max tests will be  performed at approximately weeks 4 and 8 to monitor progress. 
AE intensity will be adjusted to match the prescribed training intensity  [23, 24, 29 -32]. 
Subjects in the AE training group will also conduct foot safety  checks with the research 
team to monitor foot ulcers/ blisters. Relevant findings during foot inspections will be 
addressed with the participant and study physician. Non -weight bearing exercise may be 
implemented if the subject is limited.  
As a contingency, exercise training may be done remotely. At the PI , research 
team member,  or study physician’s discretion, participants may conduct exercise training 
at their residence, local gym, or other appropriate facility. During these training sessions, 
a study team member will communicate with the participant  prior to the session  and 
discuss the goals and training plan . More specifically, a team member will discuss where 
the session is to occur, the duration of the session, mode of exercise, and exe rcise 
intensity.  During the session, a team member may monitor exercise via telephone or 
video chat (e.g., zoom). Exercise intensity is monitored via a HR monitor. Each participant 
wears a Polar HR monitor watch for the duration of the study and is familiarized with its 
use. If a remote session is to occur, the participant will be sent home with a  heart rate 
strap that communicates with the watch to give HR feedback (i.e., via mail, during visit to 
the lab, or meeting a local establishment , etc). HR is dig itally recorded and downloaded 
as described elsewhere (another form of monitoring exercise).   
 
Standard Care  
All subjects will receive standard care for diabetes management as directed by 
[CONTACT_17880] , Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes position statement, 201 8 [33]. All 
newly diagnosed subjects with type [ADDRESS_16792] extensive experience managing clinical trials in the 
proposed population [26, 30, 34, 35] . However, we recognize participants interests , 
health , and schedules may change.  The research team’s best effort will be made to 
accommodate the participants needs  and minimize attrition . The following are potential 
reasons for withdrawal:  
• Time Commitment : Some participants may find the time commitment associated 
with this study  too burdensome for their schedule. The study coordinator will 
discuss this time commitment prior to enrollment.   
• Schedule Conflicts:  Some participants may find it difficult to determine times  they 
are available to come in for study visits. The study coordinator will also discuss 
preferred visit start times prior to enrollment to limit potential schedule conflicts.  
• Discomfort:  Participants may experience  discomfort during blood and tissue 
sampling procedures and wish to discontinue the study. Prior to enrollment, the 
study coordinator will discuss all procedures and answer any questions 
participants may have concerning sampling procedures.  
• Unforeseen Reasons:  There may be other reasons participants may withdrawal 
from the research study that are unknown at this time.  
 
Handling of Withdrawals  
The p articipants right to withdraw from the study will be respected and will occur 
within the timeframe they request. In the event of a participant withdrawal, s amples and 
data collected during their participation wi ll be stored for future use or destroyed, based 
on the participants request . 
 
Termination of Study  
The research  staff reserves the right to suspend/terminate subject’s participation 
in this study  at any time . This decision will be communicated to the participant and a 
reasonable  effort will be made to mitigate/avoid this outcome. Potential study 
suspension/termination reasons include:  
• Ineligibility : The subject’s eligib ility changes during the study  
• Safety : The research has beco me harmful to the participant  
• Health : The subject’s health condition changes and requires treatment w hich 
affects the study outcomes  
• Incompliance : Subject fails to follow the study guidelines  
• Cancelation : The research study is canceled or suspended  
 
 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ADDRESS_16793] ( approximately 5 days/week) with subjects in the 
Aerobic Exercise group and will meet approximately twice monthly  with the control group 
to monitor habits  and study progress . We have found these interactions are indispensable  
for study adherence.  
 
Concomitant Medications  
Subjects participating in this study will be diagnosed with  T2DM and therefore have 
unique medical needs. In addition to the screening provided in this study , each participant 
will be encouraged follow  their personal physician’s  guidance . Prior to  and during the 
intervention period , all medication use, dose and frequency will be documented  
 
Assessment of Subject Compliance with Study Intervention  
Subject  compliance will be regularly  assessed and documented by [CONTACT_17881]. Participants enrolled in the AE group will have contact [CONTACT_17882]  [ADDRESS_16794] with the research 
team approximately twice per month. Compliance will be determined  through routine 
personal communication and primarily evaluated  based  on exercise training attendance 
(Aerobic Exercise group only), physical activity tracking , and dietary monitoring . Subjects 
in the Aerobic Exercise group are expected to complete >80% of the training sessions 
over the course of the [ADDRESS_16795] screening and enrollment based on established incl usion and 
exclusion criteria and randomization to 12 weeks of Aerobic Exercise training or Control 
Period (both including established Standard Care practices).  Participants will all complete 
the same baseline testing  and final study visit testing .  Subjects randomized to the AE 
group will also undergo follow -up testing  at weeks 4 and 8 (1 week) to adjust exercise 
training parameters . All testing will occur at the Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) , 
Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) , Domino Farms,  Frankel 
Cardiovascular Center (CVC),  and/or Central Campus Recreation Building  (or other 
University recreation building ) and based on subject schedules,  will include a total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_16796]’s schedule, study team,  experimental approach,  
and/or clinic availability,  some procedures may be excluded  or adjusted  from any given 
visit. Excluded or adjusted procedures will be at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I and will 
not be considered a protocol deviation . 
 
Subject Screening  
Initial screening of participants will occur via a website screening tool  or telephone 
interview . During this time, the study will be described in detail and we will obtain 
information about age , body mass index (BMI), smoking and physical activity status, 
current medical conditions, health status and medications. Subjects who meet the initial 
screening criteria will be  scheduled fo r a complete screening at the MCRU , CVC , Domino 
Farms , and/or CCRB . Verbal and written informed consent will be obtained during  this 
Figure [ADDRESS_16797]. All screening findings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_17883](s) (or CVC/Domino Farms physician) when appropriate.  
 
Baseline  Testing  
Baseline testing procedures will be supervised by [CONTACT_17884] , CVC, Domino Farms, CCRB, and/or NORC . Testing include s 
measurement of basal metabolic rate, maximal aerobic capacity, cognitive assessment 
questionnaire (NIH ToolBox ), body composition,  OGTT , and insulin sensitivity . In addition, 
the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity and Seven Day Physical Activity Recall 
Questionnaires will be administered to assess habitual physical activity levels. Subjects 
will also undergo an acute aerobic exercise b out ( treadmill walking ) coupled with 
microdialysis  and muscle biopsies . Each of these testing procedures are critical for 
completion of the study objectives and evaluation of  the study hypotheses.  
 
Basal Metabolic Rate  
Basal metabolic rate will be measured  at Domino Farms , MCRU,  CCRB, or CVC  
by [CONTACT_17885]/or  medical staff. Subjects will  initially  rest quietly in their room 
for ~30 min.  We will then measure their basal  metabolic rate using a canopy -equipped  
metabolic cart for ~20 min.    
 
Maximal Aerobic Capacity  
Maximal oxygen consumption ( VO 2max) will be captured during the GXT and will  
be used as the criterion measure of aerobic capacity (i.e., physical fitness) . The VO 2max 
test will be performed using a Cornell (or similar) protocol at Domino Farms  or the CVC . 
Measurements of VO 2max and maximal heart rate (HR max) will be performed at baseline 
and following the 12 -week intervention period  (interim visit , approximately one week  
before the final study visit ). In the Aerobic Exercise  group, baseline VO 2max will used to 
determine the starting  training intensity and VO 2max tests will be repeated at 
approximately [ADDRESS_16798] target HR.  The control 
group will also return at approximately weeks 4 and 8 as well, as a blood draw (~20 ml) 
will also be taken for all individuals at these time intervals.  
 
Metabolic Control Period  
The m etabolically sensitive p re- and post-intervention insulin sensitivity 
assessment (glucose clamp ) will be performed  during a 1-night  inpatient stay at MCRU  
(two 1-night  stays  total over the course of the study ). The goal of this overnight stay is to 
control metabolism to increase outcome validity  of the insulin sensitivity assessment.  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
16 Participants will be asked to reside in the MCRU  for 1 night  and will receive a weight -
maintenance isocaloric diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein) provided by 
[CONTACT_17886] /NORC m etabolic kitchen . Subjects will be asked to refrain from 
physical activity outside of their normal activities of daily living during this control period  
Additionally, subjects will complete an OGTT , questionnaires, body composition ( DEXA 
scan ), and acute exercise test  within ~1 week of this overnight visit at the CVC, MCRU, 
CCRB, and/or Domino Farms . Metabolic meas ures will be performed >[ADDRESS_16799] 
exercise bout. This approach has been successfully used by [CONTACT_17887] [23-28, 31, 35 -37]. 
 
Cognitive Assessment  
 Participants will complete an NIH developed cognitive assessment tool ( ToolBox) 
to evaluate cognition on an iPad. This assessment will be administered  by [CONTACT_17881] . [CONTACT_17909] MD (Neurology) will oversee administration and interpretation 
of this assessment tool.  
 
Body Composition   
Body composition will be assessed by [CONTACT_751]-emission X -ray absorptiometry  
(DEXA) . DEXA scans determine components of body composition such as bone mineral 
density, lean body mass, fat mass, and segmental adiposity such as truncal fat and 
visceral fat mass.  DEXA scans will be performed in the MCRU by [CONTACT_17888] a 
member of the study team.  
 
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test  (OGTT)  
 This standard test is utilized to detect and confirm the presence of diabetes. Briefly, 
a polyethylene catheter will be  inserted into an antecubital  or dorsal  hand  vein and the 
subject will drink a beverage containing 75 g of glucose. If a catheter is not successfully 
inserted, venipuncture for blood collection  may be implemented . In addition,  finger -sticks  
may also be utilized  to assess blood glucose levels . A baseline blood draw will precede 
the consumption of the glucose drink along with blood draws approximately every  30 min 
for 3 h.  Current use of physician confirmed diabetes medication, fasting glucose values ≥ 
126 mg/dL and 2 hr OGTT values ≥ 200 mg/dL will be used as the criteria for type 2 
diabetes  [38]. Blood samples will be collected and immediately transferred to vacutainers, 
centrifuged, and stored at -80°C until analysis for blood glucose and insulin 
concentrations.  OGTTs will take place at MCRU , CCRB, or Domino Farms  and will be 
supervised by [CONTACT_17889] . 
 
Measurement of Insulin Sensitivity   
Whole body insulin sensitivity will be assessed using a 40  mU/m2/min 
hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic ( glucose 90 mg/dL) clamp procedure as described 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
17 previously and used routinely by [CONTACT_5051]  [23-27, 31, 34, 35] . Briefly, a 
polyethylene catheter will be  inserted into an antecubital vein f or infusion of insulin and 
glucose . A second catheter will be  inserted ret rograde into a dorsal hand vein with the 
hand warmed in a heated box for  blood  sampling [39]. Once catheters have been inserted , 
basal blood draws  will take place . After the basal period, a primed -continuous infusion 
(40 mU/m2/min) of human insulin will be  initiated and maintained for a period of 
approximately 120 min.  Glucose levels will be clamped at approximately 90 mg/dL by [CONTACT_17890] a variable glucose infusion (20% dextrose). Blood glucose will be measured 
approximately every [ADDRESS_16800] the variable glucose 
infusion rate. The clamp procedure will be completed after once  steady state glucose 
concentration is achieved. Upon completion, insulin infusion will be  discontinued whi le 
glucose infusion is continued until  plasma glucose stabilizes . A comprehensive metabolic 
panel (COMP) will be assessed before and after the clamp procedure.  In addition, the 
subject will be provided with a post -clamp meal or snack that consists of carbohydrate 
and protein to further maintain  blood glucose ( e.g., juice,  sandwich ). This procedure will 
take place at MCRU.  
 
Urine Collection  
Subjects will be asked to collect their urine starting at approximately 4:00am on 
the morning of the  hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic  procedure . Urine samples will be 
collected in standard urine collection vessel . Total volume and time of collection will be 
recorded.  
 
Skeletal Muscle Biopsy  
The modified muscle biopsy technique was introduced nearly 60 years ago [40] 
and is a fundamental component of muscle health research (e.g., insulin sensitivity, 
inflammation). This technique is used commonly in the medical research field ( as 
indicated by [CONTACT_17891]  [e.g., NIH funded MoTrPAC]) and is currently  utilized 
at the University of Michigan . Members of the  research team have  been involved with  
muscle biopsies for ~ 15 y, totaling  >500 muscle biopsies in populations including athletes, 
elderly, obese, type 2 diabetics [23, 35, 41 -46]. [CONTACT_17910] , PhD and [CONTACT_17911] , PhD will perform the muscle biopsies which are critical to completion of this 
study’s objectives.  
Muscl e biopsies will be obtained before and within  [ADDRESS_16801] care periods  ([ADDRESS_16802]) . Muscle samples (~200 mg; approximately the size of a pea) will be obtained 
from the vastus lateralis  muscle  (thigh muscle)  following local anesthetic delivery using 
the modified muscle biopsy technique  [40, 41, 44, 47] . Muscle tissue will be  quickly 
trimmed of excess connective tissue and fat, blo tted with gauze to remove blood and 
processed specific to future analysis. Subjects will be  instructed on how to care for the 
wound and  supplied with ice and pressure bandages after each biopsy to reduce 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
18 inflammation and any soreness . A member of the research team will follow -up with each 
participant the day after a muscle biopsy.  
 
SOP for skeletal muscle biopsy  
• Anti-coagulant  medication  (e.g.,  Coumadin,  Rivaroxaban)  and Lidocaine  
allergy/sensitivity  are exclusion  criteria  for the biopsy  procedure  
Before  performing  the tissue  biopsies,  [CONTACT_17912] (or his qualified  co-investigator  who is 
performing  the biopsies)  will: 
1) Confirm  the participant’s  identification  
2) Thoroughly  explain  the biopsy  procedures  to the participant,  describing  what  they 
may experience  during  the procedures.  
3) Confirm  the location  of the procedures  (e.g.,  left or right thigh  for muscle  biopsy ) 
Skeletal  Muscle  Biopsy  Procedure   
• Confirm  that the participant  does  not have  any known  allergies/sensitivity  to local 
anesthetic  (e.g.,  Lidocaine/Xylocaine /bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ) – this should  also have  been  
addressed  before/during  informed  consent  process  
• If necessary,  shave  ~5” x ~5” square  above  the vastus  lateralis  
• Put on surgical  gown,  mask  and bonnet  (assistants  in procedure  room  also must  
wear  mask  and bonnet)  
• Disinfect  skin above  the vastus  lateralis  with betadine  or chlorohexadine  
• Put on sterile  gloves  and all the following  procedures  must  be performed  using  
aseptic  technique  
• Create  sterile  field on tray top and around  the antiseptic  covered  area of the 
participant’s  thigh  
• Infiltrate  skin and underlying  tissue  with approve  analgesic  using  a 25g x 1.5” or 
similar  needle  (For example,  if using  lidocaine  ~5-10 ml will be administered : total 
dose  of lidocaine  not to exceed  4.5mg/kg)  
• Make  an incision  above  the vastus  lateralis  with a #10 or #11 scalpel  (cut skin and 
try to cut fascia  if possible)  
• Apply  pressure  to incision  site with sterile  gauze  until bleeding  stops  (or is very 
light)   
• While  pressure  is being  applied  to the thigh,  the biopsy  assistant  attaches  a 3-way 
stopcock  to a 60cc  or similar  syringe  
• One end of sterile  pressure  tubing  is attached  to the sterilized  biopsy  needle  (4-5g 
Bergstrom  or UCH  biopsy  needle),  and the other  end of the tubing  is handed  to the 
assistant  to attach  to their 3-way stopcock  to syringe  (or similar)  set-up for suction  
• The biopsy  needle  is inserted  into the incision  with firm pressure , the biopsy  needle  
is inserted  past the fascia,  in the location/direction  of the applied  anesthetic   
• Once  the biopsy  needle  is fully inserted,  the biopsy  assistant  pulls back  firmly  on 
the plunger  of the syringe  to apply  steady  suction  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
19 • The sample  is collected  by [CONTACT_17892]  – To increase  sample  
yield,  the biopsy  needle  can be quickly  rotated  then opened  and closed  3-5 times  
to obtain  a few “snips”  of sample  before  removing  the biopsy  needle  from the thigh  
• The sample  is placed  on a sterile  absorbent  pad, and pressure  is applied  to the 
biopsy  site with sterile  gauze   
• The biopsy  assistant  quickly  rinses/cleans  the sample  and gently  dabs  the sample  
on the absorbent  pad to remove  excess  liquid  
• The sample  is processed  according  to PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]  
• While  research  team  member  is cleaning  and storing  the sample,  manual  pressure  
is applied  to the incision  site 
• The biopsy  procedure  can be repeated  in the same  incision  site (or separate  pre-
prepared  site) if more  tissue  is needed   
• When  the entire  biopsy  procedure  is finished,  firm direct  pressure  is applied  to the 
incision  site until bleeding  stops  (~10 minutes)  
• Incision  site is cleaned  with 70% ethanol  and dried  with sterile  gauze  
• The incision  is closed  with steri-strips  or equivalent  and an overlaying  transparent  
dressing   
• A pressure  dressing  is applied  to the thigh  until bedtime  the night  of the biopsy  
procedure  
• Participant  is instructed  to avoid  water  submersion  for [ADDRESS_16803] information.  
Acute Aerobic Exercise Bout: Treadmill Walking  
Subjects will complete an acute aerobic exercise bout  coupled with muscle 
biopsies and adipose microdialysis  at baseline and following the 12 -week intervention 
period. This exercise bout includes 60 min of treadmill walking at ~65-70% of their 
predetermined VO 2max (VO 2max will be measured approximately one week prior to the 
acute exercise bout) . The acute exercise bout is considered “moderate” intensity, given 
the relatively low heart rate maintained and muscles utilized. Subjects will be familiarized 
to the protocol before testing.  For all acute exercise  trial sessions, heart rate and oxygen 
consumption will be monitored to assess the exercise intensity.  The acute aerobic 
exercise bouts will be performed at MCRU  or Domino Farms and supervised by [CONTACT_17893] a study physician on -call.

20 Microdialysis  
Our lab has experience with the microdialysis technique and has published muscle 
specific microdialysis data with acute aerobic exercise  in human subjects  [48]. We have  
also enlisted the expertise of Dr . Robert Hickner, PhD  ([LOCATION_012] State  University ) to provide 
consultation  on microdialysis best practices and interpretation of data generated. [CONTACT_17913] is a microdialysis expert 
who is one of the original 
developers of the microdialysis 
methodology in skeletal muscle  
nearly 25 years ago [49].  
 Microdialysis catheters 
mimic blood capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (Figure 
4). Substances from the 
extracellular space can be 
collected into the catheter. The 
timeline of microdial ysis events 
are portrayed in Figure 5. Two, 
small,  M Dialysis 71 high cut -off 
microdialysis catheters will be 
inserted into the  abdominal 
subcutaneous adipose bed  (no 
closer than 3 in to the 
umbilicus ). The microdialysis 
probes will be perfus ed with 
sterile water at 0.3 µl/ min for [ADDRESS_16804] with the inlet and outlet tubing 
capped, which is secured to the leg overnight. The timing of the probe insertion  
(approximately 12 h r before the resting measurements) is to ensure that the resting 
measurements are  not influenced by [CONTACT_17894] [50, 51] . The following morning 
each subject will undergo the baseline measurement of resting adipose tissue  sRAGE 
collected by [CONTACT_17895] . The microdialysis probes are perfused with a sterile 
solution supplemented with 37 g/ L dext ran-70. Dextran is used to assure there is no net 
fluid transport across the microdialysis membrane [52, 53] . Therefore, the subjects do not 
come into contact [CONTACT_17896] . Samples will be  collected in sealed microvials 
that are pre -weighed before and after each collection period to determine actual dialysate 
weight and calculate dialysate volume. At the start of each microdialysis measurement, 
each probe is reconnected to the perfusion pum p and perfused with sterile water for 10 
minutes at 0.3 µl/min and then at 0.3 µl/ min for [ADDRESS_16805]-acute aerobic exercise .  Subjects will be  instructed on how to care for the wound 
and supplied with ice and pressure bandages after to reduce inflammation and any 
soreness .

Initial Exercise Bout (moderate treadmill walking ) 
Upon completion of the baseline testing period, all subjects will be asked to 
undergo  a single, modest treadmill aerobic exercise bout (65% VO 2max for 30 minutes). 
Prior to this trial, each participant will have been  medically cleared for exercise based on 
screening criteria. This treadmill bout will be supervised by a member of the research 
team and may be completed at CCRB, Domino Farms, or MCRU (or other appropriate 
University facility).  Participants will be familiarized with the protocol , In addition to 
intermittent oxygen consumption evaluation, subjects will be fitted with a heart rate 
monitor to track exercise intensity.  Each subject will have a simple blood draw before and 
after the trial (~ 80 ml total). This e xercise will count as the first exercise training session 
for subjects randomized to the training group  and subjects randomized to the Control 
group will be advised to resume normal daily activit y and standard of care for the duration 
of the study.  
 
 
Follow -up Testing  
All subjects  will return for  follow-up testing at  approximately  week s [ADDRESS_16806] a blood draw ( ~20 ml) and the AE group will also complete a VO 2max 
test to adjust target HR for the training protocol.  
 
Final Study Visit Testing  
The final study visit  at MCRU  or Domino Farms  will include the same testing 
procedures for both groups that were completed  during baseline testing  (i.e., body

Assessment of Safety  
The risk to benefit ratio for this study is excellent. Overall, the risks are minor with 
the information gained on the impact of exercise on diabetes invaluable. Safety will be 
regularly monitored  through personal communication, observation, and documentation . 
Each individual  involved in this study will be encouraged to communicate needs and any 
potential issues that arise.  
 
Adverse Events  
Members of the research team  will be present f or all components of the study to 
monitor safety. Additionally , the research team  will communicate  weekly  for review of 
safety and data collection . In the situation of an adverse event, the event will be 
immediately managed an IRBMED  Adverse Event Report Form  will be sent to the 
appropriate clinical site  and Institutional Review Board  in a timely manner. This report will 
include a full description of the event, including the relationship of the incident  to the test 
procedure.  
 
Potential Adverse Events  and Mitigation Strategies  
Breach of Confidentiality : There is a potential for breach of confidentiality . Study 
samples and resultant data will not contain personal identifying information. Each sample 
will be stored with a unique code. All source document data will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet and converted to electronic data. All electronic data will be safe-guarded by 
[CONTACT_17897] a University of Michigan server.  
 
Muscle Biopsy : Risks include  discomfort, infection, or excessive bleeding at the biopsy 
site. These complications will be minimized using sterile technique s and pressure by [CONTACT_17898] . Subjects will be instructed that they should report any 
bleeding or opening of the wound immediately for follow up care. Subjects will be supplied 
with ice and pressure bandages after each  biopsy to reduce inflammation and any 
soreness after the biopsy. A member of the research team will follow -up with partici pants 
the day after each muscle biopsy.  
 
Lidocaine : Lidocaine is  a local anesthetic  administered during the muscle biopsy 
technique. It is possible to develop an allergic reaction to lidocaine, which could range 
from minor itching and a rash to severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_17867]. This is a possibility 
with all medications and we will include subjects in the study only if they are witho ut a 
history of an allergic reaction. Medical treatment will be provided if an allergic reaction is 
evident.  
 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
24 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] : Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a local anesthetic delivered during the muscle biopsy 
technique. It is possible to develop an allergic reaction to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , which could range 
from minor itching and a rash to severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_17868]. This is a 
possibility with all medications and we will include subjects in the study only if they are 
without a history of an allergic reaction. Medical treatment will be provided if an allergic 
reaction is evident.  
 
DEXA : There is a risk of x -ray exposure with DEXA. The duration of each scan will be 
less than [ADDRESS_16809] will be exposed to a radiation dose of ≤ 0.3 mrem based 
upon manufacturer’s specificat ions and calculations from Stan ford Dosimetry, LLC 
RADAR Medical Procedure Radiation Dose Calculator. This amount of radiation exposure 
is considered “general public” exposure by [CONTACT_3433] e Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  
 
Blood Samples : Inserting a needle for blood sampling may be associated with some 
discomfort, bruising, and on a very rar e occasion, with inflammation. Strict sterile 
procedures will be  utilized during blood draws to minimize risks.  
 
Urine Collection : There are no  known  risks to collecting urine samples. However, some 
people may find it uncomfortable or embarrassing to collect samples.  
 
EKG : Men may need to have a small amount of chest hair shaved off for the ECG pads 
to stick correctly. A small amount of adhesive might remain on the skin when the pads 
are removed or the adhesive might pull on hair when removed.  
 
Exercise : There is a risk of physical injury or fatigue due to the cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17869]. However, these risks are generally 
considered rare and minor. Our investigation team has extensive experience conducting 
graded exercise tests in a number of special populations (including elderly and diseased 
populations) and is well versed in how best to minimize risk during these tests.  In addition, 
exercise testing  and training  will be performed in a facility e quipped with AED devices  
and staff trained in CPR . 
 
Insulin Clamp Procedure : There is a risk that the subject may react to the infusion of 
glucose or insulin. These reactions could include low blood sugar, an increase in blood 
pressure, flushing and/or sweating. In the event one of these reactions occur, medical 
staff will be notified and appropriate measures will be taken.  
 
Heated Hand Box : There is a minor  risk of skin discomfort or burn. If the temperature is 
too warm it can be reduced to improve comfort.  
 
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test : There is a minor potential risk of r eaction to the ingestion 
of glucose. These reactions could include nausea, low blood sugar, an increase in blood 
pressure, flushing and/or sweating.  Continuous blood glucose monitoring will take place 
during this procedure to provide real time feedback of glucose levels.  
 
Microdialysis:  Inserting the microdialysis probes may be uncomfortable or painful.  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
25 Study Diet:  It may be burdensome for subjects to  adhere to a special diet for an extended 
period of time. The metabolic kitchen staff at MCRU will work to accommodate participant 
needs.  
 
Unforeseeable R isks: There may be risks or side effects related to the study that are 
unknown at this time . Continuous monitoring of all participants will facilitate appropriate 
action in the event of an unforeseeable risk.  
 
Expected Adverse Reactions  
There are no expected adverse events.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  and Unanticipated Problems  
Subjects will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_5051] , MCRU , CVC,  and/or 
Domino Farms  staff during all testing procedures. Should a serious event occur, it will be 
managed promptly by [CONTACT_17899].  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Test Values or Abnormal Clinical Finding  Procedure  
Should an abnormal test value or finding be identified, the subject will be promptly 
notified  and encouraged to communicate the finding with their personal physician.   
 
Reporting Procedures  
All adverse events will be reported to the research team for awareness. The study 
principal investigator, Dr . Jacob Haus PhD, and a study physician , will ensure the 
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board  is notified  within a timely manner . 
 
Safety Oversight  
[CONTACT_17910] , PhD and [CONTACT_17914] , MD (the physician -of-record) will provide 
safety oversight for the study.  [CONTACT_17915] , PhD (School of Kinesiology) will serve 
as our data safety monitor.  
 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Study Hypotheses  
Our central hypothesis is that skeletal muscle contributes to  sRAGE appearance 
in the circulation and maintenance of healthy levels of total sRAGE promotes 
cardiometabolic health.  Therefore , two specific working hypotheses have been  proposed.  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
26 1) Skeletal muscle expression of RAGE will decrease following 12 -weeks of aerobic 
exercise training  and this change  will be related to increases  in insulin sensitivity 
and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].  
2) Circulating sRAGE levels will increase following 12 -weeks of aerobic exercise 
training and this change will be related to reduced muscle RAGE expression and 
increases  in insulin sensitivity and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].  
 
Statistics and Sample Size Considerations  
The primary outcomes of this  study involve  collecting data at pre -aerobic exercise  
training and 12 w eeks of  training. Comparisons of trajectories across groups (training vs. 
Control) over time are made with appropriate adjustments for fixed (age, sex, 
medications,  diabetes  duration and severity) and time -varying covariates (i.e. , weight, 
BMI, etc). Because of the anticipated nonlinear response curves of outcome v ariables  we 
will use nonlinear mixed effects models to analyze our data. Using PROC NLMIXED in 
SAS 9.2 (SAS Inc.) we will fit the nonlinear models using two likelihood -based methods: 
adaptive Gaussian quadrature and a first -order Taylor series approximation [54-56]. The 
nonlinear mixed model is: y = f(xij, β, ui) + eij, where f is some nonlinear function of known 
vector covariates ( xij) for the jth observation on the ith subject, unknown fixed effect 
parameters (β), an unknown vector of random effect parameters (u i), and unknown 
random errors (e ij). For this study, we will treat training group as main fixed effect, 
intercept as random effects, and all outcomes will be used as responsive variables. Using 
nonlinear mixed effects models described above, we will reject n ull hypothesis if 
significant (p<.05) interaction effect between group and time is observed. Post -hoc 
analysis will examine differences between groups at different time points to assess the 
effect of exercise  training on the outcome variables across time during the intervention. 
Our human sample size was determined using data from preliminary studies to provide 
adequate power after attrition to test the hypothesized effect of training on skeletal muscle 
RAGE and sRAGE concentrations. We will enroll 75 subje cts with the anticipation that 
there will be 20 -25% attrition at 12 w eeks. We anticipate that the final N after attrition will 
be 60 (n= 30 per group ). Using the two -sided alpha level of 0.05, we estimate that a total 
sample size of [ADDRESS_16810] units for RAGE between Aerobic Exercise  training and Control groups with a 
target of 90% statistical power.  
 
Safety and Efficacy Review  
Our team has a Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act (MIOSHA) approved 
chemical hygiene plan in place.  This hygiene plan requires extensive training in the 
University of Michigan’s Responsibility Conduct of Research training program, known as 
PEERRS (Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research and 
Scholarship) , first aid, and CPR .  The research team will be meet weekly to discuss study 
progress , training,  and ensure study object ives and guidelines are met.

27 Analysis Plan  
Due to nature of this study, d ata will be analyzed on an on -going basis.  Participant 
enrollment will be rolling with sample collection occurring intermittently. Samples will be 
batched and analyzed as appropriate.  Study samples and resultant data will not contain 
personal identifying information  (only a unique study code) . All source document data will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet and converted to electronic data. All electronic data will be 
safe-guarded by [CONTACT_17900] a University of Michigan server . 
 
 
QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Ethics and Protection of Human Subjects  
Coupled with extensive experience testing human subjects  in a variety of settings , 
the training provided by [CONTACT_17901]’s Responsibility Conduct of Research 
training program, known as PEERRS (Program for Education and Evaluation in 
Responsible Research and Scholarship) will guide the protection of the research team 
and st udy participants.  
 
Informed Consent Process  
As explained in detail elsewhere , initial screening of participants will occur via a 
website screening tool  or telephone interview . During this time, the study will be described 
in detail and we will obtain information about age , body mass index (BMI), smoking and 
physical activity status, current medical conditions, health status and medications. 
Subjects who meet the initial screening criteria are scheduled for a medical screening. 
These tests will be  performed in the Michiga n Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) , CVC, 
Domino Farms , and/or the CCRB  (or other University recreation building) . Verbal and 
written informed consent will be obtained during this init ial visit according to the guidelines 
of our Institutional Review Board. Subjects are screened based on the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  
 
Informed Consent/Assent Process (in Case of a Minor)  
Minors will not participate in this study.  
 
Subject Confidentiality  
The screening process utilized in this study was selected to minimize study risk. 
All conversations between the research team and participants are considered 
confidential. Screening will take place in a private environment with only the research 
team and/or Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCR U), CVC,  or Domino Farms staff 
present. Study samples and resultant data will not contain personal identifying 
information. All source document data will be kept in a locked file cabinet and converted

population [26, 30, 34, 35] . However, we recognize participants interests, health and 
schedules may change. The research team’s best effort will be made to accommodate 
the participants needs and minimize attrition.  
 
Future Use of Stored Specimens  
Participants will be asked to consent for future use of their samples.  We expect 
that the data and tissue and blood samples obtained from the proposed study will have 
lasting research value to maximize productivity for the research team.  We intend to use 
these resources to explore future mechanisms and the data obtained that can be mined 
for new and impactful  opportunities.  
 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_17870]. Source  study documents 
will be converted to electronic files as needed and interpreted by [CONTACT_17902] -going basis.  The source study documents will be safe -guarded in a locked file 
cabinet . Weekly study team meetings will address data management needs.  
 
Data Collection  Process  
Data collection will be conducted by [CONTACT_5051] , MCRU , CVC,  and/or 
Domino Farms  staff at the University of Michigan . Specifically designed protocol 
documentation forms will guide the data collection process.  
 
Study Records Retention  
Similar to the future use of stored samples , we intend to use study records as 
resources to explore future mechanisms and the data obtained that can be mined for new 
and impactful opportunities.  Study records provide important clinical context and 
interpretation of study findings.

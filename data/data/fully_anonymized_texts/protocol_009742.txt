1.1. Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for a large proportion of chronic liver disease 
worldwide and accounts for 70% of cases of chronic hepatitis in industrialized countries. The 
global prevalence of chronic hepatitis C is estimated to average 3% {[ZIP_CODE]}. 
Thenatural history  of chronic HCV infection in children differs from that in adults since 
HCV infection in children is relatively  benign. Most children chronically  infected with HCV 
are asymptomatic or have mild nonspecific s ymptoms. Clinical sy mptoms are pr esent in 
approximately  20% of children in the first [ADDRESS_783034] 
frequent sign (10%). Many, but not all, perinatally  infected children will have intermittently  
or persistently  abnormal AL T or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, particularl y in the 
first [ADDRESS_783035] undergone liver 
biopsy, the histological spectrum is usually  mild, although severe liver disease is encountered 
{[ZIP_CODE]
}. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_593461], approximately  4% 
to 6% of children with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis 
and some childre n eventually  require liver transplantation for end- stageliver disease as a 
consequence of HCV infection {[ZIP_CODE]}.
The goal of HCV treatment in both pediatric and adult populations is eradication of the virus, 
thereby [CONTACT_384760], hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure 
resulting in either death or need for liver transplantation. This goal, however, is limited by  
[CONTACT_384761] y 
approved treatments. In addition, pediatric treatment is controversial as the current treatment 
options are limited and severe side effects and tolerability  can significantl y limit or preclude 
their use. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_91184] -established guidelines for the treatment 
of HCV in adults, there is no 
universal consensus on when or if to treat chronic HCV infection in children. I n 2010, the 
European Societ y for Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) 
issued guidance for clinical trial development fo r chronic HCV infection in children {[ZIP_CODE]}.
In the guideline, the ESPGHAN suggested that the primary  goal of treatment in children is to 
eradicate the infectionto prevent late complications. Hence, the goal is not the treatment of 
an ongoing liver disease, but rather the prevention of a future one.
PEGand weight -based RBV are currentl y considered the standard of care for the treatment of 
HCV infection in childr en. Current recommendations are that patients with GT -2 or GT-3 be 
treatedwith PEG+RBVfor [ADDRESS_783036] reported that despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 48 weeks of treatment, sustained virologic response (SVR24) was 
observed in onl y 36% to 53% of subjects with GT -1, while response rates were > 80% in 
subjects with GT -2 or GT-3 {[ZIP_CODE]}.
Sofosbuvir
Protocol GS -US-334-[ADDRESS_783037] children treated with PEG+RBV experience at least 1 adverse event due to treatment 
{[ZIP_CODE]}. Although most of these events are mild to moderate in severity , many of them result 
in dose reductions of [ADDRESS_783038] consisted 
of influenza -like illness (91%), headache (62%), and injection site reactions (45%), often 
leading to poor compliance and/or discontinuation from treatment.
Additionally , the concern for growth and development in this age group and the role that both 
PEGand RBV pot entially play in reducing growth rates has initiated significant debate 
among pediatric hepatologists as to whether these treatments should even be considered in 
the pediatric population {[ZIP_CODE]}.Many pediatricians currentl y advocate delay of treatment 
past adolescence or even into adulthood when options with DAAs are possible {[ZIP_CODE]}.
Unfortunatel y, in the 25% of pediatric patients who do meet the criteria for treatment 
(elevated transaminases and viral loads), the option of PEG+RBV therap y remains 
inadequate in regard to both efficacy  in GT-[ADDRESS_783039] a variety of molecular 
targets, which include the virally  encoded RNA -dependent RNA pol ymerase (RDRP, NS5B) 
and proteases (NS2 and NS3). Some of the most consistently  effective antivirals have been 
nucleoside/tide analogs. These compounds share characteristics with the natural nucleoside 
substrates found in the cell, and once phosphory lated to the nucleoside -triphosphate, cause 
termination of the new ly encoded viral genome.
SOFis a novel nucleotide analogue that inhibits HCV RNA replication in vitro and has 
demonstrated efficient inhibition of viral replication in in vitro and in vivo studies.. 
Furthermore, even in subjects who did experience off -treatment viral breakthrough, 
population sequencing revealed no treatment-emergent S282T mutations . No adverse effects 
on the nervous, cardiovascular, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_593462], and no specific 
target organs of toxicity  have been identified in long-term toxicology  studies. Available 
clinical data indicate SOFhas a favorable safet y profile and is well tolerated.
Based on its observed safety  and efficacy  in adult patients with HCV, 
SOFhas the potential 
to be a safe, tolerable, and effective tre atment for HCV infection in the pediatric population.
1.2. Sofosbuvir
Sovaldi™(Sofosbuvir) is a potent nucleotide analogue that inhibits HCV RNA replication in 
vitro and has demonstrated high rates of sustained viral response (SVR) when given with 
RBV+/-PEGto subjects with chronic GT-1, 2, 3 or 4 HCV infection {[ZIP_CODE]}, {[ZIP_CODE]}, 
{[ZIP_CODE]}, 
{[ZIP_CODE]}.  Sovaldi™  has been approved in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_33438]  (FDA) for the treatment of HCV infecti on GT-1, 2, 3 and 4 including 
treatment naïve and experienced patients and HIV/HCV co -infected patients.

CONFIDENTIAL Page19 20 December [ZIP_CODE].3. Ribavirin (RBV)
Ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that inhibits the in vitro replication of a wide range of 
RNA and DNA viruses {[ZIP_CODE]}, {[ZIP_CODE]}. Ribavirin monotherap y has little or no effect on the 
replication of HCV but can result in normalization of serum ALT activity  and improvement 
in liver histology . When combined with interferon or PEG therap y, RBV decreases 
substantially  the relapse rate seen after cessation of interferon therap y {[ZIP_CODE]}, {[ZIP_CODE]}.
Ribavirin is a known teratogen (FDA category  X).  Furthermore, RBV is known to
accumulate intracellularly where it is cleared slowly , and is also excreted in semen. 
Therefore, extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy  during RBV therapy  and for up to 
7 months following completion of treatment.  A comprehensive review of RBV is c ontained 
in the package insert/
SmPC.
1.4. Rationale for the Current Study
This clinical study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of treatment with 
SOF+RBVfor adolescents and children with GT -[ADDRESS_783040] demonstrated th e antiviral 
efficacy, potency, and safety  of SOF in subjects with HCV infection. SOFincombination 
with RBV would provide an all -oral, IFN-
free regimen with a shorter treatment duration 
([ADDRESS_783041] -of-care 24 to 48 week s of treatment) and 
would offer another important option in the treatment of HCV infection in the pediatric 
population.
While emerging Phase [ADDRESS_783042] that patients with GT-3 infection may  benefit from a longer 
treatment duration with SOF+RBV. Optimal duration of SOF+RBV , for genoty pe 3 subjects,
was established in FI SSION and VALENCE.  I ncreasing treatment duration from 12 to 
24
weeks increased SVR12 from 61 to 93% in non- cirrhotics and from 34 to 92% in 
cirrhotics.
Sofosbuvir
Protocol GS -US-334-[ADDRESS_783043] genoty pic efficacy  and favorable safety profile in over 
3300HCV-infected subjects across multiple patient populations in Phase 2 and 3 trials. This 
dose is the marketed dose of SOFfor the treatment of HCV -infection.
Selection of doses of SOF for adolescents and younger age groups will target s ystemic 
exposures similar to t hose observed in adults at the marketed dose, taking into account bod y 
weight/bod y surface area, the potential ontogenic changes in hepaticall y expressed 
carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and Cathepsin A (CatA) enzy mes, and the results obtained in 
older age groups.  Available data suggest comparable hepatic expression of CES1 in 
adolescents and adults, with modestly  decreased expression in children.  As such, the adult 
clinical dose, 400mg, will be evaluated in adolescents {[ZIP_CODE]}.  Safety and PK data in the 
adolescent group (Cohort 1) in Part A, will inform dose selection for the younger age groups 
in addition to body  weight/body  surface area. 
Age-appropriate formulations of SOF that offer an important option in the treatment of HCV 
infection in the pediatric population ar e planned for evaluation in children below 6 years of 
age or children who are unable to swallow a solid -dose formulation.
1.6. Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Although the majorit y of pediatric patients infected with HCV exhibit minimal hepatic
sequelae despi[INVESTIGATOR_384737], a subset of children and
adolescents will require treatment. Studies suggest that 3 major categories of diseas e can
occur within 10 years after putative HCV exposure: (1) undetectable viremia and normal
ALT, (2) persistent y et uncomplicated mild liver disease, and (3) progression to end- stage
liver disease {[ZIP_CODE]}.It is the last twogroupsof children in whom therapy  maybe indicated 
to prevent end -stage disease, either during childhood/adolescence or in early adulthood.
Given that the current standard of care for th e treatment o f children infected with HCV is 
PEGand RBV and these regimens are long in duration, relatively  toxic, and not well
tolerated, there continues to be a need for new treatments for HCV that combine potent and
sustained efficacy  with improved tol erability and safet y. 
SOFhas demonstrated efficient inhibition of viral replication in in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Available clinical data indicate SOFhas a favorable safet y profile and is well tolerated. SOF 
in combination with RBV is likely to provide significant therapeutic
benefit in the treatment 
of HCV infection in pediatric patients compared to currentl yavailable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_593463]:
Expected improved efficacy  in a pediatric population compared to the current standard of 
care
Expected improvement in safet y and tolerability in relation to either adverse reactions or 
potential medication errors in the pediatric population compared to the current standard 
of care

8.1. Definition sof Adverse Events , Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse 
Events
8.1.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with the treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and/or unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered re lated to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre -or post-treatment 
complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandatedprocedures, overdose ,drug 
abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting events that increase in severit y 
or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study  will also 
be considered AEs.
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such assurgery, endoscopy ,tooth extraction, and 
transfusion. T he condition that ledto the procedure may  be an adverse event and must be 
reported
Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before
the screening visit that donot worsen.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. ,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783] , socialand/or convenience admissions).
Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 8.5)
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not 
an AE. It is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical 
history CRF
8.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the 
following :
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event that h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)

Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y
A congenital anomal y/birth defect
A medically important eventor reaction: such events may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_506441]. Medical and 
scientific judgment mustbe exercised to determine whether such an event is reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important e vents include 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; anddevelopment of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from 
contaminated medicinal product will be considered a m edically important 
event and 
subject to expedited reporting requirements.
8.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Seriou s Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, laboratory  abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis) that 
require medical or surgical intervention or lead to IMP in terruption, modification, or 
discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. I n addition, 
laboratory  or other abnormal assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, x- rays, vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and/or sy mptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they  meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 8.1.1and 8.1.2. If the laboratory  
abnormality is part of a sy ndrome, record the s yndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia), not the 
laboratory  result (ie, decreased hemoglobin).
8.2.
Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causality and severity , and for finalreview and confirmation of accuracy  of event
information and assessments.
8.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing t he relationship to 
IMPtherapy using clinical judg ment and the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology  other than the investigational 
medicinal product. For SAEs, an alternative causality  must be provided (e.g., pre -existing 
condition, underly ing disease, inter current illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes:There is reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused by [CONTACT_10853] .

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Original
CONFIDENTIAL Page53 20 December 2013It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y 
related in the context of AE reporting.
The relationship to study  procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as venipuncture or 
biopsy) should be assessed using the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other than the study  procedure.
Yes:The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures (eg.,venipuncture)
8.2.2. Assessment of Severity
The severit y grading of AEs will be assessed as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the GSI Grading 
Scale for Severity  of Adverse Events and Laborato ry Abnormalities (Appendix 3). For AEs 
associated with laboratory  abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the 
clinical severit y in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in 
agreement wit h the grading of the laboratory  abnormality .
8.3. Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse 
Events and Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, that occur after the subject first consents to 
participate in the study (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study, including the protocol -required 24-
week post treatment follow -up period, must be 
reported to the CRF/eCRF database and [COMPANY_009] Drug Safety  and Public Health (DSPH) as 
instructed. This also includes an y SAEs resulting from protocol- mandated procedures 
performed from screening onwards.
All AEs, regardless of caus alrelationship, that occur from initiation of study  medication until 
[ADDRESS_783069] be reported to the CRF/eCRF database 
as instructed . 
All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the adverse event is stable, if possible. 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences may  request that certain AEs be followed bey ond the post- treatment follow 
up period.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek SAEs after the24 weekpost-treatment 
follow-
up period.  However, if the investigator learns of an y SAEs that occur after this time 
and the event is deemed relevant to the use of IMP, he/she should promptly document and 
report the event directl y to [COMPANY_009] DSPH. [COMPANY_009] DSPH contact [CONTACT_10856]:

8.5. Special Situations Reports
8.5.1. Definitions of Special Situations
Special situation reports includ e all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdo se, and 
pregnancy  reports regardless of an associated AE.  Also includes reports of adverse reactions 
in infants following exposure from breastfeeding, and reports of adverse reactions associated 
with product complaints and reports arising from occupationa l exposure.
A pregnancy  report is used to report any pregnancyfollowing maternal or paternal exposure 
to themedicinal product. 
Medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing ,or administration 
of a medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider , subject, or consumer.
Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal product by  
a subject.
Misuse is defined as an y intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product that is not 
in accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information.
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity  of a 
medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum 
recommended dose as per protocol or in the product labelling (as it applies to the daily  dose 
of the subject in question). In cases of a discrepancy  in drug accountability , overdose will be 
established only  when it is clear that the subject has ta ken the excess dose(s). Overdose 
cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy  except in cases in 
which the investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).
Product complaint is defined as complaints arising from potential deviations in the 
manufacture, packaging or distribution of the medicinal product.

study, including the post -treatment follow-up period, to the CRO Pharmacovigilance 
Representative using the pregnancy  report form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
pregnancy .
The pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate 
a pregnancy  without medical reasons.
Any premature termination of pregnancy  (eg, a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic 
abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) must be reported with in 24hours as 
an SAE. The underly ing medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the AE
term.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and w ill be reported as described 
in Sections 
8.1.1and 8.3. Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy  outcome 
post study  must be reported directl y to [COMPANY_009] DSPH .
The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the 
pregnancy . The outcome should be reported to
CRO Pharmacovigilance Representative using 
the pregnancy  outcome report form. If the end of the pregnancy  occurs after the study  has 
been completed, the outcome should be reported directly  to [COMPANY_009] DSPH. [COMPANY_009] DSPH

In Part A,AUCtauof GS-331007is considered as the primary  PK parameter for determining 
the appropriate SOF dose .
For Part B, the primary efficacy endpoint is SVR 12. Safety  endpoint is any AE leading to 
permanent discontinuation of study  drug(s).
9.1.3. Secondary Endpoint s
In Part A,the secondary  PK endpoints 
includeAUCtau, Cmax, AUC last, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau
and t1/2for GS-331007
and SOF as appropriate. AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug(s)will be evaluated as a secondary  safety endpoint.
For Part B, s econdary efficacy endpoints include SVR4, SVR24, end-of- treatment respo nse, 
breakthrough and relapse. Additional efficacy  evaluations may  include HCV RNA change 
from Day  1; ALT normalization; viral kinetic parameters; and changes in patient reported 
outcomes based on the Quality of Life survey  to assess the effect of treatment on quality  of 
life.
9.2. Analysis Conventions
All individual subject data will be listed as measured. All statistical summaries and anal yses 
will be performed using SASsoftware (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
9.2.1. Analysis Sets 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Analysis Sets
Intensive PK Analysis Set 
The intensive PK anal ysis set will include all part A subjects who received at least one dose 
of study drug and for whom at least one non-missing PK concentration data ,during the 
intensive sampling period, reported by [CONTACT_347108].
The PK anal ysis set will be used for detailed 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis of SOF, and metabolites.  
SparcePK Analysis Set 
The PK anal ysis set will include all enrolled subjects who rece ived at least one dose of stud y 
drug and for whom at least one observed concentration data of SOF or GS-[ADDRESS_783071] dose of stud y drug plus 30 days.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Analysis Set
The analysis set for antiviral activity anal yses will be the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) which 
includes HCV infected subjects who were enrolled and have received at least one dose of 
study drug.
9.2.2. Data Handling Conventions
Natural logarithm transformation for key PK parameters, such as C max and AUC tau, will be 
applied for pharmacokinetic anal ysis.
The PK concentration values below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be treated as zero for 
the determination of summary  and order statistics. I ndividual values that a re BLQ will be 
presented as “BLQ” in the concentration data listing and will be excluded in any  calculation 
of geometric means or ratios. For the presentation of summary and order statistics, if at least 
[ADDRESS_783072] has a concentration value BLQ for the time point, then the minimum value will be 
displayed as “BLQ”. If more than 50% of the subjects have a concentration data value BLQ 
for the time point, then the minimum and median values will be display ed as “BLQ”. If all 
subjects have concentration data value s BLQ for the time point, then all order statistics 
(minimum, first quartile [Q1], median, third quartile [Q3], maximum) will be displayed as 
“BLQ”.
Missing data can have an impact upon the interpretation of the trial data. Other than the 
endpoints discuss ed below, i n general, values for missing data will not be imputed. 
For the anal ysis of post-baseline categorical efficacy  endpoints, if a data point is missing and 
is preceded and followed in time by  [CONTACT_384767], then the missing data 
point will be termed a success; otherwise the data point will be termed a failure.
Any subject with missing data due to premature discontinuation of the study  medication will 
be considered a failure at the time points subsequent to the date of discontinuation. If no 
HCV RNA values are obtained after the last dose of study  medication, the subject will be 
considered a treatment failure for the SVR endpoints.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Original
CONFIDENTIAL Page61 20 December 2013Where appropriate, safety  data for subjects that did not complete the study  will be included in 
summary statistics. For example,
If a subject received study  medication, the subject will be included in a summary  of 
adverse events according to the treatment received; otherwise, if the subject is not dosed 
then they will be excluded from the summary .
If safety laboratory  results for a subject are missing for any  reason at a time point, the 
subject will be excluded from the calculation of summary  statistics for that time point. I f 
the subject is missing a pre- dose value, then the subject will be excluded from t he 
calculation of summary  statistics for the pre -dose value and the change from pre -dose 
values.
Values for missing safety laboratory  data will not be imputed; however, a missing baseline 
result will be replaced with a screening result, if available. If no pre-treatment laboratory  
value is available, the baseline value will be assumed to be normal (i.e., no grade [Grade 0]) 
for the summary  of graded laboratory  abnormalities.
Values for missing vital signs data will not be imputed; however, a missing baselin e result 
will be replaced with a screening result, if available.
HCV RNA values below the LLOQ for the assay  will be set to the lower limit minus 1 for 
calculation of summary  statistics for the actual HCV RNA values and the change from 
baseline values b y study visit. The reported values will be provided in the HCV RNA listing.
For selected anal yses of early time point data, HCV RNA data (IU/mL) may be transformed 
to the logarithmic (base 10) scale (log 10IU/mL).

An external multidisciplinary  data monitoring committee (DMC) will review the progress of 
the study and perform interim reviews of safety  and PK data and provide recommendation to 
[COMPANY_009] about whether the nature, frequency , and severit y of adverse effects associated with 
study treatment warrant the earl y termination of the study in the best inte rests of the 
participants, whether the study  should continue as planned, or the study  should continue with 
modifications. 
The DMC’s specific activities will be defined b y a mutually  agreed charter, which will define 
the DMC’s membership, conduct and meeti ng schedule.
While the DMC will be asked to advise [COMPANY_009] regarding future conduct of the study , 
including possible early  study termination, [COMPANY_009] retains final decision -making authorit y on 
all aspects of the stud y.
9.8. Sample Size
With approximately  50 subjects enrolled into each age group of Part B, a two- sided 95.0% 
confidence interval of the SVR12rate will extend at most 11.1% in both directions from the 
observed SVR12 rate, assuming the expected SVR12rate is 80%.

10.1. Investigator Responsibi lities
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice
The investigator will ensure that this study  is conducted in accordance with the principles of 
the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and 
South Africa), International Conference on Ha rmonisation (I CH) guidelines, or with the laws 
and regulations of the country  in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the 
greater protection to the study  subject. For studies conducted under a [LOCATION_002] I ND, the 
investigator will ensure t hat the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 
21CFR312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 
1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to.
Since this is a “covered” clinical trial, the in vestigator wi ll ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, 
is adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is an y “study of a drug or device in humans submitted 
in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or 
FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show 
equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the 
demonstration of safet y.” This requires that investigators and all subinvestigators must 
providedocumentation of their financial interest or arrangements with [COMPANY_009] Sciences, or 
proprietary  interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before 
participation of the investigator and an y subinvestigator. The investigator and subinvestigator 
agree to notify  [COMPANY_009] Sciences of any  change to reportable interests during the study  and for 
one year following completion of the study . Study completion is defined as the date that the 
last subject has completed the protocol defined acti vities.
This study  is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR, part 320, 
1993, “Retention of Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”

including causality  and intensity );
Concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant; dose changes 
should be motivated);
Date of trial completion and reason for earl y discontinuation, if applicable.
All clinical study  documents must be retained b y the investigator until at least [ADDRESS_783077] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., [LOCATION_002], Europe, or 
Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an I CH 
region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication,
until 2years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been 
notified. I nvestigators may  be required to retain documents longer if required by  [CONTACT_44536], by  [CONTACT_427], or by  [CONTACT_384784]. The 
investigator must notify [COMPANY_009] Sciences before destroy ing any clinical study  records.
Should the investigator wish to assign the stud y records to another part y or move them to 
another location, [COMPANY_009] Sciences must be notified in adva nce.
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study  site for any  or all 
of the documents, special arrangements must be made betw een the investigator and 
[COMPANY_009]Sciences to store these in sealed containers outside of the site s o that they  can be 
returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory  audit. When source documents are 
required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_258539].
Biological samples at the con clusion of this study  may be retained in storage by [CONTACT_593490] a period up to [ADDRESS_783078] enrolled, a CRF (or eCRF) must be completed and signed by  [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_593467] (as appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data 
collection. This also applies to records for those subjects who f ail to complete the study  
(evenduring a prerandomization screening period if a CRF was initiated). If a subject 
withdraws from the study , the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn 
from the study  because of a treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be 
made to clearly  document the outcome.
10.1.7. Drug Accountability
The investigator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, and comparators. 
This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study  product (quantity  and 
condition), subject dispensing records, and returned or destro yed study product. Dispensing 
records will document quantities received from [COMPANY_009] Sciences and quantities dispensed to 
subjects, including lot number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, subject initials, and 
the initials of the person dispensing the medication.
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences req uirements. Drug may  be returned or destro yed on an ongoing basis during 
the study if appropriate. At the end of the stud y, following final drug inventory reconciliation 
by [CONTACT_2037], the study site will dispose of and/or destroy  all unused investigationa l 
medicinal product supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the 
site cannot meet [COMPANY_009] Sciences’ requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made 
between the site and [COMPANY_009] Sciences or its representative for destructio n or return of unused 
investigational medicinal product supplies.
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically  reviewed and verified by

Notes: 
Toxicity grades for Quantitative and Dipstick Hematuria will be assigned by [CONTACT_10870], however for other laboratorie s, toxicity grades will only be assigned to Dipstick 
Hematuria.
With the exception of lipid tests, any graded laboratory test with a result that is between the LLN and ULN should be assigne d Grade 0.
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under either one of two grades (e.g., the severity of an AE could be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the two grades for the

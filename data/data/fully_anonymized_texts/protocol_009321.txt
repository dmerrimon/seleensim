2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease  
Lymphedema  
Secondary (acquired) lymphedema is a serious, progressive and global disease that develops 
when the lymphatic system is physically compromised and unable to sufficiently transport 
interstitial fluid and macromolecules from affected region(s) of the body to the central circulation .  
In Western countries , it most commonly occurs as a delayed result of cancer treatment, most 
frequently in survivors of breast and gynecological cancers .  In this highly prevalent condition, 
lymph node extirpation and the associated structural damage to the lymphatic vasculature leads 
to the inexorable accumulation of interstitial fluid, accompanied by [CONTACT_817506], ultimately,  irreversible structural changes of the affected tissues of the 
limb(s) . 1  Lymphedema is a chronic, debilitating disease with profound functional and 
psychosocial implications . 2  
According to the  Ameri can Ca ncer Society  (ACS) , in women there will be an estimated 252,[ADDRESS_1131965] cancer .  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 of 51 4 February  2020  Devel opment of upper extremity (UE) edema following axillary lymph node dissection for breast 
cancer treatment is the most common manifestation .  Conservative estimates place the 
incidence of UE edema after axillary lymph node dissection  at 15 -26%. 3,5-7  Conse rvative 
axillary management  (SLND)  has resulted in reduced incidents of breast cancer related 
edema . 8-[ADDRESS_1131966], was 15%  at 1 year;  
13.4%  at 3 years ;  10.[ADDRESS_1131967] rates of lymphedema ( 25.6%  at 1 year;  21% at 3 years ;  20.8%  at 5 years ). 11  
2.2 Study Device/Procedure  
The proposed study utilizes Fibralign’s BioBridge™ Collagen Matrix, a sterile implantable 
bioco mpatible and biodegradable surgical mesh ribbon comprised of highly purified porcine 
collagen .  The Class II device was cleared by [CONTACT_817507] 
8 January  2016 under 510(k) K151083 .  The device will be used for soft tissue surgical s upport 
at the time of vascularized  lymph node transfer surgery  (VLNT) ; the device will be used, 
specifically, for surgical support of the lymphatic component of the soft tissue.  
We previously completed and published a large animal study that employed a we ll-studied  and 
widely -published model . 43  The model replicates the pathogenesis of iatrogenic human 
secondary lymphedema (surgical removal of lymph nodes, radiation ablation) .  The study 
definitively demonstrated that, after BioBridge device implantation,  the lymphatic tissue 
underwent repair during the period of experimental observation, with formation of new lymphatic 
vessels, restoration of function, and reduction in the tissue fluid accumulation that is associated 
with the untreated disease .  Contrast -enhanced CT imaging and vital dye imaging confirmed 
that, at study conclusion, lymphatic vessels were fully functional within the irradiated tissue 
region, where there had been no demonstrable lymphatic vascular function before implantation 
of the BioBridg e device .  In the untreated control group, as expected, there was no observed 
improvement d uring this same period.  
Post-mortem macroscopic analysis of the implantation area after in vivo intradermal injection of 
methylene blue demonstrated that, in BioBri dge recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], newly developed lymphatic 
collectors could be identified; the development of new collectors was corroborated by 
[CONTACT_447]-treatment CT imaging .  During the course of the study, [ADDRESS_1131968] or re ‐route damaged lymphatic vessels, in which 
only arterial and venous vessels are reconnected, but in which lymphatic vessels cannot be 
re‐anastomosed, has shown improvements in limb edema, with evidence of lymphatic re ‐routing 
and clinical evidence of spont aneous lymphatic regeneration .  Although lymph node transfer has 
been shown to provide some benefit in human lymphedema patients, autologous lymph nodes 
incorporate into existing lymphatic vasculature at a relatively low frequency, thus compromising 
the ou tcome, inasmuch as connection with lymphatic vessels is required for the maintenance 
and function of the transplanted lymph nodes .  It is our belief that the addition of the Fibralign 
BioBridge will address a key weakness of this procedure, by [CONTACT_817508], lymphatic anastomosis and 
restoration of lymphatic function . 3 
Fibralign’s BioBridge Collage n Matrix consists solely of highly purified collagen with the 
immunogenic telop eptides removed .  This starting material is already used in commercial 
implant devices and sterilized after fabrication and packaging .  Extensive GLP biocompatibility 
testing has already been successfully completed in support of the 510(k) clearance and 
provided earl ier to the FDA , including implantation studies that show BioBridge naturally and 
gradually incorporates into the host tissue within [ADDRESS_1131969]  has been treat ed under this protocol (IRB -[ZIP_CODE])  prior to December  [ADDRESS_1131970]  underwent  VLNT with BioBridge placement per protocol.   
Due to the si gnificant change in this study, this patient will not be included in the final analysis.  
Since 2018, the BioBridge Collagen Matrix surgical mesh ribbon has been implanted as medical 
care in a number of lym phedema patients (personal communication, Dung  Nguyen, MD.[ADDRESS_1131971] -cancer treatment, and a few had lymphangiomatosis or primary lymphedema.  
Of the cancer  patients; [ADDRESS_1131972] cancer and  6 had gynecologi cal cancer  or melanoma.  All 
had undergone lymphatic surgery prior to BioBridge placement.  14 patients had undergone 
vascularized lymph node transfer  (VLNT);  5 underwent LVA;  and  3 received combined VLNT 
with lymphaticovenous anastomosis  (LVA).  The tim e interval between the lymphatic surgery 
and BioBridge placement ranged from [ADDRESS_1131973] -cancer treatment for Hodgkins’s lymphoma, had the BioBridge implanted with 
their lymphatic surgery (liposuction and VLNT).  [ADDRESS_1131974]  Nguyen’s patients showed 
improvement of excess volume after their initial lymphatic surg ery, ranging from 2% to 33% 
improvement in volume.  Of these,  13 of 15 showed improvement of excess volume after 
BioBridge placement that ranged from 1% to 29%.  In the remaining 2 patients, there was a 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 10 of 51 4 February  2020  median increase of volume of 6.5% in limb volume.  Th e truncated cone formula, as described 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124] Håkan  Brorson , was used to calculate excess volume . [ADDRESS_1131975] in 2016  as [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
and will be updated after IR B approvals, as appropriate . 
2.3 Rationale  
Currently, t here is a paucity of effective treatment options for lymphedema  of the limb(s) .  These 
include compression garments, intermittent compression devices, complete decongestive 
physiotherapy (CDPT), skin c are, and exercise .  The current standard of care is a combination 
of these approaches .  CDPT, which combines manual lymph drainage, multilayer short -stretch 
bandaging, exercise and skin care was recommended by a consensus panel of experts as the 
standard o f care . 12-[ADDRESS_1131976] resulted in reduction in excess limb volumes 
in the r ange of 50%. 4,19-21  Compete resolution is rarely achieved, is costly , and is time and 
labor intensive . 22  While modestly  effective, the underlying cause is not  addressed.  
In a completed large animal model (porcine) of human lymphedema, of the utilization of the 
Fibralign Biobridge, had the capacity to guide and augment lymphatic repair, and 
thereby  [CONTACT_817509] t he affected limb(s) . 43  
The BioBridge is an implantable, interventional  device comprised of a thread -like, multi -lumen 
collagen scaffold .  Biobridge ’s highly aligned nanofibrils encourage the endothelial  cell 
attachment, alignment and migration that are p rerequisite to  new vessel formation . 44,45  In our 
completed preclinical investigation,  BioBridge implantation successfully induced lymphatic 
regeneration  and ameliorated the pathology  in a porcine lymphedema model (funded through a 
[LOCATION_003]MRAA CDMRP Breast Ca ncer Research SBIR Phase  II grant) .  The results of these 
investigations have been presented  at several national and international biomedical congresses 
and the manuscript is under peer review  for publication .  On the basis  of the completed 
preclinical inv estigations, the FDA has granted a  510(k) for this device .  IDE was presented and 
approved by [CONTACT_1622] .  An amended IDE application , for randomized study,  will be presented to 
the FDA for their  approval .  
On the strength of our preclinical findings, we prop ose a  prospective clinical investigation of the 
impact of BioBridge as  an adjunct to VLNT.  VLNT is an increasingly practiced surgical 
intervention  for limb lymphedema, despi[INVESTIGATOR_817483].  Of published studies reporting limb volume outcomes after 
VLNT, volume changes range from an increase of 13% to a decrease of 64% (from presurgical 
volume).  [ADDRESS_1131977] Clinical Trials Directory  compliance

2.5 Correlative Studies Background   
We previously completed and published a large animal study that employed a well -studied and 
widely -published l arge animal model of lymphedema . 43  The porcine hindlimb model replicates 
the pa thogenesis of iatrogenic human secondary lymphedema (surgical removal of lymph 
nodes, radiation ablation) .  The study definitively demonstrated that, after BioBridge device 
implantation, the lymphatic tissue exhibited successful repair during the period of  experimental 
observation, with formation of new lymphatic vessels, restoration of function, and reduction in 
the tissue fluid accumulation that is associated with the untreated disease .  Contrast -enhanced 
CT imaging and vital dye imaging confirmed that, a t study conclusion, lymphatic vessels were 
fully functional within the irradiated tissue region, where there had been no demonstrable 
lymphatic vascular function before implantation of the BioBridge device .  In the untreated control 
group, as expected, the re was no observed improvement during this same period.   
IRB-[ADDRESS_1131978]-mortem macroscopic analysis of the implantation area after in vivo intradermal injection of 
methylene blue demonstrated that, in BioBridge recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], newly developed lymphatic 
collectors could  be identified; the development of new collectors was corroborated by 
[CONTACT_447]-treatment CT  imaging .  During the course of the study, 120 BioBridge devices were 
implanted, with no identified complications during the 3 months  after implantation or through 
histological analysis.  
The details of the model are described here .  A porcine model for secondary lymphedema in the 
minipig (Yucatan breed) was developed through meticulous resection of the lymphatic system of 
one hind limb and subsequent radiotherapy .  This procedure led to chronic edema in 44% of the 
animals at the 3 -month time point, as defined by a bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) ratio 
greater or equal to 1.[ADDRESS_1131979]-operative wound healing prob lems were comparable to those observed in humans after 
similar procedures . 1  Morphological features of chronic lymphedema in the minipi[INVESTIGATOR_817484] (CT) and MRI; the number of CT -identified lymphatic 
collectors correlated with the lymphatic dysfunction as determined by [CONTACT_231032] . [ADDRESS_1131980] imaging to identify active lymphedema, 50% of the animals in the untreated 
control group had an initial diagnosis of lymphedema at the 3 -month time point, and in all these 
anima ls, the lymphedema persisted to the 6 -month observation point.  
Lymphedema treatment with BioBridge  
Three  months  after lymph node resection and radiotherapy, animal  subjects  underwent surgical 
intervention, with implantation of BioBridge scaffolds spanning  the area depleted of lymphatics .  
The treatment opt ions included implantation of: 1) scaffold only;  2) transplantation of 
autologous lymph node fragments (LNF) supplemented with VEGF -C-enriched scaffold ;  or 
3) a VEGF -C treated scaffold .  Untreated c ontrol subjects received no treatment.  
All animals with pre -treatment lymphedema in Group  2 (BioBridge with LNF) experienced 
resolution of the lymphedema, and those in Group  1 (BioBridge only) showed improvement after 
[ADDRESS_1131981], in Group  3 (BioBridge with VEGF -C) and the control group, the majority of the animals  
had lymphedema either persist  or manifest  after the treatment started.  
Post-mortem macroscopic analysis in animals with lymphedema resolved or improved showed 
that new lymphatic c ollectors in the area of prior surgery and radiation could be seen through 
the skin after prior peripheral injection of blue dye and were confirmed by [CONTACT_4654] -imaging to be in 
the vicinity of the implanted collagen threads .  Macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], newly formed collec tors had no 
abnormal architecture .  In contrast, in control animals from Group  3, post-mortem examination 
disclosed visible lympho -vascular conglomerates in the vicinity of the distal end of the implant .  
IRB-[ADDRESS_1131982] lymphatics, as shown by [CONTACT_817510] (lymphatic + blood) when compared to untreated irradiated tissue.  
In summary , this preclinical large animal study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of 
BioBridge for the enhancement of lymphatic repair an d revascularization following the  
development of post - surgical acquired lymphedema in an in vivo model that simulates the 
human condition of acquired lymphedema of the limb.  
In subjects with lymphedema,  implantation of BioBridge 1) normalized or reduced t he 
extracellular liquid volume and 2) increased the number of functional lymphatic col lectors , 
accompanied by 3) BioBridge integrat ion into irradiated tissue and 4) formation of new 
microvasculature with increased lymphatic fraction in the proximity of the  scaffold .  Implantation 
of BioBridge supported by [CONTACT_817511], with all 
animals showing no signs of lymphedema at the experimental conclusion, while BioBridge 
supplemented with VEGF -C, a surgical control in which the directional signaling was aborted, 
did not improve lymphedema condition .  Careful consideration of current methods to treat 
lymphedema in established clinical practice suggests that supplementing the vascularized 
lymph node transfer procedure wit h BioBridge will increase the magnitude of the clinical 
response in lymphedema patients.

Time of procedure:   
Operating time ~6 hours, additional 45 min for BioBridge  placement; anesthesia 
~10 to 12 hours, positioning, IV and a rterial line placement, OR, etc ( time is variable ).  
Description of procedure:  
On the day of surgery, the patient will be sent to radiology for injection of Technecium -[ADDRESS_1131992], abdomen, proximal thighs and arm(s) will be 
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .  A surgical pause is taken to identify the patient 
and the procedure(s) to be performed.  
Attention will be  turned to the left or right groin  lymph node region or right or left neck for 
supraclavicular lymph node region .  A Doppler is used to confirm the location of the lymph node  
pedicles .  Next, reverse lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_817489] .  Technecium -99 will be injected preoperatively into the foot or hand  
(depending on donor site) .  A gamma probe is used to localize the sentinel lymph node draining 
the extremity, which will be avoided during flap harvest .  The highest gamma probe count is 
noted and the donor site is deemed suitable only if the gamma probe count for the planned 
lymph node donor site is <10% of the previously noted maximum.  Indocyanine green (ICG) 
0.2 mL is injected i ntraoperatively  into seve ral sites along the periphery of the donor flap (lower 
abdomen  or supraclavicular) for lympha tic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  Fluorescence  angiography is used to 
visualize t he lymph nodes draining the lower abdominal wall  or supraclavicular region.   
Groin donor flap:  
The lymph nodes  draining the lower abdomen are visualized and correlated with the 
SCIA -based lymph nodes .  An incision is made in to the lower (left or right) abdomen and the 
skin flaps are  elevated just above the Scarpa fascia .  At the superior edge of  the flap , the SCIV 
and SIEV are  both identified and divided, with the knowledge that most of the target lymph 
nodes will lay be tween these vessels .  The flap will be  elevated lateral to medial just above the 
sartorius fascia .  The SCIA br anch to the Sartorius musc le is divided, and the SCIA a nd 
branches of the SCIV are  mobilized to their origin and  are harvested  for transfer.  
The groin wound is irrigated with an antibiotic solution  and hemostasis is achieved .  The 
inguinal  fascia , if needed,  may be reinforced with  an onlay polypropylene mesh , secured with 
interrupted and ru nning 2 -0 Prolene sutures .  A Blake drain will be placed to drain the groin 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 18 of 51 4 February  2020  wound .  The wound is closed with interrupted 2 -0 Vicryl sutures for the Scarpa, interrupted 3 -0 
Vicryl sutures for the dermis and 4 -0 Monocryl running subcuticular stitch .  
Supraclavicular donor flap:  
A transverse incision, [ADDRESS_1131993] ructures using a bovie to create a pocket for the fa scial-lymph node flap .  Small 
superficial veins are  identified and dissected free .  The basilic vein and media l cutaneous nerve 
of the arm  are identified and preserved .  The superior or  inferior recurrent  ulnar artery is  
identified , and dissected distally to gain  pedicle length .  The lymph node dermal fat flap is  then 
harvested; the SCIA and SCIVs are  anastomosed to the distal end of the  superior or  inferior 
recurrent ulnar artery and its vena commitantes using interrupted 10-[ADDRESS_1131994] sponge and needle counts  will 
be verified .  Minimal blood loss  is expected .  The patient will be aw akened ;  extubated ;  and 
transferred to the recovery room.  
IRB-[ADDRESS_1131995] PACU recovery:   1 to 1.5 hrs.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] :  [ADDRESS_1131996]-op instructions (specific to this  procedure -VLNT) : patients are instructed to keep their 
surgical arm elevated x [ADDRESS_1131997] information to take home for their 
consideration .  Samples (skin punch biopsy and blood) may be retained for future research use

Stanford Experience  
[CONTACT_817530] has performed more than [ADDRESS_1132001] 5  years.  The average 
volume reduction is 55  to 65%.  There has not been any flap loss.  There is <  5% post -operative 
infection;  <  5% wound dehiscence;  2% of seroma;  2% of hematoma;  1% post -operative deep 
vein thrombosis  (DVT).  There have had no major complications.  To date, there has been 
no incidence of donor site lymphedema.  In general, this is a well -tolerated operation.  The 
positive outcome is , in part, dependent upon patient compliance with postoperative instructions.  
4.[ADDRESS_1132002] either by [CONTACT_756] , letter, email , to determine 
the reason why they failed to return for the necessar y visits or withdrew from study, and 
reason(s) will be documented . 
Reasons that a subject may discontinue participation in a clinical study may include the 
following:  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents continuation in study  
• Potential health hazard to patients, as indicated by [CONTACT_817514]  
• The subject may choose to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condit ion that render the subject 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Severe non -compliance to protocol as judged  by [CONTACT_093]  
• Death  
• Closure of study  
4.[ADDRESS_1132003] of care treatments for lymphedema .  These include , but are not  
limited to, compression sleeves or compression devices, decongestive therapy, intermittent 
pneumatic compression devices.  In general, there are 4 types of surgical intervention for 
lymphedema,  as follows. 35,36,46-48  
Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive H ealing Approach (LYMPHA), aimed at lymphedema 
prevention, was developed at the University of Genoa.  37,38  At the time of axillary lymph node 
dissection, a lymphaticovenous anastomosis  (LVA) is performed to restore lymphatic flow.  
While a comparatively ne w procedure, for patients undergoing ALND, results have been very 
promising.  39  However, since it is aimed at lymphedema prevention, LYMPHA is not an 
appropriate alternative for this participant population, since inclusion into this trial requires a 
diagn osis of lymphedema.   
Excisional surgery, suction -assisted protein lipectomy (SAPL), pi[INVESTIGATOR_669526]  Håkan  Brorson , 
is performed for chronic non -pi[INVESTIGATOR_817492].  SAPL is highly effective at removing the 
excess solid tissue (hypertrophied adipose tissue)  but does not restore lymphatic function.  
[CONTACT_817530], who trained with [CONTACT_817531] , frequently performs this procedure.  Post -operatively, 
the continuous use (24  hours/day, 7  days/week) of custom compression garments is required.  
These may need to be frequ ently replaced in the 1st year after the procedure.  Maintenance of 
reduction is dependent on patient compliance with continuous compression garment use.  [ADDRESS_1132004] postoperative week but maintenance 
of response is unknown due to short follow -up. 41  Additionally, LVA may not enhance the 
regional immune impairment that accompanies lymphedema.  
Tissue transfer, ie,  vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT ), when successful, is intended to 
optimally restore both lymphatic circulatory and immune function.  The BioBridge scaffold has 
been designed, and tested in preclinical animal models, to optimize the surgical outcome 
specifically in vascularized lymph nod e transfer.  It is this surgical intervention that is under 
specific investigation in this protocol.  
5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION  
5.1  Investigational Agent/Device/Procedure   
Complete  information  about the investigational device c an be found in the  Investigator’s 
Brochure and IDE document.  
The BioBridge Collagen Matrix is a sterile implantable biocompatible and biodegradable  surgical 
mesh ribbon comprised of highly purified porcine collagen that is designed to  provide 
mechanical s upport and repair for weaknesses and deficiencies in soft tissue .  The device was 
cleared by [CONTACT_817507] 8 January  2016 under 510(k)  K151083  for use 
as a collagen -derived surgical mesh for plastic and reconstructive surgery .  For the purposes of 
this investigation, the commercially -available device will not be  altered or modified in any way.  
The collapsed ribbon structure of BioBridge is comprised of a single sheet of cross -linked  
collagen collapsed into multiple folds forming a thi n membrane with aligned collagen  fibrils in the 
same lengthwise direction .  This scaffold structure provides mechanical  properties that 
contribute to strong tensile strength, which provides support to weaknesses  and deficiencies in 
soft tissue and aids in bridging a connection between two healthy soft  tissues.  
BioBridge is fabricated using a proprietary manufacturing process that produces a narrow and  
very thin ribbon -like membrane comprised of aligned collagen fibrils, creating a multi - luminal  
structure t hat can be sutured, and provides the desired mechanical properties for support of  soft 
tissue repair .  This approach presents the opportunity to enable the use of highly purified 
collagen, in a defined structure that has mechanical properties similar to th ose of the predicates, 
but without undesirable telopeptides found in collagen matrices derived from animal dermis .  
The smaller ribbon -like form factor also gives the surgeon greater flexibility for minimally 
invasive delivery and to tailor their procedure s to better address a specific patient need, where 
one or more BioBridge devices can be implanted depending on the surgeon’s discretion.  
Fibralign sources the highly purified Type  I porcine -derived collagen from a FDA registered  and 
ISO-qualified supplier .  Fibralign employs a proprietary manufacturing process that takes highly 
purified Type I porcine -derived collagen and produces narrow, ribbon -like membranes 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 25 of 51 4 February  2020  comprised of highly aligned collagen fibrils that mimic desired mechanical properties found in 
natural extracellular matrices .  A chemical crosslinking agent , known as EDC 
[N-ethyl -N’-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide ], is used during the manufacturing process to 
promote the crosslinking of the collagen but the crosslinker itself is not added to nor  bound to 
the collagen matrix .  The crosslinker residuals are water soluble and are removed by [CONTACT_817515] .  The final product is packaged into individual 
storage tubes and then sealed in a multi -pack and terminally  sterilized.  
BioBridge is fabricated using a proprietary manufacturing process that collapses a single  sheet 
layer along the width direction to form a scaffold, comprised of collagen fibrils (see  Figure  1). 
 
Figure 1 . BioBridge Collagen Matrix.  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 26 of 51 4 February  2020  BioBridge has a thickness in a range of 0.10  mm to 1.0 mm, and the device is available in 
lengths over 1500  mm. 
Extensive safety and performance testing has been completed for BioBridge in support of the 
510(k) clearance, including biocompatibility and degradation s tudies, as well as full material 
characterization of the collagen content and manufacturing reagents used in fabricating 
BioBridge (provided as part of the 510(k) submission).  Significant efforts have been made in 
sourcing materials, product design and de vice manufacturing to minimize potential risks 
associated with the device.  
These include:  
1)  BioBridge is made of highly -purified, pepsin -treated porcine Collagen Type I.  The material 
is sourced from Datum Dental, which is referenced in the FDA 510(k).  The same material is 
used in ColBar Ossix and ColBar Ossix Plus which have 510(k) clearance and CE mark and 
been used in over 350,[ADDRESS_1132005] and brain.  
2) BioBridge is manufactured from this highly purified collagen in a GMP cleanroom facility 
under Class -[ADDRESS_1132006] care and then e -beam sterilized after packaging.  This 
has been supported by [CONTACT_817516].  
3) The BioBridge matrix is a very narrow ribbon, a thread -like structure that has a similar form 
factor to suture.  In practice, the proposed treatment involves a very small amount of bulk 
material (10  mg/device, with 4  to 10 devices/patient) being implan ted subcutaneously.  
4) BioBridge has been shown to be biologically more inert than catgut suture, which is being 
commonly used in the surgical procedures proposed in the study.  This was demonstrated in 
four GLP implantation studies that were performed in support of the 510(k) application.  The 
subcutaneous implantation studies (2, 13 and 26 week) have shown that BioBridge was 
considered non -irritant and determined to have less inflammatory reaction than the control 
articles (catgut suture).  These implanta tion studies have also shown that BioBridge 
integrates well and safely absorbs in subcutaneous tissue in 6  to 9 months.  
5) Based on review of approved surgical meshes and earlier testing of BioBridge, it is not 
anticipated that implanting this small amount  of purified collagen into this treatment  area will 
create additional complications to the da maged lymphatic tissue .  None of BioBridge’s 
predicate devices have counter indications for use with patients that have lymphedema .  A 
further review of the larger  surgical mesh devices that are ma de of extracellular matrix and 
widely used in breast reconst ruction surgical procedures for similar patients also did not 
show any contraindicati ons for lymphedema .  Preliminary results from the Dominican 
Republic pi[INVESTIGATOR_817493], no complications hav e been 
reported to date with [ADDRESS_1132007] ion or other complications observed with the 120 
devices implanted.  
6) In this proposed treatment, BioBridge is not intended to replace normal body structure or 
provide full mechanical strength .  The device will be impla nted in the surgical area during 
transplantation in subcutaneous soft tissue and not intended to come in direct contact [CONTACT_817517] .  Even if the device ends up not providing the mechanical 
function as intended (fails), it is not ex pecte d to be catastrophic or to materially impact the 
subject .  If a failure occurs, the surgical outcome would be expected to be the same as the 
control group receiving the ALNT procedure without the device, which is the current 
standard of care for lymphedema  patients.

Primary and Secondary Assessments  
For each analysis undertaken, primar y and secondary, participants will be randomized into one 
of two groups:  VLNT  (control  arm) or VLNT -BioBridge  (intervention arm).  Change in 
intervention group compared to control group will be evaluated.  
IRB-[ADDRESS_1132019] cancer .  Primary endpoint is % change in (excess) limb volume, from 
baseline t o Month  12, in the intervention group relative to control group.  Dispersion (variance) 
will be assessed as the standard deviation .  
The single subject enrolled to this study prior to the December  [ADDRESS_1132020] cancer  treatment, who plan to undergo  VLNT.   
10.1.2 Measurement Definition  
Quantitative assessment of limb volume ( mL) of the affected limb at study end ( Month  12) will 
be compared to pre -intervention  (baseline)  value .  Baseline value is defined as the arithmetic 
mean of measurements obtaine d at the two qualifying screening visits .  Mean difference  in limb 
volume in the intervention group relative to control group at study end ( Month  12) following 
surgical intervention will be evaluated.    
10.1.[ADDRESS_1132021] .  The limb 
volume will be determined using a truncated cone formula{( volume  = πh(R2 +Rr +r 2)/3, let h be 
the height, R the radius of the lower base, and r the radius of the upper] .  Limb circumference, 
for calculation of limb volumes, will be serially measured at screening evaluations and in 
follow -up to study end ( Month  12).  For quantitative analysis, the volume of the ipsilateral arm 
will be expressed as a percentage of the unaffected arm volume and of the pre -treatment 
volume of the ipsilateral arm.  
10.1.4 Measurement Time Points  
Limb circumference, for calculation of limb volum es, will be measured at screening evaluations 
to scheduled follow -up visits ( Month  3, 6, 9, 12) .  The primary endpoint will be asses sed at time

measurement in the intervention group relative to control group at study end ( Month  12) 
following surgical intervention will be evaluated .  Dispersion (variance) will be assessed as the 
standard deviation.  
10.2.3 Measurement Methods  
Skin thickness measurements (in  mm) will be performed with a Lange skinfold caliper (Beta 
Technology, Santa C ruz, CA) .  For each participant, at each assessment, 3 measurements will 
be obtained: the dorsum of the hand, the midpoint of the volar aspect of the forearm, and the 
midpoint of the medial aspect of the upper arm .  At the initial evaluation, a dermatograp hic 
pencil is used to mark the site of each measurement .  Once the locations are determined, the 
location is noted (measured from the wrist) .  These locations will be re -utilized for serial 
measurements for each follow -up visit .  Calipers are calibrated pr ior to each use .  Assessor will 
be blinded to treatment status .  Pre and post -surgical aggregate scores of lymphedema -affected 
limb will be utilized and reported.

[IP_ADDRESS] Relevant Subset  
The target population are participants with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema, secondary to 
breast cancer  treatment, who plan to undergo VLNT.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measur ement Definition  
For LSG, a significant improvement in the s cintigraphic uptake of  the transplanted LN 
(continuous variable); improvement in the uptake of the radionuclide in a defined 
region -of-interest (ROI) within the proximal LN drainage pathway (axill a); improvement in the

Change in L -Dex bioimpedance spectroscopy (L -Dex BIS) , from baseline to Month  12, in the 
intervention group relative to control group.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Relevant Subset  
The target population are participants with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema, secondary to 
breast cancer treatment, who plan to undergo VLNT.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Definition  
L-Dex B IS value of the aff ected limb at study end ( Month  12) will be compared to 
pre-intervention value .  Baseline value is defined as the arithmetic average of values obtained at 
the two qualifying screening visits .  Mean difference  L-Dex BIS values in the inter vention group 
relative to con trol group at study end ( Month  12) following surgical intervention will be 
evaluated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Methods  
L-Dex BIS utilizes transcutaneous transmission of a very low frequency, subliminal electrical 
current to determ ine extracellular fluid volume .  It is a form of widely used body composition 
analysis.  
After cleaning the skin (to remove body oils), electrodes are placed on top of the skin of the limb 
being measured (for arms, at wrist and top of arm) .  A 4-electrode configuration will be used to 
non-invasively assess the extracellular and intracellular fluid contents of the limb .  The probes 
are attached to the electrode itself .  Measurement setting is selected and the bioimpedance at 
an extrapolated frequency  = 0 (R0) correlates to the volume of extracellular fluid .  The applied 
current used is 200uA RMS, at a variable frequency of 4 kHz to 1000 kHz.  
Participant data will be entered into the device software (encrypted research -dedicated laptop) .  
Data will be analyze d according to Cole theory, using the manufacturer's software (ImpediMed 
Ltd.), to provide values for a bioimpedance ratio (Ro), the resistance of the extracellular fluid 
including lymph, R∞ the resistance of total tissue fluid and Ri, the resistance of th e intracellular 
fluid.  For unilateral lymphedema, the ratio of Ro in the affected:unaffected limbs will be 
analyzed as a measure of the bioimpedance attributable to the extracellular fluid content .  Ro 
level of 1.034 is considered normal; values ≥1.[ADDRESS_1132025]

breast cancer treatment, who plan to undergo VLNT.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Definition  
Quantitative assessment of paired histological specimens of lymphedema skin pre - and 
post-intervention .  The impact of intervention on cutaneous histopathology will be evaluated 
through the use of an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -derived scoring system (comprised of dermal thickness, 
intercellular mucin content, deep dermal collagen content, and perivascular infiltrate); this 
quantitative assessment was developed and will be performed by a dermatopathologi st.  Each 
characteristic will be weighted equally and each specimen will be assigned a cumulative 
subscale score of 0  to 5 (normal to severe) .  The scores were summed for a total score (range: 
0 to 20) which is presented here .  Higher scores indicate a hig her degree of pathology .

appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as 
needed.  
11.3 Data Management Plan  
The Protocol Director  and his research tea m will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 37 of 51 4 February  2020  Case  Report Forms (CRFs) will docume nt treatment outcomes for data analysis.  Case report 
forms wi ll be developed using the Oncore  database sy stem and will be maintained by P rincipal 
Investigator  and his research team .  CRFs  (paper documents)  will be kept in a secure location, 
not accessible  to the public .  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Statistical Design  
This study is open -label due to visibly apparent differences between the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_817496].  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary outcome is the  post-surgical  % change in excess limb  volume, measured  at 
12 months , following the surgical procedure.  
Secondary Endpoint : 
For secondary endpoint , the mean response of the intervention group will be compared  to the 
control g roup, for change in measurement of dermal thickness, as measured by [CONTACT_817523], from screening evaluations  to Month  12.  
12.1.1  Randomization  
A blocked randomization design will be used for randomization .  Sixty subjects  will be 
randomized in a 4:1 ratio to the intervention arm (VLNT  + BioBridge) or control arm ( VLNT 
alone).

specified intervals of 4  cm (starting from the 3rd metacarpal head) along the axis o f the arm, 
beginning at the wrist.  Anatomic landmarks are recorded to facilitate reproducibility between 
pre- and post -surgical measurements.  This method is inexpensive, reproducible, and easily 
applied.  These measurements will be performed at initial e valuation and at each scheduled 
follow -up visit.  The pre -surgical baseline volume for each limb will be defined as the average of 
the two measurements obtained on study day S1 and study day S2.  For quantitative analysis, 
the excess volume of the limb is defined as the arithmetical difference between the affected 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 38 of 51 4 February  2020  limb (Lpre) and the contralateral normal limb  (Cpre) and the % excess volume at the beginning of 
the study is defined by:   
100% * [(L pre – Cpre)/C pre]. 
The primary outcome is defined the post -surgical % change in excess limb volume:  
100* {1 - [(Lpost – Cpost)/( L pre – Cpre)]} 
Analysis Population  
Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 arms , the intervention arm ( VLNT with BioBridge ) or 
control  arm (VLNT -only).  The primary analysis will include al l participants who have completed 
all required study visits .  However, for participants who do not complete the study, their data will 
be censored and analyzed with the current population .  Treatment summary and adverse event 
data will also be provided for  each treatment category separately.  
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on all part icipants who have undergone V LNT 
(with or without BioBridge) .  The primary analysis will include all participants who have 
completed all required study visits an d procedures .  However participants who do not complete 
the study will be censored and their data will be analyzed, along with ongoing participants .  Data 
including adverse event data will be captured for each treatment category separately.  
Analysis Plan  
The final analysis will be undertaken  after the final enrolled participan t completes all planned 
study events .  At that time, the data will be unblinded and the analyses will be undertaken as 
described above .  There will be multiple analysis populations .  The primary analysis will use  all 
subjects enrolled and assigned to treatment, categorized by [CONTACT_817524] .  A 
sensitivit y analysis will use  the set of subjects enrolled and treatment -assigned in the study who 
completed the study protocol , catego rized according to treatment actually received.  
Generalized linear mixed effects models are maximum likelihood based methods that are ideal 
for handling missing outcome data .  More specifically, in prospective clinical trials such as the 
one proposed, a ma jor concern is loss to follow up .  The model we have proposed 
accommodates anticipated loss to follow up and allows us to analyze subjects treated in the 
study even if they are lost to follow up, ie, if a subject is lost to follow up, the subject is includ ed 
in the analysis if at least one post -baseline value is recorded prior to loss to follow up) .  This 
model relies on a flexible assumption about the missing data, namely that the missing values 
are missing at random (i e, that missingness is related to obs erved values only such as baseline 
volume values and treatment arm) .  Given the nature of the data generated, we believe this to 
be a reasonable assumption.  
To allow for the possibility that the response variable may not have a linear relationship with the  
time variable, we will treat time as a categorical variable to allow time to have a non -linear 
relationship with the response.  The categorical time variable can take on values of 3, 6, 9, or 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1132030] the primary analysis to evaluate wh ether there is a difference 
between the treatment and control arms in the volume reduction of the affected limb at 
12 months.  We will fit the linear mixed effects model below assuming an AR(1) covariance 
structure.  We will evaluate the sensitivity of our  assumption about the covariance structure by 
[CONTACT_817525] a sensitivity analysis.  Let 
  represent the reduction in 
volume of the affected limb for subject i at time j (for j = 3, 6, 9, and 12  months), 
  be the 
random intercept for subject i, 
 be the error for subject i at time j,  
  be an indicator for 
whether subject i is in the BioBridge arm, and 
 ;  
 ;  
 ;  
  be indicators for 
whether a measurement on subject i at time j was taken at Month  3;  6;  9;  or 12, respectively.  
To assess whether there is a volume reduction of the affected limb at [ADDRESS_1132031] clinical 
trial settings and certainly not here.  The motivation for performing this analysis; however, allows 
us to assess how robust our findings are to deviations in our as sumptions of missingness.  A 
final sensitivity analysis will be performed where we impute data using multiple imputation 
techniques that rely on an assumption that the data are NOT missing at random.  More 
specifically, our imputation model will assume tho se with missing values in the treatment arm 
are less likely to have a salutary treatment effect.  Such sensitivity analyses will provide a 
context in which we can appropriately interpret the primary findings.  In this sensitivity analysis, 
we will assume a  range of volume reductions in the treatment arm (eg,  90%;  75%;  50% of the 
reduction observed in the control  arm).  If we find a statistically significant reduction in the 
treatment arm as compared to the control arm, the range of reductions will be chos en such that 
the range covers the “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” where the difference in the two arms is no longer statistically 
significant.  This “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” analysis is in place of a worst -case sensitivity analysis because 
there is not a clearly defined “worst -case” in a non -binary outcome.  Our sensitivity analysis will 
follow the advice given in “ Strategy for intention to treat analysis in randomized trials with 
missing outcome data.” 25

Exploratory Endpoints and Outcomes  
L-Dex: Multiple frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) will be performed with the 
impedance device .  This tool utilizes multiple frequency electrical current ( 1 kHz to 500 kHz) to 
determine extracellular fluid (ECF) volume .  At low frequency ( < 50 kHz) current does not 
penetrate the cell membrane into the intracellular space, as opposed to high frequency current 
(> 200 kHz).  As a result, intracellular and extracellular volumes can be measured 
separately . 26-[ADDRESS_1132032] deviation(SD) range from the mean . 30,31  See Figure  3 below .

An additional volume reduction of 20% ascribable to the BioBridge (versus VLNT only) would 
represent a substantial and clinically relevant amelioration in the surgical outcome wh en 
compared to current, standard VLNT without BioBridge supplementation .  This magnitude of 
treatment differential has been demonstrated for the BioBridge in lymphedema, both in our

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Sarcomas  are a group of rare, aggressive malignancies that are often fatal despi[INVESTIGATOR_48794]. The American Cancer Society predicts approximately 12,300 new 
sarcoma  diagnoses in 2017, with 5000 sarcoma -related deaths. Surgery remains the 
mainstay of treatment in localized disease, however even optimal local treatment does 
not prevent the occurrence of distant metastases in some patients, particularly those with 
high-grade tumors.  Approximately 50% of patients present with or develop advanced, 
unresec table or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, available systemic treatment options 
in this setting have limited efficacy, and thus prognosis remains poor, underscoring the 
need for development of novel treatment strategies.  
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background  
Trabect edin 
Trabectedin is a synthetic marine -derived drug that is known to have activity in advanced 
soft-tissue sarcoma ( STS) and is currently approved for treatment in  unresectable or 
metastatic  leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and liposarcoma (LPS)  previously treated wit h an 
anthracycline . A phase II study of trabectedin after standard chemotherapy as compared 
to best supportive care in various subtypes of STS showed a median progression free 
survival (PFS) of 5.[ADDRESS_51218] ratio (HR) of 0.70 [1]. The 
most common adverse events were nausea, anorexia, neutropenia, and increased 
alanine aminotransferase. A subsequent phase III trial was conducted to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of trabectedin versus dacarbazine in metastatic LMS and LPS. A total  
of 518 patients were enrolled and trabectedin -treated patients had a significantly 
improved PFS as compared to dacarbazine, 4.2 vs 1.5 months respectively with a HR of 
0.55 [2]. Trabectedin has also been evaluated in the front -line setting in a phase IIb study 
comparing trabectedin to doxorubicin in patients with adva nced or metastatic untreated 
STS. There was no significant improvement in PFS in the trabectedin arm as compared 
to doxorubicin, therefore doxorubicin remains standard of care as first -line therapy [3].  
 
Olaparib  
Investigators should be familiar with the current olaparib (AZD2281) Investigator 
Brochure (IB). 
 
Olaparib (AZD2281, KU -0059436) is a potent Polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose [poly 
(ADP ribose)] polymerization  (PARP) inhibitor (PARP -1, -2 and -3) that is being 
developed as an oral therapy, both as a monotherapy (including maintenance) and for 
comb ination with chemotherapy and other anti -cancer agents.   It is currently approved for 
treatment of both ovarian and breast cancer (patients selected for therapy based on an 
FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza [olaparib] and for the maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_12254]).  
 
PARP inhibition is a novel approach to targeting tumors  with deficiencies in DNA repair 
mechanisms.  PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA s ingle strand breaks 
(SSBs).  Inhibiting PARPs leads to the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to 
the more serious DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during the process of DNA 
replication.  During the process of cell division, DSBs can be efficientl y repaired in normal 
cells by [CONTACT_48826] (HR).  Tumors  with HR deficiencies (HRD), 
such as ovarian cancers in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, cannot accurately repair 
the DNA damage, which may become lethal to cells as it accumulates.   In such tumor

 types, olaparib may offer a potentially efficacious and less toxic cancer treatment 
compared with currently available chemotherapy regimens.  
 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 defective tumors  are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors, both in 
tumor  models in vivo [4, 5]   and in the clinic [6]. The mechanism of action for olaparib 
results from the trappi[INVESTIGATOR_48795] -strand breaks preventing their 
repair [7, 8] .  Persistence of SSBs during DNA replication results in their conversion into 
the more serious DNA DSBs th at would normally be repaired by [CONTACT_48827].  Olaparib has 
been shown to inhibit selected tumor  cell lines in vitro and in xenograft and primary 
explant models as well as in genetic BRCA knock -out models, either as a stand -alone 
treatment or in combination with established chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
1.3 Rationale  
Trabectedin has a unique mechanism of action, which includes binding to the minor 
groove of DNA and bending the helix to the major groove , thus impairing the cell cycle 
[9]. Studies have demonstrated a complex  mechanism of action that includes direct killing 
of cancer cells by [CONTACT_48828]. 
Specifically, trabectedin is thought to trap members of the nucleoside -excision repair 
(NER) mechanism forming l arge complexes that inhibit NER activity resulting in single -
strand DNA breaks (SSBs) [10]. These SSBs subsequently stall replication forks leading 
to double -strand DNA breaks (DSBs), thus resulting in cell death. Interestingly, cell lines 
deficient in NER proteins have been shown to be less sensitive to trabectedin [10-12]. 
Furthermore, defects in homologous recombination (HR) , a mechanism used to repair 
DSBs,  have been associated with higher sensitivity to trabectedin, suggesting induction 
of synthetic lethality [12, 13] .  
 
PARP enzymes are essential for repair of SSBs . Upon binding to the area of DN A 
damage, PARP is activated and catalyzes addition of long polymers of ADP -ribose on 
several proteins including histones and DNA repair proteins [14]. Intracellular signaling is 
activated resulting in activation of BER and SSB repair pathways. Inhibit ion of PARP thus 
allows propagation of SSBs , ultimately resulting in DSBs and cell apoptosis.  
 
Based on the mechanisms of action of PARP inhibitors and trabectedin, potential for 
synthetic lethality was hypothesized. Synthetic lethality is a concept in whi ch a single 
gene defect is compatible with cell viability, but the combination of gene defects results in 
cell death [15, 16] . Synthetic lethality provides a potential mechanism for thera peutic 
targeting of genetic abnormalities in cancers. One example includes inhibition of PARP 
leading to enhanced platinum sensitivity in breast and ovarian cancer models harboring 
mutations in BRCA1/2 genes.  The accumulation of lethal DSBs in a setting o f HR 
deficiency , such as in BRCA 1/2 mutants,  suggests increased sensitivity to PARP 
inhibition in the presence of DNA repair defects [17, 18] .    
 
Avila -Arroyo et al. combined trabectedin with the PARP inhibitors olaparib, veliparib and 
iniparib in BRCA1 proficient and deficient breast tumor cells. Synergistic anti -proliferative 
effects were observed in all breast cancer cell lines  with the combination of trabectedin  
and olaparib [19]. Importantly, this synergy w as noted regardless of BRCA1 status, 
suggesting rationale for this combination in BRCA proficient tumors.  
 
 Role for combination in Sarcoma  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48796].  explored the role of trabectedin in combination with olaparib in various 
bone and soft tissue sarcoma cell lines including LMS, undifferentiated pleomorphic 
sarcoma (UPS), dedifferentiated lipo sarcoma (DDLPS), fibrosarcoma (FSA), synovial 
sarcoma (SS), os teosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) [20]. They noted a significant 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 8 of 55 
 
 
 increase in gamma H2AX (P -H2AX), a marker of DNA DSBs, in cell lines treated with 
trabectedin. The combination of trabectedin with olaparib resulted in further increase in 
H2AX compared to monotherapy, and irreparable DNA fragmentation was significantly 
increased after 48 hours of therapy. They subsequently found that olaparib inhibited both 
basal and trabectedin -induced PARP1 activation in 50% of treated cell lines. Strong 
synergistic antit umor activity was found with combination of trabectedin plus olaparib in 
18/20 tested cells lines. Synergy was also noted in 15/[ADDRESS_51219] been conducted utilizing sarcoma  cell lines 
derived from patients with UPS, DDLPS, LMS, well -differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) 
and extraskeletal osteosarcoma (exOS) by [CONTACT_48829]. They noted 9/9 cell lines to be 
sensitive to trabectedin and 3/9 sensitive to rucaparib , a PARP inhibito r monotherapy 
[21]. The combination of rucapa rib with trabectedin increased DNA damage, induced 
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in all treated cell lines. UPS mice xenografts treated with 
the combination had a longer tumor volume doubling time as compared to monotherapy 
(17.1 days with combination, 1 4.8 days with trabectedin (p=0.045), 6.6 days with 
rucaparib (p<0.0001)). Twenty -five percent of tumors in the combination group had at 
least 60% necrosis, and the authors noted no observed signs of toxicity with the 
combination.  
 
A phase 1b study combini ng trabectedin and olaparib in advanced sarcoma reported the 
combination was safe and tolerable  [22]. Dose -limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia 
and prolonged neutropenia and the recommended phase 2 dose was trabectedin 1.1 
mg/m2 on day 1 and olaparib 150 mg twice daily[23].  Other treatment -related a dverse 
events included anemia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, nausea, elevated liver 
enzymes, mucositis and elevated amylase/lipase. There was no significant drug -drug 
interaction noted on pharmacokinet ic evaluation and pharmacodynamics evaluation 
confirmed PARP1 inhibition.  
 
Based on these data, we propose to combine trabectedin with olaparib in patients with 
previously treated advanced sarcoma.  The use of this combination in sarcoma is 
investigational , and  we hypothesize that the combination of olaparib and trabectedin will 
be safe and effective in patients with advanced sarcoma . 
 
1.4 Exploratory Studies  
 
1.4.1  Next Generation Sequencing  
The presence of DNA repair defects (DRD) was correlated to PARP inhibitor 
response in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving 
abiraterone with or without the PARP inhibitor veliparib stratified by [CONTACT_48830] n [24]. Molecular analysis included evaluation for BRCA1/2, 
ATM, FANCA, PALB2, RAD51B/RAD51C, PTEN, TP53, PIK3CA. Eighty patients 
underwent tissue sequencing with 42 (53%) being ETS -positive and 19 (25%) 
had DRD. Irrespective o f treatment arm, patients with DRD had a higher ORR 
(58% vs 39%, p=0.002) and longer median PFS (16.6 vs 8 mo, p=0.02) 
compared to placebo. PFS was also longer in patients with normal PTEN, TP53 
and PIK3CA. Controlling for clinical factors, the authors con cluded that DRD, 
PTEN, TP53 and PIK3CA were associated with PFS, with DRD having the most 
UMCC [ADDRESS_51220] in other tumor types.  
 
Results of comprehensive next gene ration sequencing performed on existing or 
available archival tumor samples will be evaluated for genomic alterations in 
order to identify predictors of clinical response to therapy.  
 
1.4.2  DNA Damage Repair Defects  
 
Presence of DNA repair defects has been correlated with improved response to 
trabectedin [25]. A retrospective analysis of BRCA mRNA in tumor samples from 
patients with advanced sarcoma noted improved response to trabectedin and 
better disease control rate in patients with low tumor BRCA mRNA expression 
[26].  
 
We will evaluate  existing samples  for defects in DNA repair pathways by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC) which may include H2AX, RAD51, RAD52, 
XRCC1, PARP1, Schlafen -11, BRCA1/2, amongst others. The decrease or 
increase in expression level of DNA repair pathways genes  will be c orrelated with 
disease response to therapy.  
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_51221] suggested that the 
risk of drug -related cardiac adverse events was low, ranging from 0.2% to 
7%.[27, 28]  More recent studies have suggested that ventricular dysfunction 
occurs in up to  14% of patients  with 3% in overt heart failure compared to 11 % 
and 1% with dacarbazine. [29]  
Soluble urokinase plasminogen acti vator receptor (suPAR) is a marker of 
immune activation and pathogenic factor in kidney disease. Levels of suPAR 
have been strongly associated with heart failure and incident cardiovascular 
disease. [30-32] We will measure suPAR along with traditional cardiovascular 
markers (BNP, h igh sensitivity troponin -I and high -sensitivity CRP) levels at 
baseline and after 2 doses of trabectedin, and determine whether levels are 
significantly altered by [CONTACT_48831], and whether baseline or early changes in levels 
are predictive of a later decline i n left ventricular function.

3.2.[ADDRESS_51238] SCREENING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURE S 
  
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by [CONTACT_48835] (i.e. the Coordinating Center) of The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center as 
described below:  
 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_43887] a Screening and 
Enrollment Log.  
 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting 
patient registration request to the Coordinating Center. Afte r patient eligibility has been 
determined, a copy of the completed Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent redacted  
source documents will be submitted by [CONTACT_48836], by [CONTACT_48837] -Oncology -[EMAIL_896] .    
 
A Multi -Site Coordinator of the Coordinating Center, who acts as the registrar, will review the 
submitted documents and process the registration. Sites should inform the Multi -Site Coordinator 
of a potential registration by [ADDRESS_51239] start within 14 business days of registration  to the study.  
 
Trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously over a 24 -hour continuous  
infusion  once every 21 days. Actual  body weight from screening will be used to calculate 
dose.  If weight changes by [CONTACT_726] 10% from baseline, recalculate the dose.  
 
Olaparib [ADDRESS_51240] tablets can be seen and counted.  Should any 
patient enrolled on the study miss a scheduled dose for whatever reason (e.g., as a result 
of forgetting to take the tablets or vomiting), the patient will be allowed to take the 
scheduled dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that scheduled dose time.  If gr eater 
than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose is not to be taken and the 
patient should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time .   
 
Patients will be requested to maintain a medication diary of each dose of medication. The 
medication diary should be returned and/or reviewed by [CONTACT_48838].

5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity ac cording to the Time and Events 
Table ( Section 6. 2). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity . Any toxicity observed 
during the course of the study could be managed by [CONTACT_48839]. Repeat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_51242] be informed. Once dose is reduced, escalation is not permitted

Management of hematologic toxicities while on study treatment  
Adverse event of neutropenia and leukopenia should be managed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_48845] 3 or worse 
neutropenia occurs  as above . Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -
CSF) is not recommended  for first cycle , however, if a patient develops febrile neutropenia, study 
treatment should be stopped and appropriate management including G -CSF should be given 
according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48798] .  
 
Platelet transfusions, if indicated, should be done according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].  Appropriate 
supportive treatment and causality investigation should be performed as indicated clinica lly.

confirmed.  
 
Common treatable causes of an emia (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies and 
hypothyroidism) should be investigated and appropriately managed . In some cases,  management 
of anemia  may require blood transfusions. For cases whe re patients develop prolonged 
hematological toxicity (≥2 -week interruption/delay in study treatment  due to CTC grade 3 or worse 
anemia and/or development of blood transfusion dependence, refer to guidance earlier  in this

and olaparib by [CONTACT_48854]. 
At second recurrence, reduce trabectedin by [CONTACT_23615]  
• Patient to be withdrawn from study if unable to

Guidance on renal impairment:  
If subsequent to study entry and while still on study therapy, a patient’s estimated  creati nine 
clearance ( CrCl) falls below the threshold for study inclusion (≥51 ml/min), retesting should be 
performed promptly.  
 
A dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop moderate renal impairment 
(calculated creatinine clearance by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault equation or based on a [ADDRESS_51255] of 
between 31 and 50 ml/min) for any reason during the course of the study: the dose of olaparib 
should be reduced to 100 mg twice daily.  
 
Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl 
falls to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the investigator should use his or her discretion in 
determining whether a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is warranted.  
 
Olaparib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine c learance ≤ 30 
ml/min) or end -stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or end stage disease i t 
is recommended that olaparib be discontinued.  
 
Management of new or worsening pulmonary symptom s 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., d yspnea) or radiological abnormalities occur in 
the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended and 
further diagnostic workup (including a high resolution CT scan) should be performed to exclude 
pneumonitis.  
 
Follo wing investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and symptoms 
resolve, then study treatment can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. If 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 20 of 55 
 
 
 significant pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be disc ussed with the Study 
Principal Investigator . 
 
Management of nausea and vomiting  
Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib treatment. These events 
are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) severity, intermittent and manageable on 
continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea 
and within the first [ADDRESS_51256] onset of nausea or 
vomiting and as required t hereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice 
guidelines.   Alternatively, olaparib tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack ( i.e. [ADDRESS_51257] or a couple of biscuits).  
 
As per international guidance on anti -emetic use in cancer patients (ESMO, NCCN), generally a 
single agent antiemetic should be considered (e.g.) dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines 
or dexamethasone.  
 
Interruptions for intercurrent non -toxicity related events  
Study treatment dose interruption for conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept as 
short as possible. If a patient cannot restart study treatment within 4 weeks for resolution of 
intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or toxicity, the case should be 
discussed with the Principal Investigator . 
 
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions are to be record ed in the patient’s record .  
 
Study treatment should be stopped at least 3 days prior to planned s urgery. After surgery study 
treatment can be restarted when the wound has healed. No stoppage of study treatment is 
required for any needle biopsy procedure.  
 
Study treatment should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes 
radiati on treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone 
marrow toxicity has recovered.  
 
Because the AEs related to study treatment  may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, patients 
should be advised to use caution while dri ving or using machinery if these symptoms occur.  
 
Special Considerations:  
• For ejection fraction reduction to < LLN or clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy, 
trabectedin should be held until normalization of EF. For absolute reduction in EF 10% 
or more from b aseline and < LLN, reduce trabectedin to DL -1.  
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
• The use of any natural/herbal products or other traditional remedies should be 
discouraged, but use of these products, as well as any medication or vaccine 
including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal 
supplements that the p atient is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during 
the study must be recorded  along with:  
o Reason for use  
o Dates of administration including start and end dates  
o Dosage information including dose and frequency  
UMCC 2018 .132

• Anti-emetics/Anti -diarrheal  medications  
From screening onwards, should a patient develop n ausea, vomiting and/ or diarrh ea, 
then these symptoms should be reported as AEs (see section 8) and appropriate 
treatment of the event given.

Based on limited in vitro  data, olaparib may increase 
the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, OATP1B1, 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K.  
  
Based on limited in vitro  data, olaparib  may reduce 
the exposure to substrates of 2B6.  
 
Caution should be observed if substrates of these 
isoenzymes or transporter proteins are co -
administered.  
 
Anticoagulant therapy  Patients who are taking warfarin may participate in 
this trial; however, it is recommended that 
international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored 
carefully at least once per week for the first month, 
then monthly if the INR is stable. Subcutaneous 
heparin and low molecular weight heparin are 
permitted.  
Palliative radiotherapy  Palliative radiotherapy may be used for the treatment 
of pain at the site of bony metastases that wer e 
present at baseline, provided the investigator does 
not feel that these are indicative of clinical disease 
progression during the study period.  Study treatment 
should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days 
before a patient undergoes therapeutic palliat ive 
radiation treatment.  Study treatment should be 
restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow 
toxicity has recovered.

 Medication/class of drug : Usage (including limits for duration permitted and 
special situations in which it’s allowed ): 
Administration of other anti -cancer 
agents  
 Patients must not receive any other concurrent anti -
cancer therapy, including investigational agents, 
while on study treatment. Patients may continue the 
use of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone 
disease and corticosteroids for the symptomatic 
control o f brain metastases provided the dose is 
stable before and during the study and they were 
started at least 4 weeks prior to beginning study 
treatment.  
 
Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) is not recommended, 
however, if a patient develops febrile neutropenia, study treatment should be stopped and 
appropriate management including G -CSF should be given according to local h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].  
Please note that G -CSF should not be used within at least 24 h (7 days for pegylated G -CSF) of 
the last dose of study treatment unless absolutely necessary . 
5.4 Other Modalities or Procedures  
Palliative radiation therapy may be permitted to a non -target lesion while on study 
treatment upon discussion with the principal investigator.  
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up 
to 18 months on study until one of the following cr iteria apply:  
• Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0 
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment  
• Bone marrow findings consistent with myelodysplastic sy ndrome 
(MDS)/acute myeloid leuk emia (AML)  OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
5.[ADDRESS_51258], or they may be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reason s. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study will be documented and may 
include:  
• Patient withdraws consent (term ination of treatment and follow -up); 
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment;  
• Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
• Treating physician judges  continuation on the study would not be in the 
patient ’s best interest ; 
• Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines 
as a serious adverse event);  
• Development of second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) that requires treatment which would 
interfere with this study;  
• Lost to Follow -up. If a research subject cannot be located to document 
survival after a period of [ADDRESS_51259] may be considered “ lost to 
follow -up.” All attempts to contact [CONTACT_48856]  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_43888] ; 
• Patient completes protocol treatment and follow -up criteria.

l. Bone marrow or blood cytogenetic samples may be collecte d for patients with prolonged 
hematological toxicities at any timepoint as clinically indicated as defined in Section  5.2.  
Bone marrow analysis should include an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_48800], cytogenetic 
analysis and flow cytometry, and a core biopsy for bone marrow cellularity. If it is not 
possible to conduct cytogenetic analysis or flow cytomet ry on the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], 
then attempts should be made to carry out the tests on a blood sample.   
m. Patients will be followed every 3 months via phone for documentation of progression and 
survival status for a minimum of 2  years  from registration .  If patient is unavailable, then 
survival status will be determined if possible , by [CONTACT_48859].  
n. Visits on day 1 of each cycle, lab measurements at days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, and the 
end of treatment visit, can be completed +/-3 days .

obtained within 28 days of initiation of therapy.  
** Laboratory assessment w ill be done on day [ADDRESS_51262] - Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be  evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) 
Committee [ Eur J Cancer  45(2): 228 -47, 2009 ]. Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_51263] 1 cycle (s) of therapy, and 
have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response . 
These patients will have their response classified accordi ng to the definitions 
stated below . (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
7.1.[ADDRESS_51264] one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 27 of 55 
 
 
 • 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness o r MRI 
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be  
             accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as  
             non-measurable)          
• 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776])  
                           
                         All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of     
                         centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a  lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_14216] (CT scan slice  thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis will be measured and followed . 
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_51265] scan), are considered non -measurable disease . Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymp hangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
Target l esions . All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should  be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diamet er), be representative of all involved organ, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
which may be visible by [CONTACT_48860] . Pathological 
nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions 
must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis 
of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The shor t axis of the node is 
the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_48862] . Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane ; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as 
being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant,  
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered nonpathological and sho uld not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axi s is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characteri ze any objective tumor  regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease . 
 
Non-target l esions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patholog ical 
lymph nodes should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required,  and these lesions should 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 28 of 55 
 
 
 be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to fol low). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
7.1.3  Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatmen t. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination 
unless the lesion( s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_48863] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_48864], imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
 
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, since CT is more sensitive 
than X -ray, particularly in identifying new  lesions. However, lesions on chest X -
ray may be considered measurable if they are  clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].  
 
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions  selected for response assessment. This  guideline has defined 
measurability of lesions on  CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is  5mm or less . When  CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 
mm, the minimum size  for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. M RI is also acceptable in  certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used  as a method of measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_48865],  confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is 
concern about radiation exposure  at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in 
selected instances.  
7.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions, 
determined by [CONTACT_43897] 4 
weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as referenc e the baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 29 of 55 
 
 
 Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions  (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm) , taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since t he treatment started, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluat ion of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started) . The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both meas urement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.

Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease 
resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery.  
7.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  Patients without disease progression 
should be censored at the last time point for which their disease was known to 
not have progressed.  
 
 
The dura tion of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.    
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until th e criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progres sion.  
7.2 Safety/T olerability  
  Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study 
drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 5.0 for reporting of adverse events 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Adverse Event Report Requirements  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is 
done to ensure the safety of subj ects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of informed consent  through [ADDRESS_51267] also be reported. Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will continue to be followed until:  
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute th e serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment for the changes 
observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_48801] o f this section.  

UMCC [ADDRESS_51268] be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and 
on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the 
study treatment.  
In addition to new events , any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre -existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment is also 
considered an adverse event.  
 
Adverse events after the 30 day follow up period  
For Pharmacovigilanc e purposes and characteri zation, any SAE of MDS/AML or new 
primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to the 
Coordinating Center who in turn will report to [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety regardless of 
investigator’s asses sment of causality or knowledge of the treatment arm.  Investigators 
will be asked during the regular follow up for overall survival if the patient has developed 
MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases.  
  
At any time afte r a patient has completed the study, if an Investigator learns of any SAE 
including sudden death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event is causally related to the investigational product, the investigator 
should notify the Coordinating Center who in turn will notify [COMPANY_008], Patient Safety.  
 
If patients who are gaining clinical benefit are allowed to continue study treatment post 
data cut off and/or post study completion , then all SAEs must continue to be  collected 
and reported to Patient Safety within the usual timeframe.  
 
Otherwise, after study treatment completion (i.e. after any scheduled post treatment 
follow -up period has ended) there is no obligation to actively report information on new 
AEs or SAEs  occurring in former study patients. This includes new AEs/SAEs in patients 
still being followed up for survival but who have completed the post treatment follow up 
period (30 days).  
8.2 Definitions  
8.2.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether or n ot related to the intervention.  
 
• This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condition.  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive (i.e. surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets 
the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre -existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 32 of 55 
 
 
 • Symptoms of the original or targeted disease are not to be considered 
adverse events for this study. The following symptoms are indicative of 
underlying disease and will not be reported as adverse events ( unless the 
event is considered serious):  
o Cancer -related pain   
• Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy. They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_51269] (AESI) are events of scientific and medical 
interest resulting from a pre viously identified signal (even if non -serious) or are 
specific to the further understanding of a drug’s safety profile. AESIs require 
close monitoring and rapid communication  by [CONTACT_48866] .  
 
There are currently no Adverse Events of Special Interest for Yondelis  
(trabectedin) that will be reported to the Company.  
 
Additional s afety events of interest for trabectedin  that require expedit ed 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug expos ure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicina l product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a 
Janssen medicinal product  
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without 
patient exposure to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via administration of a 
medicinal product  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal 
product  
 
Olaparib  
Adverse Events of Special Interest for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks 
of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis.  
   
A questionnaire will be sent  to any investigator reporting an AESI, as an aid to 
provide further detailed information on the event.  During the study ther e may be 
other events identified as AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help 
characterize  the event and gain a better understanding regarding the relationship 
between the event and study treatment.  
 
AESIs should not be reported as SAEs  unless they meet the SAE reporting 
criteria  per section 8.2.[ADDRESS_51270] Quality Complaint (PQC)  (for trabectedin only)  
A product quality compl aint is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect 
related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, packaging, release 
testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the 
product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot a nd batch 
numbers are of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g., autoinjector button not working, 
needle detaching from syringe  
• Suspected Contamination  
• Suspected Counterfeit  
8.2.4  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in  the view of the Sponsor -
Investigator , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  
o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_51271] dose of 
study treatment , whether or not the event is expected or associated with the 
study drug, is considered a serious adverse event.  
 
NOTE: DEATHS FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED WITHIN 
THE PROTOCOL SPECIFIED SAE REPORTING PERIOD AS  OUTLINED 
IN SECTION 8. 4 
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even t is considered ‘life -threatening’ if, in the view of the 
investigator , its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death . It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]   
 
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
 
o Important medical event  
 
Any event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed in this definition of 
“Serious Adverse Event”. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________

 bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48802] ; or suspected transmission of any infectious 
agent via a medicinal product . 
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16499]’s medical history at 
the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_48803] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for 
the administration of study therapy or other protocol -required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened d uring 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48804], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48805].  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48806] a serious adverse event, except 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g. , 
social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48807]. Any adverse 
event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48808] a new serious adverse event.]  
 
Life-Threatening Conditions  
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious 
adverse event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting 
from disease progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious 
adverse event definition.  
 
8.2.5  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational ne w drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document .  See 
section 9.[ADDRESS_51272] of expected adverse events related to the 
drugs under study.  
8.2.6  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the 
protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
UMCC [ADDRESS_51273] be reported to the Coordinating Center within the same 
time lines as for an SAE  even if the patient was discontinued from the study .  All 
pregnancies should be follow ed through to outcome (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) 
whenever possible.  The Coordinating Center should be notified once the 
outcome of the pregnancy is known.  Follow -up informati on regarding the 
outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be 
required.  
 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_48809] a contraceptive medication.  Congenital abnormalities/birth 
defects , spontaneous miscarriages  and a bnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopic 
pregnancy) should be reported a nd handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs.  
 
Paternal exposure  
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the 
study and for [ADDRESS_51274] be reported to the Coordinating 
Center within the same time lines as for an SAE  even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study .   
 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not  considered to be an adverse event. 
However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring 
from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_51275] only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in 
this protocol. Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen 
specified in this protocol should be reported as an overdose. The Maximum 
Tolerated Dose is 150 mg twice daily (tablet).  
 
Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be  treated symptomatically 
and should be managed appropriately.  
• An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the CRF.  
UMCC [ADDRESS_51276] occur within 30 days .

 If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then the Coordinating Center will  inform the 
appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e., immediat ely but no later 
than 24 hours of awareness . 
 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative wo rks with the Coordinating Center  to 
ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety 
data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events 
and within 5 calendar days of initial  receipt for all other SAEs.  
 
For fatal or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is 
missing, active follow -up is undertaken immediately. The Coordinating Center inform s 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow -up informat ion on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.  
8.7 Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events – such as those that are expected or  are unlikely or definitely not 
related to the study participation - are to be reported annually as part of regular data 
submission.  
 
All non -serious adverse events should be reported by [CONTACT_48871] s. 
8.[ADDRESS_51285] quality compliant (PQCs).  A PQC is  
defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect related to a potential quality issue during 
manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage 
or distribution of the product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and 
batch numbers are of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.   
 
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investig ator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem . The 
incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incid ent, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the IRB within 14 calendar days  
of the study team becoming aware of the problem.  
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 40 of 55 
 
 
 9.1 Trabectedin  
• Other names for the drug: Yondelis ® 
 
• Descripti on: 1 mg sterile ly ophilized powder in a single -dose vial.  
 
• Classification - type of agent:  alkylating agent  
 
• Mode of action:  Trabectedin is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues in the 
minor groove of DNA, forming adducts and resulting in a bend ing of the DNA helix 
towards the major groove. Adduct formation triggers a cascade of events that can 
affect the subsequent activity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription 
factors, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the ce ll cycle and 
eventual cell death.  
 
• Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics is characterized by a rapid decline phase at 
the end of the infusion and slower exponential phases. Population pharmacokinetic 
analyses suggest that the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin is dose -proportional and 
exposure is time -independ ent. No accumulation in plasma is observed upon 
repeated administrations every 3 weeks.  
 
Binding of trabectedin to human plasma proteins was approximately 97%. Steady 
state volume of distribution exceeds 5000 L. The estimated mean clearance of 
trabectedin  is 31.5 L/hr (50%) and the terminal elimination half -life is approximately 
175 hours.  
 
CYP3A is the predominant CYP enzyme responsible for the hepatic metabolism of 
trabectedin.  Trabectedin was extensively metabolized with negligible unchanged 
drug in urine and feces.  
 
In patients with solid tumors, following a 3 -hour and 24 -hour intravenous infusion of 
14C-labeled trabectedin, 64% of the total administered radioactive dose was 
recovered in 24 days with 58% in feces and 6% in urine.  
 
• Side effects: The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions are nausea, fatigue, 
vomiting , constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, 
and headache. Please refer to the agent’s p ackage insert for a comprehensive list of 
adverse events.  
 
• Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
Please refer to the agent’s package insert  
 
• Drug Interactions: Co-administration of trabectedin with strong CYP3A inhibitors 
results in increased trabecte din dose. Co -administration with strong CYP3A inducers 
results in decreased trabectedin dose.  
 
• Storage and stability: Store trabectedin vials in a refrigerator at 2oC to 8oC (36oF to 
46oF). Trabectedin is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and 
disposable procedures.    
 
Trabectedin must be stored in a secure, limited access area.   
 
• Preparation and Dispensing:  
• Using asep tic technique, inject 20 mL of Sterile Water for I njection, USP into the 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 41 of 55 
 
 
 vial. Shake the vial until complete dissolution. The reconstituted solution is clear, 
colorless to pale brownish -yellow, and contains 0.05 mg/mL trabectedin . 
• Inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard 
vial if particles or discoloration are ob served.  
• Immediately following reconstitution, withdraw the calculated volume of 
trabectedin and further dilute in 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP or 5% 
Dextrose Injection, USP.  
• Do not mix with other drugs.  
• Discard any remaining solution within 30 hours  of reconstitution the lyophilized 
powder.  
• Trabectedin diluted solution is compatible with Type 1 colorless glass vials, 
polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) bags and tubing, PE and 
polypropylene (PP) mixture bags, polyethersulfone (PES) in -line f ilters, titanium, 
platinum or plastic ports, silicone and polyurethane catheters, and pumps having 
contact [CONTACT_48872], PE, or PE/PP.  
 
• Administration:  
• Infuse the reconstituted, diluted solution over 24 hours through a central venous 
line using an  infusion set with a 0.2 micron polyethersulfone (PES) in -line filter to 
reduce the risk of exposure to adventitious pathogens that may be introduced 
during the solution preparation.  
• Complete infusion within [ADDRESS_51286] or of the infusion solution.  
 
• Availability : Trabectedin is provided by [CONTACT_48873] .  
          
Under no circumstance will the study medication ( Trabectedin ®) provided by 
[CONTACT_48874].  
 
• Do Not Use Commercially Available Product.  Return and Retention of Study Drug : 
The investigator s will be instructed by [CONTACT_48875] . If any trabectedin  is lost or damaged, its 
disposition should be documented in the source documents. Trabectedin  supplies will 
be retained at the clinical si te pending instructions for disposition by [CONTACT_48876].  
 
If instructed to do so, unused supplies of trabectedin  should be destroyed according 
to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the drug accountability 
forms.  
 
• Drug Acc ountability:  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain 
a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the investigational drug  
trabectedin . The drug accountability records will capture drug receipt, drug 
dispensing, drug return and final disposition.   
 
9.2 Olaparib  
• Other names for the drug:  Lynparza  
 
• Description: Olaparib is available as 100 mg and 150 mg tablets.   
 
UMCC 2018 .132 
________________________________________________________________________  
Page 42 of 55 
 
 
 • Classification - type of agent:  PARP inhibitor  
 
• Mode of action:  Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes including PARP1, PARP2 
and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular functions such as DNA 
transcription and repair. Olaparib has been shown to in hibit growth of select tumor 
cells in vitro and decrease t umor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer 
cells. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib -induced cytotoxicity may involve 
inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP -DNA 
complexes resulting in DNA damage and cancer c ell death.  
 
• Pharmacokinetics: Olaparib is available as a tablet and capsule formulation. The oral 
bioavailability of the tablet formulation is higher. Olaparib showed time -dependent PK 
that the steady state clearance decreased by 15% after multiple doses.  
 
Following oral administration, absorption is rapid with median peak plasma 
concentrations typi[INVESTIGATOR_48812] 1.5 hours after dosing. Systemic exposure (single 
dose AUC) increases approximately proportionally with doses over the dose range of 
25 mg to 450 mg. Co -administration with high -fat meal slowed the rate of absorption 
but did not significantly alter the extent of absorption (mean AUC increased by 
[CONTACT_3450] 8%).  
 
Olaparib has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 158 L after a single 300 mg 
dose. In vitro protein binding is approximately 82%.  
 
CYP3A4/5 were shown to be enzymes primarily responsible for metabolism of 
olaparib.  
 
The mean terminal plasma half -life of olaparib is 14.9 hours. Following a single dose 
of 14C-labele olaparib, 86% of t he dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7 -day 
collection period, 44% via urine and 42% via feces. The majority of the material was 
excreted as metabolites.  
 
• Side effects: The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in clinical trials were 
anemia, nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, 
nasopharyngitis/upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]/influenza, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
diarrhea, arthralgia/my algia, dysgeusia, headache, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, 
constipation and stomatitis. R efer the reader to the agent’s package insert for a 
compre hensive list of adverse events.  
 
• Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myel oid leukemia (AML/MDS): occurred in 
<1.5% of patients exposed to olaparib monotherapy and the majority of events 
had a fatal outcome. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicity at baseline and 
monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed.  
• Pneumon itis: occurred in <1% of patients exposed to olaparib, and in some 
cases were fatal. Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected. Discontinue if 
pneumonitis is confirmed.  
• Embryofetal toxicity: olaparib can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to 
a fetus and to use effective contraception.  
 
Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must 
agree t o the use of TWO highly effective fo rms of contraception in combination (as 
described in Appendix B).  This should be started from the signing of the informed 
UMCC [ADDRESS_51287] dose of study drug(s), or t hey must totally/truly abstain from any 
form of sexual intercourse (as described in Appendix B). 
 
Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for [ADDRESS_51288] 
dose of olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a 
woman of childbearing potential.  Female partners of male patients should also use a 
highly effective form of contraception (as described in Appendix  B) if they are of 
childbearing potential.  Male patients should not donate sper m throughout the period 
of taking olaparib and for [ADDRESS_51289] dose of olaparib.  
 
For details of acceptable methods of contraception refer to Appendix B Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods.  
 
• Drug Interactions: Olaparib is increased with co -administration of strong  or moderate  
CYP3A  inhibitors. Conversely, olaparib is decreased with co -administration of strong 
or moderate CYP3A inducers. Olaparib is both an inhibitor and  inducer of CYP3A 
and an inducer of CYP2B6.  
 
• Storage and stability:  Store at 20oC to 25oC (68oF to 77oF), excursions permitted to 
15oC to 30oC (59oF to 86oF). Store in original bottle to protect from moisture.  
 
Olaparib  must  be stored i n a secure, limited access area.   
 
• Administration:  
• See Section 5.1  
 
• Availability : Provided by [CONTACT_38227] . 
 
Under no circumstance will the study medication ( olaparib ) be used other than as 
directed by [CONTACT_760]. Do Not Use Commercially Available Product.  
• Return and Retention of Study Drug : 
Investigators will be instructed by [CONTACT_48877]. If any  olaparib  is lost or damaged, its disposition 
should be documented in the source documents. Olaparib  supplies will be retained at 
the clinical site pending instructions for disposition by [CONTACT_5081]. 
Participants will be instructed to return al l bottles (empty bottles or unused tablets ). 
 
If instructed to do so, empty bottles and unused supplies of olaparib  should be 
destroyed according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the 
drug accountability forms.  
 
• Drug Accountabili ty: 
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain 
a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the investigational drug  olaparib . 
The d rug accountability records will capture drug receipt, drug dispensing, d rug 
return and final disposition.   
 
10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
The goal of the planned labor atory correlative studies is to  evaluate for mutations/alteration in 
genes responsible for DNA repair and correlate with disease response to therapy.  Findings from 
UMCC [ADDRESS_51290] samples will be shared with Janssen and 
Astra Zeneca for assessment of clinical (safety and efficacy) and/or commercial value.   
 
10.1 Next Generation Sequencing  
Results of comprehensive next generation sequencing performed on existing or available 
tumor samples will be evaluated for genomic alterations to identify predictors of clinical 
response to therapy. Patients will not be asked to undergo an additional biopsy to obtain 
tumor sample. Coded  data will be stored on a secured server.  
 
10.2 Defects in DNA Damage Repair  
In addition to NGS, available tumor samples will be evaluated by [CONTACT_48878] C which may include  BRCA1, 
SLFN11, RAD 51/52, PARP1, amongst others. The decrease or increase in expression of 
DDR genes will be correlated with disease response to therapy.  
 
Specimen Banking  
Patient samples retrieved  for analysis will  be coded  and stored in a secure lab  for 
optional unspecified future research . Specimens will be stored indefinitely or until they 
are used up. If future use is denied or withdrawn by [CONTACT_102], best efforts will be made 
to stop any additional studies an d to destroy the specimens.  
 
Specimens being stored long -term for potential use not outlined in the protocol are 
subject to University Policy Go verning Tissue Sample Collection, Ownership, Usage, and 
Disposition within all UMMS Research Repositories . 
 
10.3 Cardiotoxicity  
Serum suPAR, BNP, high sensitivity troponin -I and high sensitivity CRP levels will be 
obtained at baseline and after 2 doses of trabectedin to determine whether levels change 
with therapy and whether baseline or changes in levels are predictive of a declin e in 
LVEF.  
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a prospective, single -arm, multi -site study evaluating combination trabectedin and 
olaparib. Eligible patients will be assigned to one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 consists of 
patients  with leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma. Cohort 2 consists of patients with other 
bone or soft tissue sarcoma histologies. An independent Simon -minimax two -stage 
design will be used in each cohort.  
 
The primary objective is to estimate the overall response rat e (CR+PR) with an endpoint 
of objective response as based on RECIST 1.1 criteria  anytime within a minimum of 18 
months after start of treatment but no more than 2 years from registration . Secondary 
endpoints include PFS, OS and occurrence of adverse events . Exploratory endpoints 
include the presence of DNA repair defects by [CONTACT_48879]/or IHC and cardiovascular 
biomarkers.  
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
In cohort 1, based on currently available phase III data, the ORR for LMS/LPS subgroup 
to trabectedin monotherapy (including best response of complete or partial response) is 
9% with a 43% clinical benefit rate (CBR). Therefore, we will target a RR of 2 5% with 
trabectedin plus olaparib to conclude that combination therapy is meaningful. In stage 1, 

UMCC 2018 .132

 we will  enroll 1 6 patients. If ≤[ADDRESS_51291] stage, we will 
terminate the trial early. If > [ADDRESS_51292] stage, then 
an additional 10 patients will be enrolled in stage 2, for a total of 2 6 patients. If ≥ [ADDRESS_51293] an objective response, then we will declare that the combination is 
promising an d worthy of further study. The type 1 error rate is 10% and the power is 80%.  
 
In cohort 2, the ORR is approximately 5% to trabectedin monotherapy. Therefore, we will 
target a RR of 2 0% for the combination to be meaningful. In stage 1, we will enroll 1 3 
patients; if zero patients had an objective response, we will terminate the study early. 
Otherwise, if ≥1 patient had an objective response, we will enroll an additional 14 patients 
in stage 2, for a total of 2 7 patients. If ≥[ADDRESS_51294] an ob jective response, 
then we will declare that the combination is promising and worthy of further study. The 
type 1 error rate is 5% and the power is 80%.  
 
In cohort 1, we require a minimum of 1 6 patients and a maximum of 2 6 patients. 
Assuming we can enroll 2 LMS/LPS patients per month, we will require a minimum of [ADDRESS_51295] patient for an additional 24 months, the expected study 
duration for cohort 2 is expected to be between 31 and 38 months.  
 
The total expected duration to complete accrual and follow -up for cohorts 1 and 2 is 33 
and 38 mont hs. 
11.3 Data Analyses Plans  
To address the primary objective, the overall response rate will be calculated as the 
proportion (and exact binomial 95% confidence interval) of patients with complete or 
partial response as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1, within each cohort . 
 
To address the secondary objectives:  
a. Progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method with 
errors according to Peto, within each cohort. Median and 6 -month PFS will be 
estimated along with their 95% confidence intervals.  
b. Overall survival (OS) will be calculated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method with errors 
according to Peto, within each cohort. Median, 1 - and 2 -year OS will be estimated 
along with their 95% confidence intervals.  
c. The frequency and rates of adverse events occurring in  at least 5% of participants 
and rates of grade 3 -5 adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_48880] (CTCAE), 
within each cohort.  
 
 To address the exploratory objectives:  
a. The freq uency and proportion of alterations in tumor sequencing will be summarized 
within each cohort.  
b. The frequency and proportion of alterations in DNA damage repair pathways will be 
summarized within each cohort.  
c. Changes in levels of novel cardiovascular biomarkers will be summarized and 
compared to clinical and echocardiographic cardiotoxicity.

 All information will be recorded locally and entered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on the web -
based electronic  data capture (EDC)  system of the University of Michigan. Online access will be 
provided to each site by [CONTACT_5081].  
 
CRFs will be reviewed and source verified by [CONTACT_43906]. Discrepant, unusual and i ncomplete data will be queried by [CONTACT_43907]. The 
investigator or study coordinator will be responsible for providing resolutions to the data queries, 
as appropriate. The investigator must ensure that all data queries are dealt with promptly.  
 
The data submi ssion schedule is as follows:  
• At the time of registration   
o Subject entry into the EDC  
▪ Subject Status  
▪ Demographics  
• During study participation  
o All data should be entered online within 10 business days of data acquisition. 
[Information on dose limiting toxicity events must be entered within one business 
day.]  Information on Serious Adverse Events must be entered within the reporting 
timeframe spec ified in Section 8.4 of the protocol.  
 
All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic chart).  
15.[ADDRESS_51297] be 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
This study will be monitored by a representative of the Coordinating Center of the University of 
Michigan Rogel Cancer Center . Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct of the study and 
at study close -out. 
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo site initiation meeting to be conducted 
by [CONTACT_5081]. This will be done as an actual site visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web -based meeting after the site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_48814]. Study –related questions or 
issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed -up by [CONTACT_48881].  
 
Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source documents 
at the Coordinating Center and ‘On -site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ 
visit should occur after the first subject enrol led completes  the first treatment cycle .  The study 
site will send the redacted  source documents to the Coordinating Center for monitoring.  
‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_48882]. The site will send in pertinent redacted  source documents, 
as defined by [CONTACT_43910].  
 
The first annual ‘On -site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months  after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The 
type of visit is at the discretion of the Coordinating Center.  At a minimum, a rout ine monitoring 
visit will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if the study duration 
is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify:

 ➢ Adherence to the protocol  
➢ Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
➢ Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication  
➢ Compliance with regulations  
 
During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48815].  While most 
patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any 
patient case has  the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be 
reviewed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced cases.  
 
The Coordinating Center expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduc t of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a 
suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. Any issues identified 
during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expecte d to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] 
a timely manner.  For review of study -related documents at the Coordinating Center, the site will 
be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.   
 
Participating site will also undergo a site close -out upon completion, termination or cancellation of 
a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the study, and that the site 
Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, a site close -out is conducted 
during a s ite visit; however, site close -out can occur without

 Appendix A Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry and Evaluation 
of Hy’s Law  
Introduction  
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately report cases of 
Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver 
biochemistries.  Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalities can be found i n Section 5.2 of the 
protocol.  
 
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The  
investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at 
any point during the study.  
 
The Investigator participates, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether 
Hy’s Law (HL) crit eria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations 
in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_48885] (IMP).  
 
The Investigator is responsible for reco rding data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse 
Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line with standard safety reporting processes.  
Definitions  
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)  
Aspart ate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) 
together with  Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study 
medication  irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).   
Hy’s Law (HL)  
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be 
found to explain the combination of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, 
another drug.   
For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the same day) 
the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and 
TBL must occur.  
Identification of Potential Hy’ s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for 
any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:  
• ALT ≥ 3xULN  
• AST ≥ 3xULN  
• TBL ≥ 2xULN  
The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are 
met will:  
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Definitions  within this Appendix for 
definition) by [CONTACT_48886]  
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF  

UMCC 2018 .132

Page 52 of 55 
 
 
 Follow -up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met  
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study Protocol.  
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
• Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study 
treatment (See Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and 
After Starting Study Tre atment ) 
• Notify the Company  
The Coordinating Center/Study Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_48822], to provide guidance, 
discuss and agree an approach for the study patients’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_48887]:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters a nd appropriate clinical symptoms 
and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated  
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the Study Physician. << For studies using a central laboratory add: This includes 
deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used>>  
• Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available  
• If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures  
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy ’s Law Cases  
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
No later than [ADDRESS_51300] and TBL elevations, a determination of 
whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the 
criteria for a SAE:  
• If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF  
• If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly 
and follow the AZ standard processes  
 

UMCC [ADDRESS_51301] and TBL elevations other 
than the IMP:  
 
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard processes.  
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply  
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.  
 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess 
whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative 
explanation  until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality 
assessment as per above  
• Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary  information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the 
review  
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study 
Treatment  
This section is applicable to patients << with liver metastases>> who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.  
At the first on study treatment occurrence of  PHL crit eria being met the Investigator will:  
• Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condition# compared with 
the last visit where PHL criteria were met#  
− If there is no significant change no action is required  
− If there is a significant change notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  of this Appendix  
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin ) in isolation or in combination, or a

This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met PHL 
criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requireme nt to conduct follow -up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is based 
on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteri a being met and 
answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to 
be the disease under study e.g. chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infection or liver disease,  << or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study 
treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in Actions Required 
When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Tre atment  >>? 
If No: follow the process described in Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  of this App endix  
If Yes:  
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition# compared 
with when PHL criteria were previously met  
• If there is no significant change no action is required  
• If there is a significant change follow the process descr ibed above  
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, 
or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has 
been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation 
with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

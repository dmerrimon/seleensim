PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol 
Number:  MILES  (V135 -201) 
Title:  A Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Randomized Trial to Study the 
Viaskin MILk Efficacy and Safety for Treating IgE -Mediated Cow’s 
Milk Allergy in Children (MILES  Study)  
Investigational 
Product:  Viaskin Milk  (DBV135)  
Indication : Immunoglobulin E ( IgE)-mediated cow’s milk allergy  
Number of 
Study Centres : Seventeen  sites in North America ([LOCATION_002] and Canada)  
Phase:  Phase 1/2 
Objectives:  The objectives of this study are : 
• To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Via skin Milk after 
12 months of epi[INVESTIGATOR_24873] ( EPIT ) 
treatment, for desensitizing IgE -mediated cow’s milk -allergic 
children.  
• To assess the long -term safety and efficacy of up to 48 
months of tr eatment with Viaskin Milk.  
• To assess the safety and the therapeutic benefit of the most 
effective tested dose of Viaskin Milk over 24 months of 
treatment.  
Sponsor: DBV Technologies    
Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.0  24 June 2019

Study Design:  This is a multi -center , double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized 
trial to study the safety and efficacy of Via skin Milk applied 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322159] 2  to 17 years  of age  with 
IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy (CMA) . Viaskin Milk is a patch 
containing an ex tract of cow’s milk proteins. Subjects will receive  
blinded  treatment  for 1 year at one of the 3 doses of Viaskin Milk : 
[ADDRESS_397614] dose of Viaskin Milk , 500 µg, 
and continue treatment in an open -label  manner for up to a 
maximum of 3 additional years.   
Following results of the 12 -month blinded period, all eligible 
subjects who wish to continue participation in the study will  switch  
from Viaskin Milk 500  µg to Viask in Milk 300 µg for 24 months of 
treatment.  
The study will be conducted at 17 sites in the U nited States  and 
Canada , with selected Investigator s and staff experienced in the 
diagnosis and management of CMA and anaphylaxis , and who are 
capable of performing  a double -blind placebo -controlled food 
challenge (DBPCFC) in children  (2 to 11  years old) and adolescents 
(12 to 1 7 years old) . 
Eligible subjects with confirmed IgE -mediated CMA will perform a 
first DBPCFC at screening with escalating doses of cow’s milk 
proteins . Subjects showing a positive DBPCFC at screening, 
defined as the appearance of objective signs or symptoms to an 
eliciti ng dose of cow’s milk proteins  ≤300  mg (a pproximately  9.4 mL 
of cow’s milk) will be randomized in the study.  
The study will be divided into 2 consecutive parts (Part  A and 
Part B) for randomization of the su bjects to treatment.  
Part A will evaluat e the saf ety of 3  escalating doses of Viaskin Milk 
(150 µg, 300  µg, and 500  µg of cow’s milk proteins ) versus  placebo  
in successive cohorts of subjects before proceeding to Part B . In 
each cohort, evaluation of safety will be based on safety data 
collected and analyzed from subjects treated for [ADDRESS_397615] 3  weeks of treatment, Part A subjects will 
not discontinue treatment but instead will continue treatment up to 
Month 12, at which time  subjects  will undergo a second D BPCFC.  
Part B is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 3  doses 
of Viaskin Mil k (150 µg, 300  µg, and 500  µg of cow’s milk protein , 
assessed  to be safe from Part A) versus  placebo . Subjects will be 
randomized to receive a 12  month treatment (blinded treatment 
period), at which time a second DBPCFC will be performed.  The 
efficacy of V iaskin Milk will be assessed based on data po oled from 
subjects in both Part  A and Part  B, treated up to Month  12. 
After the Month  [ADDRESS_397616] 
DBPCFC was to  be performed at Month  24.

Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.0  24 June 2019  
Confidential  Page 6 of 170 
 After Month 24, eligible subjects from Part A or Part B were t o be 
proposed to enter the study extension to receive 2 additional years 
of EPIT with open -label Viaskin Milk at 500  µg. For subjects 
entering the study extension , a fourth and fifth DBPCFC were  to be 
performed at Month  36 and Month  48, respectively. Following 
results of the 12 -month blinded period, DBPCFC procedures were 
stopped while the subjects were still receiving Viaskin Milk 500  µg. 
After implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 , all subjects will 
recei ve Viaskin Milk 300 µg for 24 months , independently of the 
duration of previous treatment with Viaskin Milk 500  µg. For 
subjects switching to Viaskin Milk 300  µg, a n optional  DBPCFC may 
be performed after 12 and /or [ADDRESS_397617] . 
A final End -of-Study (EOS) visit will be performed for all subjects 
when they complete the study. The EOS visit was to take place 
[ADDRESS_397618] cow’s milk -free diet with no consumption of 
dairy products or baked milk products until their EOS  visit (except 
during the DBPCFC s). 
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately 194 subjects (18 subjects in P art A and 1 76 subjects 
in Part  B) will be randomized to treatment in thi s study.  
The number of subjects continuing  beyond the Month  24 visit and/or 
in the treatment period  with Viaskin Milk 300  µg will depend on the 
study extension  eligibility criteria and the willingness of subjects t o 
continue  in the study .

Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.[ADDRESS_397631] up to 6% of young 
children  and 3 to 4% of adults , and appears to have an increasing prevalence .1,2 
Allergic reactions to food can result from  different immunologic mechanisms including 
immunoglobulin E ( IgE)-mediated reactions (acute onset), non -IgE cell -mediated 
reactions (delayed or chronic onset) or a combination of both. Food allerg ies lead  to a 
large variety of clinical symptoms involving the skin , and/or the gastrointestinal and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_322171] , and the cardiovascular system . Of these  food allergy  symptoms , 
those  described as anaphylactic shock can be life -threatening and require  a rapid 
admission to an emergency room.  
Cow’s milk allerg y (CMA) is the most common food allergy in infants and young 
children, with an incidence of approximately 2 to 3% in developed countries .3,[ADDRESS_397632] shown that the prognosis for developi[INVESTIGATOR_322172]’s milk is good, 
with a majority of pa tients outgrowing their CMA by [CONTACT_14898] [ADDRESS_397633] that the resolution rate of CMA is approximately  
50% by 5  years  of ag e.8,9 The low levels of allergen -specific IgE (sIgE) to cow’s milk 
and milk skin prick test (SPT) wheal size have been shown to be good predictors of 
resolution , while high levels of cow’s milk sIgE have been shown to be predictors of 
persistence of C MA.,,[ADDRESS_397634] avoidance of the 
responsible allergen(s). This is especially challenging for cow’s milk , which is widely 
included  in many dairy products, and also in smaller amounts in other manufactured 
food products. Consequently, th e risk of accidental allergic reactions in children allergic 
to cow’s milk represents a major health concern, and the frequency of accidental 
exposure, some leading to severe reactions, could reach 40% in children over a 
12-month peri od.[ADDRESS_397635] of oral immunotherapy or sublingual 
immunotherapy for the treatment of CMA; these studies have shown some efficacy in 
increasing the quantity of cow’s milk consumed.12,13 However, occurrences of local 
adverse events ( AEs), as well as systemic, potentially serious reactions during the 
course of oral immunotherapy are common.,[ADDRESS_397636] in some cases within 1 week off 
therapy. Thus, developi[INVESTIGATOR_322173] a clear unmet medical need.  
DBV Technologies (DBV) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel product for the treatment of CMA. The  
investigational product , Viaskin Milk (DBV  135) consists of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_322174] a patch (Viaskin delivery system) , containing a solid deposit of 
formulated milk protein extract . Epi[INVESTIGATOR_24873] (EPIT), consisting of 
repeat ed applications of the patch containing the allergen to intact skin, is a novel 
method under investigation for the treatment of foo d allergies . 
The rationale for testing EPIT in humans for the treatment of CMA is based on the 
following:  
Sponsor: DBV Technologies    
Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.0  24 June 2019  
Confidential  Page 22 of 170 
1. EPIT has shown evidence of clinical benefit in animal and early human studies, 
especially in the pediatric population  with CMA . 
2. EPIT provides a ready -to-use and easy -to-administer form of allergen 
immunotherapy, particularly well -adapted to the pediatric p opulation.  
3. EPIT can directly target the immunocompetent cells (such as the Langerhans 
and Dendritic cells) in a nonvascularized environment (ie , the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]).  
EPIT is expected to have a better safety profile than the other forms of immunotherapy 
due to t he slow delivery of large allergenic macromolecules in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_322175], 
hence reducing notably the risk of systemic distribution of the allergen.  EPIT has been 
shown to be well tolerated and could represent a very promising approach for the 
treatment of CMA.  
1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
Several nonclinical studies support the clinical development of Viaskin Milk . These 
include  an efficacy study in milk -sensitized mice, toxicolo gy studies (including 
repeat -dose, genotoxicity and tolerance studies), as well as biocompatibility studies 
performed with the Viaskin alone.   
The overall results of the studies support the conclusion that no toxic effects are 
expected with Viaskin Milk. Details regarding nonclinical studies with Viaskin Milk  are 
available in the Investigator’s Brochure .15  
1.3 Clinical Studies  
A brief summary of clin ical study information for Viaskin Milk is included below. Refer to 
the Viaskin Milk (DBV 135) Investigator’s Brochure  for additional d etails re garding 
clinical studies with Viaskin Milk . 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 3 -month clinical study entitled “Efficacy of a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_322176]’s milk tolerance in children with cow’s milk protein allergy: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]” has been completed (study #SV 782). The clinical study report (CSR) of this

allergen patch containing 500 µg of skimmed cow’s milk powder (approximately 150 µg 
cow’s milk protein).  
Children aged between 3 months to 15 years and with cow’s milk protein sIgE 
>0.35  kU/L a nd/or a positive SPT  to cow’s milk protein plus an oral milk challenge were 
eligible for  participation in the study. If the oral cow’s milk challenge was positive at a 
dose <10 mL, the subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive active treatment  patch 
(containing 1 mg of cow’s milk powder)  or placebo . Each patch was applied on the 
posterior tru nk in the inter -scapular space of the children for 48 hours, 3 times a week. 
The total duration of the blinded therapy was 3  month s, followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label 
dosing up to an additional 6  months. The primary efficacy criterion was the maximal 
cumulative tolerated dose (CTD) of cow’s milk (in  mL) after 3  months of  the blinded 
treatment .

The mean  age  standard deviation ( SD) of the subjects enrolled in this study was 
3.82  2 years (range:  from 10 months to 7 years  and 8 months). A total of 9  children  
treated with the active patch and 7  children treated with placebo were incorporated in 
the per protocol analysis. An oral food challenge with cow’s m ilk was performed at 
baseline (Day 0) and after 3  months (D ay 90) of blinded treatment. The maxim al CTD 
of milk increased from a mean   SD of 1.77   2.98 mL at Day 0 to 23.61   28.61  mL at 
Day 90 in the active treatment group; in the active gro up, CTD slightly decreased in 
1 patient and increased by >10-fold in 2 patients and >100-fold in 3  patients a fter the 
EPIT treatment. T he mean CTD did not change in the placebo group (4.36   5.87 mL 
at Day 0 to 5.44   5.88 mL at Day 90). Although this preliminary study failed to 
demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of the CTD (likely due to the limited 
number of subjects  and short duration of the treatment period ), subjects  treated  with 
the active patch demonstrated increased tolerance to milk exposure.  
No child required interruption of treatment because of an AE and none received 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. No serious adverse events  (SAEs)  were reported during the trial. Overall, 
repeated application of the active patch was safe and well tolerated  in this study .  
In summary, the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_322178]’s milk EPIT demonstrate d a 
favorable  safety pro file, a clear trend toward clinical efficacy , and suggest ed that longer  
treatment periods might be appropriate.   
1.4 Study Rationale  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated doses of Viaskin 
Milk delivered epi[INVESTIGATOR_322179] -mediated CMA. The goal s 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_322180] : 
• To protect subjects with IgE -mediated CMA from the risk of severe reactions, in 
particular severe anaphylactic reactions, in case of accidental exposure to cow’s 
milk. 
• To permit or accelerate the re -introduction of cow’s milk and other dairy 
products into the diet of cow’s milk -allergic subjects.  
2 Study Objectives  
The objectives of this study are : 
1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Via skin Milk to induce desensitiz ation to 
cow’s milk in IgE-mediated cow’s milk -allergic children  after [ADDRESS_397639] effective tested 
dose of Viaskin Milk over 24 months of treatment.  
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multi -center , double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial to study the 
safety and efficacy of Via skin Milk applied epi[INVESTIGATOR_322181]: DBV Technologies    
Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.[ADDRESS_397640] of cow’s milk proteins. The placebo treatment will consist of a Viaskin patch 
containing a similar formulat ion without cow ’s milk proteins. The study will be  
conducted at 17 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada , with selected Investigator s and 
staff experienced in the diagnosis and management of CMA and anaphylaxis , and who 
are capable of performing a double -blind placebo -controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) 
in children  (2 to 11 years old) , adolescents (12 to 17 years old) . 
Eligible subjects with confirmed IgE -mediated CMA will perform a first DBPCFC at 
screening with escalating doses of cow’s milk proteins. Subj ects showing a positive 
DBPCFC at screening, defined as the appearance of objective signs or symptoms to 
an eliciting dose of cow’s milk proteins ≤300  mg (approximately 9.4  mL of cow’s milk) 
will be randomized in the study.  
Double -blind, placebo -controlled  treatment period up to Month 12  
The study was divided in to 2 consecutive parts  for randomization of the subjects to 
treatment : Part A and Part  B. Part A  initially permit ted an evaluation of  the safety of 
3 escalating doses of Viaskin Milk  (150 µg, 300  µg, and 500  µg cow’s milk proteins ) 
versus  placebo  in successive cohorts of subjects before proceeding to Part B . Part B 
permit ted an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the 3 safe dose s of Viaskin Milk  
(150 µg, 300  µg and 500  µg of cow’s milk protein , as assessed from the safety data in 
Part A subjects ) versus  placebo . The efficacy of Viaskin Milk was assessed based on 
data pooled from subjects in both Part A and Part B. Details of subject enrol lment and 
the treatments administered for each par t of the study are provided in Section  3.1.2  for 
Part A and in Section  3.1.3  for Part  B.  
In both Part  A and Part  B of the study , subjects  were  randomized to receive treatment 
with Viaskin Milk versus  placebo for 12 months (blinded treatment period) , at which 
time a second DBPCFC was performed. The primary  analysis of this study was 
conducted after data h ave been collected up to Month  [ADDRESS_397641] dose  selected (500 µg of cow’s milk protein), based on safety data in Part A 
subjects. A third D BPCFC was to be performed at Month 24.  
After Month 24, all eligible subjects from Part A and Part B were to be proposed to 
enter the study extension to receive 2 additional years of EPIT with open -label Viaskin 
Milk at 500  µg (see eligibility criteria i n Section  4.3). For subjects entering the study 
extension , the fourth and fifth DBPCFC s were to be performed at Month  [ADDRESS_397642] effective tested dose was 
the Viaskin Milk 300  µg, and that this dose was safe1. Given that all subjects were 
currently receiving the 500 -µg dose , all subjects will switch from Viaskin Milk 500  µg to

3.1.2  Part A    
In Part A  of the study , the safety of 3 escalating doses of Viaskin Milk , 150 µg, 300  µg, 
and 500  µg cow’s milk proteins , will initially be assessed over a 3 -week treatment 
period . Subjects will be randomized into 3 successive cohorts of 6 subjects each to 
receive either Viaskin Milk or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  
Cohort  1 (150 µg dose group ): a total of 6 subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to 
receive either Viaskin Milk at  150 µg (n=4) or placebo (n=2). Safety d ata will be  
collected and  analyzed  after [ADDRESS_397643] dose of Viaskin 
Milk. 
Cohort  2 (300 µg dose group ): the screening of subjects in Cohort  [ADDRESS_397644] will be randomized and treated 
in this cohort before the review of the DSMB from the previous cohort has been 
completed  and the DSMB rec ommendation made . The same process as described 
above for Cohort  1 will be repeated : a total of 6  additional subjects will be randomized 
(2:1 ratio) to receive Viaskin Milk at 300 µg (n=4) or placebo (n=2). Safety data after 
[ADDRESS_397645] dose of Viaskin Milk.  
Cohort  3 (500 µg dose group ): the screening of subjects in C ohort [ADDRESS_397646] will be randomized and treated 
in this cohort before the review of t he DSMB from the previous cohort has been 
completed  and the DSMB recommendation made . The same process as described 
above for Cohorts  1 and 2  will be repeated : a total of 6  additional s ubjects will be 
randomized (2:1  ratio) to receive Viaskin Milk at 500 µg (n=4) or placebo (n=2). 
Safety data after 3 weeks of treatment will be collected and analy zed. In parallel, 
cumulative safety data from subjects in the previous Cohorts  1 and 2  will also be 
collected and made availa ble for review  by [CONTACT_4318].  The DSMB will assess 
whether this dose of 500 µg is also safe.  
All subjects in Part A will continue their blinded treatment  at their assigned initial dose 
of treatment  (150 µg, 300 µg, or 500 µg Viaskin Milk or placebo) up to Mo nth 12. 
3.1.3  Part B   
After t he analysis of the cumulative safety data of Part A subjects , the 3 doses of 
Viaskin Milk  (150 µg, 300  µg, and 500  µg of cow’s milk protein ) were kept to study the 
efficacy of Viaskin Milk in a placebo -controlled dose -finding Part B of the study.  
The s creening of subjects in Part  B may start after enrollment  in Part A is complete ; 
however,  none of the  subject s screened in Part  B can be randomized and treated 
before the review of the safety data from Part A subjects has been completed by [CONTACT_322245] ( FDA).  
A pause in the randomization will allow for this safety review to occur and 
recommendations to be release d.

In Part B, approximately  176 additional subjects will be randomized (1:1 :1:1 ratio) to 
receive Viaskin Milk 150 µg (n=44) , Viaskin Milk 300 µg  (n=44) , Viaskin Milk 500 µg 
(n=44) , or placebo (n=44) up to Month  12.

data of Part A subjects.  
Subjects who terminated the study at Month [ADDRESS_397648], the re-introduction of milk into the diet as early as possible (eg, 
baked milk products or dairy prod ucts) or the initiation of  different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322182] a 
preferred option  for other subjects . For this purpose, all eligible subjects from Part A 
and Part B (see eligibility criteria  in Section  4.3) were proposed to enter into the 
open -label study extension, to receive [ADDRESS_397649] s who enter ed the study extension were to continue their treatment up to 
Month  48 and to perform additional DBPCFC s at Month 36 and at Month 48.  
Following results of the 12 -month blinded period , the DBPCFCs that were to be 
performed at Month 24, Month 36 and Month 48 should not be conducted while 
the subjects are still receiving Viaskin Milk 500  µg.  
Switch to Viaskin Milk 300  µg 
Following results of the 12 -month blinded  period , all eligible subjects will switch from 
Viaskin Milk 500  µg to Viaskin Milk 300  µg for 24 additional months, independently of 
the duration of  previous  treatment with Viaskin Milk 500  µg: 
• Subjects who will decline to switch to  Viaskin Milk 300  µg will be discontinued 
from the study and an ET visit or an EOS visit will be performed (see Section  
7.2.3 ); 
• Subjects who will switch to Viaskin Milk 300  µg will be treated for 24 additional 
months : 
o Until Visit S1 is performed and the subjects start with Viaskin Milk 
300 µg, they will continue to receive Viaskin Milk 500  µg. No DBPCFC 
should  be performed while the subjects are still receiving Viaskin Milk 
500 µg. 
o Subjects will then follow  a dedicated study flowchart  (see Table 6 and 
Table 7), 
o Optional DBPCFCs can be performed after 12 and /or 24 months of 
treatment ,

methodology defined in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Standardized milk and placebo 
food c hallenge formula and material as well as the Manual of 
Procedures will be provided to all sites  and must be used for conducting 
the food challenge.  
When performed, the results of these  food challenge(s) will be 
documented and reported in the e -CRF.  
o The EOS  visit will take place [ADDRESS_397651] 
cow’s milk -free diet with no consumption of dairy products or baked milk products until 
their final study visit (except during DBPCFC). At the end of participation in the study, 
the re -introduction of milk products (eg, dairy products or baked milk products) into the 
subject’s diet, or the decision to keep the subject under a strict cow’s milk -free diet will 
be left to the Investigator’s discretion.

children and adolescent  subjects  with IgE-mediated CMA. Randomization and double -
blinding are used to minimize bias in treatment allocation and in the assessment of 
both safety and efficacy during the double -blind treatment period. Randomization and 
double -blinding also minimize s bias arising from the  expectations of subjects  and/or 
their parent(s)/guardian(s), the Investigator s, and from individuals who collect  the study  
data. 
An open -label extension at the highest safe dose based on the safety data collected 
during the Part A and B was initia ted. The selected dose before the  availability of  
efficacy data was the Viaskin Milk [ADDRESS_397653] efficacious dose was determined to be the Vias kin Milk 300  µg. This dose was 
shown to be safe. Consequently, all subjects will switch over to this dose for an 
additional treatment period  of 24 months . 
4 Selection of Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal  
4.1 Number of P lanned Subjects  
Approximately 194 children and adolescent subjects will be rando mized in th is study , 
18 subjects in Part A and 1 76 subjects  in Part B.  The screen failure rate is anticipated 
to be around 35%, therefore  approximately 300 subjects may be screened in the study.  
4.2 Eligibility Criteria  for Study Enrol lment  
4.2.1  Inclusion Criteria  
1. Signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) by [CONTACT_7078](s)/guardian(s) of subjects and 
informed assent  form (IAF)  for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_397654] cow’s milk -free diet, with no cons umption of 
dairy or baked milk products.   
5. Cow’s milk sIgE level at screening ≥10 kU/L.  
6. Positive SPT to cow’s milk with a largest wheal diameter ≥6  mm. 
7. Positive DBPCFC at screening with an eliciting dose ≤300 mg cow’s milk 
proteins (a pproximately  ≤9.4 mL of cow’s milk).  
8. Negative urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree and commit to use

• 12 hours of daily application during the second we ek (from Day  8 to Day  14); 
• [ADDRESS_397665] week (from Day  15) onwards.  
In case of severe local reactions, or if the subject present s an AE considered as a 
systemic “allergic reaction type” of any severity  and related to the study drug , the daily 
duration of patch appl ication can be adapted/reduced if the Investigator considers this 
could allow for  an optimal management of the safety of the subjects. The daily duration 
of patch application could then be progressively extended day by [CONTACT_322247] 
24-hours/day applica tion after the AE resolves or stabilizes.  In the rare event that 
Grade 4 local skin reactions occur, subjects should transiently discontinue patch 
application. Subjects should then visit the site for the next patch application and for 
adequate examination and treatment of the wounded zone (refer to  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , 
Adverse Events of Special Interest to the Sponsor).  
The patches will be appl ied on the inter -scapular area o n the back of the children (2 to 
11 years old) and on the inner side of the arms for the adolescents  (12 to 17 years old)  
and former adolescents who become adults  (≥18 years old) . Children who reach the 
age of 12 years during their  participation in the study may continue to apply the 
patches on their back, or switch to the arms.  For each site of application (arms or 
back), the specific place where the patch is applied will represent a zone : 6 zones in 
total will be  used and rotated for application of the patches . The application of the patch 
should start with Zone 1 on Day  1, then Z one 2 on Day  2, then Zone 3 on Day  3…up to 
Zone 6 on Day  6. Then the patch will be applied back to Zone 1 on Day  7, Zone 2 on 
Day 8, etc. 
• For children (2 to 11 years old), the Zones  1, 2, and 3 will be located on 1 side 
of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_322186]  4, 5 and 6 will be located on the other side of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
• For adolescents (12 to 17 years  old) and former adolescents who become 
adults  (≥18 years old) , the Zones  1, 2 and 3 will be located on 1 arm and 
Zones  4, 5, and 6 will be located on the other arm.

data of Part A subjects . The Vi askin Milk open -label treatment period was to continue

• [ADDRESS_397667] week  
• 12 hours of dai ly application during the second week  
• [ADDRESS_397668] week onwards  
At the time of Protocol  Amendment  5, all subjects were currently receiving active 
treatment with Viaskin Milk 500 µg. The switch to Viaskin Milk 300 µg will not 
require a  progressive  increase of application duration, and all subjects will be 
able to start with 24 hours of daily application of Viaskin Milk 300 µg . 
During the open -label treatment period s with Viaskin Milk 500  µg and Viaskin Milk 
300 µg, the daily duration of patch application could also be reduced/adapted and 
progressively extended up over a few days to reach the 24 -hours/day application in 
some specific cases , as described in the previous section,  if the Investigator considers 
this could allow for an optimal management of the safety of the subjects.  In the rare 
event that Grade [ADDRESS_397669]  to the location (back or arm) and zones  
together with  the recommendations for applying and removing the patch should 
continue as described above in the blinded  treatment period section  (refer to 
Secti on 6.3.1 ).  
If the patch was removed or has fallen off prematurely, the daily duration of application 
of the patch and the reason for early removal will be recorded in the subject diary 
cards. During the open -label treatment period s with Viaskin Milk [ADDRESS_397670] patch application was to be 
the day before the second Month  24 DBPCFC (day before Visit  17). For subjects who 
enter ed the study extension after Month  24, the open -label  treatment period was to

assigned (refer to Section 6.1, Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups) to 
the subjects duri ng the 12-month double -blind treatment period and the blinding will 
remain until all 12-month data are collected .  
The appearance of Viaskin Milk and placebo  patches will be identical. During the 
blinded treatment period, a n Emergency Code Break procedure will be available to 
Investigator s via IWRS, to allow for unblinding a subject  or treatment kit , (ie, informing 
the Investigator  of the treatment group to which the subject has been assigned ). The 
blind for a specific subject can be broken by [CONTACT_322248]. If possible, t he 
medical monitor  at the CRO  and the sponsor should be consulted  before breaking the 
blind  and the Investigator  should always assess the relationship of the AE to the 
investigational product  before breaking the blind.

Subjects and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) will receive diary cards to record the daily 
application of Viaskin patches (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for further details about  diary 
cards).  The duration of the patch application will be recorded every day from Day  1 
(Visit 4) up to Month  3 (Visit 9) on the subject diary cards.  After Month 3, the subjects 
will only record the days and time period s when the duration of the patch app lication 
did not follow the durations recommend ed in the protocol . During the period of [ADDRESS_397676] and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) will be 
collected periodically during the subject’s visit at sites and entered into the eCRF or the 
clinical database . 
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to correctly instruct subjects and/or 
parent(s)/guardian(s) on how to store and administer the investigational prod uct. At 
each visit, prior to dispensing a new investigational treatment  box, the compliance of 
the subject will be assessed by [CONTACT_322249] (even for a duration that is less than  the recommended duration), versus  the 
number of days in that time interval . An overall  compliance of ≥80% over the treatment 
period is sought. Subjects exhibiting a poor compliance ( <80%) should be counseled  
on the importance of a good compliance.  
The Investigator  or designated study perso nnel will maintain a log of all investigational 
product  dispensed (see Section 10.1, Drug A ccountability for details).  
6.7 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322191], if any of the following occur:  
• Any death related to Viaskin dosing;  
• More than one Stage 3 anaphylaxis ( see Appendix 14.4, Anaphylaxis Staging 
System) related to Viaskin application (and not occu rring during the DBPCFC s); 
• More than 3 subjects requiring >1 injection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322192] (and not occurring during the DBP CFCs). 
Upon safety review, 1 of the following outcomes will be determined:  
• Accrual into the study may cont inue without modification;  
• Accrual into the study may continue with modifications as recomm ended by [CONTACT_40746];  
• Accrual into the study should stop.

observation. The challenge occurs over two days and must take place under direct 
medical supervision in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic setting with resuscitation equipment a nd 
emergency medications and staff immediately available. It is recommended to have  an 
intravenous (i.v.) line  in place prior to challenging the subjects; however , the final 
decision not to place this i.v. line can be made on a case -by-case basis at the 
discretion of the Investigator . A local anesthetic  cream can be used for establishing this 
i.v. lin e, especially for children. If a site prefers to have the subjects come to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322201], to prepar e them for the following 
day, this is allowed and will not be considered an SAE.  
Subjects must be off antihistamines 1 to 7 days (depending of the half -life, see 
Appendix  14.7) prior to any DBPCFC. Subjects will not be allowed to use long-acting 2 
agonists (e g, formoterol) within [ADDRESS_397778] day of the DBPCFC, the second day of the 
DBPCFC can be co nducted only from the fourth day onwards.

and 13); a DBPCFC was planned  at Month  24 (Visits 16 and 17)  and for subjects who 
entered the study extension , at Month  36 (Visits  19 and 20) and Month  48 (Visits  22 
and 23) , but these food challenges should no longer be performed while the subjects 
are still receiving Viaskin Milk 500  µg. A DBPCFC can be performed after 12 months 
(Visits S3 and S4) and /or 24 months (Visits S6  and S7) of treatment with Viaskin Milk 
[ADDRESS_397779] .  
No DBPCFC will be performed while the subjects are still receiving Viaskin Milk 
500 µg and  until they reach 12 months of treatment with Viaskin Milk 300  µg.  
Each DBPCFC will comprise 2 visits: [ADDRESS_397780] within 7 days (one week) after the first day of the food challenge.  
However, the second day may be scheduled up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_397781] 
food challenge and documented in the eCRF, if any of the following occur s: (1) the 
subject experiences reactions after the DBPCFC on the first day that require more than 
7 days to elapse before the next food challenge, or (2) any intercurr ent disease 
preventing the second day of the challenge to be conducted safely as planned , such as 
a rhinitis, bronchitis or gastrointestinal infection ; in this specific condition and for safety 
reasons, the timeframe between the [ADDRESS_397782] be appropriately documented , or (3) the subject’s schedule or site logistics 
prevent the second day of food challenge to be performed within [ADDRESS_397783] day.  
The order of the food challenge (milk or placebo) will be blinded;  it will be determined 
using a randomization table that will be distributed to site personnel dedicated to the 
preparation of the challenge formulas (see Section  8.4). After both days of a DBPCFC 
have been completed, the order of the food challenge (ie, actual visits that the milk and 
placebo challenges were administered) can be revealed for completion of the eCRF.  
The subject should have a light breakfast and may d rink water at home at least [ADDRESS_397784] of the challenge  no other 
food (except for the food challenge  formula ) should be consumed by [CONTACT_423]. Water 
should also ideally not be consumed , but limited amount of water will be tolerated

The contents of the first meal after the food challenge should be light.  
All DBPCFC s will consist of administering  cow’s milk proteins (or placebo) in gradually 
increasing doses at 20 -minute intervals. The Investigator  may use clinical judgment to 
increase the intervals between doses in case  there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_322202] (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). 
Before implementation of Protocol Amendment 5, DBPCFCs to milk and to other 
allergens were strictly forbidden. After implementation of Protocol Amendment 5, 
DBPCFCs to milk ( including baked milk, and outside of the one described in this 
protocol ) will stil l be strictly forbidden as long as the subject is part of the study  but 
performing DBPCFCs  to any other food for the subject’s medical management will be 
permitted. Whether  the subject’s medical condition is still  compatible with the ir 
participation in the  study should be assessed by [CONTACT_2725]’s 
medical monitor  before the food challenge is performed . If not compatible , the Sponsor 
may decide to discontinue the subject from the study.  Note that the initiation of other 
immunotherapy tre atment remains prohibited during the participation of the subject in 
the MILES study (refer to Section 6.5.2 ). Viaskin Milk patches should not be applied 
on the day  of a food challenge  and until all procedures  are completed . Information 
on food challenges to other allergens than cow’s milk will also be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  DBPCFC at Screening (Visits 2 and 3)  
During the screening DBPCFC, the doses of cow’s milk protein s to be ingested will be 
1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 100  mg, and 300  mg administered at 20 -minute intervals. 
The Investigator  may use clinical judgment to increase the intervals between doses in 
case  there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_322203] (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). Very occasionally , the Investigator  may use clinical judgment to 
repeat the same dose  (but only once ) before administration of the next higher dose  and 
only if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_322204] (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). The dose and the  time of administration of each dose (an d of a 
repeat ed dose when applicable)  will be recorded in the eCRF.  The subjects will be kept 
under observation for an additional [ADDRESS_397786] objectively  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 ) at or below the eliciting 
dose of 300 mg of cow’s milk protein s to be eligible for randomization to treatment . 
Hence, this screening DBPCFC will be stopped at or below the dose of 300  mg on 
either day of the challenge  (milk or placebo) , whether reactions have occurred or not.  
Subjects who have not reacted objectively at or below the eliciting dose of 300 mg of 
cow’s milk proteins will be considered ineligible for this study.   
All subjects sho uld undergo procedures of the DBPCFC on both days. However , in 
exceptional cases, the DBPCFC on the second day of the challenge might not be 
performed if the subject had a  severe  anaphylactic reaction  during the first day of the 
challenge, leaving no doubt  about the nature of the formula administered, ie, cow’s 
milk. In this rare case and in this case only, the food challenge formula will be 
unblinded to confirm that the subject effectively received the milk formula.  A severe 
anaphylactic reaction would inv olve a >20% drop of blood pressure, cyanosis or 
Sp02<92%, confusion, collapse, loss of consciousness, 3 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322205]

At the end of the second day of the food challenge (Visit  3), the sequence of the 
2 formulas (milk or placebo) administered  to the subject will be unblinded by [CONTACT_322254] (eg, dietician s, study nurse s, pharmacist s, pharmacy 
technicians, licensed medical assistants, or any other qualified site personnel, as

challenge will then be establi shed  and recorded in the eCRF  as follows : 
1. The subject had objective symptoms to the placebo formula at any dose leading 
to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322206]. S/He cannot be randomized in the study.  
2. The subject had no objective symptoms during the [ADDRESS_397787] dose of 
300 mg of cow’s milk protein s. S/He is considered not allergic enough to cow’s 
milk to participate in this study and cannot be randomized in the study.  
3. The subject had no objective symptom when receiving placebo but had an 
objective reaction (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ) at 1 of the doses of the milk 
formula consumed between 1  mg and 300  mg inclusive. S/He will be 
randomized in the study as s/he reacted to a dose of milk proteins lower than or 
equal to 300  mg (eliciting dose).

Following results of the 12 -month blinded period, the DBPCFCs that were to be 
performed at Month 24, Month 36 and Month 48 should not be conducted while the 
subjects are still receiving Viaskin Milk 500  µg.  
After subjects switch to Viaskin Milk 300  µg, the DBPCFCs at 12 months and 24 
months will be optional  and left at the Investigator’s  and the subject’s  decision.  
However, if a subject experienced a severe anaphylaxis to cow’s milk during the 
MILES study, whether or not occurring during the DBPCFC, no further DBPCFC 
should be conducted for this subject . 
All DBPCFC s at Month [ADDRESS_397789] will be conducted using the same procedur es 
that are described for the screening DBPCFC, with the exception that the dos ing will 
continue beyond the 300  mg dose of cow’s milk protein s if there are no objective 
symptoms (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 ) at the [ADDRESS_397790] dose of 3000 mg of cow’s milk proteins or until an objective 
reaction occurs  (as defined i n Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). 
For all DBPCFC s at Month [ADDRESS_397791] , the doses of cow’s milk proteins will be 
1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 100  mg, 300  mg, 1000  mg, 2000  mg, and 3000  mg

48) and the Viaskin Milk 300 µg open -label period (12 and 24 months after the switch) 
are provided below . Further details are provided in the Manual of Procedures for the 
DBPCFC.   
Only clear -cut OBJECTIVE  immediate -type symptom(s) requiring treatment  will be 
considered a permissible reason to stop the DBPCFC and to determine the eliciting 
dose (highest dose given during the challenge)  and the CRD of cow’s milk . For the 
open -label treat ment period with Viaskin Milk 300  µg, abdominal complaints will also be 
considered as a criterion for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322206] (see below) . The main objective 
symptoms to expect are as follows ( this list is not exhaustive; also refer to  
Appendix  14.2, OFC Symptom Score Sheet s21, 22): local or generalized pruritus, 
flushing, local or generalized urticaria, hives, swollen lips, swollen tongue, throat 
tightness, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, rh inorrhea, sneezing, wheezing, conjunctivitis, 
asthma, drop of the PEF, hypoxia, hypotension, hypotonia, decreased level of 
consciousness associated with collapse and/or incontinence or other life threatening 
symptoms.  
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322209] s performed during the double -blind placebo -
controlled period and the open -label treatment period with Viaskin Milk 500  µg were the 
following:  
• There is a >1 -point rise in an objective symptom from any category in the OFC 
Symptom Score Sheets, except only f or pruritus, which requires >2 -point rise  
• There is ≥1-point rise in an objective symptom from ≥2 categories in the OFC 
Symptom Score Sheets  
• There is a 1 -point rise in an objective symptom from 1 category in the OFC 
Symptom Score Sheets, with the following exceptions:  
o Pruritus : 0 to 1 or 0 to 2  
o Urticaria: 0 to 1

Only 1 out of 5 categories has increased its grading symptom score  
 
≥ 1-point rise  
(i.e. mild, moderate or severe)  
OR ≥ 2-point rise  
(i.e. moderate or severe)

o Abdominal complaints  
 
* “Laryngeal ” means symptoms due to laryngeal oedema and must be differentiated 
from another cause of cough like pharyngeal transient irritation or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_56790] s. Transient laryngeal irritation will not be considered as an objective OFC 
symptom and will no t be considered in the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
**For emesis/vomiting, the symptoms may result from two different situations: 
vomiting/spi[INVESTIGATOR_22940] -up during the feeding, resulting from subjective intolerance to the food 
formula or vomiting/emesis resulting from a gast rointestinal allergic reaction to the milk 
allergen, usually delayed from the feeding. Only the second situation will be considered  
as an objective OFC symptom and will be considered for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] . 
***Cardiovascula r symptoms: hypotension or cardio vascular failure directly related to 
the systemic allergic reaction. They have to be differentiated from similar symptoms 
related to another cause, such as a dizziness induced by [CONTACT_492] . 
In case of subjective symptoms, eg, mouth pruritus, throat pruritus , nausea, abdominal 
pain or any other subjective symptoms at a specific dose, deemed significant enough 
to question whether an objective symptom could occur, the Investigator  can, under 
these conditions,  extend the time between the previous dose and the next dose to see 
how the subject’s symptom(s) evolve(s). The same dose can be repeated only once, to 
check whether the subjective symptom(s) reappear(s) or not and with what intensity, 
and whether (an) objective symptom(s) now clearly appear(s ). If (an) objective

relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding  or vital sign measurement ), 
sympto m, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.24 This 
includes an exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, 
drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is 
not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments.  Note: A 
procedure is not an AE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator s to document all AEs that occur during the 
study.  AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_322257]/her parent(s)/guardian(s) a 
nonleading question, for example, “Are there any new or changed symptoms since we 
last asked or since your last visit?” AEs should be reported on t he appropriate page of 
the eCRF.   
All AEs occurring after the first Viaskin patch application  will be considered treatment -
emergent AEs (TEAEs).  TEAEs will be defined as any AEs, regardless of  relationship 
to Investigational product , which occur during or after the initial Viaskin patch  
application  or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to the Viaskin patch . If relationship information is m issing  for a 
TEAE , it will be considered drug-related. AEs with missing or incomplete onset date will 
be treated as TE AEs and missing onset date w ill be imputed as date of initial Viaskin 
patch  application  unless there is evidence that the event occurred before  the treatment 
period . 
Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_322258]:  
Mild An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort 
and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate  An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities; intervention may be needed.  
Sponsor: DBV Technologies    
Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.0  24 June 2019  
Confidential  Page 86 of 170 
Severe  An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention may be  needed.  
If there is a change in seve rity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
The severity of anaphylactic reactions, including those reported as part of medical 
history, will be assessed using the Anaphylaxis Staging System ( Appendix 14.4). For 
anaphylactic reactions occurring during the DBPCFC, only those considered to be a 
SAE will be assessed for severity.  
Assessment of C ausality  
The relationship between an AE and the investigational  product will be determined by 
[CONTACT_737] s on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions:  
Unrelated  Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to the 
investigational product administration , and that could be explained by 
[CONTACT_322259] . 
Unlikely  Clinical event whose time relationship to the investigational product  
administration makes a causal connection improbable, but that could 
plausibly be explained by [CONTACT_148542].  
Possible  Clinical event with a reasonable t ime relationship to the 
investigational product  administration , but that could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
Probable  Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to the 
investigational product  administration, and is unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
Definite  Clinical event with plausible time relationship to the investigational 
product  administration, and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_322260] o r chemicals.  
All SAEs assessed as “definitely related”, “probably related” and “possibly related” will 
be categorized as “related” for expedited reporting.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator s will describe the action taken with the drug product in the appropriate 
section of the eCRF, as follows:  
• None: No change in the dose of the study product . 
• Discontinued permanently: The study product was permanently stopped.  
• Temporarily interrupted: Dosing of the study product was interr upted.  
• Other: Specify.  
Outcomes of Adverse Events  
The Investigator s will describe the outcome of the AEs in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF, as follows:  
Sponsor: DBV Technologies    
Amendment 6: MILES  Final Version 6.0  24 June 2019  
Confidential  Page 87 of 170 
• Recovered/Resolved: The subject fully recovered from the AE with no 
residual effect observed.  
• Recov ered/Resolved with sequelae: The residual effects of the AE are still 
present and observable.  
• Ongoing : The AE itself is still present and observable.  
• Death.  
• Unknown/Lost to follow up.  
Treatment Required  
The Investigator s will describe if the subject was tr eated for an AE in the appropriate 
section of the eCRF, as follows:  
• None: No treatment was required.  
• Medication required: Prescription and/or over -the-counter medication were 
required to treat the AE.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322213], whether or not medication was 
required.  
• Other: Specify.  
More than one option  can be recorded to report all treatments given for each AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_397799] information concerning all 
AEs is included  on the appropriate pages of the eCRF . 
The following data should be documented for each AE:  
Diagnosis of the event if available and  description of the symptom event.  
Classification of ‘serious’ or ‘not serious.’  
Severity.  
Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable).  
Action taken.  
Treatment required.  
Causal relationship.  
Outcome of event (recovered, recovered with sequelae, ongoing , death [with date and 
cause reported] , unknown ). 
All Investigator s should follow up subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or until, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the event is stabiliz ed or determined to be chronic.  
Details of AE resolution  must be documented in the eCRF.  
Based on the medical judgment of the Investigator , all non -serious AEs (including the 
abnormal laboratory values identified as AEs by [CONTACT_737] ) will be followed until

[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_397801] that, at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening . This means that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event might hypothetically have caused death if 
it was more severe .  
Note: Whereas  an anaphylactic reaction is generally considered to be 
potentially  life-threatening , not all anaphylax es put the subject s at immediate 
risk of death , if for ex ample  appropriate treatment s lead to symptoms reduction 
or disappearance . As per the  Anaphylaxis Staging System classification 
(Appendix 14.4), an anaphylaxis assessed as mild or moderate should not be 
classified as life -threatening.  
• Requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (at least overnight stay or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
or prolongation of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322214] a SAE:  
1. Evaluation or treatment of a pre -existing (before informed consent 
signature) and non -exacerbating condition : 
a. The condition e xisted prior to the subject’s entry into the study and has 
been recorde d in the subject’s disease/medical history and the e -CRF 
AND  
b. The condition h as not worsened in severity or frequency during the 
subject’s exposure to the investigational product  AND   
c. It has not required a change in treatment management during the 
subject’ s exposure to the investigational product ; 
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a planned treatment of a pre -existing (before informed 
consent signature) and non-exacerbating  condition ; 
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322215] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (an AE is incapacitating or 
disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the 
subject’s ability to c arry out normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an “important medical event”  that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322216]. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for a llergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
Hematology , biochemistry , and any other laboratory tests will be analyzed  at a central 
laboratory (ies) designated by [CONTACT_456]. Reference ranges will be supplied and used 
by [CONTACT_322265].  
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at the timepoints listed in  the Schedule of 
Assessmen ts (Table  2 to Table 7). Instructions for blood sample collection , storage,  
and shipment will be provided in the laboratory manual.  
The following laboratory tests will be performed  using collected samples : 
Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, red blood cells  (RBC) , white blood cells  (WBC) , and 
differentials . 
Bioc hemistry  
Aspartate aminotransferase  (AST) , alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) , total bilirubin, total 
protein, blo od urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine . 
Total Blood Volume Requirements  
The estimated maximum blood volume that will be collected from each subject during a 
visit will be approximately 15 mL for hematology and biochemistry laboratory tests and 
efficacy or exp loratory assessments (serum immunology markers [Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ], 
filaggrin mutations , and epi[INVESTIGATOR_81078]  [Section 7.3.3 ]), up to Month 48, and 
approximately 12.[ADDRESS_397805] up 
to Month  24 will be approximately 80 mL.  For subjects who enter the study extension 
(Month 24 to 48), approximately [ADDRESS_397806] during the whole study (up to Month 48 ) was to be approximately 130  mL. For 
subjects who switch to Viaskin Milk 300  µg, up to  57.5 mL of additional blood will be 
collected within 24 months. The total blood volume requirement does not exceed the 
recommended sample blood volume of 3 mL/kg and up to  50 mL total within 8 weeks .26 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other L aboratory Variables  
For female subjects of childb earing potential, a urine sample will be collected to screen 
for pregnancy (urine β-HCG)  at the visits  listed in  Table  2 to Table 7. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_322218] , measured as FEV 1, will be performed for  subjects ≥6 years old ( unless 
they have documented inability to adequately perform spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] ) and the PEF will be 
assessed  for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_397807] < 5 years. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_10230]/or PEF data (depending on 
the subject’s age and ability to perform these tests)  will be documented on the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Diary Cards  
Diary cards will be dispensed to the subjects at Visit  [ADDRESS_397809] will be col lected for entry into the eCRF or  
into the clinical database.  
Subjects or their parent(s)/guardian(s) will be instructed how to use the diary card from 
Visit 4 (Day  1) and to bring the card to the site at each subsequent visit. Subjects or 
their parent(s)/guardian(s) will be instructed to record on their diary cards any 
AEs/medical events  and associated medications, the duration of application and 
reason for removal of the Viaskin patch, if the patch is removed before the 
recommended duration in addition to  any information regarding cow’s milk consumption 
(including dairy products or any baked milk product) during the ir participation in the  
study.  
At the clinical site, upon review of the diary cards, the investigative staff will interview 
the subject to know whether the milk consumption was either accidental or voluntary. 
This will be useful for the Investigators to assess whether there has been any 
risk-taking behavior and collect as much information as possible about  those cases.

8 Statistical Methods  
8.1 Statistical and Analytical  Plans 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to  database lock.  
The SAP will ensure that  the study data listings, summary tables , and figures that will 
be produced, and the statistical methodologies that will be used, are complete and 
appropriate to allow valid conclusions regarding the study objectives.  
8.1.1  Datasets or Populations Analyz ed 
The Safety Set (SS) will include all subjects who applied at least [ADDRESS_397816] , or as it will be determined at the Blind Data Review Meeting  (BDRM) , on a 
case -by-case basis . The SS will be used for all safety analys is tables and listings . 
The Intent -to-Treat  Set ( ITT) will include all randomized subjects. Subjects will be 
analyzed according to randomized treatment.  The ITT Set will be used for all analyses 
of efficacy endpoints.   
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all subjects from the ITT population who do not 
have major protocol violations that may affect the primary endpoint.  Major protocol 
deviations will be defined in the SAP.   
Protocol deviations will be categorized as either major or minor and discussed during  
the blinded data review  meeting (BDRM). Decisions taken at the BDRM will be 
documented and approved by [CONTACT_322267].  
The Open -label Set s (OLS) will include  all subjects from the ITT who entered the 
open -label treatment period (ie , who appli ed at least one Viaskin Milk patch during the 
open -label treatment period)  and will be described in the SAP .  
The Open -label Set  300 µg  (OLS_300) will include  all subjects who switch ed to Viaskin 
Milk 300 µg and will be described in the SAP .  
8.1.2  General Considerations  
There will be 2 age groups considered for the statistical analyses:  
• Children: 2 to 11 years of age at the time of Visit 1  
• Adolescents: 12 to 17 years of age at the time of Visit 1  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_551], dose level, and  pooled placebo group for the 
randomized blinded treatment period  (Months 0  to 12) as follows:  
Part A  and Part B : Viaskin Milk  150 µg, 300  µg, 500  µg of cow’s milk proteins , and 
placebo.  
Part A and Part  B subjects will be combined and pooled by [CONTACT_15994], as 
applicable, for the efficacy analyses at Month  12. 
In general, categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages, and 
continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with evaluable

data (n), mean, standard devi ation, median, first and third quartiles (Q1, Q3), minimum 
and maximum.  
All hypothesis tests will be in scope of dose -response or longitudinal analyses.  
Listings of raw subject data will be sorted by [CONTACT_15994] , randomization number and  
visit, as applicable , for all randomized subjects. For subjects in Part A, data from 
Cohorts  1, 2, and [ADDRESS_397817] Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population (ITT, PPS, SS, 
OLS and OLS_300 ) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570] (dose 
level/placebo).  
Subject disposition will be summarized for all subjects in the  ITT. The number and 
percentage of subject completed, discontinued, and the primary reason for early 
withdrawal fro m the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_322268].  
8.1.4  Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
For continuous demographic variables and baseline characteristics (including age, 
height, weight , body mass index  (BMI, kg/m²), body surface (m²),  weight/height (kg/m), 
SPT mean wheal diameter, FEV 1 percent predicted [spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]] , PEF percent 
predicted , CRD of cow’s milk, and milk sIgE), descriptive will be generated for each 
dose level and  placebo  group at V isit 1 for all subjects in the  ITT. 
For categorical demographic variables and baseline characteristics (including sex, 
ethnic origin, and medical  history) , the number and percent of subjects in each 
category  will be tabulated for each dose level and  placebo  group at Visit [ADDRESS_397818] demographic and baseline characteristics data will be listed.  
8.1.5  Concomitant Medication s 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHODrug). A summary of concomitant medications by [CONTACT_322269] (ATC) term and preferred term will be produced 
overall and by [CONTACT_322270] e group, for each dose level and placebo group on the ITT for the 
randomized blinded treatment period (Months 0 to 12).  
Concomitant medications during the open -label treatment periods after Month 12 will 
be described. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
8.1.6  Efficacy  
Missing data will not be imputed for the efficacy analyses  except for the classification of 
treatment responders / non responders for the primary efficacy analysis .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  and Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage (%) of subjects who are treatment 
responders after [ADDRESS_397819] one of the following 
criteria:  
• A ≥10-fold increase in the CRD  of cow’s milk proteins at the Month [ADDRESS_397820] 144 mg  of cow’s milk 
proteins (approximately  4.5 mL of milk) . 
• A CRD  of cow’s milk proteins ≥1444 mg ( approximately 45  mL of milk ) at the 
Month  [ADDRESS_397821] of cow’s milk proteins is entered directly in CRF  by [CONTACT_322271] c ow’s milk proteins  given  during the challenge , including repeat 
doses if applicable, and exact quantity of the last dose given (if not given in totality).  
The percentage of subjects who are treatment responders after 12 months of EPIT 
treatment will be calculated on the ITT population using missing = failure imputation 
method (ie, subjects with missing observation at Month  12 will be considered as non -
responder s). 
The numb er and percentage of responders  will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_135911], for each pooled dose level  (Part A and Part B) and placebo  group , for the 
blinded treatment period (Months 0 to 12) . 
Methods of exact logistic regression will be used to compare the proportion of 
treatment responders at Month  [ADDRESS_397822], for subjects in the ITT 
population. P -values, odds rat ios together with associated 95% Confidence Intervals 
(95% CI) will be presented.   
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study, together with additional exploratory 
analyses, will assess the dose -response relationship and aim to inform the dose 
selection f or phase 3.  Model -based analytical approaches of exploratory dose 
finding (e.g., MCP -Mod) will be used to evaluate the dose -response relationship 
and estimate target dose(s).  
Further details of the statistical methodology and considerations for the appro aches 
to be used in the analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_397823] of the primary 
efficacy criteria to the results and interpretation of s tudy results. The analysis described 
above will be repeated for subjects in the ITT using observed data  and in the PPS . A 
similar analysis will be performed on ITT population  using multiple imputation instead of 
missing = failure imputation method. Multipl e imputation method will be further 
described in the SAP.   
Other covariates of interest including baseline IgE (by [INVESTIGATOR_67132]) and country will be 
explored.

Finally, the primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for each age group as well as for 
each filaggr in mutation group (With filaggrin mutation / Without filaggrin mutation). 
Within subgroup, the treatment group comparisons will be  conducted at a two -sided 
10% significance level.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  and Analysis  
The secondary endpoints for the double -blind, placebo -controlled treatment period up 
to Month 12 are: 
• The mean and median CRD of cow’s milk proteins at Month  12 and change 
from baseline.

[IP_ADDRESS].5  Analysis of Severity D uring the Milk DBPCFC  
The change in the severity of symptoms elicited during the milk DBPCFC from baseline  
will be assessed  at Month 12 . Grading of symptoms will be done  using the grading 
definition in the OFC Symptom Score Sheet s., Each sy mptom (objective and subjective) 
will be graded 0, 1, 2 or 3 . A total symptom score  will be derived  for objective symptoms . 
The total summary score (absolute and change from baseline) will be summarized 
overall and by [CONTACT_551], dose level and placebo group  on the ITT for the randomized 
blinded treatment period (Months  0 to 12).  
A second severity score will be derived to asses s the change from Baseline in the 
severity of symptoms elicited during the milk DBPCFC  at comparable cow’s milk 
proteins dose . The calculation of this severity score at comparable cow’s milk proteins 
dose  will be further described in the SAP. This score wi ll be summarized overall and by

• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_322166].  
In all safety presentations, imputation of missing data will take the option of the most 
conservative outcome, so that, for example, missing relatedness  for a TEAE  will be 
assumed to be related and missing severity will be assumed to be severe  if the severity 
is missing for an AE starting on or after the date of initial Viaskin Milk patch appl ication  
and mild  if the severity is missing for an AE starting prior to the date of initial Viaskin 
Milk patch application .

All data  that are not available in electronic format  (eg, diary cards ) will be 
double -entered into the data management system , if these data have to be entered by 
[CONTACT_322279] . Following data verification (completion of second data entry  and 
further verification of the  entries ), the audit trail will be switched on ( ie, a computeriz ed 
log of all subsequent changes to the data will be recorded). Automated checks will be 
made against the data to ensure completeness and consistency. The database and 
check programs will be v alidated before implementation.  
MedDRA will be used to code  concomitant diseases and AEs and the WHODrug will be 
used for concomitant medicati ons. 
Missing or inconsistent data will be queried in writing to the Investigator  for clarification. 
Subsequent modifications to t he database will be documented.  
The sites  will enter d ata directly into the EDC system by [CONTACT_120081] a 
secure internet connection.  The CRO  will provide training on how to use the system to 
the Investigator s at each site. Data entered into the eCRF must be verifiable against 
source documents at the site. Data to be recorded directly in the eCRF (without prior 
written or electronic record) will be identified and the eCRF will be considered the 
source document. Any changes to the data entered into the EDC system will be 
recorded in the audit trail and is FDA CFR  21 Part  11 compliant.  
Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as will be defined in the data validation 
specification . External data ch ecks will be programmed where appropriate ( eg for 
laboratory data) as well as for cross table checking between eCRF’s ( eg AE and 
concomitant medication forms).  
[ADDRESS_397831]  (including placebo product , as applicable ), the 
Investigator  (or deputy) will conduct an inventory of the supplies and verify that the 
investigational product  supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts before  
completing  a supplies receipt.  The Investigator  will retain a copy of this receipt at the  
site and return the original receipt to the study monitor.  The investigational product will 
be shipped by [CONTACT_322280] a designated person at the study site and must be stored in 
a locked and secured storage facility, accessible only to those individuals authorized by 
[CONTACT_737] . The inven tory of supplies at each study site  may be checked at any 
time d uring the study by [CONTACT_2037].  
It is the responsibility of the study monito r to ensure that the Investigator  (or deputy) 
has correctly documented the amount received, dispens ed and return ed of the 
investigational product  on the dispensing log that will be provided.  A full product  
accountability log will be maintained at the  site at all times.  The study monitor will 
arrange regular collection of unused investigational product that was  returned by [CONTACT_1560].  The study monitor will also perform an inventory of investigational product  at 
the close -out visit to the study site . All di screpancies must b e accounted for and 
documented.  
At the end of the study, the sites will be responsible for destroying unused 
investigational product and providing a corresponding certificate of destruction .

14.9 Reference Safety Information for  the Cow’s Milk Food Challenge  in the MILES 
study  
In the context of DBV135 (Viaskin Milk) clinical development, a for mulated recipe of food 
challenge has been developed by [CONTACT_322292] -Blind Placebo -
Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) procedure  in clinical trials .  
The food challenge kits, containing the low and high dose of cow’s milk protein and 
placebo formulas, are provided to all sites participating in the Viaskin Milk clinical studies 
where DBPCFCs procedures are conducted according to a specific Manual of 
Procedure.  
The Food Challenge is  a non -authorized product  used to produce a physiological 
response that is relevant to the design of the clinical trial.  
All serious adverse events (SAE), including anaphylactic reaction s and allergic 
symptoms,  that occur during  the Food Challenge procedures, are elicited events to either 
diagnose the food allergy or to assess the efficacy of the corresponding Investigational 
Medicinal Product (Viaskin Milk). Therefore, they are considered as expected by 
[CONTACT_108].  
Only death occurring within the context of the DBPCFC procedure or any SAE with the 
outcome “Death” related to Food Challenge will be considered as unexpected and 
considered as suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction for expedited reporting 
purpose.

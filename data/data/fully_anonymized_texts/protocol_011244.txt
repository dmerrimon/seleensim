 Presby[CONTACT_19555]- correcting  intraocular lenses ( IOLs ) have evolved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_275515].  Such IOLs 
include extended depth o f focus (EDOF) and multifocal (MF) IOLs.  The ultimate goal o f these lenses and 
their various iterations over time has been to provide an excellent range of focus at distance, 
intermediate, and near distances, good quality of vision and contrast sensitivity under different lighting 
conditions, good reading ability, and the minimization of  photic phenomena.  
 
 The TECNIS Synergy IOL is a  one-pi[INVESTIGATOR_553428] -correcting IOL  available in non -toric and toric 
versions  that was introduced to the US market in June 2021.  At our center, we were the first site in the 
US to implant the Synergy ( June 7, 2021 ) and have been us ing the IOL  ever since .  This Synergy IOL is  
part of the TECNIS platform, which is composed of  time -tested hydrophobic acrylic material with 
ultraviolet and violet light absorber, 6-mm aspher ic optic, refractive index of 1.47, and  continuous 360  ° 
posterior square edge design .  The company boasts that the new Synergy  IOL combines the benefits  
from the TECNIS Multifocal and TECNIS Symfony (EDOF)  diffractive  designs , and that it delivers a wider 
range of continuous vision  and better near vision in day and night than a leading trifocal IOL .[ADDRESS_727288] surgeons who are considering

completed the study  visit.  
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 A. Sample size  
As a single -arm study  designed to provide normative results for the lens , there is no  relevant 
sample size calculation. Some subgroup analysis is desirable (e.g., toric vs. non -toric, photopic 
vs. mesopic results, differences by [CONTACT_553432]/or site). It is expected that 100 su bjects (200 
eyes) will be sufficient to allow this type of subgroup analysis.  
 
 
De Rojas J O, Sandoval HP   [ADDRESS_727294] descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed appropriate 
based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and 
interpreted at a 5% s ignificance level.  Data analysis will be conducted by a third -party 
consultant.  
 
C. Study Endpoints:  
 1. Primary Endpoints:  
1.  Binocular distance corrected near visual acuity at 40 cm under photopic conditions  
2.  Binocular distance corrected near visual acuity at 40 cm mesopic conditions  
 
 
2. Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Binocular low contrast distance visual acuity under photopic and mesopic conditions  
2. Uncorrected and distance -corrected near (40 cm) visual acuity  
3. Uncorrected and distance -corrected intermediate (66 cm) visual acuity  
4. Uncorrected and best -corrected distance (4 m) visual acuity  
5. Distance -corrected near visual acuity at best distance  
6. Non -directed complaints  
7. To evaluate patient’s overall satisfaction of their vision  
8. To evaluate patient’s spectacle independence  
9. To evaluate visual symptoms using a questionnaire  
10. To evaluate the functional vision questionnaire  
11. Residual mean spherical equivalent refraction  
12. Residual refractive sphere  
13. Residual refractive cylinder  
14. Percentage of eyes with postoperative MRSE accuracy to target ≤ 0.5D  
 
D. Safety Analyses  
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular ad verse events will be tabulated.  
Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment- related.  
Comparison of treatment groups with respect to the proportion of study patients reporting 
adverse events will be made using Fisher’s  Exact Test.  
 
6. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
A. Confidentiality  
To ensure confidentiality in this study, records of the participants will be examined only by [CONTACT_28824], sub -investigator(s)  and research staff involved in the study.  Study r ecords will

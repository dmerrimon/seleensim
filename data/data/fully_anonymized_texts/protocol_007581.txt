 6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE) 
Subjects who experience an adverse event during study participation will be discontinued from study participation  but will be follow ed by [CONTACT_686123]. 
 
 
6.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, reportable AEs include ocular AEs and non- ocular ser ious 
adverse events (SAEs). All AEs will be classified first for seriousness and significance and  
then as to whether or not they are device related or non -device related and if device related,  
then, if it is an adverse device effect (ADE), an anticipated serious adverse device effect  
(ASADEs) or an unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DEs). AEs , ADEs,  
ASADEs, [LOCATION_003]DEs, SAEs, Significant Non -Serious AEs and Non- Significant  Non - 
Serious AEs are defined as follows:  
 
6.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects or users , whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device. Adverse events should be categorized as devic e related or 
non-device related.  
Throughout the course of this study all efforts will be made to remain alert to reportable AEs. If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  
 All reportable AEs occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject’s end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.  
 
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adver se event which:  
• Led to death;  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
o A life -threatening illness or injury; or  
o A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness); or  
o Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or  
o Injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; or 
o Chronic disease 
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth  defect
.

 6.1.3 Serious Adverse Ocular Event  
Serious Adverse Ocular Event is a serious adverse event that results in, or has potential to cause, either permanent impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure and may necessitate medical or surgical intervention. Serious Adverse Events require expedited reporting. Serious adverse events include any hazardous, sight- threatening 
conditions occurring after exposure to a study lens , including but not limited to the 
following: 
 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal tissue). For the purposes of reporting, a corneal ulcer which has any of the following characteristics should be considered in this category: 
o Central or paracentral location;  
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane; 
o Infiltrate ≥2 mm diameter; 
o Associated with iritis;  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure;  
o Culture positive for microorganisms; 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits.  
 
Note: Signs of a presumed infectious ulcer may include irregular focal infiltrates; active lesions with raised edges; significant diffuse infiltration; anterior corneal to  
mid-stromal involvement; erosion with overlying staining; conjunctival and lid 
edema; anterior chamber reaction (iritis); severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset; severe redness; purulent or mucopurulent discharge; tearing; photophobia. 
 
• Any central or paracentral (withi n 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in 
permanent opacification  (such as corneal scar or vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and hyphema. 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea.  
• Permanent loss of 2 or more lines (10 letters) of Best Spectacle Corrected Visual 
Acuity ( BSCVA ). 
• All cases of iritis.  
 
6.1.4 Significant, Non- Serious Adverse Event  
A Significant, Non- Serious Adverse Event is an Adverse Event that does not meet the 
serious criteria, is considered significant, and requires expedited reporting. These events 
include (but are not limited to): 
• Peripheral non-progressive non-infectious corneal ulcer 
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events  
• All cases of corneal staining severity greater than or equal to Grade 3  
• A temporary loss of 2 or more lines (10 or more letters) of BSCVA (for greater than 
or equal to 2 weeks)

 • Increase in neovascularization of 1.5mm or greater. 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discont inuation of greater than or 
equal to 2 weeks. 
 
6.1.5 Non -significant, Non- serious Adverse Event  
A Non -Significant Non -Serious Adverse Event may include (but are not limited to) and 
does not require expedited reporting: 
• Asymptomatic, peripheral, corneal inf iltrative events.  
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis  
• Viral Conjunctivitis  
• Allergic Conjunctivitis  
• Corneal Edema  
• Contact [CONTACT_240375][INVESTIGATOR_19534]  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_930229] (ADE)  
An ADE is an Adverse Event that is assessed to be related to the use of an investigational 
medical device. This definition includes Adverse Events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE)  
An ASADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious 
Adverse Event) or significant, non-serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-
serious AE) and which, by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome, has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs include:  
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis  
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discha rge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
An [LOCATION_003]DE is an ADE that first m eets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious 
Adverse Event) or significant, non-serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-serious AE) and has an effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by,  or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

 A culture should be obtained in cases of corneal ulcer or suspected  ocular infection, unless medic ally contraindicated. Cultures should be taken from the cul- de-sac, lower eyelid 
margin, and the corneal lesion (if applicable). When a culture is obtained, the contact [CONTACT_686124] t he AE should 
be collected from the subject (if available at the time of the  culture) for culturing and 
processing by [CONTACT_686125]. Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies (e.g., lenses, lens cas es and/or lens case solutions) 
are for  information only. Because microbes may be introduced into subject supplies during 
use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiology or direction of organism transmission . The ocular cultures, along with the 
associated contact [CONTACT_145924], will be sent to the clinical laboratory designated by [CONTACT_145925]. The clinical laboratory will report the 
culture results to both the Investigator and to the Research Clinic, the Investigator will record the results in the applicable form.
 
 
6.3 Adverse Event Identification and Evaluation  Throughout the course of a study all efforts will be made to remain alert to Adverse Events (AEs). If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate 
medical intervention will be made. The associated product should be retained for further analysis, if needed.  
 All AEs occurring after signing the informed consent and through the end of the subject’s participation in the study must be recorded and reported, if applicable. All AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.   Identify potential adverse events during a clinical study by [CONTACT_145926]: 
• Direct observation by [CONTACT_737] 
• Asking the study participant using a non-specific question (i.e. Have you had any problems since the last visit?)  
• Unsolicited volunteering of information by [CONTACT_87755] (i.e. Doctor, I have had numerous headaches since I started using this lens)  
• Laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classification as an adverse event (i.e. IOP over 30mmHg)

 PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, LENS CARE AND LENS HANDLING : 
 1. Preparing the Lens for Wearing:  
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of your new lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact [CONTACT_224037]. Your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle your lenses. The procedures are:  
• Always wash your hands thoroughly with a mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint- free tow el before touching your lenses. 
• Avoid the use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before handling your lenses, since these substances may come into contact [CONTACT_145944].  
• Handle your lenses with your fingertips and be careful to avoid contact [CONTACT_145945]. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
• Start off correctly by [CONTACT_686134].  
 
2. Handling  the Lenses:  
• Develop the habit of always working with the same lens first to avoid mix -ups. 
• Position the lens on your index finger and examine it to be sure that it is moist, clean, clear, and free of any nicks or tears.  
• Should you accidentally place an inside-out lens on your eye, one of the following 
signs should signal you to remove and replace it correctly. 
a) Less than usual comfort, 
b) The lens may fold on the eye, 
c) Excessive lens movement on blink, 
d) Blurred vision.  
• If the lens folds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and wet thoroughly with the recommended rinsing or storing solution. Then GENTLY rub 
the lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. 
• If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, t he lens or your finger may be too 
wet. To correct this, dry your finger by [CONTACT_145947], drying the opposite finger each time.

 3. Placing the Lens on the Eye  
There are other methods of lens placement.  If the following methods are difficult for you, 
your Study Doctor will provide you with an alternate method.  
 
NOTE: If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following:  
The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these instructions).  
If the lens is centered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and check for the following:  
• cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens)  
• the lens is on the wrong eye  
• the lens is inside -out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal)  
 If you find that your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove both lenses and consult your eye care professional.  
 
A. The One -Hand Placement Technique  
• Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight ahead, pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point above you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye.  
 
 
 
B. The Two -Hand Placement Technique  
• With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on your eye. While holding this position, look downward to position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids.  
• If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and gently place a finger on the edge of the contact [CONTACT_145948]. Then by [CONTACT_145949], the lens will re -center itself. If the lens still feels 
uncomfortable, follow the steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Adverse Reactions.”  

ROC2 -23-007: Orientation Characteristics of kalifilcon A Daily Disposable Toric Contact [CONTACT_686128] 1.[ADDRESS_930241] techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the procedures below.  
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a 
mirror, gently place a finger on the contact [CONTACT_145950].  
OR 
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a mirror, move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye.  
 
5. Removing the Lens 
• Always remove the same lens first.  
• Wash, rinse, and dry your hands thoroughly.  
• Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to 
remove it (a simple check of your vision, closing one eye at a time, will tell you if the lens is in the correct position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your removal hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the edges of the lens together. 
• Remove the other lens by [CONTACT_145951]. 
• Follow the required lens care procedures described by [CONTACT_89635].  
• NOTE: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your eye care professional will provide you with an alternate method. 
 
6. Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens 
• It is impor tant to the health of your eyes that your contact [CONTACT_686135]. If a lens 
sticks (stops moving), put a few drops of the Bausch + Lomb Sensitive Eyes® Drops 
provided by [CONTACT_686136]. In this case, do not use plain water or anything other than the recommended solutions. Do not attempt to remove a lens that is sticking, which could damage your eye. If the lens does not begin to move when

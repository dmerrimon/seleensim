CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN 
 
I. TITLE 
Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of the OPTIMIZER® System in Subjects with 
Moderate- to-Severe Heart Failure with Ejection Fraction between 25% and 45%:  FIX-
HF-5C  
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
A. Name [CONTACT_247683] I Vs System, a system capable of 
delivering non-excitatory cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signals.  These 
electrical signals are intended to influence myocardial properties in patients with chronic 
heart failure.  The System consists of four major components: 
1. An implantable pulse generator  with specialized internal components that 
generate the cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signal (the OPTIMIZER I Vs 
device);  
2. Three commercially available percutaneously placed leads :  
a. one in the right atrium to sense right atrial activation, and  
b. two in the right ventricle to sense ventricular activation and deliver CCM 
signals.   
NOTE: For purposes of this study, any commercially available atrial lead can be 
used.  For the ventricular sensing and CCM delivery leads, the following leads 
may be used: 
 Biotronik Setrox S45, S53 and S60 lead  
 [LOCATION_011] Scientific Dextrus 4135, 4136 and 4137 lead  
 St. Jude Tendril DX 1688T, 1788T, 1888 or 2088  active fixation lead  
 or others as qualified by [CONTACT_247531] ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300867] programming wand, providing the means to set System 
parameters and assess device diagnostics (OMNI II Programmer); 
4. A battery charging system , consisting of a charger unit and wand (Mini 
Charger);   
 The OPTIMIZER IVs is very similar in its design, and is substantially equivalent, to the 
OPTIMIZER III System with regard to its intended use, safety, performance, and design 
characteristics. The design of the OPTIMIZER IVs includes several differences intended 
to offer physicians and patients a smaller IPG, a portable charger and an easier to use 
programmer. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_247449] (the device 
algorithms, sensing signals, CCM signal outputs and functionality) all remain identical. 
B. Summary of findings from non-clinical studies that potentially have clinical 
significance and from clinical trials that are relevant to the trial 
1. Nonclinical studies 
a. Basic research 
Experimental evidence indicates that electrical signals can modulate cardiac 
contractility.  When cardiac contractility modulating (CCM) signals were applied 
to isolated rat myocytes, myocyte shortening increased and peak intracellular [Ca2+] 
increased.  This suggested that during CCM signal  application there was an 
increase in intracellular calcium which was the basis for the increase in myocyte 
contractility. 
When CCM signals were applied to isolated rabbit papi[INVESTIGATOR_247450], cardiac 
contractility modulation reached a steady, stable state within several seconds and 
recovered within the same amount of time after signal cessation.  Peak tension 
increased, but diastolic tone was not significantly affected.  The CCM signal effect 
was reversed when the polarity of the signal was reversed, even though the timing 
and duration of the signal were constant.  Intracellular microelectrode recordings 
showed that signals that increased cardiac contractiltiy were associated with 
prolongation of the action potential, whereas signals that depressed contractilty 
caused a decrease in action potential duration.  In either case, there was no extra 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300868]-extra-systolic potentiation (PESP).  
Furthermore, when CCM signals were applied in rabbit papi[INVESTIGATOR_51482] [ADDRESS_300869] dogs 
indicated that CCM signals applied to the left ventricle in dual chamber paced hearts 
induced an increase in cardiac contractility as indexed by [CONTACT_51537] 
+dP/dt max.  Increases in LV systolic pressures and aortic flow were also observed, 
with a trend towards reduction in end diastolic pressure. 
CCM signals were applied in six heart-failure dogs, transvenously in four dogs and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_51483].  The results indicated an enhancement in LVP, 
dP/dt max and ESP, in both AAI and DDI pacing modes and in normal sinus rhythm.  
The CCM signal was applied to 16 DDI paced pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], resulting in an increase in 
dP/dt max and an increase in LVP. 
Experiments conducted in healthy dogs suggested that CCM signal application to 
either the left or right ventricle could improve myocardial contractility with no 
major adverse effects.  Inotropic effects were greater from the right side when the 
signals were delivered simultaneously to two electrodes inserted into the right 
ventricular septum. 
b.  Chronic animal study 
A six-month study was conducted in 11 animals to evaluate the safety and 
performance of the OPTIMIZER II System under simulated clinical conditions.  
This study involved seven treatment animals and four control animals in which 
OPTIMIZER II Systems were implanted.  In the treatment animals, the 
OPTIMIZER II System delivered CCM signals to the myocardium for seven 
equally-spaced one-hour periods every 24 hours.  This signal delivery paradigm 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -009 
FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 7 of 51 was similar to the one that will be used in the clinical investigation.  In the control 
animals, the device delivered simulated pacing signals under the same paradigm. 
The safety of the System was assessed on the basis of the effects of the CCM signal 
on myocardial tissue and on lead integrity, the changes in global and regional 
myocardial function and inotropic reserve and the incidence and severity of 
adverse events. 
At the end of the study, the data showed that the System operated as intended and 
delivered CCM signals on >90% of beats during the intended periods.  The pulse 
generator turned on and off automatically for the intended periods.   
The effects of CCM signals on gross and histologic appearance of the myocardium 
were indistinguishable from those observed with simulated pacing signals.  At lead 
insertion sites, mature fibrous material devoid of signs of acute inflammation was 
observed.  There was no effect on histologic appearance of myocardium remote 
from the lead insertion sites.   
The myocardium retained normal inotropic reserve, as evidenced by [CONTACT_247532] (assessed by [CONTACT_2715]-dependent 
changes in heart rate, dP/dtmax, dP/dtmin, time constant of relaxation, 
ventriculography and global and regional echocardiographic assessment of 
myocardial function).  There was no untoward effect of CCM signal delivery over 
this period of time on lead integrity, as assessed by [CONTACT_247533].   
In aggregate, these data suggested that the device operated as intended and the 
CCM signals had no identified adverse effects on normal canine myocardium.  
This study is considered to be appropriate to provide some insight into long term 
safety of the system because the testing has evaluated a very wide range of 
myocardial properties with no suggestion of deleterious effects.  The finding of no 
active inflammation around the lead site is a strong indication that there is no 
ongoing damage created by [CONTACT_247534].  Therefore, it is very unlikely that longer

FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 8 of 51 term testing in animals would yield any additional or contrary information to what 
has been identified in this study. 
c. Clinical studies 
   (1)   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_51484] 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_247451] 24 heart failure subjects undergoing EP procedures in Milan, 
Italy.  CCM signals were delivered via a Cardima octapolar catheter inserted into 
the great cardiac vein (GCV) via the coronary sinus.  The results indicated that CCM 
signals enhanced hemodynamic parameters.  In six subjects with left bundle branch 
block (LBBB), the application of the CCM signal was applied in addition to 
biventricular pacing and the effect was additive.   
From the left side experience, the primary findings were:  
 Improved systolic performance 
 No significant change in diastolic function 
 Sensation in a small number of subjects, possibly due to the proximity 
of the CCM electrode to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_51486] 
 Difficulty in optimizing lead position in the coronary sinus  
These observations provided the motivation for testing whether CCM signals could 
be effective hemodynamically if delivered to the RV septum.  In a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], as a basis of comparison, eleven subjects had CCM signals applied to the 
right side of the heart.  Primary observations were: 
 Improved systolic performance 
 No sensation in response to CCM signal/application 
 Easily positioned catheters 
A larger inotropic effect from the right side was observed when the signal was 
delivered simultaneously to two right ventricular septal leads as compared to when 
it was delivered from one electrode alone.

 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 9 of 51 (2) Chronic feasibility study 
A safety study of the implantable OPTIMIZER System in six subjects with 
functional NYHA Class III heart failure and baseline ejection fraction of 35% or 
less by [CONTACT_247535][INVESTIGATOR_51487], Italy.  
Enrolled subjects were evaluated at baseline by [CONTACT_51541], a 
cardiopulmonary stress test, a [ADDRESS_300870] pacing electrodes placed 
percutaneously and guided to the RV endocardial septum.  CCM signal amplitude, 
delay, duration and number of pulses (to a maximum of three) were set during the 
implantation procedure to achieve a minimum 5% improvement in dP/dt max.  
Subjects underwent an acute and a chronic phase of monitored CCM signal 
application or sham signal application, five days per week.  Follow-up testing 
included echocardiograms, 24-hour Holter monitor tests, cardiopulmonary stress 
tests, 6-minute walk tests and completion of a quality of life questionnaire.  All 
subjects completed participation in the study.  There were no clinically significant 
adverse events in any subject. 
(3) Chronic safety and performance study (FIX- HF-3 Study) 
A clinical investigation was conducted to evaluate the safety and functionality of 
the OPTIMIZER II System in subjects with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) 
Class III heart failure.  Twenty-two subjects underwent OPTIMIZER II System 
implantation.  Subjects underwent application of CCM signals for three consecutive 
hours a day for eight weeks after implantation. 
Device interrogations indicated that CCM signals were delivered for the intended 
180 minutes per day and on approximately 84±16% (median 90%) of normal sinus 
beats.  CCM signals were appropriately delivered during the relative refractory 
period (between the QRS complex and the onset of the T-wave) and were 
suppressed on PVCs as designed.   
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300871] symptoms improved during the study.  From Class 
III at entry, NYHA class decreased in three subjects to Class I, in 15 subjects to 
Class II and in two subjects, it was unchanged.  Minnessotta Living with Heart 
Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) scores decreased from baseline value of 
41.9±22.2 to 23.6±17.9 (mean reduction of 16.9±21.9, p=0.0027).  Ejection fraction 
increased from the baseline value of 21.4±6.3% to 27.4±7.0% at eight weeks (mean 
increase 5.9±6.4%, p=0.0006).  There was no significant change in heart rate 
(76±11, median 75), number of PVCs per hour (70.8±176.7, median 21.4), number 
of runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia per hour (0.04±0.10, median 0.02), 
or the number of premature atrial contractions per hour (17.2±46.8, median 1.7).   
There were four deaths (two during the study period and two after study 
completion), three apparently from cardiac causes in subjects with severe heart 
failure at high risk of mortality.  The fourth death was due to a massive pulmonary 
embolism caused by [CONTACT_51542].  A subject with a heart 
transplant on chronic immuno-suppressive therapy who suffered from chronic 
rejection and who was treated with the OPTIMIZER II system on a compassionate 
basis but who was followed according to the protocol, died of sepsis.  All subjects 
continue to be followed closely. 
Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events were generally expected for patients 
with severe heart failure within the context of a study of a device-based treatment 
for heart failure, and were observed with a frequency similar to that of a recent study 
of biventricular pacing.  Seventy adverse events were reported, most commonly 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], shortness of breath, dizziness and water retention.  Twenty events in 
11 subjects were classified as serious and/or severe.  Nine events occurring in five 
subjects were classified as device-related.  The most common device-related events 
were pocket hematoma and stimulation sensation.  In aggregate, these results 
indicate that the OPTIMIZER II System operates as intended, is safe and its use is 
associated with improvements in symptoms of heart failure.

Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -009 
FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 11 of 51 Fourteen of the patients who participated in the study described in (3) above 
participated in a second clinical study to investigate the effects of increased 
duration of CCM treatment.  In these subjects, the OPTIMIZER II device was 
programmed to deliver CCM signal for 7 noncontiguous hours per day (7 
cycles of 1 hour on, 2 hours 24 minutes off) for 6 months.  Upon entry into 
this increased dose safety study, the clinical status was markedly improved 
compared to their original baseline status prior to having received CCM 
treatment.  NYHA averaged 1.6±0.5, MLWHFQ averaged 9.6±6.2, 6MW 
averaged 471±121, peak VO2 averaged 1065±215 ml O2/min (~14.0±2.8 ml 
O2/kg/min) and ejection fraction averaged 35±9%.  Over the 24 week follow-
up period, the clinical parameters were maintained at relatively constant 
levels, except for peak VO 2 which increased to 1201±343 ml O 2/min 
(15.8±4.5 ml O 2/kg/min; p=0.02).  Medical therapy for heart failure did not 
change in a majority of patients during this study, and there was an 
approximately equal number of instances when medication use was increased 
as when it was decreased.   
During the 8 week period of the original FIX- HF-3 study described above, 
there were 43 adverse events reported in these 14 study subjects.  Ten of these 
events were classified as serious and/or severe.  Twelve of the events were 
classified by [CONTACT_247536], possibly or probably related 
to the device.  In contrast, during the 24 week period of the present FIX-HF -
3 Extension study, there were a total of 43 adverse events of which three were 
classified as serious and 14 were classified as being definitely, possibly or 
probably related to the device.  Thus, the rate (number of AEs/time) and 
severity (number of serious AEs) of adverse events was significantly lower in 
the FIX-HF -[ADDRESS_300872] 
common adverse events reported during the FIX- HF-3 Extension study were 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea and pulmonary edema, which are similar to what was 
reported in the original FIX-HF -3 study.

FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 12 of 51 (5)    Prospective, multicenter, randomized double blind study of CCM: the FIX-
CHF-4 study (Europe)  
A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded study (FIX-CHF-4) was 
conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the OPTIMIZER II and 
OPTIMIZER III systems in subjects with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) class II and III heart failure. A total of 164 subjects with ischemic 
(60%) or idiopathic (40%) cardiomyopathy, EF<35%, NYHA Class II (24%) 
or III (76%) received a CCM pulse generator. Patients were randomly 
assigned to Group 1 (n=80, CCM treatment 3 months, sham treatment second 
3 months) or Group 2 (n=84, sham treatment 3 months, CCM treatment 
second 3 months). The co-primary endpoints were differences between 
groups of changes in peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) and Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ). 164 subjects with 
ejection fraction <35% and NYHA Class II (24%) or III (76%) symptoms 
received a CCM pulse generator. Baseline EF (29.3±0.9% vs. 29.8±1.12%), 
peak oxygen consumption (VO 2,peak, 14.1±0.3 vs. 13.6±0.3 ml/kg/min) and 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ, 38.4±2.1 
vs. 36.5±2.11) were similar in both groups. For VO2,peak and MLWHFQ, a 
statistically significant benefit was noted during periods of active treatment 
compared to sham treatment. The mean improvement in patients’ VO 2,peak 
during the periods of active treatment was 1.03  2.78 (p=0.[ADDRESS_300873]) wit h 
95% confidence interval of (0.09, 1.98).  For MLWHFQ, mean improvement 
during patients’ active treatment was 5.85  16.03 (p=0.[ADDRESS_300874]) with 
95% confidence interval of (0.59, 11.11).   
There were 6 deaths during the study, two prior to randomization (ventricular 
fibrillation and worsening heart failure), one in Group 1 during the OFF 
period (undetermined cause), one in Group 2 during the OFF period and two 
in Group 2 during the ON period (sudden cardiac death and renal failure).   
In total, there were 48 serious adverse events in 40 patients during CCM OFF 
periods, compared to 45 serious adverse events in 41 patients during CCM 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300875] frequently reported events were epi[INVESTIGATOR_247452], atrial fibrillation, bleeding at the OPTIMIZER 
System implant site and pneumonia.  There were no significant differences 
between ON and OFF phases in the number or types of adverse events.  
Adverse events specifically related to the device and/or the procedure as 
reported by [CONTACT_247537], device pocket 
infections, bleeding at the insertion site and pericardial effusion.  
Investigators listed several other events as being of “unknown” relationship 
to the device and/or procedure, including atrial fibrillation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_247453], cardiogenic shock, angina, ventricular tachycardia and 
ICD sensing defect. 
Because of the crossover design, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247454].  In all there were 14 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247455] 
1 patients (CCM ON phase) compared to 20 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247456] 2 
patients (CCM OFF phase).  In addition there was 1 death in a Group 2 
patient versus no deaths in Group 1 patients.  With the relatively small sample 
size the overall event-free survival did not reach statistical significance 
(p=0.31).   
Another safety endpoint in the study was an evaluation of whether the use of 
the OPTIMIZER Systems was associated with changes in the incidence and 
nature of arrhythmias assessed by [CONTACT_247538].  At baseline, the total 
number of PVCs/hour was balanced between groups with median (range) 
values of 21 (0-511) and 25 (0-712) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively.  During 
ON periods, there was a median of 20 (0-777) and 17 (0-459) PVCs/hour in 
Groups 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 16 (0-1007) and 15 (0-764) during 
the OFF periods.  In addition, there were no significant differences in other 
Holter parameters between baseline and follow up in either group.   
Overall, the results of this study suggested that the device improves quality 
of life and exercise tolerance and appears safe when used over 3 months time.

FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 14 of 51 On May 6, 2004, the FDA granted conditional approval for human trials to 
begin in the [LOCATION_002]. The US Feasibility Study (also referred to as the 
Phase I Study) was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 
OPTIMIZER II System with active fixation leads in subjects with moderate 
and severe heart failure.  The investigation was designed as a multi-center, 
randomized, double-blind study at 10 sites nationwide.  This was a 
randomized, double blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_247457]. Methods:  49 subjects with 
medically refractory NYHA Class III symptoms were successfully implanted 
with a CCM pulse generator and two leads inserted into the RV septum.  
Forty-nine (49) subjects were randomized to have their devices programmed 
to deliver CCM signals (Treatment, n=25) or to remain off (Control, n=24) 
for 6 months.  Evaluations (double blind) included 6-minute hall walk, 
echocardiography, cardiopulmonary stress test and Minnesota Living with 
Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ).  Results:  Although most baseline 
features were balanced between groups, ejection fraction (31.4±7.4 vs. 
24.9±6.5%, p=0.003) and peak VO 2 (16.0±2.9 vs. 14.3±2.8 ml O 2/kg/min, 
p=0.02) were lower in the Treatment group versus the Control.  Nevertheless, 
freedom from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] 6 months was 65 vs. 80% in Control vs. 
Treatment.  Freedom from death was 100% in both groups at 6-months.  
Compared to baseline, 6MW increased 13.4 meters, peak VO 2 increased 0.2 
ml O 2/kg/min and anaerobic threshold increased 0.8 ml O 2/kg/min more in 
the Treatment group than the Control group.  With the small number of 
subjects none of the differences were statistically significant.  Conclusions:  
Even though the Treatment group was sicker at baseline, event-free survival, 
adverse event profiles and measures of effectiveness trended to be better in 
the treatment group.  These results warrant large scale studies of safety and 
effectiveness of CCM.

cause mortality and all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (12.5% allowable delta).  The 
groups were matched for age (56±14 vs 59±12 yrs), EF (27±6 vs 26±7%), 
pVO 2 (14.6±3.3 vs 14.8±3.0 ml/kg/m in) and all other characteristics. While 
AT did not improve at 6 months, pVO 2 and QoL were improved by [CONTACT_247541] (by 
0.65 ml/kg/min, p=0.024 and -9.7 points, p<0.0001, respectively) over OMT. 
48% of OMT and 52%of CCM patients experienced a safety endpoint, which 
satisfied the non-in feriority criteria (p=0.03). In patients with EF≥25% (as 
determined by [CONTACT_247542]) and NYHA III (n=185), AT (0.64 ml/kg/min, 
p=0.03), pVO 2 (1.31 ml/kg/min, p=0.001) and QoL (10.8 points, p=0.003) 
improved more in the CCM group. Findings were similar at 12 months and 
results of responders analyses applied to all variables were also significant 
(p<0.01) in this group.  Furthermore, when peak VO 2 was analyzed as a 
continuous variable, it was observed that for patients with EF≥25% the 
treatment group experienced a statistically and clinically significant 
improvement over controls through 12 months, regardless of NYHA class 
(further details provided below in Statistical Analysis section).  Thus, the 
study showed that when used in patients with narrow QRS and NYHA Class 
III or IV symptoms on OMT, CCM is safe and improves pVO 2 and QoL at 6 
months. In the prespecified subgroup analysis, CCM appeared more effective 
in patients with EF≥25% as evidence by [CONTACT_247543] 2 at 
6 months, findings that were sustained through 12 months.

FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 16 of 51 Furthermore, subjects were deemed eligible and enrolled based on the site 
assessment of EF, but since each study was also assessed in an 
echocardiographic core lab,  it turned out that 38 of the study subjects (20 in 
OMT and 18 OMT+CCM) had EFs greater than 35% per core lab assessment.  
For this subgroup, the EF average was 38±3% (range 35-45%) and did not 
differ between groups.  At the 6 month endpoint, peak VO 2 increased by 
1.66+0.42 ml/kg/min in OMT+CCM v ersus a 1.30+0.73 ml/kg/min decrease  
in OMT, a difference of 2.96 mlO2/kg/min (p=0.03).  MLWHFQ decreased 
by 19±22 points in OMT+CCM v ersus 1±29 point in OMT, a mean difference 
of 18 points (p=0.06).  6MW increased by 43±80 meters in OMT+CCM 
versus a decrease  of 10±97 meters in OMT, a mean difference of 53 meters 
(p=0.11).  The results of this additional hypothesis generating subgroup 
analysis indicate that CCM has the potential to provide clinically significant 
benefits in patients with medically refractory CHF with EF between 35 and 
45%.   
In aggregate, the results of prior studies suggest that the OPTIMIZER System 
functions as intended and preliminary evidence suggests that CCM therapy 
could provide clinical benefit especially in a subset of subjects with ejection 
fraction ≥25% .   
C. Summary of the known and potential risks and benefits, if any, to human subjects 
1. Known Potential Risks 
The results of bench testing, from preclinical studies using prototype devices in 
animals and from preliminary clinical studies suggest that acute applications of 
CCM signals present no undue risk to subjects.  However, there are recognized 
risks associated with the heart failure state itself, with interventional 
cardiovascular procedures in heart failure patients and potentially with the use of 
the OPTIMIZER system. 
a. Death 
Class III and IV heart failure patients are at risk for death from their 
underlying disease, with annual mortality rates ranging from ~20% for 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -009 
FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 17 of 51 Class III patients to as high as ~75% for Class IV patients.  With any 
invasive cardiovascular procedure in heart failure patients there may be 
added risk of death. Invasive aspects and the associated risks of 
the OPTIMIZER implant procedure and device system are described 
below. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of death associated 
with the application of cardiac contractility modulation therapy. Applying 
appropriate subject selection criteria, using meticulous techniques and 
providing attentive post-procedure care will minimize the risks associated 
with these procedures. 
b. Risks of implantation of the OPTIMIZER pulse generator 
The risks associated with implantation of the OPTIMIZER pulse generator 
are similar to those of implanting a permanent pacemaker, which are well 
characterized and include (but are not limited to) infection, bleeding, 
pneumothorax, myocardial perforation by [CONTACT_247544].  Applying appropriate subject selection criteria, using 
meticulous surgical technique and providing careful post-operative care 
will minimize the risks associated with these procedures. 
c. Arrhythmias and/or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_247459] a result of CCM signal application.  
Arrhythmias may include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias as well 
as ventricular arrhythmias or supraventricular arrhythmias and may be 
associated with palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].  These may include sinus bradycardia, 
complete heart block, junctional rhythm, asystole, sinus tachycardia, atrial 
fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial 
tachycardia, premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular 
contractions, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia, 
ventricular fibrillation, electromechanical dissociation, or cardiac arrest.  
Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_247460].  Safety algorithms intended to 
minimize the incidence of arrhythmias have been incorporated into the 
OPTIMIZER System.   
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300877]-implantation infection is minimized by 
[CONTACT_247545].  
Infectious complications may include localized infections (infections of 
the device pocket, femoral cannulation sites, cellulitis, pneumonia, etc) 
and sepsis.  
f. Thromboembolic Events 
Thrombosis or embolism may occur as a result of the placement of the 
leads for the OPTIMIZER System or as a result of the underlying disease.  
These events may include deep vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, and 
mesenteric thrombosis.  Since there is only one additional lead compared 
to a normal dual chamber pacemaker, the added risk is considered to be 
not clinically significant. 
g. Right or Left Bundle Branch Block 
Insertion of pacemaker leads on the right ventricular septum can 
occasionally cause transient interruption of the specialized conduction 
system of the heart, which can lead to bundle branch block.     
h. Worsened heart failure 
CCM signal application is intended to improve the strength of the heart 
beat and lessen symptoms of heart failure.  However, if signal application 
is ineffective, the subject may experience the typi[INVESTIGATOR_247461], including shortness of 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300878] or on exertion, fluid accumulation and pleural effusion, 
cardiogenic shock, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (possibly with the need for 
mechanical ventilation) or may require alteration of medication doses. 
i. Risk of Myocardial Perforation 
There is a risk of right ventricular perforation with insertion of any 
pacemaker lead.  If this happened it could result in fluid (including blood) 
accumulation around the heart (as in a pericardial effusion) that could 
compromise ventricular function or even cardiac tamponade.  This risk 
can be minimized by [CONTACT_247546], standard insertion techniques by 
[CONTACT_247547]. 
j. Vascular laceration and bleeding 
There is a risk of vascular laceration and bleeding as a result of the implant 
procedure.  Th is may include bleeding in the pulse generator pocket.  This 
risk can be minimized by [CONTACT_247548]. 
k. Chest wall sensation, phrenic or device pocket stimulation 
CCM signals may cause chest wall sensation or phrenic stimulation.  
When these have occurred, they have generally been short –lived and have 
been resolved by [CONTACT_247549].  Occasionally an invasive 
procedure may be required to reposition the leads. 
l. Neurologic events 
In addition to the risks discussed above, patients with heart failure are at 
risk for risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and stroke.   
m. Potential for OPTIMIZER – ICD/Pacemaker interactions 
 It is possible that the presence of CCM pulses could be sensed by [CONTACT_247550].  In such 
a case, an inappropriate ICD shock could be delivered.  Similarly, if a 
pacemaker inappropriately sensed a CCM pulse for a cardiac 
depolarization, the pacemaker could be inhibited from delivering 
treatment during a bradycardia (such as a sinus bradycardia).  Device 
interaction testing has indicated that these do not occur when true bipolar 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -009 
FIX- HF-5C 
 Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 20 of 51 ICD leads are used and when both devices are programmed properly.  To 
minimize this risk, all personnel involved with programming the 
OPTIMIZER device are appropriately trained in proper device 
programming. 
n. Surgical revision of the OPTIMIZER System 
There is a potential that any system component could malfunction, 
become damaged, infected, or, in the case of the leads, become dislodged.  
System component malfunction or other clinical circumstances (eg, 
sepsis) may require noninvasive corrective actions or possibly even a 
surgical revision (repositioning, replacement, or removal) of the 
malfunctioning component(s).   
o. General Medical  
Patients with heart failure may experience adverse events related to their 
underlying disease and such may be encountered during the course of the 
study.  These may include hypotension, dizziness, syncope, worsening 
renal function, worsening liver failure, anemia, etc.  
2. Known Potential Benefits 
a. CCM signal application 
Based upon available evidence from preclinical laboratory animal studies 
and preliminary clinical safety studies, application of non-excitatory 
electrical CCM signals to the heart muscle during the absolute refractory 
period can increase the strength of th e heart’s contraction.  Subjects 
receiving CCM signal application may experience improved exercise 
tolerance, fewer symptoms of heart failure and increased overall quality 
of life.   
b. Medical Management 
Subjects will receive a significant amount of attention from medical 
professionals during the course of this investigation.  They will be 
undergoing cardiac evaluations at frequent intervals.  Extra attention will 
be devoted to ensuring that subjects are receiving the proper types and 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300879] a specified duration and amplitude (voltage), which have been 
determined in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies.  The maximal voltage (7.5V) is 
delivered unless the subject experiences a side effect (e.g., muscular stimulation, 
sensation), in which case the voltage may be decreased.   
The “dose” of CCM si gnals is determined primarily by [CONTACT_247551].  Results of the chronic safety and performance study that took 
place in the European Union (described above) suggest that three hours of CCM signal 
application results in clinical benefit in a majority of subjects.  Several subjects initially 
involved in that study were followed at an increased dose (7 hours of CCM signal per 
day).  The results of that study suggested no increase in risk and potentially mild 
improvements over the 3 hour per day regimen.  Phase I and Phase II of the FIX-HF -5 
studies utilized an intermediate dose of 5 hour/day signal delivery paradigm.  Since the 
safety profile during Phase I and Phase II of the study has been clinically acceptable and 
for consistency, the present study shall continue to use the 5 hour/day dose.   
 
E. Statement that the trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and 
the applicable regulatory requirements 
This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and other 
region-specific applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
F. Description of the population to be studied 
The patients for whom the OPTIMIZER  System is indicated are those with reduced 
ventricular function and symptomatic heart failure.  Subjects entered into this 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300880] likely to benefit from 
application of CCM signals.   The population is generally characterized by [CONTACT_247552], an ejection fraction between 25 and 45% (inclusive) and peak VO 2 
between 9 and 20 ml O2/kg/min.   
 
G. References to literature and data that are relevant to the trial and that provide 
background for the trial 
Pacemaker implantation has been well characterized and is the standard of care for 
treatment of certain types of cardiac rhythm disorders.  The literature related to this 
therapy is voluminous and readily available.  References specific to CCM signal 
application are listed in Appendix A.  Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is 
applicable to heart failure patients with conduction abnormalities manifested as an 
increased QRS duration on the body surface electrocardiogram.  The clinical studies in 
which CRT has been evaluated have provided important information for how to conduct 
studies of CCM signal application and are therefore relevant to the present investigation.  
 
III. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of th e 
OPTIMIZER System with active fixation leads in subjects with medically refractory 
moderate- to-severe heart failure characterized by [CONTACT_247553] 25% and 
45% and peak VO 2 between 9 and 20 ml O 2/kg/min.  Safety and effectiveness endpoints 
are provided in Section IV below.

C. Anticipated Rate of Site and Patient Recruitment 
Two hundred and thirty (230) study participants will be recruited from a maximum of 60 
study sites over a period of approximately 2 years from study initiation.   No site will be 
allowed to enroll more than 15% (35 subjects) into the study. 
 
D. Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
An independent DSMB shall be established to review results and adverse events in order 
to provide unbiased oversight of the study.  The DSMB shall be composed of independent 
physicians and statisticians not otherwise affiliated with the study.  The sponsor shall 
work with the DSMB to develop a set of standard operating procedures which shall 
include the timing and format of regularly scheduled meetings, the format in which data 
shall be submitted by [CONTACT_51557].     
 
E. Event Adjudication Committee (EAC) 
 An EAC shall be established.  The EAC will be responsible for the review, adjudication 
and validation of all reported SAEs that occur over the course of the study and the 
subsequent classification of these events.   The classification shall include whether the 
event is related to either the OPTIMIZER device or to the OPTIMIZER procedure, and 
whether such an event constitutes a “complication”  as defined by [CONTACT_247559].  The committee shall also adjudicate the cardiac relatedness of deaths and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  The EAC shall be composed of independent physicians not otherwise 
affiliated with the study.  The committee will determine a schedule for meeting times 
based on the expected rate of subject accrual.

[LOCATION_002] and in Europe.  A minimum of 115 subjects will be enrolled in the 
US; it is anticipated that approximately 30-50% of the subjects will be recruited 
from European sites.   
3. Randomization 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups with an 
allocation ratio of 1:1.  Block randomization by [CONTACT_51558] 
(ischemic versus non-ischemic cardiomyopathy) will be used to ensure balanced 
enrollment between the two groups. 
4. Objective Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoints of this study are chosen to provide as objective, 
reliable and practical as possible assessments of clinical and physiologic 
improvements.  With regard to the physiologic assessment, peak VO [ADDRESS_300885] complete 2 baseline CPX 
tests. If the blinded core lab deems one of the two tests “inadequate”, the data 
from the one “adequate” test shall be used for eligibility determination and

2.    Randomized subjects are required to complete two CPX tests at [ADDRESS_300886] refuses or is unable to complete 
one of the two tests, or if the core lab deems one of the two tests “inadequate”,  
the data from the one “adequate” test shall be used for the final analysis.  In 
cases where data from both tests are available, the values will be averaged and 
the resulting value will be used for data analysis.

Study ID CP OPT2009 -[ADDRESS_300887] operating procedures (SOPs) for the core laborator y are 
established in collaboration between the Sponsor and each core lab director.  
5. Subject accountability 
Every effort will be made to follow all subjects of each cohort to assure as 
complete a data set as possible.  
 
G. A description of study treatments, the dosage and the dosage regimen of the 
investigational product. 
1. Study treatment 
The trial treatment will consist of the application of non-excitatory cardiac 
contractility modulating (CCM) electrical signals to the heart muscle.  
2. Description of dosage  
CCM signals resemble pacing signals in that they are characterized by a delay, 
duration and amplitude. Compared to pacing signals, CCM signals are 
multiphasic, are of wider pulse duration and are higher in amplitude.  In this study, 
the signals will consist of two biphasic pulses ~10 ms in duration (total duration 
~20 ms) with amplitude of ~ 7.5 V.   
3. Dosage Regimen 
In addition to optimal medical therapy, one group of subjects (Treatment Group) 
shall receive five non-contiguous one-hour periods of CCM signal application per 
day for the 24 weeks of the study, with a schedule of one hour ON and three hour s 
48 minutes OFF.

continue to receive optimal medical therapy (Control Group).    
4. Description of packaging and labeling 
The OPTIMIZER System hardware will be labeled, packaged and shipped in a 
manner that identifies the System as an investigational device for clinical 
investigation only (US requirement only), and that protects the device under 
normal conditions of shippi[INVESTIGATOR_51497].  The leads will retain their 
commercial packaging and labeling. 
 
H. Expected duration of subject participation 
The duration of each subject’s participation in the main portion of the study is expected 
to be approximately 7 months.  This will include approximately one month for screening 
and baseline testing and a 24 week primary follow-up period.  Following completion of 
the main portion of the study :  
 Subjects with an OPTIMIZER device in the US shall continue to be followed 
clinically at 6 month intervals until the FDA has made a determination about the 
safety and efficacy of the device.   
 All other subjects (US Control group and all non-US subjects) shall be followed 
for vital status only, every 6 months, until the 2 year vital status has been 
determined.  
The sequence and duration of trial periods are described in Table 1 .

1. It is desired to deliver CCM signals for ≥70% of the time;  
2. CCM signals are suppressed for 3 beats following a PVC.  Therefore, if there is one PVC every 13 beats there will be 9 CCM 
signals delivered (no CCM on the PVC and no CCM for 3 additional NSR beats);  
3. If the average HR is 85, there are 115,200 beats/day.   
4. If 1/13 of these are PVCs, that equals an estimated 8861 beats/24 hours.  The actual percent of CCM signal delivery will depend 
on whether PVCs occur as singlets, doublets, runs, etc.

should be programmed to its non-therapy delivering mode and the 
OPTIMIZER System should be activated to deliver CCM signals.  The 
physician then accesses the marker channels of the ICD/pacemaker to 
check if double counting is present.  If so, the physician should modify the 
ICD/pacemaker parameters (e.g., increase the blanking period) until 
double counting is no longer evident.

VIII.   Assessment of safety 
A. Specification of safety parameters 
The safety of the OPTIMIZER System will be assessed by [CONTACT_247567] (see section IX for statistical 
analysis).  The primary safety endpoint shall be the proportion of subjects without 
experiencing either an OPTIMIZER device-related complication or a procedure-related 
complication by 24 weeks.  The safety endpoint will considered to be met if the 
proportion of complication-free subjects is significantly larger than 70% (one-sided 
significance level of 0.025); equivalently, the safety endpoint will be met if the lower 
bound for the 95% confidence interval of the percent of subjects surviving without 
experiencing a primary safety event is not less than 70%.

dverse events shall also be carefully recorded and compared between treatment and 
control groups.   
An adverse event is defined as any undesirable change from the subjec t’s baseline and 
usual health status (prior to their enrollment into the study) whether or not it is device or 
procedure related.  An adverse event includes device failures that adversely affect the 
subject and/or require an intervention to correct the failure.  
B. Serious, Device Related and Unanticipated Adverse Event Definitions.
Adverse events that occur during this study may be associated with the OPTIMIZER
implant procedure, or specifically associated with the use of the OPTIMIZER device.  An
adverse event will be considered to be device-related when, in the judgment of the
Principal Investigator, there is a logical connection between the use of the device and the
occurrence of the event, above and beyond the study procedure itself.
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-
threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247467], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a
congenital anomaly/birth defect.
An unanticipated adverse device event (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse effect
on the health or safety of a subject or any life-threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_247568], if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
For purposes of the primary safety analysis, an OPTIMIZER device or OPTIMIZER
implantation procedure-related complication shall be any serious adverse event that is
related to the device or the procedure as classified by [CONTACT_247569].
C. Procedures for recording and reporting adverse events and intercurrent illnesses
The Investigator shall report all adverse events to Impulse Dynamics and to the reviewing
IRB or Ethics Committee (EC) (as/if required according to IRB or EC policy).  All device
malfunctions and serious adverse events, including, but not limited to events associated

IX. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed description of the statistical methods, sample size justifications and 
justifications for safety and efficacy parameters are provided separately in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  Important features of the SAP are reviewed below. 
A.   Description of the statistical methods to be employed and justification of sample size 
1. Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis will compare differences in the change in peak VO 2 
from baseline to 24 week follow-up visit between the Treatment and Control 
groups.  An intent- to-treat analysis based on a Generalized Mixed-Effects Model 
will constitute the primary analysis as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
The general statistical hypothesis to be tested is: 
 
H0: βint ≤ 0  vs  H A: βint > 0

represents the difference in mean change in peak VO 2 24-weeks  from baseline in 
the treatment vs. control groups.  As will be detailed in the next section, a 
Bayesian approach will be e mployed to take advantage of the significant amount 
of data available from the orig inal FIX -HF-5 study.  Superiority of the treatment 
arm will be declared if the posterior probability that the mean change from 
baseline to 24-weeks  in peak VO 2 in the prospective trial is higher in the treatment 
group (i.e., βint>0) is 97.5% or higher, conditioned on the prospective data and the 
original FIX-HF-5 data . 
Hierarchical Bayesian Design for Borrowing Data from the Original FIX-HF -
5 Study for the Primary Efficacy Analysis 
As noted above, the original FIX-HF -5 study did not meet the primary 
effectiveness endpoint of showing superiority of probability of response for the 
treatment group compared to the control group (average ITT imputation result of 
38/215 = 17.7% Treatment responder versus 28/213 = 13.2% Control responder).   
However, in the subgroup of subjects with EF ≥ 25 subjects (which is the focus  
of the present study), a statistically significant increase in peak VO 2 was observed 
in Treatment versus Control.   
FDA released the document “ Guidance for the Use of Bayesian Statistics in 
Medical Device Clinical T rials” on February 5, 2010.  This document explicitly 
allows sponsors to employ Bayesian designs in proposals to FDA, but lays out 
some important guidelines that must be satisfied.  In particular, a Bayesian design 
must avoid putting strong priors on favorable outcomes as this will inflate type I 
error far above acceptable levels.  In fact, Bayesian designs are required by [CONTACT_247570]; usually this means requiring that the probability 
of a type I error will be kept very low.  In order to be able to incorporate favorable 
prior information and yet not inflate type I error, the statistical model must be able 
to borrow in a flexible manner so that more borrowing is done when results for 
the prospective study are consistent with the favorable prior information but

the null hypothesis.  Hierarchical models are a natural approach to achieving this 
flexible borrowing strategy.   
Statistical Model Used for Effectiveness 
For a Bayesian design in this setting, we regarded the original study as having 
generated normally distributed longitudinal data in the 2 subgroups defined by [CONTACT_51634] 
≥25 or <25.  The current study will  only enroll subjects in the EF ≥25 subgroup.  
If the favorable subgroup result holds up, then a fair amount of borrowing from 
this favorable subgroup should occur (but less than just pooling the prior and 
prospective subgroup data).  If, on the other hand, the favorable subgroup is not 
confirmed than more borrowing will occur from the non-favorable subgroups in 
the previous study.  The model used to achieve this is a hierarchical model 
consistent with one presented in Pennello & Thompson (Pennello G, Thompson 
L. Experience with reviewing Bayesian Medical Device Trials. J Biopharm 
Statistics. 2008;18:81 –115).  A detailed model description appears in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  Inference for this model centers around the difference 
in mean changes in peak VO 2 between the treatment arm and control arm in the 
prospective data set conditional on all of the data both for the prior study (both 
subgroups) and prospective study (focused only on the single subgroup), and it 
will be required that the posterior probability of superiority be 97.5% or higher.  
The design simultaneously gives incremental power above and beyond that of a 
standalone analysis while preserving the low (5%) type I error of a standalone 
analysis.   
Power, Type I Error Tables for Effectiveness and Sample Size 
Operating characteristics for the Bayesian design are determined by [CONTACT_80729] a 
large number of possible data sets for a variety of true values of the model 
parameters and then determining the associated posterior inference via Markov 
chain Monte Carlo methods (Lunn D J, Thomas A, Best N and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_192636] D

Statistical Software 2005;12:1 –16).     
The type I error of the design is approximately 5%.  More than adequate (86% or 
better) is ensured if the true interaction term (i.e. difference in mean change from 
baseline to 24 weeks for treatment vs. control arms) is at least 75% of that 
observed in the subgroup in the original study. Further details will be provided in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan 
  2. Primary Safety Analysis 
The primary safety analysis shall evaluate the procedure- or device-related 
complication rates through 24-weeks of follow up.  The statistical null hypothesis 
shall be that the proportion of patients in the treatment group without experiencing 
a primary safety event is less than 70%, and the alternative hypothesis shall be 
that the proportion is more than 70%.  This lower limit of 70% was chosen to be 
the same criterion used in several prior studies of CRT (PMAs P010012 : Contak 
CD CRT D, P030005 : Contak Renewal TR, P030035 : St. Jude Frontier, and 
P010012/S37 : Contak Renewal 3AVT).  Satisfying the primary safety endpoint 
will require rejecting the null hypothesis at a one-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_300918] 95% confidence interval is above 70%.  It is noteworthy that 
point estimate of freedom from this composite endpoint at 24 -weeks among 
subjects in the subgroup EF≥25% was 88%.   
3.  Other efficacy analyses 
Other efficacy analyses that will be analyzed in a hierarchical statistical method 
and will include: 
a. MLWHFQ: Results will be analyzed both as a comparison between groups 
of the changes from baseline and as a responders analysis with a 10 point 
reduction in MLWHFQ considered as a “responder”.  
b. Between group differences in changes in mean peak VO 2 with RER 
included as a covariate in the analysis.

clinicians.  Results will be analyzed both as a comparison between groups 
of the changes from baseline and as a responders analysis with a 1 class 
reduction in NYHA considered as a “responder”.  
d. An analysis of between group differences in changes in peak VO 2 that only 
includes tests whose RER is ≥1.05.  
These analyses will be conducted on both the prospective data alone and on the 
prospective data pooled with the data from the original FIX-HF -[ADDRESS_300919] (EF ≥25). Pooled models will include a study indicator to 
adjust for differences in overall success rate between studies.  Analysis from the 
pooled data will constitute the analysis upon which success will be determined.  
Since, with regard to efficacy, there are multiple hypotheses to be tested, the 
method of alpha control is the closed form hierarchical method.  Thus in order to 
test endpoints beyond the primary endpoint, the primary endpoint must attain a 
posterior probability of superiority that exceeds the nominal value.  This 
hierarchical approach does not result in additional inflation of the type I error rate. 
The two other efficacy parameters to be tested (changes in [ADDRESS_300920] 
and VE/VCO 2) will not be included in the hierarchical statistical analysis 
described above.

and will include all subjects randomized, regardless of whether the subject withdrew prior 
to study completion.  The main reason for withdrawal is anticipated to be a voluntary 
decision made by [CONTACT_247571].  A Generalized Mixed-Effects

INFORMED CONSENT 
 
Introduction 
Your doctor has explained to you that your heart strength is decreased and this may be causing 
you to experience tiredness and shortness of breath.  This condition, called heart failure,  is usually 
treated with medications to improve the strength of the heart muscle and reduce the amount of 
work the heart has to do.  However, medications are not always successful in making heart failure 
patients feel better.  An experimental medical device has been developed to improve heart strength 
using electrical signals applied to the heart.  The experimental medical device is called the 
OPTIMIZER System.  The experimental treatment delivered by [CONTACT_247586] 
(CCM) treatment.  
Research 
You are being asked to consider voluntary participation in a research study of the CCM treatment 
with the OPTIMIZER System sponsored by [CONTACT_51594] ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  The purpose of 
the study is to determine whether the CCM treatment improves the way you feel.  We would like 
to give you all the information necessary to help you make an informed decision about 
participating in this research study.  Before you give your consent, please read the following 
information carefully.  The information given here is not intended to be a substitute for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_247473], who will answer all your questions about this study. 
Expected Duration of Study Participation 
Your participation in this study is dependent on your randomization assignment described later in 
this informed consent form. You will be expected to come in for study assessments and procedures 
for approximately 7  months.  This will include approximately one month for screening and 

Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009-[ADDRESS_300955] therapy, you will be contact[CONTACT_247587] 6 month intervals 
to check on your health status for up to 2 years following the start of your study participation.  
Study Procedures  
Certain medical tests and assessments will be performed to determine if you are eligible to 
participate in this study. These tests and assessments include:  
 a physical examination  
 an evaluation of your medications  
 an evaluation of your medical history including all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247474] 
 an assessment of your current heart failure symptoms 
 an electrocardiogram (to check the electrical activity in your heart) 
 an echocardiogram (to check the strength of your heart) 
 a questionnaire that asks you about your heart failure symptoms 
 a 24-hour Holter monitor test (a tape recording of your heart rhythm over the course of an 
entire day) 
 two different types of stress tests. The first test is to see how far you can walk on flat ground 
for [ADDRESS_300956] will be done within 7 days of 
scheduled implant to make sure that you are not pregnant; in addition, you must agree not to 
become pregnant as long as you are in this study.  Women of childbearing potential must be using 
a medically approved method of birth control such as an IUD, surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, 
tubal ligation), or must be post-menopausal for at least one year.  
In some cases, your doctor may be able to use an echocardiogram, 24-hour Holter, or 
electrocardiogram performed within 30 days prior to your consent to enroll in this study.  
Many patients with heart failure develop a need for a device called an implantable cardiac 
defibrillator (ICD) and/or a pacemaker.   If your doctor believes that you have a n eed for an ICD 
or pacemaker, this may be offer to you at this time.

Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 3 of 11 If the results of these tests indicate that you are eligible to participate, you will be randomly 
assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of two groups: either a group that receives an OPTIMIZER 
System or a Control group that does not receive the OPTIMIZER System.  Regardless of which 
group you are in, you will continue to be followed closely to ensure that you are receiving optimal 
medical therapy for your heart failure.   
If you are randomized to receive the OPTIMIZER System , you may require additional testing 
in accordance with the procedures followed by [CONTACT_106954]. These tests may include blood 
testing, urinalysis, and a chest x-ray.  These procedures vary at each institution, so your doctor will 
discuss them with you.   
The implantation will be done either in an operating room or in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, 
depending upon the normal practices for implanting heart devices at your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The 
implantation is performed under sterile conditions on an exam table and an intravenous (IV) line 
is put into your arm. The IV delivers fluids and medication during the procedure. The medication 
will make you relaxed and drowsy but you will remain awake.  
The implant includes three electrical wires (leads) that connect the main component of the 
OPTIMIZER System, the implantable pulse generator (IPG) to your heart through the veins inside 
your chest, very similar to procedures used when implanting a pacemaker device.  The IPG is 
generally implanted under your skin in the shoulder area and contains a battery and components 
that deliver CCM therapy sealed inside. The leads are used to record the normal electrical signals 
generated by [CONTACT_247588].  The skin is numbed prior 
to making an incision, and the leads are inserted and steered through the blood vessels into your 
heart while the doctor views them with moving x-rays.  
Tests will be performed to ensure that the OPTIMIZER System and if you have one, the ICD 
System, are functioning properly.  This test may require your doctor to make your heart beat 
quickly to see if your ICD will sense and properly treat that condition. 
If you also have an ICD or pacemaker, your doctor will perform tests to make sure that the devices 
do not interfere with each other.  This could include a standard test used to confirm proper ICD 
function during which your heart is stimulated to beat abnormally (ventricular tachycardia or 
fibrillation ).   
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
Study ID CP OPT2009-[ADDRESS_300957] X-ray and the OPTIMIZER System will be 
turned on.  The OPTIMIZER System has a rechargeable battery, meaning that it can remain active 
for many years without having to be replaced.  During normal use, the battery needs to be 
recharged every week for approximately 90 minutes.  The energy for recharging is delivered 
through your skin by a device that you position over your collar bone.  No wires or needles are 
required for this process.  You will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], typi[INVESTIGATOR_247475].   
If you are randomized to the Control group, you will continue to receive optimal medical 
therapy and you shall receive the same study related assessments as detailed below.   
All subjects follow-up  (Optimizer group and Control group) , will be asked to return to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247476] a medical history review.  If you have

Risks Associated with the OPTIMIZER System Implant and CCM Treatment 
The risks associated with implanting the OPTIMIZER System (which includes implantation of the 
pulse generator and the leads that connect the generator to your heart) and applying CCM treatment 
include: 
 injury to the heart or blood vessels 
 bleeding 
 irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias, including abnormally slow or fast heart beats) 
 damage to the heart muscle 
 damage to the tricuspid valve, potentially resulting in tricuspid valve regurgitation 
 damage to specialized tissue in the heart responsible for initiating each heart beat (i.e., the 
heart’s c onduction system ) 
 transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke 
 formation of blood clots 
 chest wall sensations 
 pain at the incision site 
 infection 
 collapsed lung 
 a hole in the heart from the leads 
 lead dislodgement 
 fluid or blood accumulation around the heart 
 death 
 
Risks Associated with the Use of Local Anesthesia 
Risks associated with the use of local anesthesia used during the OPTIMIZER System implantation 
procedure are as follows: 
 puncture of a vein 
 localized pain at or around injection site 
 numbness at or around injection site 
 bruising

FIX- HF-5C 
Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 6 of 11 Risks associated with possible ICD and/or pacemaker device interactions 
If you have an ICD, it is possible that the CCM pulses delivered by [CONTACT_247589] a fast heart beat (ventricular tachycardia).  If this 
should happen, the ICD may send an unnecessary shock to your heart.  Studies in animals have 
not found this to be a problem when the ICD and the OPTIMIZER System are programmed 
correctly.  Also, it is possible that the OPTIMIZER will cause the ICD to fail to deliver treatment 
for a life threatening arrhythmia. However, the OPTIMIZER device is designed to minimize this 
possibility and prior testing and experience in patients suggests this is unlikely to occur . 
Additionally, all personnel involved with programming the OPTIMIZER System have been 
trained on device programming and device interaction testing. 
If you have a cardiac pacemaker it is possible that the CCM pulses delivered by [CONTACT_247590] a regular heartbeat.  If this 
should happen, the pacemaker might not send pacing signals to your heart at a rate needed by [CONTACT_247591], and could result in an abnormally slow or unsteady heart rhythm (bradycardia).  Symptoms 
of bradycardia result from a lack of oxygen enriched blood being delivered to your body and 
include dizziness, fainting, extreme fatigue and shortness of breath.   
Many of the risks associated with the implantation of the OPTIMIZER System are minimized by 
[CONTACT_51598], through the use of 
meticulous care during the implantation procedure and by [CONTACT_247592].  However, if you visit any other physician or medical 
center that needs to reprogram either of your implantable devices, please ensure that they are aware 
of possible interaction between the devices. 
 
Risks associated with possible interaction between the ICD and OPTIMIZER charg er  
 
If in addition to the OPTIMIZER device, you also have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator 
(ICD), there is the possibility that the ICD may inappropriately deliver therapy (shocks) if you 
place the charger wand over the ICD.  Please make sure that you place the charging wand only 
over the OPTIMIZER implant site.

FIX- HF-5C 
Protocol version September 25, 2015  Page 7 of 11 Risk of an OPTIMIZER System Surgical Revision  
There is a potential that any system component could malfunction, become damaged, infected, or, 
in the case of the leads, become dislodged.  Malfunctions of system parts or other clinical 
circumstances (e.g., sepsis) may require corrective actions or possibly even surgical repair 
(repositioning, replacement, or removal) of the part or parts that are not working properly.   
Unknown Risks 
Because the OPTIMZER System is an experimental device, the application of CCM treatment to 
your heart may involve risks that are currently unknown.  If you receive the OPTIMIZER System, 
you will be notified of any additional risks that become known during the study that may affect 
your decision of whether to continue in the study. 
 
Foreseeable Risks Associated with Study Participation for All Study Subjects 
There is a risk for all subjects enrolled in this study, whether you receive an OPTIMIZER System 
or not, that your heart failure signs and symptoms may become worse.  Heart failure signs and 
symptoms include the following :  
 stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) 
 heart attack 
 dizziness or lightheadedness 
 palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] 
 increased fatigue/weakness 
 shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
 fluid retention in the lungs 
 severe swelling of the legs, feet and ankles 
 abnormal heart rhythms (too fast or too slow) 
There is also a risk of death associated with many of the signs and symptoms listed above.  
 
Reasonably Expected Benefits to You and to Others 
Your heart failure symptoms may improve as a result of receiving CCM treatment and this may 
help you exercise more or feel better.  The study will determine the degree to which these benefits 
occur.  If researchers determine that there are benefits, then your participation in this research

Study ID CP OPT2009-[ADDRESS_300966] a concomitant device (e.g., ICD, pacemaker) will undergo additional testing at the end 
of the implant procedure to ensure appropriate function of both the OPTIMIZER System and the 
concomitant device. The following steps summarize the required testing: 
1. Program the ICD so that it does not deliver antitachycardic therapy during this test. 
2. Program the sensing windows of the OPTIMIZER and ensure that the OPTIMIZER System can be 
programmed to consistently delivery CCM therapy in the presence of the concomitant device. 
3. Activate CCM therapy and evaluate the real-time intracardiac electrograms and marker channels to 
ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate oversensing during normal sinus rhythm that 
cannot be resolved through reprogramming or lead repositioning.  
4. Activate CCM therapy and evaluate the real-time intracardiac electrograms and marker channels to 
ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate undersensing during normal sinus rhythm 
that cannot be resolved through reprogramming or lead repositioning. 
5. While CCM therapy is being delivered, ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate 
inhibition of bradycardia pacing. In patients that require bradycardia pacing, activate CCM therapy 
during pacing and evaluate the real-time intracardiac electrograms and marker channels to ensure 
that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate inhibition of bradycardia pacing therapy that cannot 
be resolved through reprogramming or lead repositioning. 
6. Program the ICD to detect and convert an induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Program the 
OPTIMIZER to deliver continuous CCM therapy. While CCM therapy is being delivered, induce 
VT/VF and ensure that the implanted ICD can appropriately detect the ventricular tachyarrhythmia.  
Ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate undersensing during VT/VF that cannot be 
resolved through reprogramming or lead repositioning.

Follow-up of Subjects enrolled during the FIX- HF-5B Protocol 
Background 
FDA approved the FIX- HF-5B Confirmatory Study protocol in 2010 for the enrollment of 230 subjects 
at 30 US sites. The study was designed to prospectively evaluate CCM therapy in a subgroup of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3859] (NYHA 3 and LVEF 25-35%) with the OPTIMIZER III System. A FIX- HF-5B protocol revision, 
version July 29, 2011 (G030099/S084), was approved by [CONTACT_243914] 2011 that included an 
expanded LVEF criterion of 25-45%. 
Enrollment into the FIX- HF-5B Confirmatory Study started with the first subject consent on February 22, 
2011. A total of 17 subjects were randomized from 2011-2012 ; 11 to the OPTIMIZER group and 6 to the 
Control group . The FIX- HF-5C Confirmatory Study enrollment began in 2013 with the next generation 
device, the OPTIMIZER IVs System.   
Study Follow-up Procedures 
Subjects enrolled into the FIX- HF-5B protocol shall continue follow-up per the current (FIX- HF-5C) 
protocol.  The FIX- HF-5C protocol is a revision of the FIX- HF-5B protocol, with the study number 
change made primarily to delineate the difference in the index device implanted at the time . All FIX- HF-
5B subjects are in the post-study follow-up phase and being seen every 3 months for a history and device 
interrogation.  
OPTIMIZER III IPG Replacement: 
FIX- HF-5B subjects requiring an exchange of the ir OPTIMIZER III implantable pulse generator (IPG) 
may receive the OPTIMIZER IVs IPG.  
Consent Materials: 
All FIX- HF-5B subjects have signed the current IRB-approved consent form for the FIX- HF-5B study. 
A template informed consent addendum is attached and should be provided to all FIX- HF-5B subjects 
currently in active follow-up.

Dear OPTIMIZER Study Research Participant: 
You are currently taking part in the above-named research study. Before beginning this research 
study, you signed an Informed Consent that fully described the study and your rights as a research 
participant. The purpose of this Informed Consent Addendum is to provide you with new 
information about the study. Though the initial phase of the research study is completed, minimal 
data continues to be collected at approximately 3-month intervals primarily to determine if your 
OPTIMIZER device is functioning appropriately.   
We are writing to inform you that routinely scheduled visits will now take place approximately 
every 6-months, unless your doctor decides more frequent visits are necessary. You should still 
contact [CONTACT_247597] a problem with your device or you do not feel 
well.   You are reminded to continue charging your OPTIMIZER device on a weekly basis.  
Failure to keep your device battery charged may cause permanent damage to the battery. 
We also want to let you know that if you ever need the OPTIMIZER device replaced, you will 
be offered the most current version of the device called the OPTIMIZER IVs System, which is 
the next generation of the device you currently have.  The OPTIMIZER IVs device is very similar 
to your current device but is smaller and thinner and uses a smaller more portable charger.  If 
you do not wish to have the newer OPTIMIZER IVs implanted, the OPTIMIZER III IPG will be 
turned off, if it hasn’t been already,  and if you wish, the device may be removed.

1.1 Introduction 
   
Clinical evidence to support approval of this PMA (M150003) is derived from FIX -HF-5  
series of studies , including: the Phase I FIX -HF-5 Feasibility trial; the Phase II FIX -HF-5 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]; and the FIX -HF-5C Confirmatory trial.    
 
The Feasibility trial (FIX -HF-5, Phase I) examin ed the OPTIMIZER  II System in patients with 
NYHA Class III or IV heart failure and a normal QRS duration. The results provided 
preliminary evidence of device safety and efficacy, which led to the conduct of the Phase II FIX-HF-5 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076].   
 
The Phase II FIX -HF-5 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_247481] a prospective, randomized study that included 428 
heart failure patients with NYHA functional class III-IV symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_247482] (OMT ), ejection fractions (EF) <35% (or up to 45% per echo core lab reading) and 
QRS duration <130 ms.  Patients were randomized 1:1 to either continue to receive OMT or received OMT plus CCM ™ treatment delivered by [CONTACT_247598].   
 
The primary eff ectiveness endpoint of the FIX-HF-5 study was v entilatory anaerobic threshold 
(VAT) evaluated by a b linded core lab and assessed by a responder ’s analysis.   Comparisons 
between treatment and control in peak VO 2 and quality of life were statistically signif icant   (p 
value 0.024 and <0.0001, respectively).  More importantly, a post hoc sub -group analysis of 
patients with EF > 25% showed significantly greater effect  between the treatment and control 
groups for peak VO 2 and quality of life than in the cohort as a whole.  
 After consultation with FDA, Impulse Dynamics conducted an additional confirmatory study (FIX -HF-5C) with peak VO
2 as the primary effectiveness endpoint in patients with EFs ranging 
from 25% to 45%  (inclusive) .  A Bayesian statistical approach w as employed to take advantage 
of the data available from the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_300967] (EAP) device on July 31, 2015, 
indicating that FDA believes the device fills  an unmet clinical need and merits priority revie w. 
 
The [ADDRESS_300968] relevant in that there was a pre- specified fixed  borrowing of data from  a subgroup of 
patients from this study for the Bayesian Analysis of the FIX -HF-5C primary endpoint : peak 
VO 2. 
 The results of the FIX -HF-5C study demonstrated a statistically and clinically significantly 
higher improvement in peak VO
2 in patients treated with CCM ™ for 24 weeks in addition to 
OMT in comparison to patients treated with OMT alone.  Similarly, quality of life as assessed 
by [CONTACT_247599]  (MLWHFQ) , functional class

In parallel, the OPTIMIZER  System has been  available in  Europe and Asia gaining real world 
experience.  Investigator -initiated studies were conducted to examine long term effects of 
CCM ™ (Kuschyk et al., 2015; Kloppe et al., 2016 and Liu et al., 2016).  In addition, Impulse 
Dynamics conducted 2 registr y studies  (CCM -HF and CCM -REG) to further elucidate the use 
of CCM ™ in the moderate- to-severe heart failure population.   
 Once enrollment was complet ed in the FIX -HF-5C study, a Continued Access Protocol (FIX -
HF-5CA) was submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1622] .  The first patient was enrolled in this study 
on July 3, 2017. The Continued Access Study utilizes the next version of the device, the OPTIMIZER SMAR T with the 3-Lead configuration.  As detailed above, the switch to the 
OPTIMIZER SMART was necessitated due to OPTIMIZER  IVs manufacturing constraints  
(i.e., loss of availability of the header material) .  The differences between the OPTIMIZER  
IVs and the OPTIMIZER SMART 3- Lead configuration are summarized above in Table 8; the 
main differences are the differen t epoxy material used for the header and the smoothness of 
the titanium can contour.  Therefore, this P MA application is seeking approval for the 
OPTIMIZER SMART 3-Lead configuration device. 
 
1.2 Clinical Need  
 
CCM™  delivered by [CONTACT_247600] a unique therapeutic 
modality for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe heart failure (HF), a life threatening  and irreversibly debilitating disease for which there is an unmet clinical need .   
 
1.2.1 Unmet clinical need  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_247483], heart failure remains a cause of 
substantial disability, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and mortality. There is a crucial need for additional safe 
and effective heart failure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], in particular in patients with normal QRS w here there is 
currently no therapeutic  medical device available in the [LOCATION_002].   The OPTIMIZER 
SMART System fulfills  an unmet medical need .  
 
1.2.2 Life threatening  and irreversibly debilitati ng disease  
 
The heart is a life sustaining  organ.  When it  fails, the heart can no longer supply adequate 
cardiac output to meet the body’s metabolic needs, particularly during periods of exertion.  Thus, heart failure  (HF)  is both a life threatening  and irreversibly debilitating condition.  
Current statistics su pport this fact.  Approximately 5.[ADDRESS_300969] heart failure in the 
United State s according to CDC.
1 Fifty percent of people diagnosed with heart f ailure die 
within 5 years of diagnosis.1  One in 9 death s in 2009 included HF  as a contributing cause1.  In 
2010, there were 1,801,000 physician office visits with a primary diagnosis of HF and 676,000 emergency department  visits and 236,000 outpatient depar tment visits f or HF .
2  Clearly, 
morbidity and mortality are high in patients with HF.  HF is life threatening since the likelihood of death is high unless the course  of the disease is interrupted in patients before permanent 
damage is done.  Moreover, hear t failure can be considered irreversibly debilitating in that in

patients affected.   Indeed, the patient population served by [CONTACT_247601].  By [CONTACT_108], 
NYHA Class III patients have a marked limitation of physical activity but are reasonably asymptomatic  at rest; less than ordinary physical activity causes  fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or 
dyspnea in NYHA Class III heart failure patie nts.  NYHA Class IV patients are even more 
impaired in that these patients have an inability to carry out any physical activ ity without 
symptoms ; patients have symptoms at rest, which are increased with any amount of physical 
activity.     
1.2.3 Lack of Al ternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_247484] , it is evident that the OPTIMIZER SMART is intended to 
treat a life threatening , irreversibly debilitating disease:  heart failure.   The OPTIMIZER 
SMART  is the only available device that can provide CCM therapy. 
  CCM ™’s target population is NYHA Class III and ambulatory IV subjects, with normal QRS 
duration and reduced ejection fraction despi[INVESTIGATOR_247485], guideline -directed pharmacologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   There  are currently no device therapi[INVESTIGATOR_247486]-group of patients. 
 Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)  is also indicated f or patients with moderate to 
severe heart fail ure with prolonged QRS duration.  CRT  works by [CONTACT_247602].  However, 
CRT is only indicated for patients with prolonged QRS  duration, primarily those with QRS 
duration >150 ms.  Since o nly ~30% of the patients with heart failure have a wide QRS
3, CRT 
is not applicable to 70% of heart failure patients.  In addition, CRT applied to patients with systolic heart failure and a QRS duration of less than [ADDRESS_300970] device (LVAD).  However, even with newer and smaller devices being developed, LVADs are fraught with serious complications such as bleeding, stroke, infection, and 
thrombosis. Because of these risks, LVAD use is generally limited to patients with more severe 
heart failure than those qualifying for CCM™ therapy.  
 
1.3 Intended Use and Indications for Use  
 
Intended Use: The OPTIMIZER SMART S ystem is intended to deliver CCM™  electrical 
signals to the myocardium of the heart.  
 
Indications for Use :   The OPTIMIZER SMART System, which delivers CCM therapy, is 
indicated for the treatment of NYHA Class III or ambulatory NYHA Class IV heart failure patients in normal sinus rhythm with LVEF ranging from 25% to 45% and QRS interval <130 ms to improve exercise tolerance, quality of life, functional status and reduce heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].

229 subjects with EF > 25% from  the FIX- HF-5 Phase II  study using a Bayesian 
modeling approach. Subjects  (n=160) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment 
groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Block randomization by [CONTACT_247603] (is chemic versus non -ischemic cardiomyopathy) w as used to ensure balanced 
enrollment between the two groups. 
 
 
1.4.2 Overview of Study Methodology 
 
Sites identified potential patients from their clinic’s chronic heart failure population.  The target patient p opulation consisted of subjects with ejection fractions from 25 to 
45% (inclusive) whose symptoms were consistent with NYHA Class functional class 
III or ambulatory NYHA Class IV.   Informed consent was obtained from potential 
subjects who were then enrolled in the study to undergo baseline screening testing to determine eligibility for the study.  Baseline screening exams included: cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) to determine peak VO
2, echocardiography to 
determine left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF), 12 -Lead ECG, 24- hour Holter 
Monitor, quality of life assessment (MLWHFQ), a blinded assessment of NYHA Class and [ADDRESS_300973] s were evaluated by [CONTACT_247604].  The core laboratory was blinded to the randomization assignment for individual patients. 
 
If patients passed baseline testing, a device implant date was scheduled  in the 
electrophysiology laboratory as soon as possible; this scheduled implant date served as the study start date (SSD) from which the timing of all future follow -up visits were 
determined. After passing baseline testing and meeting all entry criteria ( Table 9 ), 
subjects were randomized in a 1:1 manner to either the Control Group that received

[IP_ADDRESS] CPX Core Laboratory 
 
We think it important to note that, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has invested as much time, effort and financial resources to ensure the qualit y of 
every cardiopulmonary stress test (CPX).  Quality measures taken in the FIX -
HF-5C study, included: quali ty assurance testing at every site to validate 
equipment every 6 months; sending technicians to perform tests upon requests of the sites or when the core lab identified issues with test performance; mandating two tests at each timepoint; and rapid centralized reads of test quality and asking for additional tests when quality metrics were not met.  Similar measures were taken in the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_300979] of CPX testing at the sites and 
the evaluation of the tests  by a blinded core laboratory to optimize  the quality of 
tests and achieve maximal effort from each patient.  These measures included: 
1) on- site training on standardized procedures for conducting CPX testing; 2) 
normal subject validation testing and revalidation every 6 months; 3) providing the patient with instructions on how to prepare for the CPX test; 4) rapid 
feedback on quality of every test from the core laboratory and retest reques ts for

Tests were deemed inadequate if: 1) t he subject had an erratic or oscillatory 
breathing pattern; 2) the data were non -physiologic; 3) an issue was identified 
with the testing equipment ; or 4) the test was submaximal, meaning it was 
terminated by [CONTACT_247606]/technician prior to 
the subject reaching volitional exhaustion. Reasons for earl y termination 
included non- heart failure symptoms (e.g., angina, heart rhythm disturbance, or 
leg, foot, or back pain) or the subject was technically challenged to perform the test.   
Metabolic data w ere collected for [ADDRESS_300980]’s ventilation volume were at normal, 
physiologic, and stable resting values before beginning the test. Metabolic data 
were then collected for the duration of the test and for an additional [ADDRESS_300981].  Peak VO 2 and peak respi[INVESTIGATOR_63760] (RER) were determined by [CONTACT_247607] [ADDRESS_300982] results with the potential for r educing sample size.

6, with a 30% weight or 70% down-
weighting of the FIX -HF-5 subgroup  treatment group difference. Non -informative 
prior distributions were specified for all other model parameters. The pre -specified 
primary analysis would conclude superiority of the CCM ™ Treatment group versus 
Control if the Bayesian posterior probability of a positive treatment difference in favor of CCM ™ treatment exceeded 0.975.  In addition, a 95% Bayesian credible interval 
was provided based on the 2.5
th and 97.5th percentiles of the Bayesian posterior 
distribution of the treatment difference.  For summary purposes, and similar (non-Bayesian) repeated measures model was also fitted to the FIX -HF-5 and FIX -HF-5C 
studies (without borrowing) to summarize the treatment differences of each trial independently. 
 
Quality of life assessed with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) was a key secondary effectiveness endpoint.  The [ADDRESS_300988] of the signature [CONTACT_247687]. Other questions look at physical and social functioning in the context of heart failure symptoms.  Scores on the MLWHFQ can range from 0 to 105.  The tool is validated for the heart failure patient population. 
 
Additional secondary effectiveness endpoints include: 
• Change in NYHA Class  
• Change in Peak VO 2 including only tests with RER > 1.05 
 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of complications ( OPTIMIZER  device- 
or procedure -related serious adverse events that requires invasive treatment or results 
in a permanent disability or death). The success criterion for the safety endpoint was set such that the therapy would be considered safe if greater than 70% of the implanted population was free of such a complication.  This criterion was agreed upon with FDA with approval of the final Data Development Plan (DDP) on July 13, 2017.  Secondary safety endpoints included mortality, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and SAEs.

endpoints were done in completed cases (CC) and the per protocol (PP) population. 
Secondary and additional effectiveness analyses were conducted in completed cases and 
the PP population. Completed cases refer to all available data for the particular endpoint of interest. The PP population is defined as subjects who received treatment 
(OPTIMIZER  Group), have any follow -up post study start and have no protocol 
violations that would affect endpoint assessment. Secondary and additional safety endpoints were assessed in the PP population. The primary effectiveness endpoint was evaluated together with the borrowing of information from 229 subjects with EF≥25 
from the original FIX- HF-5 study using a Bayesian modeling approach.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Accountability  
A summary table provides the total number of subjec ts screened, randomized and 
evaluable, by [CONTACT_76537]. The subjects eligible for and compliant with each follow- up visit were summarized descriptively. Subjects withdrawn were tabulated with 
their reasons for withdrawal. 
Each subject screened for the study was accounted for. A subject accountability table 
presents the total number of screened and randomized subjects as well as the total number of evaluable subjects and subjects with a violation of specific inclusion or exclusion criterion. A tabulation of subjects who were screened but not randomized, and 
their reasons for ineligibility, is  provided. Subjects who were ineligible at the 
intraoperative stage with the reason for ineligibility and subjects with a protocol 
violation with the specific vio lation are also listed. Subjects were grouped into broad 
categories for the purpose of tabulation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Character of Study Variables  
For continuous variables, the descriptive analyses present the mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. Fo r categorical variables, the number with the 
characteristic, the total number evaluated, the percent and the 95% exact binomial confidence intervals ar e provided. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Comparability Analyses  
Comparability analyses were performed to determine the similarity between treatment 
groups and study sites with respect to important demographic or other variables, either 
known or suspected to have an influence on the outcome variables. The absence of similarity for any variable identifies that variable as a potential covariate in subsequent safety and effectiveness analyses.

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis  
The main effectiveness endpoints of the Impulse Dynamics FIX -HF-5 trial were 
ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT primary) and peak VO
2 (secondary) at 24 
weeks , using multiple imputations to obtain estimates of missing data. In addition, 
responder analyses were conducted using a variety of arbitrary cut -points (i.e. percent 
improvement) as a basis for dichotomizing the quant itative data and "response rates" 
were compared between treated and control subjects. Results of  these analyses 
showed that the effectiveness of the OPTIMIZER System, when assessed  by [CONTACT_247609] 2, is mo st evident in a subgroup of subjects with  an EF>=25% at baseline.  
Several issues were identified with the  approaches used in the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_300992],

arbitrary thresholds which may not be clinically meaningful. 
To overcome these limitations, the FIX -HF-5C study utilized an alternative statistical 
approach to the analysis of these data based on mixed effects regression mo dels
9 with 
peak VO 2 as the primary endpoint. Unlike the 'pre- specifi ed endpoint analyses using 
propensi ty score matching for imputation of missing data, the current analy sis uses 
all available longitudinal data (baseline, [ADDRESS_300994] ). This statistical approach does not require imputation, but still provides the same level of r obustness to missing values and drop- outs (missing at random - MAR )
[ADDRESS_300995] fit (by [CONTACT_247610]) to the FIX -HF-5 
data. In particular, we found that an equicorrelation, equal variance model fit the data 
quite well, and was superior by [CONTACT_247611]:  
(i) arbitrary variances and correlations;  
(ii) random intercepts and slopes with arbitrary variances;  
(iii) random intercepts  and slopes with equal variances. Error variance was 
allowed to vary by [CONTACT_247612] v ariability due to averaging of replicated studies.  
T
he primary effect of interest is the treatment by [CONTACT_5586] -24-weeks interactio n. A 
Bayesian approach was used (see next section) to extend this model to allow the treatment by [CONTACT_247613] s the [ADDRESS_300996] in a model along with center by [CONTACT_5586], center by 
[CONTACT_247614]. If a significant center  by

was obtained and tested for significance. This sensitivity analysis was based on FIX -
HF-5C data only and was based on maximum likelihood methods (not Bayesia n). 
A similar sensitivity analysis was carried out to test for a region (i.e., US vs non- US) 
by [CONTACT_247618].

studies revealed that LOCF endpoint anal ysis can lead to substantial biases in 
estimators of treatment effects under all three of the missing data mechanisms evaluated, whereas the generalized mixed -model analysis of the ava ilable data leads 
to estimators with comparatively small bias, and contr ols Type I error rates at the 
nominal level in the presence of  MCAR, MAR, and some cases of MNAR. In a 
sensitivity analysis of  48 RCTs from 25 NDAs, the generalized mixed model was the 
superior approach in controlling Type I error rates and minimizing bias es as compared 
to the endpoint analytic approach. Interestingly, no evidence of MNAR was found in these real datasets.

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Safety Analysis 
The primary safety analysis  evaluated the OPTIMIZER  procedure- or device -
related complication rates through 24- weeks of follow up. We construct ed an exact 
binomial 95% confidence interval for the complication free proportion.  
The primary safety end point was  the percentage of subjects in the OPTIMIZER  group 
who experienced either an OPTIMIZER  device or OPTIMIZER  procedure related 
complication through the 24- week follow -up period, as determined by [CONTACT_247620] (EAC). The EAC reviewed all serious adverse event reports (SAEs), confirmed the classification of "serious", and adjudicated the relationship of the event to the OPTIMIZER  System device or 
procedure. SAEs that the EAC determined to be definitely related to either the OPTIMI ZER  System or the OPTIMIZER  Procedure were further classified as either 
a Complication or Not a Complication. A "complication" is an OPTIMIZER  device 
or OPTIMIZER  procedure related event that requires invasive treatment or results in 
a permanent d isability  or death.  
Satisfying the primary safety endpoint required that the complication -free proportion 
of the population was significantly higher  than 70% (using a one -sided significance 
level of 0.025).   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Justification of Sample Size  
Power calculation s for a  longitudinal design are normally quite complex, and the 
addition of the Bayesian modeling increases the complexity . We adopted the 
following approach.  Data were simulated based on a multivariate normal 
distribution, in which the means, var iances, and correlations between time points 
are based on the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_300999] for the original trial. We then simulate d a large number of prospective datasets under these assumptions for a 
variety of possible true treatment effects (differences in change from baseline to 24 
weeks between control and treatment arm) and calculated the proportion of these 
datasets that would satisfy the Bayesian superiority criterion of the previous section. Assuming a  true treatment effect of O (that is the slopes in the two arms  are 
identical) yields the type I error. Simulations are presented in the "Primary Analysis 
Specification" report  (Attachment 06). For 30% borrowing of the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_301000].

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary effectiveness analysis  
If the null hypothesis was rejected for the primary endpoint, it was planned that the 
secondary effectiveness analyses would be performed. Details of the secondary 
effectiveness analyses are provided in the "Primary Endpoint Analysis 
Specification" report (Attachment 06) provided with the “Primary & Key Secondary Analyses Impulse Dynamics FIX -HF-5C” Report (Attachment 07).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Supporting Secondary Effectiveness Analyses  
A supporting analysis of the  secondary endpoints was done using the combined 
FIX-HF-5C and FIX - H
F-[ADDRESS_301001]  data with baseline NYHA III-IV and baseline 
EF>25% (to be referred to as the FIX -HF-5 Subset).  
These supporting secondary e ffectiveness analyses were done in the completed 
cases population from the combined FIX -HF-5 Subset and FIX -HF-5C data sets . 
The analysis of MWLHF and p eak VO 2 with RER ≥1.[ADDRESS_301002] one class 
reduction from baseline used the same Mantel -Haenszel method proposed from the 
secondary endpoint applied to the combined study groups. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Effectiveness Analyses  
As exploratory analyses, all primary and secondary analyses are repeated with 
pooled FIX -HF-5 Subset and FIX -HF-5C data using maximum likelihood methods, 
with adjustment for study where applicable (e.g. a fixed effect for study in 
longitudinal models). 
A series of additional analyses of effectiveness were perform ed.  Each variable was 
tested with a  univariate and  multivariate test. The univariate test for categorical 
variables were with Fisher's exact test and the multivariate analysis was done with 
logistic regression. If the variable is ordinal or continuous, the univariate test was a 
two-sample Wilcoxon  rank sum test and the multivariate test was done with  the 
analysis of variance procedure or equivalent. Screening for all  multivariate analyses 
was done to prevent over specification of  the model . 
The additional analyses include:  
 a. Univariate and multivariate evaluation of the primary effectiveness endpoint in the per protocol population. 
b. Comparisons of treatment effects separately in subjects whose CHF etiology is ischemic or non- ischemic.  
c. Comparison of treatment effects separately in the subjects whose EF is  ≥

[IP_ADDRESS] Secon dary Safety Analysis  
The nature, frequency, and seriousness of adverse events between the two groups were compared using descriptive summary statistics. In addition, the primary safety 
endpoint and hypothesis were tested on the completed cases and per prot ocol 
populations. 
• All-cause mortality  
• Cardiac mortality  
• Composite rate of all- cause mortality and all- cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Composite rate of cardiovascular mort ality and heart failure -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
• Overall incidence and seriousness of adverse events  
 Kaplan Meier plots and log- rank tests were used to descriptively compare treatment 
groups for each of the above outcomes. Summary statistics were presented for both the prospective data alone and on the prospective data pooled with the data from t he 
original FIX- HF-[ADDRESS_301004] (NYHA= III or IV, EF ≥ 25% 
subgroup).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Missing Data 
 Our primary approach to handling missing endpoint data w as the mixed effects 
modeling framework.  Mixed models provide valid inference for the model parameters provided that all missing data are "missing at random" (MAR) with respect to the data used in the statistical model.  If the MAR assumption does not 
hold, inference can be biased.  In particular, endpoint data  missing due to patient 
death or to heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247489].  To handle these specific cases a value of 0 w as imputed if the reason for missing was  death and the minimum value

not receive the device are described in detail in another section of the current report.   
dP/dt testing not done : The September 25, 2015 version of the protocol dropped the 
requirement of dP/dt testing that involved performing a left heart  catheterization in the 
patient prior to implanting the device. Two (2) implant cases were done after FDA approval with IRB approval documentation pending. 
CCM ™ therapy : Subjects are typi[INVESTIGATOR_247490] ™ therapy programmed 
ON after the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In one case, due to lasting effects from the anesthesia, CCM ™ was initiated 2 days later.  
Follow-up visit done out of  the window : This i ncluded study visits that were 
completed  but were done either prior to the study window start date or after the study 
window end date.  
2 week or 4 week visits not done : Four visits were not done in Control group subje cts. 
These study visit s only required a safety assessment and an OPTIMIZER  device 
interrogation for subjects that received the device. Control subjects that did not return for these visits were assessed for safety over of the phone until they returned for the 12-week visit. No effectiveness  endpoints were required at these two intervals. 
12 week or 24 week visits not done : As with the [ADDRESS_301008] To Follow -up: T here was one subject that was randomized but was never 
heard  from again after that. The details of this case are described in the Subject 
Accountability  Section of the cur rent report.  
Study visits performed outside the study window specified in the protocol accounted for a majority of the protocol deviations that occurred.  None of the protocol deviations were  serious enough to cause the associated patient to be removed from the overall

significant impact on the outcomes achieved in the study, either positive or negative. 
The majority of the “Testing” deviations had to do with the subject bei ng unable to

24-week study visit window (44 days late). 
11. Subject 75- 429 (Active, [ADDRESS_301025] Deviations) refused to complete the 12- week and 
24-week CPX testing due to symptoms of nausea experienced after test.  
12. Subject 78- 401 (Active, [ADDRESS_301026] Deviation) only did one [ADDRESS_301027]

Eighty- six (86) subjects were randomized to the control group; 79 of the 86 
subjects complete d the 24 -week study. Three (3) control subjects died prior to the 
12-week visit (subjects 90 -402, 65- 427, 65- 422) at 4, 36, and [ADDRESS_301062] (72 -408) died after the 12-
week visit and prior to the 24- week visit at 117 days, due to a pulmonary 
complication following a non- cardiac procedure.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 OPTIMIZER  Treatment Arm of the Study  
 
Seventy -four (74) subjects were randomized to the CCM ™ Treatment group;  68 
of the se 74 subjects underwent device implantation.  Six (6) subjects did not 
receive an implant.  One (subject 65- 446) died 2 days prior to the scheduled 
implant date, 1 (subject 57- 409) was lost to follow -up prior to the scheduled 
implant date, 1 (subject 08-407) was deemed ineligible ( interim assessment 
classified this patient as NYHA Class II) and was withdrawn, 1 (06 -404) was 
discovered to have an additional abandoned ICD lead and the implant was canceled (follow -up testing through 24- weeks performed) and 2 s ubjects 
(subjects 51- 423 and 51-454)  elected not to undergo the implant procedure but 
follow-up testing through 24- weeks was performed.  Thus, 3 of the six patients 
randomized to CCM ™ treatment who did not undergo device implantation 
completed the 24- week study follow up visits. 
 In addition to the subject that died just prior to the implant date, [ADDRESS_301065] (88 -

comparisons of baseline variables between the Control and OPTIMIZER  groups 
of the FIX -HF-5C study. There are no statistically significant differences between 
the groups i n any of the variables , thus demonstrating that randomization of 
subjects produced balanced groups with respect to baseline characteristics.

The maj ority of subjects enrolled  in the FIX -HF-5C study were white males , 
which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a large recent  heart failu re study (e.g., the PARADIGM 
study.)17  
 
The etiology of heart disease was ischemic in ~60% of the subjects.  This finding is also consistent w ith a recent study  of heart failure (e.g., the PARADIGM 
study.)
17  The history of atrial arrhythmias presented in the T able 21 represents 
remote  history because subjects  with recent persistent or permanent  atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter were excluded from the study.  The presence of 
ventricular arrhythmias as shown here is common for patients with predominantly ischemic heart failure.   Approximately 90% of the randomized subjects in FIX -
HF-5C were NYHA Cl ass III at baseline assessment  consistent with the target 
patient population.

differences between the groups for any category of cardiovascular medication 
evaluated, so the groups were again shown to be well balanced after 
randomization.  In both groups, approximately 83% of subjects were on AC E-I 
or ARB medications while over 95% o f subjects in both groups were receiving 
beta blocker medication at baseline. Seventy -five percent of subjects were taking 
diuretics and approximately 35% of subjects were on an aldosterone inhibitor.  The rate of diuretic therapy in FIX -HF-5C is similar t o the rate reported in the

Subjects at Pseudo -site 3 (Study Site 51) appear to have a higher mean baseline 
Holter PVC than the subjects at the other p seudo- sites. Similarly, it appears that 
subjects at Pseudo -site 3 (Study Site 51) have a higher mean baseline score for the 
MLWHFQ than subjects at the other pseudo- sites. Subjects at Pseudo -site 5 
(combined sites 70- 79) appear to have a lower mean baseline Peak RER than 
subjects at the other pseudo- sites.  
Pseudo- site 6 (Study Site 90) appears  to have a higher mean baseline heart rate 
than the subjects at the other pseudo- sites. Similarly, subjects at Pseudo -site 6 
(study Site 90) have a higher mean systolic blood pressure than subjects at the 
other pseudo- sites. Subjects at Pseudo -sites 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_301074] a higher 
mean baseline diastolic blood pressure than subjects at the other three pseudo-
sites.

Note the following: 
• Subjects at Pseudo -sites [ADDRESS_301081] a lower percentage using ace inhibit ors 
than the subjects at the other pseudo- sites.  
• Subjects at Pseudo- sites [ADDRESS_301082] a lower percentage using diuretics than 
the subjects at the other pseudo- sites.  
• Pseudo- sites 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_301083] with baseline Ivabradine use.  
• Subjects  at Pseudo -sites [ADDRESS_301084] higher rates of digoxin use than subjects 
at the other pseudo- sites.  
• Subjects at Pseudo -site [ADDRESS_301085] a much higher rate of Aldosterone inhibitor use 
than subjects at the other pseudo sites. 
• Subjects at Pseudo -sites [ADDRESS_301086] a higher use of Hydralazine that subjects 
at the other pseudo- sites.  
• Subjects at Pseudo -sites [ADDRESS_301087] a much lower baseline rate of nitrate use 
than subjects at the other pseudo- sites.  
 
Thus, as anticipated in a study with a relatively small sample size, several 
differences between pseudo sites emerge.  Accordingly, for purposes of 
poolability, it is appropriate to assess if treatment effects differ among pseudo sites 
as will be detailed in the next section.

To determine if the data can be pooled in estimation of the primary effectiveness 
endpoint, two analyses were conducted below per the SAP: one for the presence of a pseudo- site by [CONTACT_247630] a geographic 
region by [CONTACT_226055]- site interaction. Additional exploration of the heterogeneity of 
the treatment effect by [CONTACT_247631] & Key 
Secondary Analyses Report (Attachment 07). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Analysis of Poolability by [CONTACT_247632]- site 
The evaluation of a pseudo- site by [CONTACT_247633]- site as a 
random component along with the interaction of pseudo- site by [CONTACT_247634].  If the interaction of pseudo- site by [CONTACT_247635] a P -value 
<0.15, the data were considered not poolable and required a model that 
includes pseudo-site as a random component. 
The results of the pseudo- site poolability model are presented in the table 
below.

[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Medication Dose Changes 
Information on both baseline and 24- week medications and doses were available 
from 152 patients among the FIX -HF-5C population, 81 in the Control group and 
71 in the  ACTIVE group.  For each class of drug (ACE -inhibitors, ARBs, β -
blockers, diuretics, second diuretic, or aldosterone inhibitor), we determined the 
total number of patients in each group in which the drug was changed, in addition to the number in which dose s were increased and the number in which doses were

The primary effectiveness  outcome measures by [CONTACT_247637] 15 and Table 3 2.  The model -based estimated mean 
difference in p eak VO 2 at 24 weeks between CCM ™ Treatment and Control 
groups was 0.836 ml/kg/min (15.042 vs. 14.206 mlO 2/kg/min, respec tively), with 
a 95% Bayesian credible interval of (0.123, 1.552 mlO 2/kg/min). The probability 
that CCM ™ treatment is superior to Control is 0.989, which exceeds the 0.975 
criteria required for statistical significance of the primary endpoint.

Summarizing the FIX -HF-5 and FIX -HF-5C studies separately ( Figure 16 ), the 
model- based estimated treatment differences at 24 weeks in FIX -HF-5 and FIX -
HF-5C studies are 1.080 mlO 2/kg/min (0.413, 1.759 mlO 2/kg/min) and 0.793 
mlO 2/kg/min (- 0.099, 1.684 mlO 2/kg/min ), respectively.  The primary analysis 
for FIX -HF-5C (with borrowing) appropriately leverages information from both 
studies to provide a more robust estimate of the treatment difference.

 Eighty- six (86) subjects were randomized to Control and [ADDRESS_301091] to their 
24-week CPX testing adequacy determinations. Seventy- two (72) Control 
subjects and 68 OPTIMIZER  subjects performed the 24- week CPX testing. 
77.8% of the Control subjects that performed the 24- week CPX testing had 2

                     Discussion of pVO 2 results  
 
The studies primary endpoint, a difference in peak VO 2 between groups, was met.  
This diffe rence was arrived at  by a reduction of peak VO 2 in the control group 
and a maintenance of peak VO 2 in the treatment group after 6 -month follow -up.  
Thus, it can be concluded that in this study and included cohort, CCM prevented 
worsening of exercise tolera nce.  It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_247496] a clinical trial 
that exercise tolerance would be maintained in the Control group and would 
increase in the treatment group; for example, such expected findings have generally been identified in prior studies of cardiac resynchronization therapy

First, the purpose of a randomized trial is to be able to account for (i.e., balance) 
unanticipated confounding factors and behaviors between groups.  Clinical trials 
and trial programs enroll unique populations based on unique eligibility criteria . 
In the FIX -HF-5 / FIX -HF-5C trials, we enrolled a group of patients who 
remained substantially symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_247497] -directed 
medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If left alone, these patients demonstrate disease progression as is evident by [CONTACT_247641]
2. Observing this is part of the beauty 
of the randomized parallel -control trial design. As detailed further below, the 
consistency betw een FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_301096] (CPX).  Quality measures taken in the FIX -HF-
5C study, included: quality assurance testing at every site to validate equip ment 
every 6 months; sending technicians to perform tests upon requests of the sites or when the c ore lab identified issues with test performance; mandating two tests at 
each timepoint; and rapid centralized reads of test quality and asking for 
additional tests when quality metrics were not met.  Similar measures were taken 
in the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_301097] of the  quality metrics, from among the 
160 patients enrolled in FIX -HF-5C (86 Control patients; 74 CCM treated 
patients) ~[ADDRESS_301098] “adequa cy” and only “adequate” 
tests were included for analysis.  It turned out that ~90% of tests were deemed 
adequate and included in the final analysis.  We believe these methods further 
contribute importantly to the reliability of the CPX results obtained in FIX -HF-
5C study. 
Third, the finding of decreased peak VO
[ADDRESS_301099] of 
treatment on exercise duration.  In the pooled FIX -HF-5 and FIX -HF-5C dataset, 
peak VO
2 decreased but exercise duration was constant in the Control group (147

p<0.001).  Please refer to the following Figure and Table (data pooled from FIX -
HF-5 and FIX -HF- 5C; error bars are SEMs) for further details.  Thus, we identify 
another difference between the groups.  Importantly, since values of RER are 
constant across time, this does not appear to be a result of differences in patient effort between groups. 
 
Considering that a continuous treadmill ramp protocol was used in the conduct of the exercise tests, exercise time is directly related to workload.  Therefore, the ratio of exercise time (a surrogate of work performed) to peak VO
2 (energy 
utilization) can be considered as an index of overall metabolic efficiency.  Improved metabolic efficiency is commonly  expected on repeat exercise testing 
due to habituation (i.e., patient familiarity with the test) and possibly some degree of physical conditioning. Interestingly, this efficiency ratio increased from baseline to 6 months by [CONTACT_247642]:  44.5 vs 47.0 [sec/(mlO2/min), p=0.001] in controls compared to 45.7 vs 48.5 [sec/(mlO2/min), p=0.007] in CCM treatment (p=ns between groups).  These 
findings are summarized in the next Figure.  As noted above, this is also in the 
context of no change of RER values between baseline and 6 -months such that 
changes in patient effort are considered to be accounted for.

The fact that this efficiency index impr oved as expected, and comparably in both 
groups speaks to the equal treatment of study subjects in both groups and, we 
believe, also speaks to the blindness of the core lab interpretations. 
Thus, patients in the CCM group were able to do more work than Controls (as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_247643].  However, due to the 
apparen t increase in metabolic efficiency in the context of a high degree of 
oversight during the conduct of the tests, increased work was able to be performed at the same peak VO
2.   
In summary, the finding that peak VO [ADDRESS_301101] oversight by [CONTACT_247644] “as 
needed” traveling exercise physiologist to ensure the highest possible test quality and inclusion only of “adequate” tests. 
Although peak VO
2 stayed relatively constant, exercise duration (an index of  total 
workload in our continuous ramp study) increased significantly in the treatm ent 
group. In Controls, duration stayed constant but peak VO [ADDRESS_301102] of CCM is demonstrated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analyses   
The conclusion of CCM ™ superiority with respect to mean p eak VO 2 was 
consistent across all sensitivity analyses  (detailed in Attachment 07  Primary & 
Key Secondary Analyses Report ). These inclu ded various methods of imputation 
for missing data (missing data due  to death imputed as 0, imputed as the lowest 
pVO 2 at any visit, or no imputation), as well as an assessment of site -to-site 
heterogeneity of the treatment effect.  The conclusion of CCM ™ superiority with 
respect to mean pVO 2 was consistent across all sensitivity analyses.  In addition, 
it was noted that the primary analysis would achieve statistical significance with

in the analysis plan). 
 In addition to the sensitivity analyses, there are two additional potential limitations of the Bayesian analysis: 
a.  The analysis of the FIX -HF-5 data used for borrowing in the Bayesian analysis 
included one patient with a basel ine NYHA class II.  The primary  outcome 
(peak  VO
2) was missing  at [ADDRESS_301103]  of 
including this patient  on the FIX-HF-5 analysis  was minimal.  
 b. There was no imputation  of missing  data in the FIX-HF-5 analysis  submitted  
to the FDA  in the FIX -HF-5C simulations (i.e. all simulations used a 
“completed case” analysis of FIX -HF-5 for borrowing). However,  a FIX-HF-
5 “complete  case”  analysis  (for borrowing) is inconsistent with the primary  
analysis  of FIX-HF-5C, which  imputes  missing  data due to death  in FIX- 
HF-5C as 0’s. There are a total of 6 patients  in the FIX-HF-5 study who are 
missing  peak  VO
2 due to death,  of which  5 are in the active treatment  group 
and 1 is in the control group. 
Given these considerations, we repeat ed the FIX -HF-5C primary analysis with 
30% borrowing of FIX - HF-5 data, in which the FIX -HF-5 analysis excludes 
the one patient with NYHA class II  and imputes missing peak VO 2 data due 
to death as 0’s for the above 6 patients. This involves fitting a Bayesian mode l 
on the FIX -HF-5 data, then performing the FIX -HF-5C analysis (with and 
without borrowing of FIX- HF-5 data). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Comparison of Baseline Characteristics between Subjects Showing Improvement vs. Worsening or No Change on the Primary Endpoint (pVO2)  Baseline characteristics including medications were compared between

of 160 patients and 442 non- missing peak VO2 observations from FIX -HF-5C 
patients.   Also, in this analysis, zeros are imputed for deaths in accordance with 
the prospective statistical  analysis plan. 
In Table 40, which is an analysis of peak VO 2 for tests in which RER is ≥1.05, 
there are a total of 160 patients and 420 non- missing values for peak VO 2 
observations ; 22 subjects less than in Table 33a . In this analysis, zeros are NOT 
imput ed for deaths, which certainly had an important influence on the findings 
since there were more deaths in Control and Active treatment groups. 
In addition to the 10 tests missing due to deaths, there were 12 addition patients 
in which tests were deemed adequate but in which the RER was <1.05 (6 in the Control group and 6 CCM group). 
This accounts for the differences in the number of observations.  There are several 
additional importa nt points for discussion. 
First, despi[INVESTIGATOR_247498]≥1.05, the treatment effect still trends in the direction of benefit of CCM treatment. In fact, the sensitivity analysis on the com pleted cases 
analysis without any imputation (Table 20) showed treatment be nefit with the 
Bayesian borrowing, and the 24- week difference between treatments in this 
population is similar to the RER≥1.05 subset.  This is further illustrated in the following graph (FIX -HF-5C data) which shows that at each timepoint and both 
groups, elimination of tests with RER<1.[ADDRESS_301109]

documented in the meeting notes of teleconferences with FDA  (Attachment 10).   
We remain concerned about the physiological and statistical validity of such an 
analysis.  Firstly,  a 1.[ADDRESS_301110] reached their exercise limit.  Impulse 
provided a reference showing, from independent analysis, that low RER values are associated with a patient’s maximum e ffort and that increases of RER may 
themselves reflect improvements in patient conditions.  Accordingly, this analysis throws away one side of the distribution that contributes to the assessment of the treatment effect.  Furthermore, all the unprecedented safeguards introduced in the 
conduct, data collection and interpretation of  test results discussed were geared 
to minimizing (if not eliminating) possible placebo effects on peak VO
2.  As 
evidence of the success of the approach, please refer to the followi ng graph of 
data from the FIX -HF-5C, which shows the average RER of tests a t each 
timepoint by [CONTACT_19313].  As seen, there is no difference over time or between groups (p>0.4 for all comparisons). 
 
Thus, using RER as in an index, there is no evidence of change  of effort during 
exercise testing in either group. 
In summary, the impact of removing test results with RER <1.[ADDRESS_301111] further shown that based on the FDA -specified index  (i.e., RER) there is no evidence of

a third party without the prior written consent of Impulse Dynamics [LOCATION_003], Inc.  [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Safety Endpoint  
 
The primary safet y endpoint is the composite endpoint of the percentage of subjects 
in the OPTIMIZER  group who experienced either an OPTIMIZER  device or 
OPTIMIZER  procedure related complication through the 24- week follow -up 
period, as determined by [CONTACT_247655] (EAC).  
The EAC reviewed all serious adverse event reports (SAEs), confirmed the 
classification of “serious”, and adjudicated the relationship of the event to the 
OPTIMIZER  System device or procedure.  SAEs that the EAC determined to be 
definitely related to either the OPTIMIZER  System or the OPTIMIZER  Procedure 
were further classified as either a Complication or Not a Complication.  A 
“complication” was defined as  an OPTIMIZER  device or OPTIMIZER  procedure 
related even t that requires invasive treatment or results in a permanent disability or 
death.  Satisfying the primary safety endpoint require d that the complication -free 
proportion of patients  was significantly higher than 70% (using a one -sided 
significance level of 0.025).  
Only those subjects that underwent the OPTIMIZER  implant procedure could 
experience an OPTIMIZER  procedure related complication and only those subjects 
who receive the OPTIMIZER  device could experience an OPTIMIZER  device 
related complication. Thus, the “As Treated” cohort is the primary cohort for 
analysis.  The per protocol population is also presented, however, this population 
is identical to the as treated population for OPTIMIZER  subjects in the FIX -HF-5C 
study.  For completeness, results in t he intent to trea t population are also provided.

Thus, the complication free proportion in the as treated study group is 89.7% (61/68) with lower confidence limit of 79.9% (one -sided alpha=0.025).  As this is 
greater than the pre- defined threshold of 70%, the primary safety endpoint was 
met.  The ITT analysis yields similar results (90.5% (67/74) with lower confidence 
limit of 81.5%) and the PP analysis was identical.

compar ed with Controls during the 24- week (168  day) study period. This analysis accounted 
for minor differences in duration of follow -up (due to the ±2 week window for the final visit 
at 24 weeks)  by [CONTACT_247661] a percentage of total “follow -up days,” where 
the number of follow -up days  was defined as the number of days between the study start date 
to the date of the final follow -up visit; for patients who died before the end of the study, 168 
days was used as the total days of follow up.  Final results were then obtained by [CONTACT_247662] 168.  As summarized above, i n the FIX -HF-5C study population, 
there were very few deaths or heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Accordingly, DAOOH HF in the 
CCM Treatment group was 167.7±2.2 days, v ersus 158.3±3 5.8 days in the Control group 
(p=0.011), for a difference of 9.4 days.  
In addition to DAOOH HF, we also explored the rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247502] 24-week study period.  The results  expressed as events 
per patient -year are summarized in the following table for both non -heart failure cardiovascular 
(“CARDIAC” ) and heart failure (HF) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247503].  
As summarized in the table, although there were imbalances in the event -rates  between groups 
at baseline, both CARDIAC and HF event rates were significantly and substantially reduced 
during the study period compared to the event rates prior to the study in the Active treatment 
group but were unchanged in  Control group.

a. OPTIMIZER  Malfunction  
 Per t he case report form reporting instructions, an adverse event category called 
“OPTIMIZER  Malfunction ” is reported for any of the following occurrences: 
• OPTIMIZER lead dislodgement  
• OPTIMIZER lead fracture  
• OPTIMIZER pulse generator  • OPTIMIZER sensin g defect  
• Other - To be specified  
There were 6 events classified as an “OPTIMIZER  Malf unction” reported 
during the 24- week study occurring in 6 subjects.  Five (5) of the six events

revision due to increasing pain and discomfort at the IPG suture line with 
prominent exposure of the lead.  None of these events were as a result of 
product quality issues or failures. 
b. ICD/Pacemaker Malfunction  
 
There were 2 ICD/Pacemaker  malfunctions in the OPTIMIZER  group.  One 
incident was an ICD / lead dislodgment.  The other incident was an inappropriate 
firing of the ICD; testing at the time of the incident proved it was not due to 
crosstalk between the ICD and OPTIMIZER  devices.  There were no 
ICD/Pacemaker related SAEs in the Control group. 
c. Arrhythmias 
There were 5 serious AEs classified as an arrhythmia; 3 occurred in the OPTIMIZER  group and 2 occurred in the Control group.

     The following details the 3 arrhythmia SAEs in the OPTIMIZER  group: 
   Sixty -nine (69) year old female (Subject 90- 413) with idiopathic 
cardiomyopathy and ICD (2011).  The subject was randomized to the 
OPTIMIZER  group on September 1, [ADDRESS_301119] presented to the ER o n February 19, 2017 
(AE3 - Arrhythmia: Atrial fibrillation) and was found to be in atrial flutter with 
a heart rate of [ADDRESS_301120]. The AE was 
adjudicated and classified as “Not a Complication.” The SAE was also re-categorized as “Arrhythmia: Atrial flutter” by [CONTACT_247664].  
  
 Seventy (70) year old male (Subject 90- 442) with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, 
a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, and a dual -chamber 
ICD.   The subject was randomized to the OPTIMIZER  group on December 15, 
[ADDRESS_301121]

complicated with renal failure and the subject was put on dialysis on January 30. The subject was discharged on February 2, 2017.  
There was one additional adjudicated  serious adverse ev ent (worsening of heart

reviewed the event, they classified it as non -serious. Since this is the only non-
serious adverse event, a separate table of non -serious e vents is not presented . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Safety Endpoints  
 
The primary safety endpoint for the FIX -HF-5C study was met since the proportion 
of patients who were complication free exceeded 70% in the ITT population.   
There were no statistically signific ant differences between the active OPTIMIZER  
group and the control OMT group with respect to overall survival or freedom from 
cardiac death. Freedom from the composite of cardiovascular  death and heart failure 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40175] 7.9% higher in treatment compared to control (p=0.048 using Greenwood’s formula for the variance) in the FIX -HF-5C population alone and was 
5.7% higher in the combined FIX -HF-5 and FIX -HF-5C population (p=0.036 using 
Greenwood’s formula for the variance and p=0.0419 by [CONTACT_26500]- rank tes t).  In the pooled 
population, patients experienced an overall 3.9 greater number of days alive out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179881], and the same number of more days alive not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14850].  Even in the FIX -HF-5C study alone CCM patients e xperienced a greate r 
number of days alive not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14850]. Finally, the rates of cardiac and heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247509] -HF-5C population 
(the population for which data were available) vs. the rat es prior to implant. 
 
The incidence of adverse events in this study was in general relatively low.  
Comparisons between the treatment groups did not show any statistical differences between Control and OPTIMIZER  groups with respect to any adverse event tabulated 
for the analysis.  The data presented here allows us to conclude that the OPTIMIZER  
IVs, and therefore the OPTIMIZER SMART 3- Lead configuration by [CONTACT_102854], is 
safe for use in the population of patient s with moderate -to-severe heart failure.

[IP_ADDRESS] CCM ™ Therapy Delivery During FIX -HF-5C Study  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Dosage 
Impulse Dynamics conducted multiple clinical trials which explored several 
therapy dosage timing configurations that were proven to provide a desirable clinical benefit.  For example, the FIX -HF-3 study delivered CCM™ at a “dose” 
of 3 hours/day administered continuously  for 3 hours once a day.  In the FIX -3-
ext and FIX -CHF -4 studies, CCM ™ was delivered in 1 hour intervals for a total 
of 7 hours/day, while in the FIX -HF-5 study, the CCM ™ “dose” was reduced to 
5 hours/day, also in 1- hour intervals equally spaced throughout the day.  Of note, 
a single center study (FIX -CHF-13) did a preliminary evaluation of 5 vs. 12 
hours/day therapy dosage which did not indicate a clinical difference between the 
two times .
18 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Number of Hours/Day  
As the difference in clinical performance of 5 versus 12 hours/day was not found to be significant, the  schedule recommended by [CONTACT_247677] 5 hours per 
day in equally- spaced 1 -hour intervals. Dosage of CCM ™ therapy, as delivered 
in the FIX -HF-5C trial, was pre -set at 5 hours duration in a given 24 hour period. 
The therapy delivery duration was non-programmable.   This “therapy delivery period” started each day at 00:00 hours and was delivered in increments lasting 1 hour in duration. After each one hour period, CCM signal delivery is halted for 3.8 hours. This cycle continued until 23:59 hours at whi ch 
time the cycle repeats. This cycl e continues unless interrupted by [CONTACT_247678], such as high PVC count, atrial arrhythmia, etc.

[IP_ADDRESS].3 CCM™ Percentage per Day  
 
Subjects have their Optimizer device interrogated at every study visit, during 
which CCM delivery percentage and other diagnostic data is  gathered. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_247523] 5 hours of scheduled CCM therapy, the programmed cycle may be interrupted 
when there is a high PVC count, atrial fibrillation, or any other type of tachyarrhythmia. The total amount of time CCM therapy is delivered can be estimated b ased on the number of CCM beats delivered (recorded as total trains). 
Assuming the average heart rate is 72bpm, approximately 21,600 CCM trains would equate to 5 hours (100%) of CCM effectively provided. During the FIX -
HF-5C study, over 80% of the subjects  received the full 5 hours and 
approximately 94% of the subjects received more than 80% of the CCM therapy. The remaining 6% of the subjects received less than 4 hours of therapy due primarily to a high numbe r of PVCs or new onset atrial fibrillation.

[IP_ADDRESS].4 CCM Delivery Programming 
 
Impulse Dynamics discovered that electrical currents delivered during Phase 2 of the ventricular  action potential lead to an increase in ventricular contractility.  The 
actual CCM ™ signal parameters were developed based on animal experiments, 
engineering considerations, and clinical experience.
19  
 As described by [CONTACT_247679] “Design and Development of Medical Electronic Instrumentation ,”
20 CCM ™ signals consist of charge -balanced 
biphasic pulse bursts of  5 to 10 ms in duration per phase; one to three pulses per

CCM ™ delivery must occur within the absolute refractory period.  
Programmability allows the physician to deliver the CCM ™ signal at a time when 
it produces maximal effect on contractility. As shown in Figure 30, the de lay and 
duration of the CCM ™ pulse train were selected to place the CCM ™ signal fully 
within the ventricular action potential’s plateau (Phase 2), leaving sufficient margin of safety to stay clear of ventricular repolarization (T -wave).  Bi phasic 
pulses an d a 40 ms balancing phase were chosen to ensure net -zero current flow 
to prevent electrochemical damage to the tissue.  Lastly, CCM ™ pulse phase 
durations in the 5-7 ms range were shown in animal experiments to yield the 
desired contractili ty-enhancement effects.  
 
 
                    Figure 30: Delay and Duration of CCM™ Pulse Train  
 
The start of the timing cycle for CCM ™ signal delivery is triggered by [CONTACT_941] “Local 
Sense” event. The delay parameter (coupling interval) is the time interval between the leadi ng edge of the Local Sense triggering event and the start of CCM ™ pulse 
train delivery. With the OMNI II Programmer, the  delay parameter can be set to 
values between 3  ms and 140 ms. To determine the proper programmed setting, 
the following criteria are ap plied:  
 • Programmed value is initiated by [CONTACT_247680] 
• Appropriate programmed value is 35ms after second sensed ventricular event, 
either the RV or LS event, whichever occurs last

a third party without the prior written consent of Impulse Dynamics [LOCATION_003], Inc.  • If LS event is after RV event, programmed value should be 35ms 
• If RV event is af ter LS event, programmed value should be 35ms plus the 
measured RV -LS interval 
 
Further descriptions of the CCM signal are provided in the following sections.  
a. CCM Train Delay  
The Train Delay is a programmable value between 3 and 140 ms in increments of 1 ms. The “Standard” or nominal setting is 35 ms. The purpose of this Train Delay is to ensure the entire ventricular mass (right and left) is depolarized. There is no specific value that would always be correct, since each patient’s conduction system serves  as their own norm. 
 
b. Phase duration 
The phase duration limits the amount of energy delivered to the patient in one event. The phase duration of the pulses comprising the CCM ™ signal can be 
programmed with the OMNI II Programmer to one of 4 possible values between 5.14 ms and 6.60 ms. The duration of both phases is  automatically set to identical 
values. At no time can they be programmed to different values. The nominal setting for this Phase Duration is 5.14 ms.  
 As described by [CONTACT_247679] “Design and Development of Medi cal 
Electronic Instrumentation,”
20 CCM ™ signals consist of charge -balanced 
biphasic pulse burst of 5 to 10 ms in duration per phase; one to three pulses per 
burst delivered [ADDRESS_301141] been shown to be therapeutic when treating patients with CHF. The effectiveness of these signals has been reported by [CONTACT_247681] .
21 
 Programmability of the Phase Duration allows the physician to modulate the intensity of the therapy: Patients with discomfort felt at the time of therapy delivery could be treated by [CONTACT_247682]. If no discomfort is felt at the initiatio n of therapy, the Phase Duration is left at the nominal setting.

exercise tolerance (peak VO 2), quality of life (MLWHFQ score), and functional status (NYHA 
class) in patients with heart failure and EF ranging from 25% to 45%, QRS duration <130 ms, 
normal sinus rhythm and persistent functional class NYHA III or ambulatory IV symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_247524].  These observations are further supported by a 
between -group difference (improvement) in 6MHW distance in excess of 30 meters favoring 
CCM ™ Treatment over Control.  Additional sensitivity analyses further confirmed the 
robus tness of the findings, independent of other assumptions concerning the methods of 
Bayesian borrowing and imputation for deaths and missing data.  Finally, a significant reduction in the composite of cardiac deaths and heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247525] . 
 An analysis of a small subset of the FIX -HF-5 study population (n=38) (further discussed in 
section 6.3 below) suggested that CCM ™ treatment effects were particularly large in patients 
with EF ≥35%.  That finding was also further corroborated when data from an additional [ADDRESS_301142] an indication for an ICD, so that a standalone C CM™ device 
could be applicable.      
In addition to the  data of the present study, the safety of CCM ™ has been consistently 
demonstrated in prior studies .
22,23,3  In particular, the FIX -HF-5 study demo nstrated that 1 -year 
event -free survival was noninferior in the CCM ™ group compared to the Control group22 
Consistent across studies has been the finding that the rate and severity of overall adverse 
events is not significantly different than in the respective control group, despi[INVESTIGATOR_247526] a device implant.    The magni tude of the treatment effect of CCM ™ on peak VO
2 is comparable to those identified 
in patients studied in p rior studies of Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ).  These include 
MIRACLE  (0.9 ml/kg/min)Error! Bookmark not defined., MIRACLE -ICD (1.0 ml/kg/min)Error! 
Bookmark not defined., CONTAC -CD (0.8 ml/kg/min)Error! Bookmark not defined..  Although these studies 
have different entry criteria, they do provide a basis for comparing effects of CCM™ to CRT. The current study also identified a significant reduction of the composite of cardiovascular death  and heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247527].   
 While the current study was too short in duration and included too few patients to fully address survival bene fit, prior studies have provided evidence of beneficial effects on survival and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s. The European registry (CCM -REG, fully discussed in section 5 below) 
provides further evidence of the impact and magnitude of CCM ™ in reducing cardiac 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .

that for patients with EF <35%, a device that combines CCM and ICD functions is under development.  Similarly, indwelling pulmonary artery pressure sensors ar e also applicable and 
help optimize medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_247528], on their own, provide a heart failure therapy.  Thus, there is a relatively large cohort of heart failure patients failing medical therapy that do not have the benefit of a simply implanted device- based therapy.  It is such patients that CCM ™ 
is currently designed to serve.    
Conclusion s 
In summary, the results of the present study supplement and confirm results of prior studies in showing that CCM ™ is safe and improves exercise tolerance an d quality of life in patients 
with EF ranging from 25% to 45%, QRS duration <130 ms, normal sinus rhythm and persistent 
NYHA class III or ambulatory class IV symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_247529].  The composite of cardiovascular deaths and 
heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247530].  The clinical effects were observed across the range of EFs studied, and clinical effectiveness was even greater in patients with EFs between 35 and 45% consistent with the FIX -HF-5 study.

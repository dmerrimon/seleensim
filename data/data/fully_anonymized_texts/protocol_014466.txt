The HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines wil l be administered using the IM or ID  TriGrid™ Delivery 
System ( TDS -IM V1.0  or TDS -ID, respectively ), which uses electroporation (the application of 
electrical pulses to improve the uptake of DNA into the cells ). The system  consists of 3 components: 
a pulse stimulator, an integrated applicator, and a single -use application cartridge. The device is 
manufactured by [CONTACT_550478], Inc, San Diego, [LOCATION_004]. The TDS -IM device in use for 
this study as well as past HTNV and PUUV vaccine trials has been the first version of the device, therefore the name [CONTACT_550557] 5.[ADDRESS_723147] will receive 1 injection on Days 0, 28, and 56 for a total of 3 injections, and subjects 
will be followed up to 6 months after the final vaccination (to Day 220 ).Sentinel subjects will not be 
used for Groups 1 and 3 because the IP dose is lower than the 2.0  mg/mL dose that was previously 
evaluated in human subjects.  
Dosing for sentinels and main study subjects will progress as follows:

02 March 2022 Version 8.0 15 US Government Proprietary  Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety Endpoints : 
1. The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events ( AEs) and/or serious adverse events 
(SAEs ) associated with TDS -EP-based administration of HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines.  
2. The occurrence of solicited local and systemic AEs occurring from the time of each injection 
through 14 days following the procedure (memory aid to assist with the first 14 days)  
3. The occurrence of vaccine -related unsolicited AEs from the time of the first injection through 
[ADDRESS_723159] (approximately [ADDRESS_723160] vaccination)  
5. The occurrence of clinical safety laboratory AEs through 14 days following each study vaccination  
Immunogenicity  Endpoints: 
1. Development and characteristics of an HTNV- specific antibody (PsVNA50 titer) and/or 
PUUV- specific antibody (PsVNA50 titer) of ≥ 1:20.  
2. Determination of the proportion of seropositive subjects (defined as PsVNA50 ≥ 1:20) at 
each scheduled time point (eg , Days 0, 28, 56, 84  and 140) 
3. Determination of the final overall rate of seroconversion over all scheduled time points (eg, Days 0, 28, 56,  84 and 140 ). Seroconversion is defined as a post -vaccination HTNV- or 
PUUV- specific titer of ≥ 1:40, or a minimum four-fold rise compared to baseline titer, and all 
study volunteers will begin the study with a baseline titer < 20 (eg, seronegative).  
4. Determination of GMT of the PsVNA50 for HTNV- and PUUV-specific neutralizing 
antibodies at each scheduled time point (eg, Days 0, 28, 56, 84  and 140). 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
1. Exploratory endpoints, evaluated as part of the immunogenicity objectives, including 
calculation of PsVNA80 titers for HTNV and PUUV may be calculated from the collected 
data for informational purposes, and neutralization assays using other hantavirus PsV (eg, Seoul virus, Dobra va virus) may also be performed to evaluate levels of cross-neutralizing 
antibodies.  
2. Determination of GMT of neutralizing of the PsVNA80 for HTNV- and PUUV- specific 
neutralizing antibodies at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are taken for 
each study group and over all time points for each study group  
3. Determination of GMT of neutralizing of the PsVNA80 for Seoul - and Dobrava -specific 
neutralizing antibodies at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are taken for each study group and over all time points for each study group  
Statistical Methods: 
• Descriptive analysis of safety and reactogenicity outcomes will include all subjects who 
meet the eligibility criteria, receive at least one vaccination, and for whom safety data are available. Summary tables will be  created in which incidence, gradation, and relationship 
to the use of investigational product of individual solicited local and systemic signs, 
symptoms, or unsolicited events are delineated by [CONTACT_2060], severity, gender, an d 
overall. Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will be  analyzed in a similar fashion.  To address the 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022 Version 8.0 16 US Government Proprietary  primary objective of the study, safety and reactogenicity endpoints  will include 
determi ning the nature, frequency, severity , and relatedness of AEs and/or SAEs 
associated with TDS -EP-based administration of HTNV, PUUV, and HTNV/PUUV 
DNA vaccines.  
• To address the secondary objectives of the study, immunogenicity endpoints will be 
evaluated. Descriptive analysis of immunogenicity outcomes will include all subjects 
who me et the eligibility criteria, receive at least one vaccination, and for whom 
serological data a re available. The primary analysis variable will be  the proportion of 
seropositive subjects (defined as P sVNA 50 ≥ 1:20) at each scheduled time point for 
which blood samples are taken  (eg, Days 0, 28, 56,  84 and 140) and the final overall rate 
of seroconversion over all scheduled time points to study completion for each study group.  Seroconversion is defined as a post -vaccination HTNV- or PUUV-specific titer of 
≥ 1:40, or a minimum four -fold rise compared to baseline titer and all study volunteers 
will begin the study with a baseline titer <  20 (ie, seronegative). For each study group, a 
binomial proportion and 95%  confidence interval (CI) w ill be  calculated. The secondary 
analysis variable will be  GMT s, with 95% CIs, of the PsVNA50 for HTNV- and PUUV-
specific antibodies at each scheduled time point for which blood samples a re taken for 
each study group and over all time points for each study group. G MTs, standard errors, 
and 95% CIs w ill be  calculated using log -transformed titers . For titers  below the lower 
limit of detection (<  20), the value will be transformed to a value equal to the lower limit 
of detection ( ie, 20) divided by [CONTACT_550479] 2, which equals  14.1. Exploratory 
objectives may evaluate PsVNA80 titers, which may be calculated for informational 
purposes, and may evaluate PsVNA50 titers against related Seoul and Dobrava viruses.  
• For hematology and s erum chemistry tests, any clinically significant changes from 
baseline value will be  identified. The median, interquartile range, and normal values for 
each laboratory value (as determined by [CONTACT_550480]) will be  reported for each 
treatment gro up for each specimen collection point.  
Sentinel Group Halting Rules: 
The following halting rules will be applied in the 48  hours following sentinel group vaccination (n = 2 
subjects per cohort) for review by [CONTACT_550481]

The genus Hantavirus  of the family Bunyaviridae  includes more than 20 viruses known to cause 
human infections ( Jonsson et al, 2010 ). The hantavirus family has a propensity for regional 
variation , although the viruses were evolutionarily likely derived from a common ancestor 
approximately 2000 years ago  (Souza, 2014 ). Like other bunyaviruses, hantaviruses are 
spherical, lipid membrane -enclosed viruses containing 3 negative -sense RNA segments encoding 
a small number of proteins. In hantaviruses, these segments include the following: a large (L) 
segment that  encodes the RNA -dependent RNA polymerase; a medium (M) segment that 
encodes 2  envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc, formerly G1 and G2, respectively); and a small 
(S) segment that encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) ( Schmaljohn and Nichol , 2007 ). 
Antibodies to both GN and GC have been demonstrated to be protective in passive antibody 
studies in rodents  (Custer et al, 2003; Hooper et al, 2008; Schmaljohn 2009; Brocato et al, 2012 ; 
Hooper et al, 2013; Brocato et al, 2014 ). 
Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide a mong various rodent host populations. Transmission to 
humans occurs primarily through the inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine or feces or through 
the bite of an infected animal. Infection with hantaviruses can result in a range of clinical presentations  from asymptomatic to life threatening. Four of the hantaviruses, Hantaan virus 
(HTNV), Dobrava virus, Seoul virus, and Puumala virus (PUUV), have been described in association with the potentially life -threatening hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HF RS) 
(Peters, 2010
). While each of these viruses is endemic to different regions, there is some overlap. 
HFRS is a prolonged, multistage disease that can cause fever, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, and acute renal insufficiency. Mortality rates as high as 15% have been reported, and full recovery in survivors may require weeks to months (
Jonsson et al, 2010 ; Peters, 2010 ). 
Other hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus in North America and Andes virus in South America, have been associated with hantavirus pulmonary syn drome, another potentially 
life-threatening condition characterized  by a febrile prodrome followed by a severe but 
temporary increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and shock. Mor tality rates for this 
presentation now range from 35% to 40% ( CDC, 2012; Simpson et al, 2010
). 
Treatment for hantavirus infections includes primarily supportive care measures. Use of 
antivirals such as ribavirin has demonstrated mixed results ( Peters, 2010 ). Preventive measures 
include avoidance of rodents and their excreta. In regions of the world where HFRS is endemic, 
virus- specific inactivated -virus vaccines have been developed. However,  reports on efficacy of 
these vaccines have been mixed ( Schmaljohn, 2009; Hammerbeck et al, 2009 ). 
4.1. Military Relevance 
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not licensed a vaccine for (virus- specific or 
generalized) HFRS . Vaccine efforts against hantaviruses have been under way s ince 1990, and 
an inactivated rodent brain or cell culture -derived HFRS vaccine is available in China with 
millions of doses administered  (Zhang, 2010 ). An inactivated vaccine by [CONTACT_550487]™ has some efficacy against Puumala and Dobrava- Belgrade v iruses ( Cho, 1999 ) 
although no licensed products exist in Europe or the U nited States . Hantaviruses are found 
worldwide in wild rodent populations. Combat and noncombat operations within these environs 
may place US military personnel at risk of exposure and disease, from one or more regional 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723185] recognized during the Korean War (the name 
[CONTACT_550558]) where it was a major cause of noncombat -
related morbidity and mortality among US and allied forces.  Specifica lly, over 1,[ADDRESS_723186], with an overall mortality of 5 % to 10%. 
From 2000 to 2009, US forces in Korea experienced 8  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 72 ambulatory visits 
for hantavirus infections. The risk posed by [CONTACT_550488]  ([LOCATION_003]MRDC ) to develop an effective combined- virus vaccine against the viruses that 
cause HFRS.  
4.2. Rationale for Study  
The development of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) vaccines, such as those to be utilized in this 
study, is based on the observation that antigen-encoding DNA plasmids can induce both cellular and humoral immune responses against various viral and bacter ial pathogens. DNA vaccines are 
perceived as having a number of potential advantages over other types of vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines are easily constructed by [CONTACT_460848]; easily and inexpensively 
manufactured as a well -characterized mol ecule [ DNA plasmid ]; and at boost, not eliminated by 
[CONTACT_550489]. Furthermore, as nonliving vaccines, they cannot lead to infection. The object of DNA vaccination is to deliver DNA into the nuclei of cells capable of presenting the encoded antigen to immune reactive cells that  can elicit an immune 
response (Ingolotti et al, 2010; Ledgerwood and Graham, 2009
). 
Electroporation (EP) delivery was shown to be a very effective means of inducing antibody responses to HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines in animals and has also been found to be effective 
in eliciting immune responses in humans with several other types of DNA vaccines (
Hooper et 
al, 2008 ; Hooper et al, 2013; Spik et al, 2008 ). These data led to the Phase 1 clinical study at the 
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) , which demonstra ted that administration of 
the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines both alone or in combination using an EP device to deliver 
intramuscular (IM) injections  not only was safe but also provided improved seroconversion rates 
to both viruses ( Hooper et al, 2014 ). This first IM -EP study was performed using the codon-
optimized PUUV plasmid, but the HTNV plasmid had not yet been codon optimized. 
Results from the Phase 1 IM -EP study prompted the decision to pursue a larger, Phase 2a study. 
This study evaluat ed the combination of HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, at 1.0 or 2.0 mg 
doses, as well as 2 different dosing schedules (2 doses v ersus 3, over a 2-month period, with a 
booster dose at Day 168). The study also used the Ichor EP devi ce from the previous study 
performed at WRAIR  to deliver vaccine by [CONTACT_550490] (ID) inoculation . The HTNV 
vaccine was different than the iteration used in the Phase 1 study, as the HTNV plasmid 
(pWRG/HTN- M[co]) ha d an optimized open-reading frame and was  predicted to produce a 
higher seroconversion rate when combined with the PUUV vaccine. The need for an improved 
HTNV vaccine was evidenced by [CONTACT_550491], rabbits, and humans (from the first 
Phase 1 study), which indicated that delivery of a mixture of the HTNV and PUUV vaccines resulted in a reduced response to the HTNV vaccine as compared to when it was delivered by 
[CONTACT_5071]  (Spik et al , 2008 ; Schmaljohn et al, 2014 ; Hooper et al, 2014
). This interference was 
overcome by [CONTACT_550492] [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723187] expression and/or messenger RNA stability (unpublished information). Preliminary 
results from the Phase 2a study confirm that a mixture of the codon- optimized HTNV DNA 
vaccine and the codon- optimized PUUV DNA vaccine delivered by [CONTACT_550493] e to elicit strong 
responses to both HTNV and PUUV (unpublished results). This Phase 2a clinical study has been 
completed with follow-up ongoing. Study results have not been finalized, but there have been no 
related severe AEs to date, with preliminary fin dings consistent with what was seen in the earlier 
Phase 1 study using the same IM -EP device.  
The rationale for dosages and plan of routes of IM compared to ID administration  in the current 
Phase 1 study  is based on prior work by [CONTACT_550494] (Ichor Medical 
Systems)  and prior experience from the previous HTNV DNA and PUUV DNA vaccine clinical 
study in which candidate vaccines were shown to elicit antibodies in humans when administered by [CONTACT_550475].  This study affords the opportunity to compare the IM and ID routes of administration, 
at the highest possible doses, given the limitations of the volumes that can be administered by [CONTACT_550495] (1 mL and 0.2 mL, respectively). This study is being performed to determine 
which of IM or ID elicits a superior immune response, given the amount of DNA administered using these routes.  
4.3. Name [CONTACT_550559] 21 CFR 3.2 (e) a combination product is a product composed of any combination of a drug and a device; a biological product and a device; a drug and a biological product; or a drug, 
device, and a biological product. The investigational product used in this study is a combination 
of a DNA vaccine and a device.  The 2 investigational products, HTNV and PUUV DNA 
vaccines, were manufactured by [CONTACT_350783], Inc., San Diego, [LOCATION_004], from their 
respective drug substances, pWRG/HTN- M(co) and pWRG/PUU V-M(s2) , in accordance with 
current good manufacturing practice (c GMP)  guidelines, and were constructed on a well -
characterized plasmid backbone, pWRG7077. 
The HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines will be administered individually and in combination by 
[CONTACT_550496] ™ Delivery System s (TDS -IM 
V1.0 or TDS- ID, respectively ), manufactured by [CONTACT_550478], San Diego, [LOCATION_004].

and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550430].  
Refer to Section  6.[ADDRESS_723188] been evaluated in several preclinical, good 
laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity studies . In support of a Phase 1 clinical study, the HTNV and 
PUUV DNA vaccines were administered to rabbits using the TDS -IM V1.0 device (Ichor, San 
Diego, [LOCATION_004]) (Hooper et al , 2014 ). 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022 Version 8.0 31 US Government Proprietary  In support of this protocol, a repeat -dose toxicity study evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, 
and potential target organ toxicity of HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines alone or in combination 
in New Zealand White rabbits when administered IM or ID with EP  (unpublished results) . 
Toxicity and reversibility of effects after a 4 -week recovery period were also evaluated. Each 
group consisted of 10 rabbits/sex/group, as follows: Group 1, Saline (control), IM and ID 
without EP ; Group 2, HTNV (3.0 mg), IM with EP ; Group 3, HTNV (1.2 mg), ID with EP ; 
Group 4, HTNV (3.0 mg) + PUUV (3.0 mg), IM with EP ; Group 5, HTNV (1.2 mg) + PUUV 
(1.2 mg), ID with EP ; and Group 6, PUUV (1.2 mg), ID with EP. 
Overall , administration of the HTNV vaccine alone, the PUUV vaccine alone, or the HTNV + 
PUUV vaccines together by [CONTACT_550497], as all findings were 
generally reversible and no longer seen at the end of the recovery period (except for the histopathologic findings at the injection sites), and none of these findings resulted in any limiting 
toxicity. The histopathologic findings at the injection sites were considered to be typi[INVESTIGATOR_550431]. These vaccines were also 
biologically active and immunogenic as all vaccine-treated rabbits regardless of dosing route and 
type of vaccine administered (either alone or in combination) developed neutralizing antibodies against the respective HTNV or PUUV viruses as measured by [CONTACT_550498].  
The plasmid vector backbone in the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines is pWRG7077. This is the 
same backbone used for several different DNA vaccine p lasmids delivered by [CONTACT_550499]’s EP 
delivery system. Thus, the vector backbone has been tested in multiple safety studies in addition to those with the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines; eg, studies supporting a Phase [ADDRESS_723189] tissues and DNA  (Hannaman et al, 2016
). 
In other safety and toxicology studies using different DNA vaccine vector  backbones, notable 
findings associated with EP- mediated delivery of DNA vaccines were limited to localized 
inflammatory responses of mild to moderate severity at the site of administration ( Dolter et al, 
2011 ). The injection site findings were most prominent in tissue samples obtained at 48  to 72 
hours after administration with progressive resolution of the local inflammatory responses over 
time (samples assessed at [ADDRESS_723190] -injection).  
The results of the pWRG7077- based DNA vaccine biodistribution studies indicated negligible 
systemic uptake of vaccine DNA following IM EP delivery with no significant differences 
observed among the different DNA vaccine candidates tested to date. Persistence analysis indicated that the presence of vaccine DNA 30 to 90 days after administration was confined to 
the tissues at the site of administration (muscle and skin), and only at very low (ie, < 1,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/µg) levels, suggesting minimal risk for potential integration of vaccine DNA into host DNA ( Dolter et al, 2011
).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 
Hantaan and Puumala Virus DNA Vaccines, pWRG/HTN- M(x) and 
pWRG/PUU- M(s2), for Prevention of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers Using the TDS -IM Electroporation 
Delivery Device (S -11-12, WRAIR 1854) 
The HTNV DNA and PUUV DNA v accine products  were previously administered to  31 healthy 
human subjects via the Ichor EP device in a Phase 1 study conducted at the Walter R eed A rmy 
Institute of R esearch , Silver Spring, Maryland, from January 2012 to January 2013 
(Hooper, et  al, 2014 ). In this study, 27 subjects received 3 doses at 2 mg/mL per dose of HTNV 
DNA vaccine, PUUV DNA vaccine, or a combination of HTNV DNA and PUUV DNA vaccines 
over a 2-month period by [CONTACT_52596] . Two other subjects received 2 doses of the HTNV DNA 
vaccin es and 2 subjects received 1 dose of the HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccine.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Immunogenicity Results  
Subjects were vaccinated with an HTNV DNA vaccine, PUUV DNA vaccine, or combination of HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccines using TDS- IM V1.0. Both the HTNV DNA vaccine and PUUV 
DNA vaccine were immunogenic in humans when delivered alone or in combination. For 
subjects receiving at least [ADDRESS_723191],  was 71% (20 of 28) . The seroconversion rates for HTNV  DNA, 
PUUV DNA, and HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccines were 68%, 78%, and 44% (against both HTNV 
and PUUV), respectively. The lower seroconversion rate against both viruses in the combination 
group can be attributed to the lower frequency of anti-HTNV seroconversion in that group (44%) 
relative to the rate of anti -PUUV seroconversion in the same group (78%). For seroconverters, 
peak geometric mean titers (GMT s) for all 3 groups were between 100 and 1,000 regardless of 
whether the plasmid was delivered alone or in combination (the combination wa s half -dose for 
each plasmid). In general, peak titers occurred within [ADDRESS_723192] vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies were still detected in 70% (14/20) of t he seroconverters [ADDRESS_723193] vaccination . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Safety Results  
During the performance of the TDS- IM V1.0 study, there were no significant safety concerns 
involving the investigational products. Overall, 30/31 (96.8%) subjects receiving at least 1 dose 
of HTNV DNA, PUUV DNA, or HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccines  reported at leas t 1 AE. Of the 
246 AEs reported, 96.7% we re graded as mild to moderate. Seven  out of 8 AEs identified as 
either Grade 3 or Grade 4 were considered  unrelated to the study vaccine ; 1 Grade 3  AE was 
considered unlikely  to be related.  There were 2 SAEs  reported during this study, both involving 
transient Grade 4 lab oratory  abnormalities detected in otherwise asymptomatic individuals 
(hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia, respectively) . Each event was evaluated and determined to be 
unrelated to study participation. 
Seventy- six incidents of injection site pain  were reported in 28/31 (90.3% ) subjects, accounting 
for 30.9% of all AEs. The other most commonly reported AEs were headache (5.7%), injection 
site bruising  (3.7%), muscle aches (3 .3%), and fatigue (3 .3%). Ninety -six/246 (39.0%) AEs were

(pain, bruising, or erythema).

Safety, Reactogenicity, and Immunogenicity of a Venezuelan Equine 
Encephalitis DNA Vaccine Candidate Administered Intramuscularly or Intradermally by [CONTACT_550486] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
In a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a DNA- based Venezuelan 
Equine Encephalitis vaccine, pWRG/VEE, or placebo control was administered to 41 healthy, 
adult subjects using either the Ichor TDS -IM V1.0 or TDS -ID EP devices (
Hannaman, et al, 
2016 ). Subjects received up to 3 administrations of the pWRG/VEEV vaccine. Subjects in the 
TDS -IM V1.0 groups received 0.5 mg (N = 8) or 2.0 mg (N = 9) of pWRG/VEE or a saline 
placebo (N = 4) in a 1.0- mL injection. Subjects in the TDS-ID groups received 0.08 mg (N = 8) 
or 0.3 mg (N = 8) of pWRG/VEE or a saline placebo (N = 4) in a 0.15- mL injection. Subjects 
were monitored for a total of 360 days. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Immunogeni city 
VEEV -neutralizing antibodies in sera were measured by [CONTACT_550500] 
(PRNT). All subjects (100%) in the high - and low -dose TDS- IM V1.0 groups developed 
detectable VEEV -neutralizing antibodies after 2 or 3 administrations of pWRG/VEE, 
respectiv ely. After [ADDRESS_723194] immunization (Study Day 70), with a 
geometric mean PRNT titer of 43.[ADDRESS_723195] (Day 360), with5 of 8 subjects in the 0.3- mg TDS ID 
group and 1 of 8 subjects in the 0.08- mg TDS -ID group exhibiting detectable PRNT acti vity. 
There was a correlation between the DNA dose and the magnitude of the resulting VEEV-
neutralizing antibody responses for both IM and ID EP delivery. Thes e results indicated that 
pWRG/VEE delivered by [CONTACT_550501] -IM V1.0 or TDS -ID EP is safe, tolerable, and 
immunogenic in humans at the evaluated dose levels. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Safety  
No vaccine- or device- related serious adverse events were reported for either EP device.  
Adver se reactions associated with the use of the TDS -ID device included acute pain at the time 
of EP application in almost all subjects. Mild, transient bleeding at the sites of electrode 
penetration was commonly observed following removal of the device. These included injection site pain, erythema, induration, swelling, tenderness, bruising, punctures at the site of needle 
penetration, eschar formation at the site of needle penetration, and/or localized pi[INVESTIGATOR_152115]. The associated injection site reacti ons typi[INVESTIGATOR_62465] 24-[ADDRESS_723196] possibly related to the vaccine

acute tolerability of TDS -ID EP delivery judged to be greater than that of TDS- IM V1.0 EP 
delivery. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. DNA Vaccine Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers using the TDS -IM 
Electroporation Delivery Device for Prevention of Hemorrhagic Fever with 
Renal  Syndrome (S-14-01, WRAIR 2085) 
Results from  the Phase 1 study prompted the decision to pursue a larger, Phase 2a study. This 
study evaluated the combination of HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, at 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg doses, 
as well as 2 different dosing schedules (2 doses versus 3, over a 2 -month period, with a booster 
dose at Day 168). The study also used the Ichor EP device from the previous study performed at 
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The HTNV vaccine was different than the iteration 
used in the Phase 1 study, as the HTNV plasmid (pWRG/HTN-M[co]) had an optimized open-
reading frame and was predicted to produce a higher seroconversion rate when combined with the PUUV vaccine. This study has been completed. Study results have not been finalized, but 
there have been no related severe AEs to date, with prelimi nary findings consistent with what 
was seen in the Phase [ADDRESS_723198]- related reasons.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Delivery Device  
The TDS- IM V1.0 and TDS- ID devices are investigational.  To date, the TDS- IM V1.0 device 
has been used as the means of administration in a total of 25 completed and ongoing clinical studies of DNA based vaccine candidates, with > [ADDRESS_723199] been dosed using the TDS- IM V1.0 device in 
these studies (including subjects receiving either the test DNA or placebo). Subjects have been

4.5.1. Risks/Discomfort to Subjects and Precautions to Minimize Risk  
The following safety profile is based on the aforementioned clinical stud ies with HTNV DNA 
and PUUV DNA vaccines , plus a VEEV DNA vaccine trial led by [CONTACT_550499], and includes a brief 
description of possible procedures to ameliorate risks and symptoms. The potential risks of this 
trial are those associated with having blood drawn, use of the TDS- IM V1.[ADDRESS_723202] or device. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Local Reactions 
Local reactions in previous studies have included pain, stinging, itching, bruising, tingling, 
numbness and redness at the injection site  (deltoid muscle or associated skin in that area of the 
arm), and sometimes af fecting the arm distal to the site. Information about local reactions are 
described below for each device type. 
TDS -IM V1.0 D evice:  
Adverse reactions associated with the use of the TDS -IM V1.[ADDRESS_723203] all subj ects include acute pain with localized muscle contractions during 
the application of the electrical fields. In the TDS- IM V1.0 study of the hantavirus DNA 
vaccines, brief, but intense, muscle contractions and associated local pain/discomfort during the 
period of EP administration were observed in essentially all subjects . Additional AEs associated 
with the administration procedure included minor, transient cutaneous bleeding at the sites of 
electrode and injection needle penetration, and mild to moderate in jection site soreness/bruising 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_550432] [ADDRESS_723204] also reported mild, transient paresthesia (tingling) or hypoesthesia (numbness) in the injected limb or fingers for a few seconds or minutes following 
electric field application. Over the 24 -72 hours after administration, administration site soreness, 
erythema, induration and/or eschar formation of mild to moderate severity are commonly 
reported. Other injection site findings of mild severity including bruising and/or hematoma have 
been reported occasionally. The associated injection site reactions have typi[INVESTIGATOR_550433] 24–[ADDRESS_723205] administration.

IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723206] on the bone. The TDS- IM V1.0 device registered an error code  
and no vaccine was delivered. This was believed to be due to an inaccurate measurement of skinfold thickness. Following the incident, associated adverse events wer e limited to mild 
transient soreness at the penetration site. Although the specific cause of this event could not be 
definitively established based on the available information, inspection of the device was 
sufficient to rule out device malfunction (ie, th e needle did not penetrate beyond the specified 
depth setting). To ensure intramuscular injection, proper selection of the injection site as well as 
assessment and setting of the injection depth are important factors in procedure administration. 
In particu lar, care should be taken in specific subjects or subject populations with low muscle 
mass (eg, sarcopenia) to ensure that an administration site with adequate muscle thickness (eg, 
vastus lateralis) is selected for injection. Specifically, any selected ad ministration site should 
have sufficient muscle mass to accommodate the 1 -inch/25-mm maximum penetration depth of 
the device.  To mitigate the risk of this happening again, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_550434], designated 
personnel with PI [INVESTIGATOR_550435]. This should decrease the possibility of inter- rater variability errors 
in measurement and avoid overest imations of soft tissue girth. The measurement may be 
repeated, as needed, throughout the study or if any study team member has a concern about the accuracy of the measurement (eg,  if there seems to be a discrepancy between the volunteer’s 
body habitus and the indicated depth setting for the TDS- IM V1.[ADDRESS_723207] been no occurrences of excessive energy delivery in any of the nonclinical and clinical studies conducted with the pulse stimulator to date.  
TDS -ID Device:  
To date, the TDS-ID device has been used as the means of DNA vaccine administration in one completed and [ADDRESS_723208] been published (Hannaman et al, 2016). Adverse reactions associated with 
the use of the TDS -ID device include acute pain at the time of electroporation application in 
almost all subjects. Mild, transient bleeding at the sites of electrode penetration was commonly 
observed following removal of the device. These included injection site pain, erythema, 
induration, swelling, tenderness, bruising, punctures at the site of needle penetration, eschar 
formation at the site of needle penetration, and/or localized pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]. The associated injection site reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_550436] 24 -72 hours following 
administration. 
Consistent with the clinical safety experience from the VEEV DNA vaccine study, interim safety 
reports from the 2 ongoing clinical studies utilizing the TDS- ID device (clinicaltrials.gov # 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and EUDRA CT# 2014-001997-33) have included mild to moderate injection site reactions including minor bruising and hematoma at the sites of administration. 
No serious adverse events attributed to the device or administration procedure have been 
observed to date during a ny of the clinical studies utilizing the TDS -ID device.

The systemic reactions that have been reported in previous studies using the investigational vaccines, together with these devices or similar devices, included fatigue , headache, tachypnea, 
and myalgia. Information about risks for systemic reactions are described below for each device. 
TDS -IM V1.0  Device:  
Experience with the TDS- IM V1.0 device indicates that mild to moderate vasovagal reactions are 
possible. Transient vasovagal reactions, comprising mild dizziness, skin pallor, diaphoresis, 
lightheadedness, and/or hypotension  (consistent with pre -syncope) occurring immediately after 
device application, have been reported in approximately 1% of subjects. Vasovagal reactions including three instances of vasovagal syncope were also reported immediately after administration procedure in clinical testing to date. Two of the cases were described as vasovagal 
syncope associated with tonic- clonic or seizure -like muscle movements. Both cases of vasovagal 
syncope with tonic- clonic or seizure -like muscle movements manifested after the subjects had 
received sequential bilateral EP injections u sing the TDS-IM v1.[ADDRESS_723209] and/or delivery device have been generally mild to moderate in severity and 
include flu- like symptoms, headache, fever, nausea, chills, dizziness, malaise, fatigue, arthralgia, 
myalgia, neuralgia, and aphthous stomatitis. Several subjects have reported individual instances 
of severe fatigue within [ADDRESS_723210] included ALT/AST, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, non-fasting glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Among these, elevation in serum 
creatine phosphokinase of mild to moderate severity in small minority of subjects has judged to 
be potentially associated with procedure administration. One instance of Grade [ADDRESS_723211] and was diagnosed as an unrecognized pre- existing condition.

IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022 Version 8.0 38 US Government Proprietary  TDS -ID device:  
Systemic adverse events judged to be at least possibly related to the vaccine candidate or the 
TDS -ID administration pro cedure were all grade 1 or 2 and included fatigue, headache, low 
grade fever, dizziness, enlarged lymph nodes, elevated blood pressure. In rare cases, syncope has been reported in subjects receiving intramuscular injections with the TDS technology ( TDS -IM 
V1.0). Monitoring for these and other systemic symptoms commonly seen in investigational 
vaccine studies (eg, fever, chills, rash, nausea, and allergic reaction) will be performed 
throughout the study and addressed as required to maximize subject safety.  
No serious systemic adverse events attributed to the device or administration procedure have 
been observed to date during any of the clinical studies utilizing the TDS-ID device. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. DNA Vaccine Investigational Product Risks  
It is important to note that this protocol investigates a combination product, which is the DNA 
vaccine product together with the TDS delivery device, and that risks for the [ADDRESS_723212] been reported in previous studies using the investigational 
vaccines with these and other devices included fatigue, headache, tachypnea, and myalgia. 
Light- headedness/dizziness, which in one case progressed to syncope, has also been reported. 
Monitoring for these and other systemic symptoms commonly seen in investigational vaccine 
studies (eg , fever, chills, rash, nausea, and allergic reaction) will be performed throughout the 
study and addressed as required to maximiz e subject safety.  
Research from this program has shown that these DNA vaccines do not cause infection with the target viruses, nor do they cause integration of the vaccine DNA into the test subject. 
The HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines do not contain live virus and encode only a portion of the 
HTNV and PUUV viral genome, which is insufficient to support production of live virus. 
Therefore, there is no basis to expect that these candidates may cause infection . The FDA 
considered safety measurements appropriate bas ed on results of preclinical and clinical studies 
performed using DNA vaccines with the same plasmid backbone (pWRG7077). Persistence analysis in a study using a similar DNA vaccine vector indicated that the presence of vaccine 
DNA 30 to 90 days after admi nistration was confined to the tissues at the site of administration 
(muscle and skin), and only at very low (ie, < 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/µg) levels, suggesting minimal risk 
for potential integration of vaccine DNA into host DNA ( Dolte r et al, 2011
). The TDS- IB also 
describes acceptable biodistribution safety data for the VEE vaccine based in the pWRG -7077 
backbone, which is the vector used in this study. In addition, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Resear ch (CBER) guidance entitled Considerations for Plasmid DNA Vaccines for 
Infectious Disease, dated November 2007, stipulates that “biodistribution studies may be waived 
for DNA vaccines produced by [CONTACT_4859] a novel gene into a plasmid vector previously 
documented to have an acceptable biodistribution/integration profile.” 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Risks to unborn babies are unknown at this time; pregnant females will be excluded from this 
study.

menopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months without menses). Study subjects should not become pregnant during the study and for at  least [ADDRESS_723214] study vaccination (see inclusion criteria). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lactation 
Risks to nursing infants are unknown at this time; lactating  females will be excluded from this 
study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Venipuncture  
Blood sampling carries a minimal risk of minor discomfort and the possibility of minor bruising 
at the site of the needle puncture and, rarely, the possibility of infection at the needle puncture 
site.
 Venipuncture causes transient discomfort and may result in fainting. Fainting is usually 
transient and managed by [CONTACT_226295]/her legs. Bruising at the 
site of the venipuncture may occur but may be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_550502]. Venipuncture may also cause infection. The use of aseptic (sterile) 
technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn extremely unlikely. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Allergic Reaction  
As with any Investigational New Drug (IND) product administration and no matter what 
precautions are taken, there is always the risk of a serious, or even life- threatening, allergic 
reaction. To  mitigate this risk, potential subjects with a history of severe allergic reaction of any 
kind, or significant allergic reaction to a known component of the experimental products , will be 
excluded from participation. Medical emergency equipment is located at the University of

anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Guillain -Barré Syndrome  
Guillain -Barré syndrome (GBS) is a disorder in which the body’ s immune system attacks part of 
the peripheral nervous system. It afflicts only about one person in 100,000, and in rare instances 
vaccinations may increase the risk of GBS. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying 
degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. These symptoms can increase in intensity 
until certain muscles cannot be used at all. Most individuals recover from even the most severe cases of Guillain -Barré syndrome, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness 
(NIH, 2011
). To mitigate this risk, individuals with a history of GBS, other neurologic diseases 
per the physician investigator’s discretion, or other significant reaction to vaccination will be excluded from participation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unknown Risks  
Furthermore, as with all research there is the remote possibility of risks that are unknown or that 
cannot be foreseen based on available  information. This would include late effects that have been 
seen with some vaccines. The long- term effects on EP -mediated delivery of DNA is not known. 
4.5.2. Alternatives to T his IND Product or Study  
At this time, there is no known alternative to taking this product to afford the same potential protection from HFRS. An alternative is not to participate in this study.  
4.5.3. Intended Benefit for Subjects  
There  is no intended direct benefit for study subjects.  
4.5.4. Risks to the Study Personnel and the Environment  
The principal risk in the clinical setting is (eg, in the handling of needles that may be contaminated and the attendant risks including hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other human pathogens). Adherence to standard operating procedures (SOP) for working 
with infectious agents and universal precautions will reduce the risk of exposure. 
Injury to operators is possible if the electroporation d evices are handled improperly; therefore , 
these devices are for use only by [CONTACT_550503] a training 
course on the set up and use of the TDS systems.  
There are no known risks to the environment other than those associated with the generation of 
biohazardous waste attendant to HTNV and PUUV vaccination of humans. All biohazardous 
waste will be disposed of as stipulated by [CONTACT_5737], state, and Federal regulations and in accordance 
with study site SOPs. 
4.5.5. Risks to Subject Confidenti ality  
Efforts will be made to keep subject personal information confidential  within the limits of the 
law. There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_550504]. In order to maintain confidentiality, study physicians and the study team will store study 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723218] personal information may be disclosed if 
required by [CONTACT_550505] D evelopment Command [LOCATION_003]MRDC , the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Maryland, and/or the Federal 
Drug Administration (FDA), who will be allowed to inspect sections of medical and research 
records r elated to the study. The risks of storing subject samples for use in possible future 
research studies or having them used in future research studies are those associated with possible 
loss of confidentiality. Subject samples will be labeled only by a code and will not be labeled 
with subject name [CONTACT_352049]. 
4.6. Route of Administration, Dosage Regimen, Treatment Period, and 
Rationale  
Subjects will receive HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN -M(co), and PUUV DNA vaccine, 
pWRG/PUU -M(s2), administered separately and as a mixture using the TDS -IM V1.[ADDRESS_723219] dosage, schedule, and mode of administration.

• To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the HTNV, PUUV, and HTNV/ PUUV 
DNA vaccine candidates delivered to healthy adults either IM  or ID  by [CONTACT_151658]. 
5.2. Secondary O bjectives  
• To obtain a preliminary assessment of the immunogenicity of the combination 
HTNV/ PUUV DNA vaccine candidate relative to the monovalent formulations. 
• To identify the HTNV and/or PUUV DNA vaccine combination and route of 
administration that elicits the most immunogenic response as determined by 
[CONTACT_550471], and geometric mean titers (GMT) as measured by [CONTACT_550472]50.

02 March 2022 Version 8.0 44 US Government Proprietary  6. TRIAL DESIGN  
6.1. Study Endpoints  
Primary endpoints, correlating to the primary objective of the study, will include determining the 
nature, frequency, and severity of AEs and/or SAEs associated with TDS- EP-based 
administration of HTNV, PUUV and HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccines.  
• The occurrence of solicited local and systemic AEs occurring from the time of each injection through 14 days following the procedure  
• The occurrence of vaccine- related  unsolicited AEs from the time of the first injection 
through 28 days following each injection 
• The occurrence of SAEs from the time of the first injection through the final study visit (approximately [ADDRESS_723220] vaccin ation) 
• The occurrence of clinical safety laboratory AEs through 14 days following each study vaccination 
Secondary endpoints, correlating to the secondary objectives of the study will be to determine 
the proportion of seropositive subjects (P sVNA50  ≥ 1:20)  and the final overall rate of 
seroconversion over all scheduled time points to study completion for each study group. G MT 
will be calculated using PsVNA50.  
• Determination of the proportion of seropositive subjects (defined as PsVNA50 ≥ 1:20) at each scheduled time point (eg , Days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 140) 
• Determination of the final overall rate of seroconversion over all scheduled time 
points to study completion for each study group. Seroconversion is defined as a post-
vaccination HTNV - or PUUV- specific titer of ≥ 1:40, or a minimum four -fold rise 
compared to baseline titer , and all study volunteers will begin the study with a 
baseline titer < 20 ( ie, seronegative ). 
• Determination of GMT  of the PsVNA50 for HTNV- and PUUV- specific neutralizing 
antibodies at each scheduled time point for each study group and over all time points 
for each study group. 
Exploratory endpoints, evaluated as part of the immunogenicity objectives, including calculation 
of PsVNA80 titers for HTNV and PUUV may be calculated from the collected  data for 
informational purposes, and neutralization assays using other hantavirus PsV (eg, Seoul virus, Dobrava virus ) may also  be performed to evaluate levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies. 
• Determination of GMT  of neutralizing of the PsVNA80 for HTNV- and PUUV -
specific neutralizing antibodies at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are taken for each study group and over all time points for each study group 
• Determination of GMT  of neutralizing of the PsVNA80 for Seoul- and Dobrava-

humans previously in a recent clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA 
vaccine for Venezuelan encephalitis virus ( Hannaman  et al,  2016 ). These same codon-optimized 
HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccine products have also been tested in humans previously, albeit 
only using the TDS -IM V1.0 EP device, and at lower dose level s than proposed in this study. 
Previous studies examined these vaccines in Phase 1 ( Hooper et al, 2014 ) and 2a clinical trials at 
up to 2- mg dose levels per IM EP admi nistration , whereas this study is testing up to 6 mg of 
DNA per administration  using the 2 devices. The GLP repeat -dose rabbit toxicology and 
immunogenicity study performed in support of this study administered these same codon-
optimized HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines at up to 6 mg doses using the 2 devices and at an 
increased dosing frequency compared to this proposed Phase 1 cl inical trial design. The rabbit 
toxicology study did not reveal safety concerns for the use of this higher dose level and with these 2  devices.  
This study will be a  single -center, randomized, study of the HTNV, PUUV, and combined 
HTNV/ PUUV DNA vaccines delivered IM and ID by [CONTACT_151658].  
The study may  enroll 6 randomized groups of 12 subjects each  for a total of 82 subjects (This 
accounts for 10 replacement subjects for Group 6, impacted by [CONTACT_4113]). The study had initially 
planned to enroll [ADDRESS_723224] 60 subjects complete all vaccinations at around 10 subjects per group, taking possible attrition into account. Subjects will receive one dose of vaccine on each of Days 0, 28, and 56 and will be followed until Day 220.

during shipment/transportation of the vaccines will not incur a protocol deviation.  
6.4.3. Investigational Product Prepa ration  
The University of Maryland’s Investigational Drug Services (IDS) will prepare the vaccin es for 
administration. A supplementary document entitled “ Manual of Procedures”  has been supplied to 
the University of Maryland CVD describing the procedures to be followed when preparing the vaccines for administration. Briefly, the products to be administered in Groups 1-[ADDRESS_723246] concentration for dosing; these groups are all single 
vaccine component groups. For the groups that are administered combination product (Groups 5 
and 6), the HTNV and PUUV vaccines will be mixed with each other at a 1:[ADDRESS_723247] preparation, the volumes of each component to be 
combined, the supplies to be used (eg, syringes or other device-specific requirements), and any data collection forms for recording procedures as they are performed.  
6.4.4. Investigational Product Accountability  
The sponsor’s representative is responsible for overseeing the distribution of the investigational 
product to the study site. In this study, investigational product refers to both the vialed vaccine, 
diluent,  and the single -use cartridges associated with the TDS -IM V1.0 and TDS- ID devices. The 
sponsor’s representative has delegated drug accountability responsibility for this product to The University of Maryland’s Investigational Drug Services (IDS) under the supervision of the PI ; 
however, the sponsor’s representative has ultimate responsibility for product accountability. 
After the investigational product is distributed, the  IDS is responsible for and will maintain logs 
of investigational product receipt, storage, reconstitution, accountability by [CONTACT_1130], and 
investigational product remaining before final disposition. At the UMB CVD, the logs will be 
maintained in the accountability files within the office of the CVD . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_277983], in 
writing, this responsibility to another individual, but the PI [INVESTIGATOR_550437]’s representative or designee, or is destroyed as directed by [CONTACT_456]’s 
representative.  
All vials (unused, partially used, and spent) will be retained by [CONTACT_454685]. 
Any IP that experiences a temperature excursion will be placed in quarantine status and the 
Sponsor will be notified of the temperature excursion. The sponsor will determine the disposition of the quarantined IP. No vials should be destroyed or disposed of without specific instructions 
from the sponsor’ s representative and as stipulated by [CONTACT_5737], state, and federal  regulations. This 
occurs after the study monitor has completed the final accountability inspection. The disposition 
records will account for all remaining investigational products. 
All unused or partially used investigational product and empty vials will be destroyed when  
directed by [CONTACT_456]’s representative and as stipulated by [CONTACT_5737], state, and Federal r egulations. 
This occurs after the study monitor has completed the final accountability inspection. The single- use application cartridges for the EP device will only be retained by [CONTACT_550514],

7.1. Recruitment of Subjects 
Healthy adult men and women will be recruited from the Baltimore -Washington, DC area 
through the UMB clinical trial centers  by [CONTACT_550516], to 
include, but not limited to: informational flyers, newspaper advertisements, websites, word of 
mouth, and e- mail. All recruitment materials will be prepared and submitted for review and 
approval by [CONTACT_550517]. When a subject calls the study site and discloses an 
interest in the study, the recruitment staff will discuss the trial from an IRB -approved script. If 
the subject is still interested, contact [CONTACT_550518]/or screening will be arranged.  
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to any procedures being performed. 
The study briefing and informed consent process will be done within the respective clinical trial 
center, which may begin in a group setting, but then proceeds to individual discussion between an investigator and study subject prior to any procedures. Study individuals who are interested in 
learning about the trial will meet with a member of the study team and will undergo an informed 
consent process consisting of a detailed informational presentation of the study given by a study investigator or by [CONTACT_550519]-approved briefing slides in person or by [CONTACT_3553] a pre-recorded 
audio recording. 
Following the briefing, the coordinator or designee will provide the subject ample time to read 
the informed consent document. A study investigator and/or designee will answer all questions 
raised during the session. The subject will be asked to sign the consent. The subject will be 
allowed to take the consent document home to consider and discuss it with others and return to the trial center at a later time to sign it. After signing the consent, the subject will take an 
assessment of understanding. The assessment is administered to aid the study personnel in 
identifying gaps in understanding. Subjects must score at least 80% correct on the 10-question 
multiple -choice questionnaire. Any questions missed will be explained to the subject, and the 
subject’s questions will be answered. Th e subject will be given one additional opportunity to 
take the comprehension test. Any subject who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103160], does not understand the study well enough to consider their consent truly informed will be excluded. 
No study procedures will occur before the potential subject provides written informed consent. 
To minimize any possible coercion, supervisors or anyone in the chain of command or in a position of authority will not be permitted to consent the subject. However, they wil l be available 
to answer questions and provide additional information. 
Consent for Future Use: As part of the informed consent process subjects will be asked to 
provide permission for the future use of their specimens (s ee Section  14.3). Refusal to allow 
samples to be stored for future use will not exclude subjects from participation.

While the preference will be that all subjects complete all study visits, a subject may end his or her participation in the study at any time. If a subject withdraws, the investigator will make a reasonable effort to determine the reason for the withdrawal from the study and to complete 
termination procedures  as outlined in Section  7.5.5. Telephone calls, registered letters, and e-
mail correspondence are considered reasonable effort. F or subjects leaving the study, a targeted 
examination may be performed, if medically indicated and if permitted by [CONTACT_423]. 
The investigator may elect to stop further dosing a subject for an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE) resulting in a safety concern, for noncompliance with protocol requirements, or for circumstances that study personnel feel is in the best interest of the study 
participant . When a subject withdraws from the study due to an AE or further dosing is 
discontinued by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_284300], the following should be notified within 24 hours: the UMB

If a subject meets withdrawal conditions for a concomitant medication violation or noncompliance, this should clearly be stated in the source document and the study termination 
eCRF.  
7.5.2. Termination of Dosing  
Subjects who do not receive all 3 vaccinations will be encouraged to remain in the study and 
complete study visits for follow-up, safety and immunogenicity assessments per  the Study 
Events Schedule ( Table  4). If the scheduled visit does not include collection of blood for safety 
or immunogenicity, the visit may be conducted by [CONTACT_25600]/ electronic communication (eg, e-mail, text message) rather than in person . 
7.5.3. Data Collected for Withdrawal Subjects  
All data c ollected up to the time of withdrawal, including any final evaluation and lab results that 
may be pending at the time of withdrawal, will be reported. Likewise, any specimens collected 
up to the time of withdrawal, including any samples collected for storage and use in future 
research, will be kept and utilized as outlined in the protocol and consent form. The study 
termination eCRF will be completed, with the reason for withdrawal specified.  
7.5.4. Replacement of Subjects  
To ensure that a required minimum number of subjects ( 60) complete key study events for 
purposes of statistical analysis, [ADDRESS_723273] is deemed ineligible or withdraws prior to enrollment/first dose (study Day 1) they will be replaced to ensure [ADDRESS_723274]’s withdrawal and to have the subject return to the clinic  to complete the 
planned activities/ termination procedures  detailed in Section  8.1.5. Withdrawing from the study 
for any reason will not impact the subject’s medical care. Subjects who withdraw will be 
followed, as allowed by [CONTACT_423], through resolution of any ongoing adverse events. Women 
who become pregnant and men who report a partner’s pregnancy  during the duration of the study 
will be encouraged to seek obstetric care and will be asked to provide follow-up information at 
the conclusion of the pregnancy. These pregnant subjects will be followed for safety and will not 
receive any additional immunizations. They will be followed for the duration of their pregnancy, and any evidence of fetal harm will be reported promptly to the UMB IRB and sponsor within 
24 hours of study team knowledge.

8.1. Detailed Description of Study Visits  
8.1.1. Screen  1/Briefing Visit (First  Visit; Day -90 to Day -7) 
Screening and enrollment procedures will be the same for all potential subjects. Potential 
subjects will undergo screening no more than 90 days prior to their planned initial injection (Day  0, Visit 1). All subject screen v isit procedures will be performed on the first screening visit 
(Screen 1 ) to include clinical  safety lab  tests.  The immunogenicity tests (HTNV and PUUV 
PsVNA) will be performed at a secondary screening visit (Screen 2) allowing sufficient time to process t he sera while assuring subject s’ safety lab values are still within accepted values within 
[ADDRESS_723276] dose administration.  A period of 56 days to complete screens 1 and 2 prior 
to enrollment is requested to accomplish not only the lengthy process of screening more than 200 people for the goal of enrolling 82 subjects, but to ensure the data from the immunogenicity tests 
will be returned for selection of subjects. A turnaround time of up to 4 weeks is required for 
results of the PsVNA immunogenic ity tests (see Section  9.3). If more than [ADDRESS_723277] passed the immunogenicity screen. 
The following procedures will be performed during the initial screening/briefing visit (Screen  1): 
• Brief potential subject and review of informed consent with subject 
− Obtain written informed consent for participation in the study and for HIV testing 
− Assess of subjects informed consent/protocol comprehension by [CONTACT_17801] a 
quiz 
− Provide copy of signed informed consent documents to subject 
• Review  inclusion and exclusi on criteria  to assess if subject is eligible for study  
• Query subject for demographic information and medical history including 
concomitant medications  
• Do a full physical examination to include the following organs and organ systems: 
general appearance, ski n, head and neck, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, extremities, 
musculoskeletal, lymph nodes and nervous system. The exam will be performed by a study clinician licensed to make medical diagnoses and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator 
• Take r esting vital sign  measurement s including oral temperature, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Subjects must not eat or drink anything hot or cold, or smoke within 10 minutes prior to taking oral 
temperature  
• Measure skinfold thickness of potential injection sites  with a  caliper  
• Record  subject ’s weight 
• Collect approximately 33 mL venous whole blood for clinical safety laboratory tests 
to determine trial eligibility:

− Glucose, Cr, AST, ALT, total bilirubin 
− Viral s erologies (HBsAg, anti- HCV Ab, and anti- HIV Ab ) 
− PT/PTT tests  
• Collect blood for serum βHCG pregnancy test for all females of childbearing 
potential 
• Perform ECG to determine trial eligibility. A  baseline 12- lead ECG will be obtained 
on all subjects as part of the screening process. A study investigator will review all ECGs and a board- certified cardiologist will be available to review any questionable 
ECG readings. An abnormal ECG may be defined as, but not limited to, showing 
pathologic Q waves and significant ST-T wave changes; left ventricular hypertrophy 
unrelated to that of a healthy, athletic volunteer; any non-sinus rhythm excluding 
isolated premature atrial contractions; right or left bund le branch block; or advanced 
(secondary or tertiary) A -V heart block. Cardiology back-up may be obtained if 
questions arise as to the suitability of a candidate based upon the ECG results.  
8.1.2. Screen  2 Visit (Second Visit; Day -90 to Day -7) 
Screen [ADDRESS_723278], who had acceptable clinical laboratory 
screening results and met other eligibility criteria, has evidence of prior exposure to hantaviruses. 
Those who are seropositive, as defined by a Hantavirus Ps VNA50 titer ≥  20, will not be eligible 
to participate in the study. A turnaround time of up to 4 weeks is required for PsVNA50 results . 
(see Section  9). The following procedures will be performed during the second screening visit 
(Screen 2) : 
• Collect  approximately 10 mL whole venous blood for the determination of: 
− Hantavirus PsVNA50  screen  for prior humoral immunogenicity 
If Screen [ADDRESS_723279] vaccination, then the 
following tests will also be conducted: 
• Check inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure that subject is still eligible for the study 
• Query subject about interim medical history including concomitant medication  use 
• Do a directed p hysical examination if indicated based on the subject’s interim 
medical history. The exam will be done by a study clinician licensed to make medical 
diagnoses and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal i nvestigator or sub-
investigator 
• Take r esting v ital sign measurement including oral temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
• Weigh and record subject’s weight. If there is a >  15% change in body weight, 
remeasure skinfold thickness of potential injection sites with caliper  
• Collect  approximately 24.5 mL of whole venous blood for  the determination of:

− Glucose, Cr, AST, ALT, total bilirubin 
− Viral s erologies (HBsAg, anti- HCV Ab, and anti- HIV Ab ) 
• Collect urine  from all females of childbearing potential for urine pregnancy test  
If deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_2413], any or all of the above screening laboratories may be 
repeated at Screen 2  or a later (planned or unplanned) study visit to allow an accurate 
determination of a potential subject’s eligibility . If screening lab values are out of the normal 
range (i.e. Grade 1-4 as outlined on toxicity table), with the exception of the values noted in Inclusion Criteria 10, but are expected to be temporary (eg, due to dehydration), they may be re-
assessed onetime at the discretion of the investigator.  If these screening procedures have 
occurred within the 56-day screening window prior to the first vaccination , the results and 
documents will not need to be repeated, as copi[INVESTIGATOR_550443]. 
Potential subjects will be notified of their eligibility as soon as all lab results are available,  and 
an assessment can be made by [CONTACT_473]. If determined to be eligible, subjects will be 
scheduled for their initial vaccination (Day 0, Visit 1).  
Regardless of eligibility, individuals will be informed of any significantly abnormal test results 
that are clinically relevant in  an expeditious manner, via telephone, in person, or by [CONTACT_550521]. Appropriate counseling will be given regarding necessary medical follow-up. 
Information on individuals with evidence of reportable infectious diseases (eg, HIV and 
hepatitis) will be transmitted to the required public health authorities as applicable. Potential 
subjects will be notified of this possibility during their informed consent process.  
8.1.3. Vaccination Visits  
There will be 3 primary vaccination visits: D ay 0, Day 28 ± 4 days, and Day 56 ± [ADDRESS_723280]’s upper arm (deltoid area; alternating arms, beginnin g with left , if possible), using the TDS -IM V1.0 or TDS -ID EP 
system during the course of the study. Vaccine composition, vaccine dose and schedules (per 
group), subject randomization, and the TDS EP system have been discussed earlier in this 
protocol. 
The following procedures will be performed during each vaccination visit:  
• Review subject’s medical history including concomitant medication  use since 
screening or previous vaccination 
• Review e ligibility criteria with subjects and safety criteria including AEs, prior to 
study vaccination to ensure continued eligibility (see Section  7.5) 
• Do a directed physical examination  if indicated based on the subject’s interim 
medical history  (see also Table  4). Assess injection site prior to study vaccination to 
establish a baseline.

If necessary, biological samples will be sto red temporarily at the University of Maryland Center 
for Vaccine Development  to await transport to appropriate laboratories for processing and 
analysis. Transport and storage of these biological samples will be handled according to 
applicable SOPs/SSPs.  Upon receipt of humoral immunogenicity samples at [LOCATION_003]MRIID, any 
non-used/residual sera remaining after completion of the immunogenicity testing may be 
retained and used for future research.  
Any study for the future use of these biological samples will have the appropriate human subjects protection regulatory review and approval. In addition, a subject may decide at any point to withdraw consent for the future use of his/her samples. Should a subject withdraw consent for 
the use of his or her samples, any unused samples will be destroyed. Samp les will be stored 
indefinitely after transport to [LOCATION_003]MRIID.  
8.3. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will include all current medic ations and medications taken within [ADDRESS_723282] study vaccination or 
early termination (if prior to [ADDRESS_723283] study vaccination), whichever occurs first. 
Medications will includ e prescription and over- the-counter drugs as well as herbals, vitamins, 
and supplements. Even though the medications of greatest concern are those taken [ADDRESS_723284] vaccination, c oncomitant medications will be collected 
and recorded at each study visit.

• Antibiotics for an acute illness within 24 hours or any antiviral medication taken 
within 72 hours of each study vaccination. 
• Allergy treatment with antigen injections within [ADDRESS_723287] Compliance and Memory Aid Completion  
Subjects who are unable to follow the study requirements and arrive at study visits will be 
withdrawn from the study at the PI’s discretion. Poor compliance with study visits would include 
the inability to come to a scheduled study visit within window on 2 or more occasions. Withdrawal procedures for such insta nces are detailed in Section  7.5. 
Following each injection, subjects will be provided a memory aid ( ie, fillable diary card) and 
instructed in its use. On a daily basis during the [ADDRESS_723288] any local or general symptoms (eg, fever, myalgia, and m alaise) they 
experience (see Section  10.3.2). To more accurately account for possible fevers, subjects will be

reactions at the injection site (such as erythema, edema, bruising, and pain) for [ADDRESS_723290] ’s 
recollection.  Subjects will be ins tructed on the use of the memory aid and encouraged to fill it 
out as directed; if it is not completed or not brought to a study visit by [ADDRESS_723291] whether recorded on the memory aid or verbally reported to the study staff will be 
recorded in the eCRF as an AE with a grade and relationship as determined by [CONTACT_550524].

Handling/Processing and Transport for Research Blood Samples.” S amples will be stored at 
[LOCATION_003]MRIID’s Nonclinical Development Division (NCDD). [LOCATION_003]MRIID Molecular Virology Branch personnel will receive frozen sera. Samples will be thawed on wet ice and heat 
inactivated at 56°C (± 1°C) for 30 ± 1 minutes in a water bath. Samples will then be stored at 4°C (± 2°C) until assays are performed (< 5 weeks). Afterward, samples will be returned 
to -70°C (± 10°C) storage. Dates of serum thawing, heat inactivation, and re- freezing will be 
recorded.  As a control for bias, beginning at the Day [ADDRESS_723294] or the dose/regimen the subject received. All sera will be pre -screened at a 
1:20 dilution in both the HTNV and PUUV PsVNA. Positive samples will be further analyzed by [CONTACT_550525]. Depending on resources and time availability, certain samples may be directly titrated for endpoint (ie, no pre- screen); this will be recorded and 
documented. For those samples, a second assay will be performed to confirm the results. If PsVNA50 titers are determined in 2 independent assays, then GMT s for the combined results 
will be calculated.  
[LOCATION_003]MRIID S OP AP -05-16, Pseudovirion N eutralization Assay, will be used for all PsVNA. If a 
pre-screened sera sample has a titer of ≥ 20, but if during re -titering for endpoint determination 
the sample is found to have a titer < 20, then the more conservative < 20 value will be used. If an 
assay fails to meet the S OP acceptance criteria or if there is assignable cause, then the assay will 
be repeated. For individual specimens, if questions of accuracy arise, then those specimens will 
be retested. Questions of accuracy include differences in dup licates greater than 4 -fold in titer, or 
titers > 50,000. If a sample is retested and the assay passes acceptance criteria, then the new value will be reported but noted as a repeat. 
Data will be reported as HTNV and PUUV PsVNA50 titers. Seroconversion rat e, GMT, and 
peak titer, for the cohorts will be determined. A contributing scientist report summarizing the

assignments following database lock. 
In this study, up to 10 mL of blood on Days 0, 28, 56 and 140 and approximately 50 mL  of blood 
on Day 84 will be collected for future use purposes. Any blood remaining after immunogenicity 
studies are conducted will be retained for future hantavirus- related research for subjects who 
agreed to future use of these samples. These samples will  be stored at [LOCATION_003]MRIID.  The future 
research purposes for which this blood will be utilized are yet to be determined, but are likely to be additional immunogenicity assays; exact assays are yet to be determined.  
9.2.1. Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint  
The primary immunogenicity endpoint is the production of hantavirus neutralizing antibodies 
after vaccination as measured by [CONTACT_550472] 50. This information will allow calculation of 
seroconversion rates. Seropositivity is defined as a post-vaccination PsVNA50 titer ≥  20. Th e 
primary analysis variable will be the proportion of seropositive subjects (defined as PsVNA50 ≥ 1:20) at each scheduled time point (eg , Days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 140), and the final overall rate 
of seroconversion over these time points.  Seroconversion is defined as a post -vaccination 
HTNV- or PUUV- specific titer of ≥ 1:40, or a minimum four -fold rise compared to baseline titer , 
and all study volunteers will begin the study with a baseline titer <  20 (eg, are seronegative). The 
PsVNA that will be used in this  trial is a  well -characterized, investigational assay that has been 
used in multiple research studies. This assay is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses a luciferase reporter protein. The VSV -luciferase particles are pseudotyped with 
hantavirus envelope glycoproteins. When the PsV successfully attach to and then enter cells, the luciferase reporter protein is expressed. If sera contain antibodies that prevent the PsV from attaching to and/or entering cells, then the reporter activity i s neutralized. The reciprocal of the 
dilution that results in a 50% decrease is the PsVNA50  titer.  The assay will be performed under 
GLP conditions in accordance with an SOP  and will be monitored for quality by [CONTACT_550526]’s 
quality assurance unit.  
9.2.2. Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
The secondary analysis variable will be GMT , with 95% CIs, of the PsVNA50 for HTNV- and 
PUUV- specific antibodies at each scheduled time point (eg, Days 0, 28, 56, 84and 140). GMT s 
will be calculated using  PsVNA50.  
9.2.3. Explo ratory Immun ogenicity Endpoints  
PsVNA80 titers may be calculated from existing data for information. The reciprocal of the dilution that results in an 80% decrease in luciferase activity is the PsVNA80 titer. PsVNA using other hantavirus PsV (eg, Seoul virus, Dobrava virus) may also be performed to evaluate levels 
of cross-neutralizing antibodies.

Objective criteria and safety evaluations will be utilized. For each group of sentinel subjects, the 
SRC will evaluate safety data at [ADDRESS_723299] dose. If none of the events described (in 
sentinel group halting rules) are  observed in the sentinel subjects, vaccination of the remainder of 
the cohorts will proceed. Should any of the study halting criteria be met, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_550438] 24 hours. The SMC will meet to evaluate data and make a recommend ation. The 
SMC recommendation will be documented and provided in writing to the ORA PSSO . The 
sponsor’s representative will then decide to terminate, modify, or continue the conduct of the study. The ORA PSSO  will communicate the final decision to the appropriate parties involved in 
the study (ie , PI, RM/ISM, and DMID). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_550428]. 
[LOCATION_003]MRDC  RA Scientist will communicate the final decision to FDA as appropriate.  
10.1.4. DMID Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
Safety oversight will be conducted by [CONTACT_1629] S MC, which is an independent group of experts that 
monitors subject safety and advises DMID  and the study team. S MC members will be separate 
and independent of study personnel participating in this study and should not have scientific, financial , or other conflict s of interest related to the study. The SMC will consist of at least 3 
voting members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of safety data from 
this trial. The SMC will operate under the rules of a DMID -approved charter. The SMC will 
review applicable data to include but not limited to enrollment, demographics , dosing, and 
clinical and safety data, which may include solicited and unsolicited AEs/SAEs, reactogenicity, concomitant medications, clinical saf ety laboratory values, and any physical examinations at 
scheduled time points during the study as defined in the charter. The objective of the SMC is to make recommendations to the sponsor if the study should continue per protocol, be modified and then proceed, or be terminated. After each meeting the SMC will make its  recommendations in 
writing regarding continuation, modification, or termination of the clinical trial and provide to ORA PSSO . 
The SMC meetings for data review are as follows:  
• Organizational meeting (prior to start of the study) 
• An SMC ad hoc meeting will be convened when a halting rule is met or at the request of the investigator and/or DMID if there are safety concerns during the course of the 
study. 
• Annual review meetings . 
• End of study safety data review (after database lock and prior to final clinical study report).  
Data will be provided in a standard summary format. The SMC may be asked to provide 
recommendations in response to questions posed by [CONTACT_122830]. 
10.2. Specification of Safety Endpoints  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_550530] (local reactions and systemic reactions such as fever, headache, and fatigue) during specified periods of the study. The following endpoints 
will be evaluated:  
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022  Version 8.0  74 US Government Proprietary  • The occurrence of solicited local and systemic AEs occurring from the time of each 
injection through 14 days following the procedure (memory aid to assist with the first 
14 days) 
• The occurrence of vaccine- related unsolicited AEs from the time of the first injection 
through 28 days following each i njection  
• The occurrence of SAEs from the time of the first injection through the final study 
visit for each subject (approximately [ADDRESS_723300] vaccination)  
• The occurrence of clinical safety laboratory AEs through 14 days following each 
study vaccination  
10.3. IND Safety Reporting  
The following terms, as defined by 21 CFR 312.32, apply to IND safety reporting. 
10.3.1. Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  
ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice Guidelines define an adverse event (AE) as any untoward 
medical occu rrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product. 
An AE is considered to be any adverse change or exacerbation from a baseline condition that 
occurs following the initial administration of an investigational product whether or not the event 
is considered to be related to the investigational product. Examples of this include but are not limited to the following:  
• Adverse changes including new signs and symptoms, intercurrent illness modifying the clinical course, or the worsening of a baseline condition including the increased frequency of an event or an increased intensity of a condition  
• Concomitant disease with onset or increased severity after the start of study product administration  
• A new pattern in a preexisting condition, occurring after the receipt of investigational 
product that may signal a clinically meaningful change 
• Clinically significant changes in laboratory values  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser  degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
Adverse events will be documented in terms of a medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, 
the adverse event will be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_516890]. AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. Information to be collected include event 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022  Version 8.0  75 US Government Proprietary  description, date of onset, cl inician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product 
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and date of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or 
stabilizatio n. 
All AEs must be graded for severity and relationship to study product. 
10.3.2. Solicited Adverse Event  
A solicited AE is a predetermined event, identified in the Investigator’s Brochure, which may 
reflect safety concerns related to the investigational product. The solicited AEs for this study 
include: 
• Redness, swelling, bruising, pain, or tenderness at the injection  site 
• Fever  
• Myalgia (general muscle aches)  
• Headache  
• Lymphadenopathy 
• Axillary pain or discomfort 
• Tachypnea 
• Fatigue 
Adverse events that are considered related to the TDS -ID and TDS -IM V1.0 devices include 
eschar formation, bleeding, tingling or numbness at injection site or hand/arm distal to site, and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]. If any of these should occur, they will be captured as unsolicited adverse events. 
10.3.3. Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the follo wing outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adve rse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723301] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
All SAEs will be:  
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not 
related to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_550445] 1 through Day 220. 
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE form and eCRF 
• Followed through resolution or end of study by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_249585] 
• Reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_9273], RM/ISM , DMID, PSSO  PVG physician, and the 
IRB, if indicated  
10.3.4. Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reacti on 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or availab le, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if t he investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular a ccidents. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
10.3.5. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
Federal regulations require that unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others be 
promptly reported to the IRB. These events encompass a broader category of events than SAEs 
and may include issues such as problems with loss of control of subject data or the investigational product; adverse psychological reactions; or breach of confidentiality. Risks to 
others (eg, program personnel) must also be reported. 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others are any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the procedures that are described in the protocol, investigators brochure or informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population. 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022  Version 8.0  77 US Government Proprietary  • Related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the study; and 
• Suggests that the study places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_274740] a given incident, experience or outcome constitutes an 
unanticipated problem involving risk to subjects or others and  ensure upward reporting of the 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the appropriate regulatory offices. 
10.4. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must assign a relationship of each AE to the rece ipt of the investigational 
product. The investigator will use clinical judgment in conjunction with the assessment of a 
plausible biologic mechanism, a temporal relationship between the onset of the event in relation to receipt of the investigational produ ct, and identification of possible alternate etiologies 
including underlying disease, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. The following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_550531] n. ONLY A PHYSICIAN CAN MAKE THIS DETERMINATION.  
• Not related: No relationship to investigational product. Applies to those events for which evidence exists that there is an alternate etiology.  
• Unlikely: Likely unrelated to the investigational product. Like ly to be related to 
factors other than the investigational product but cannot be ruled out with certainty. 
• Possible: An association between the event and the administration of investigational product cannot be ruled out. There is a reasonable temporal association, but there may 
also be an alternative etiology, such as the subject’s clinical status or underlying 
factors (including other therapy). 
• Probable: There is a high degree of certainty that a relationship to the investigational 
product exists. There is a reasonable temporal association, and the event cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state or factors including other therapy. 
• Definite: An association exists between the receipt of investigational product and the event. An association to other factors has been ruled out. 
The sponsor uses 5 categories of relatedness (defined above), which are to be used for this 
clinical trial. The category of “Not Related” maps to DMID category of “Not Related ,” while the 
categories of “Unlikely ,” “Possible,” “Probable, ” and “Definite” map to the DMID category of 
“Related .” 
10.5. Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_093]. Inherent in this assessment is the 
medical and clinical consideration of all information  surrounding the event including any 
medical intervention required. Each event will be assigned one of the following categories: mild, moderate, severe, potentially life threatening/life threatening, or fatal. Refer to the grading scale in Appendix C  for further guidance in the assignment of severity. The criteria below may be used 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-0100 Department of the Army 
02 March 2022  Version 8.0  78 US Government Proprietary  for any symptom not included in the grading scale. Any potentially life threatening/life 
threatening, or fatal AE must be reported as an SAE.  
The eCRF for AEs will reflect only the highest severity for continuous days an event occurred. 
Mild  Grade 1  Does n ot interfere with routine activities; minimal 
level of discomfort  
Moderate  Grade 2  Interferes with routine activities; moderate level of 
discomfort 
Severe  Grade 3  Unable to perform routine activities; significant level of discomfort 
Potentially life threatening/life threatening  Grade 4  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550446] 5  Death
 
FDA guidelines for toxicity will be followed; however, if a subject is evaluated in an emergency 
room for nonlife threatening illness or symptoms (ie, visits emergency department on weekend for mild problems because the physician’s office is closed), the information from that visit will 
be reviewed and severity of the adverse event will be assessed according to the subject’s clinical 
signs and symptoms. 
As defined by [CONTACT_284367], the term “severe” is often used to describe intensity 
(severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event 
itself however, may be of relatively minor medic al significance (such as severe headache). This 
is not  the same as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome  or action  criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
10.6. Recording Adverse Events 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454642]’s representative ([LOCATION_003] MRDC ORA) and the UMB 
CVD IRB in the appropriate safety, annual, and/or final reports. The study site will provide data files to the sponsor’s representative for preparation of annual and final reports to the FDA. The 
sponsor’s representative will be responsible for reporting any required information to the 
delivery device supplier (Ichor Medical Systems, Inc.)  and DMID. 
10.6.1. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints  
AEs, solicited AEs,  and SAEs  will be assessed at all study visits, documented in the source 
records, and recorded on the eCRFs using accepted medical terms and/or the diagnoses that 
accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the 
eCRF will be  the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The investigator will assess 
all AEs for seriousness, relationship to investigational product, severity, and other possible 
etiologies. When an adverse event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on 
the AE eCRF as “ongoing.” 
HP Geneva  The Surgeon General 
IND [ZIP_CODE]; S-15-39; DMID 12-[ADDRESS_723302] (the first 14 days will be assisted with a memory aid). 
10.6.2. Duration of Follow- Up of Subjects after Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators are required to f ollow SAEs to resolution  or end of study. Resolution is the return 
to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the probability that it will become chronic. 
The SAE outcomes will be reported to the sponsor’s representative using the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form. If the follow-up information requires an update to the SAE Report Form, a 
new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE and giving 
the date of the original report should be e- mailed or faxed to usarmy.detrick.medcom-
usam [EMAIL_10490]. The follow-up information should describe the outcome 
of the event, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject  continued or withdrew from study 
participation.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs in former subjects; however, if an SAE, considered to be related to the investigational product is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time  following completion of the study, the event will be reported to the 
[LOCATION_003]M RDC  ORA PSSO  as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
10.7. Reporting Adverse Events 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454642], the UMB IRB, and DMID in the appropri ate safety, 
annual, and/or final reports. After appropriate data cleaning and query resolution between the clinical site, sponsor’s clinical monitor, and clinical data manager, SAEs from the clinical database will be reconciled with the sponsor’s SAE database. SAEs and AEs for inclusion in 
annual and final reports to the FDA will be provided from the clinical database by [CONTACT_550532] . 
The study site will provide data files to the sponsor’s representative for preparation of annual and 
final reports to the FDA. The sponsor’s representative will be responsible for reporting any 
required information to the delivery device supplier (Ichor Medical Systems, Inc.).

11.1. Description of Statistical Methods  
Descriptive analysis of safety and reactogenicity outcomes will include all subjects who meet the eligibility criteria, receive at least one vaccination, and for whom safety data are available. Summary tables will  be created in which incidence, severity , and relationship to the use of 
investigational product of individual solicited local and systemic signs, symptoms, or trending unsolicited events are delineated by [CONTACT_2060], severity, gender, and overall. Unsoli cited AEs 
and SAEs will be analyzed in a similar fashion.  
Descriptive analysis of immunogenicity outcomes will include all subjects who meet the 
eligibility criteria, receive at least one vaccination, and for whom serological data are available. The primary analysis variable will be the proportion of seropositive subjects ( defined as 
PsVNA50 ≥ 1:20) at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are taken (eg , Days 0, 
28, 56, 84and 140), and the final overall rate of seroconversion over all scheduled time points to study completion for each study group. Seroconversion is defined as a post -vaccination HTNV- 
or PUUV- specific titer of ≥ 1:40, or a minimum four -fold rise compared to baseline titer and all 
study volunteers will begin the study with a baseli ne titer <  20 (ie, seronegative). For each study 
group, a binomial proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. The secondary 
analysis variable will be geometric mean titers (GMT) , with 95% CIs, of the PsVNA50 for 
HTNV- and PUUV -specific antibodies at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are 
taken for each study group and over all time points for each study group. G MT, standard errors, 
and 95% CIs will be calculated using log- transformed titers . For t iters below the lower limit of 
detection (< 20), the value will be transformed to a value equal to the lower limit of detection ( ie,

PsVNA80 titers, which may be calculated for informationa l purposes, and may evaluate 
PsVNA50 titers against related Seoul and Dobrava viruses.  
For hematology and serum chemistry tests, any clinically significant changes from baseline value will be identified. The median, interquartile range, and normal values for each laboratory value 
(as determined by [CONTACT_550480]) will be reported for each treatment group for each 
specimen collection point.  
11.1.1. Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_550539] t erm, severity, 
and relationship to study treatment. Serious adverse events will be described. A complete listing of adverse events for each subject will provide details including severity, relationship to study product, onset, duration, and outcome. Laboratory results will be summarized by [CONTACT_550540], severity, study day, and study arm. 
Safety analysis will include data collected from all subjects . Adverse event data will be listed 
individually (including intervention and outcome) and summarized by [CONTACT_550541] a body system for each treatment group. Serious and/or unexpected AEs will also 
be discussed on a case -by-case basis. For the tabulation of the AEs by [CONTACT_6764], a subject 
will be counted only once in a given body system. For example, a subject reporting nausea and 
diarrhea will be reported as one subject, but the symptoms will be listed as 2 separate AEs within 
the class. Therefore the total number of AEs reported within a body system may exceed the 
number of subjects within the body system reporting AEs. 
The total number of AEs reported within body systems between each treatment group will be 
compared using Fisher’s exact test.  
Changes in pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_550452]. 
Depending upon the sample size, the more common adverse events that may be drug related 
should be examined for a dose, duration, or demographic relationship, or using other ana lyses 
such as standard life- table methods.  
11.1.2. Clinical Laboratory Data Analyses 
For hematology and serum chemistry tests, the mean, mean change, median, median change, and range of all values for each test for each treatment group at baseline and for the final ‘on therapy’ 
values will be printed in a summary table. A second table (a ‘shift table’) will be made, showing 
for each laboratory variable the percentage of subjects in each treatment group whose values decreased, stayed the same, or increased between the baseline or pre-treatment period and the 
end of the study. A third table will be prepared displaying the numbers of subjects in each 
treatment group who had values below, within, and above the normal range at baseline and at the final visit.  
These t ables will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_550453]/ISM  to evaluate whether any significant trends in 
laboratory values occurred. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_550453]/ISM  will also review the urinalysis data by [CONTACT_550542], but no summary tables of these will be prepared.

2.1 Background
Alopecia Areata 
Alopecia areata (AA) is a common acute onset autoimmune disorder characterized by [CONTACT_44215], 
non-scarring hair loss in well defined areas.1It is the second most common form of Alopecia after 
the androgenetic type. The extent of hair loss defines the three main AA forms, namely Patchy AA, 
Alopecia Totalis (loss of all scalp hair) and Alopecia Universalis (loss of all body hair). Patchy AA is the most common form.
The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_565378] 25% in adult-onset patients. Spontaneous 
regrowth can occur in 50-80% of the patchy AA cases within a year, however additional patches 
can also form, resulting in the formation of several patches that often coalesce eventually lead to alopecia totalis.
2Alopecia areata overall rate of relapse has been estimated to be around 86%.3,[ADDRESS_742572] important features of AA is that the disease process does not destroy hair follicles.
Alopecia areata is considered as a complex genetic disease influenced by [CONTACT_80238]. 
Based on large epi[INVESTIGATOR_565379], Europe and Asia, and systematic meta-analysis, the lifetime incidence of AA is estimated to be around 2% of the population.
5,6The 
onset is most common in the third and fourth decades of life but it does occur at any age.7When 
first onset is at an earlier age the risk for future extensive disease increases.[ADDRESS_742573] been associated with AA, including depression, anxiety, and 
autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as asthma, thyroid disease, depression and anxiety .
8,10,11
Daxdilimab
Daxdilimab (HZN7734 [previously known as MEDI7734 and VIB7734]) is a human 
immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7), a cell-surface protein that is unique to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in human and the nonhuman primate. Daxdilimab binds to ILT7 on the surface of pDCs, which leads to recruitment of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, thus inducing apoptosis and depletion of pDCs in vivo. The afucosylation of daxdilimabis designed to 
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC Protocol HZNP-DAX-201 Page 28of 70
Protocol Version 2.0: 07 JAN 2022
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DACenhance the potency of daxdilimab for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against 
pDCs. Since pDCs are the major cell type that secretes type I interferons (IFNs) in response to 
nucleic acid-containing immune complexes, it is hypothesized that depletion of pDCs will reduce disease activity for patients with autoimmune diseases that are partially driven by [CONTACT_565398] I IFNs.
Trial Rationale
The exclamation hair and the bald areas are caused by [CONTACT_565399], which starts with the 
loss of immune privilege of the hair follicle and a subsequent autoimmune attack of the bulbar region of anagen phase hair follicles by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and Th1 cytokines.
1,6,[ADDRESS_742574] identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region genes and other immune function genes to be associated with AA. Interestingly some of these genes had not been previously implicated in other autoimmune diseases.
6,13-15These genes were the 
ULBP3/ULBP6 known to be ligands for the natural killer receptor D (NKG2D). 
The significance of this finding was later demonstrated in functional studies where 
CD8+NKG2D+T cells were shown to be major effectors of AA pathogenesis.16Effector 
CD8T cells can get activated by [CONTACT_565400] I and NKG2DL on epi[INVESTIGATOR_565380]. CD8 T cells are not the only immune cells involved inAA. CD4 T cells and NKcells are also present around the epi[INVESTIGATOR_565381]-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNg. 
Critical to the recruitment and activation of the peri-and intra-lesional NK and T cells seems to be 
pDCs and Type I IFNs.
17
In one study, alopecia developed in 19% of the treated patients, and it regressed soon after treatment completion.
18These observations led to studies that searched for direct histologic 
evidence of Type I interferons. 
Lesional scalp biopsies from patients with AA were assessed with immunohistochemistry for 
expression of the type 1 interferon-inducible myxovirus protein A (MxA), one of the most reliable surrogate markers of Type [ADDRESS_742575] the cytotoxic cells in the deeper areas of the skin, where the hair follicles are located.
12
Another study using immunohistochemistry on AA biopsies, not only confirmed the expression of MxA in peribulbar areas, but also demonstrated the presence of pDCs through BDCA2 staining in the same areas. pDCs accounted for approximately 10% of the mononuclear cells, and the abundance of MxA expression suggested that the pDCs were in an active state producing Type I IFNs.

Protocol Version 2.0: 07 JAN 2022
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DACUsing a dynamic model of AA development, the central role of pDCs in initiating AA was 
demonstrated.20Induction of AA in mice, by [CONTACT_565401] T cells derived from lymph 
nodes of AA-bearing syngeneic mice, revealed that densely infiltrated IFN-a-producing pDCs 
initiate the lesions in the affected hair follicle as well as in the proximity of these follicles. Additionally, intradermal injection of pDCs also induced AA.
2.2 Risk/Benefit Assessment
Known Potential Risks
Daxdilimab was tested in a first-in-human, single-ascending dose study (Study D6080C00001). The key objectives of the study were to evaluate the single dose safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD). The study enrolled 36 adult subjects with dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), Sjo
sclerosis. Subjects received a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of daxdilimab , or 
mg, or placebo. After single SC administration, serum peak concentrations were observed [ADDRESS_742576]-dose. Daxdilimab PK exposures increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. Apparent clearance (CL/F) ranged from 0.468 to 1.03 L/day. Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) ranged from 9.89 to 19.0 L. The estimated terminal elimination half-life (t
1/2) 
ranged from 13 to 20 days across dose levels. No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred that were considered related to the investigational product. Two subjects had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) considered related to the investigational product by [CONTACT_093]: one subjectin the placebo group with nausea (Grade 1) and one subject in the daxdilimab  mg group with tongue discolouration (Grade 1). The most common adverse events (AEs) reported in the daxdilimab-treated subjects were diarrhoea (11.5%) and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (11.5%). There was no imbalance of AEs between the daxdilimab and placebo groups. No injection site reactions or hypersensitivity reactions were reported. No anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) occurred. Mean reductions of at least 50% in the pDC level of daxdilimab-treated subjects were evident at 
24hours after dosing in all dose groups. Increasing doses were associated with a non-linear 
increase in pDC reduction. Increasing doses were generally associated with a longer duration of 
pDC reduction.
Study HZN7734.P1b.S1 evaluated the PK, PD, and safety of [ADDRESS_742577]
systemic sclerosis, PM, or DM. Subjects received placebo or daxdilimab at  mg by 
[CONTACT_10530]. Daxdilimab PK exposure was approximately dose proportional over the dose range 
investigated. Apparent steady-state clearance (CLss/F) values were similar across dose groups and ranged from 0.62 to 1.18 L/day. The t
1/2was 14.6 days for subjects receiving mg daxdilimab. 
Sixteen of 22 (72.7%) daxdilimab-treated subjects and 6 of 9 (66.7%) placebo treated subjects experienced at least one TEAE. There were no deaths in the trial. One placebo-treated subject and no daxdilimab-treated subjects experienced treatment emergent SAEs. No subject experienced an AE leading to treatment discontinuation. No treatment-emergent ADA was observed in subjects 
treated with daxdilimab. In subjects with CLE, Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and 
Severity Index-Activity (CLASI-A) scores improved more in the daxdilimab  mg group than the placebo group. After 3 monthly SC doses of daxdilimab  mg or  mg, the median change in percent pDCs at Day 85 was -54.1% in the daxdilimab group, compared to a +9.8% in the placebo group. 

Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC Protocol HZNP-DAX-201 Page 30of 70
Protocol Version 2.0: 07 JAN 2022
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DACTo date, no adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for daxdilimab have been identified. Important 
potential risks for daxdilimabinclude viral infection and viral reactivation, opportunistic infection, 
malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Other potential risks include injection site reactions, vaccine interaction, drug-drug interactions, and reproductive toxicity.
Known Potential Benefits
In this Phase 2a trial, it is hypothesized that participants moderate-to-severe alopecia areata may 
see an improvement in their condition as a result of participating in the trial.
Participation in this trial may help generate future benefit for larger groups of patients with AAif 
daxdilimab proves to be successful in treating this disease.
Assessment of Risks and Benefits
All quality, pharmacology and toxicology data, and satisfactory safety and tolerability data 
demonstrated in nonclinical studies are considered sufficient to expect a positive benefit/risk ratio for the treatment ofpatients with moderate-to-severe AAwith daxdilimab, and therefore to initiate this trial.
The risk to participants in this trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_178438], 
proper trial design, and close monitoring.

4.1  Overall Design 
This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, proof-of-concept trial to assess the preliminary 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of daxdilimab in participants with moderate-to-severe AA, with 
Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) 
score at Screening and Day 1. Participants will be between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive), with 
a current epi[INVESTIGATOR_565382] [ADDRESS_742578] 6 months. Approximately 30 participants will be 
enrolled to receive daxdilimab  mg administered subcutaneously  
.  
 
All participants will read and sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to any screening 
procedures being performed. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be accepted into the trial.  The trial will comprise of a screening period of up to [ADDRESS_742579] a follow-up period of 16 weeks (through Week 48) to evaluate long-term safety and to observe the duration of efficacy following the treatment period. Participants who prematurely stop dosing will be followed through Week [ADDRESS_742580]-treatment follow-up period will be requested to complete the ET visit. 
For scheduled trial visits, participants will come to the trial centers on 14 occasions: screening, 
 
Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_565402],  
 
 
 
. 
 
Blood samples will be collected from all participants to characterize the PK, PD, and 
immunogenicity of daxdilimab. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_530623], SAEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), 
performing local injection tolerability assessment, recording vital signs, performing physical 
examinations and electrocardiograms (ECGs), and evaluating clinical laboratory results.

4. Willing to keep the same hair style and color (eg, hair products, process, and timing for hair appointments) for the duration of the trial. 
5. Clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe AA - 
total scalp hair loss at screening and baseline (Day 1) defined by [CONTACT_565403]. 
6. Duration of current epi[INVESTIGATOR_118166] 3 months but 7 years at screening and Day 1, along 
with investig since diagnosis of 
AA could be >[ADDRESS_742582] at Day 1. 
9. For female participant of childbearing potential involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy: the participant must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method 
from at least [ADDRESS_742583] 6 months (approximately 5 half-lives) after 
the last IP administration or the end of the trial, whichever is longer, and refrain from egg retrieval/egg donation during this period. Highly effective contraceptive methods include hormonal contraceptives (e.g, combined oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, injectable, or implant), intrauterine devices or intrauterine systems, vasectomized partner(s) (provided his 
methods of contraception (e.g. male condom with cervical cap, male condom with diaphragm, and male condom with contraceptive sponge) in conjunction with spermicide.  
Note: For countries where double barrier methods are not accepted as highly effective 
contraception, this option must not be considered. 
Note: Participants must have been on a stable dose of hormonal contraceptives for at least 
4 weeks before Day 1.  
Note: The above list of contraceptive methods does not apply to participants who are abstinent 
for at least [ADDRESS_742584] IP administration or until

 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  the end of the trial, whichever is longer.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not acceptable. 
Note: A female participant of nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows:  
- Female participant who has had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). 
- Female participant who has had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months prior to the screening visit without an alternative medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone

Participants who are permanently discontinued from receiving IP will be followed for 
protocol-specified assessments including follow-up of any AEs through Week 48 unless consent is withdrawn specifically from further trial participation (Section 7.1.3), or the participant is lost 
to follow-up (Section 7.2). Site investigators will be trained about the importance of retention of 
participants through the completion of the study, and participants will be informed about the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue study treatment early.
Discontinuation from the Trial
Reasons for discontinuation from the trial include the following:
The participant is lost to follow-up.
The sponsor or regulatory authorities, for any reason, stop the trial. In this case, all participants will be discontinued from the trial. The investigator will immediately, on discontinuance of the trial by [CONTACT_456], in its entirety or at a clinical trial site, inform both the participants and the research ethics board of the discontinuance, provide them with the reasons for the discontinuance and advise them in writing of any potential risks to the health of participants or other persons.
Withdrawal of Consent from the Trial
Participants are free at any time to withdraw from the study (IP and assessments), without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). Such participants will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and the presence of any AEs. If a participant withdraws participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take place. Further details concerning use of samples collected during the study from a participant who withdraws consent are provided in Section 10.9.

Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT)
To participate in this trial, a participant must have moderate-to-severe AA as assessed by a SALTscore of
at screening and baseline (Day 1) as described in Section 5.1.
The SALT score is a well-validated metric and widely utilized tool for determining the degree of hair loss based on the percentage of scalp surface area involved on the top, back, and each side of the scalp for AA.  The investigator will determine the percent scalp hair loss in a given quadrant, 
multiply this by [CONTACT_565408], and sum the resultant numbers for 
each quadrant to give the total percent scalp hair loss with a maximum score of 100.

Definition of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event
A TEAE is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with the IPbut appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was on treatment 
(regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated).
Definition of Serious Adverse Event
A SAE or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose has any of the following 
consequences:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67722]/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
-
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious .
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC Protocol HZNP-DAX-201 Page 53of 70
Protocol Version 2.0: [ADDRESS_742609] (AESI)
An AESI is an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the IP and may require close monitoring and collection of additional information by [CONTACT_093]. An AESI may be serious or nonserious.
The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize 
and understand them in association with the use of this IP.
The following AESIs will be particularly monitored in this trial:
Hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis.
Severe viral infection/reactivation (CTCAE Grade 3 or higher).
Opportunistic infection.

Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC will assess the expectedness of each SAE in relation to the IP.
Time Period and Frequency for EventAssessment and Follow-Up
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of trial personnel during trial visits 
and interviews of a trialparticipant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a trial monitor.
All AEs, including local and systemic reactions, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes event description, date 
severity, relationship to IP (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on trial must 
be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. 
Trial site personnel will note the occurrence and nature of each participant
present prior to the informed consent signature [CONTACT_178491]. During the trial, site personnel will note any change in the condition(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AE. 
Any medical condition that is present prior to informed consent signature [CONTACT_178492]. However, if the trial participant
deteriorates after the consent signature, it will be recorded as an AE.
Should a participant experience an AE at any time after the informed consent signature [CONTACT_178493], the event will be recorded as an AE in the source document and eCRF. Any SAE related to the trial participation (e.g., screening procedure) will be recorded in

Pregnancy is not itself an AE or SAE; however, maternal/fetal complications or abnormalities will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination and, in the case of a live-born offspring, to 1 month of age in that infant. The investigator will notify the pharmacovigilance unit and Innovaderm of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial pregnancy form. All pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor and, when applicable, to the ethics committee.
Overdose
Investigationalproductoverdose is any accidental or intentional use of IPin an amount higher than the dose indicated per protocol for a given participant. Trial treatment compliance (see Section6.3.2) should be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or 
accidental).
Any IP overdose during the trial should be recorded on the source document and eCRF. In the 
event of overdose, the participant should be closely monitored for any potential AEs. All AEs associated with an overdose should be entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in Section 8.6.8, Serious Adverse EventsReporting, even if the events do not 
meet seriousness criteria. If the AE associated with an overdose does not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using the SAEs reporting procedures and in an expedited manner butshould 
be noted as non-serious on the form and the Adverse Event eCRF.The excess quantity and duration 
of the overdose should be recorded.

9.1  Sample Size Determination 
A total of up to 30 participants will receive daxdilimab in the trial. The sample size was determined 
by [CONTACT_565411], safety and tolerability, and PK/PD. No formal power calculation was performed. 
The mean percent reduction from baseline in SALT score was 58% in 4 mg group at Week 36 in 
25. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was about 
42%. With 30 participants, if we observe a mean percent reduction from baseline in SALT score 
of 58% at Week 24, there is about 98% confidence that the mean percent reduction from baseline 
is at least 42%. The estimated probability that true mean percent reduction from baseline in SALT score is above a cutoff for an observed mean is provided in Table 6.

applicable laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. 
10.2  Ethical Review  
It is the understanding of the sponsor that this protocol (and any amendments) as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be reviewed and approved by a research ethics board (REB)/ institutional review board (IRB). This board must operate in accordance with the current federal regulations. For sites with a local ethics committee, a letter or certification of approval will be sent by [CONTACT_68477] (or contract research organization [CRO]) before initiation of the trial and also whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made.  
10.3  Informed Consent Process 
An ICF describing in detail the trial treatment, trial procedures, and risks will be given to the participant, along with an assent form when required. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093] (if acceptable 
by [CONTACT_1295]), to obtain written informed consent from each individual participating in this 
trial, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the trial. 
trial trial participation. Consent forms will be IRB/REB 
approved, and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research trial to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal 
explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant
procedures, and potential risks of the trial and of his or her rights as a research participant. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the trial with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. 
The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the trial. Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason, without prejudice. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), 
and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any trial-specific procedures.

If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if any 
new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of a participant to continue to 
participate, the consent form should, if necessary, be reviewed and updated by [CONTACT_1201]/REB. All participants (including those already being treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form, and asked to give their consent to continue in the trial. 
10.4  Trial Discontinuation and Closure 
This trial may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for trial suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_565416], investigators, the sponsor, and regulatory authorities. If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigators will promptly inform trial participants and the IRB/REB, and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Trial participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to trial visit schedule. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension of the trial include, but are not limited 
to the following: 
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants 
 Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements 
 Data that are not sufficiently complete or evaluable 
 Scientific or corporate reasons 
The trial may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed and satisfy the sponsor, IRB/REB, Health Canada, and/or FDA.

for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_388162], the reviewing IRB, institutional policies, or sponsor requirements. 
10.6  Clinical Monitoring 
Clinical site monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of trial participants are protected; that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable; and that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), ICH GCP guidelines, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s). Centralized monitoring, which consists of remote review of accumulating data from all sites, will be performed as detailed in the Centralized Monitoring Plan.  
10.[ADDRESS_742619], data and biological specimen collection, documentation, and completion. 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system, and 
data QC checks, which will be run on the database, will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution. 
During the trial, the sponsor or its representative will conduct monitoring visits at regular intervals. 
The monitoring visits will be conducted to ensure protocol adherence, quality of data, accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, IP accountability, compliance with regulatory requirements, and continued 
adequacy of the trial site and its facilities. 
The site may be audited, monitored, or inspected by a quality assurance officer named by [CONTACT_103], by [CONTACT_178471], and/or by [CONTACT_50756]. The investigator will be given notice before an audit occurs and will be expected to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including source data) as requested. The trial site will provide direct access to all trial-related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_271689].

may subsequently be transferred to the sponsor. 
10.9 Biological Specimens and Data  
Study data are protected by [CONTACT_2224] a sample identification (SID) number, which is a number 
specific to the participant. The investigator is in control of the information that is needed to connect 
a study sample to a participant; a participant may withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_95129]. If consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be given to and used by [CONTACT_1034], but no new data or samples will be collected unless specifically required to monitor the safety of the participant.  
Leftover samples stored for future research with participant consent will be labeled with a sample 
identification number. If the participant consents to have his/her samples used for future research, 
this additional research may not start immediately and may start at any time during the storage 
15 years after the end of the 
study in which they were collected. If the participant chooses not to allow his/her study samples to be used for future research, the samples will be destroyed by [CONTACT_565419]. If future use consent is withdrawn, the Sponsor and the investigator

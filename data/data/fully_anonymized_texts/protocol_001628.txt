Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. CF affects more than 70,000 individuals worldwide1 
(approximately 30,000 in the US2 and 45,000  in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies 
as an orphan disease.4, 5 
CF is caused by [CONTACT_155412]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene.[ADDRESS_196790] common disease-causing CFTR  mutation is F508del , which accounts for 
approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF.10 Approximately 40% to 45% of 
people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% have at least 
[ADDRESS_196791] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein 
delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. With differing mechanisms of action, a 
combi nation of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR-mediated chloride transport 
more than either type  of modulator alone. 
The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by 
[CONTACT_155413]: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco ), 
lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi®), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko /Symkevi®).   
VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, 
TEZ, and IVA (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual 
combinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components ( VX-445, 
TEZ, and IVA) when added to human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells derived from 2 groups of 
CF patients: those heterozygous fo r F508del with a second CFTR  allele carrying a minimal 
function (MF) mutation that is not responsive to TEZ, IVA, and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); 
and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes). 
Additional information about VX-445/TEZ/IVA can be found in th e Investigator’s Brochure.

documentation for medicati ons taken within the [ADDRESS_196806] dose of study drug in this 
study through completi on of study participation, as defined in Section  9.1.5 . 
 Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF through completion of 
study participation. Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for 
CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before Day 1. Subjects should not 
initiate long-term t reatment with new medication from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit 
through completion of stud y participation. Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or 
other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
 Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or 
up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. 
 VX-445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of 
medicinal products that are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, 
glyburide, nateg linide, and repaglinide should be used with caution. 
 IVA is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Administration of IVA may increase 
systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may 
increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin or other substrates 
of P-gp with a narro w therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  
 IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore during coadministration with warfarin, additional 
monitoring of the internati onal normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal products 
that are CYP2C9 substrates for which exposure may be increased include glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_168781]; these should be used with caution. 
 Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393] 11.5.[ADDRESS_196807] “CF” 
meal or snack, or a standa rd meal. 
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 
2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed-dose combination (FDC) TC tablets in the 
morning and [ADDRESS_196808], doses of study drug should be 
taken at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 
3. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of TC will be administered at the site after 
predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by [CONTACT_168791]. 
4. If a subject ’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines should be 
used: 
 If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_196809]’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject shou ld withhold their morning dose of TC and the morning dose of TC will be 
administered in the clinic. 
 If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_196810]’s scheduled morning 
dose of TC, the subject s hould take the morning dose of TC at home. 
5. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 
9.6.[ADDRESS_196811] should take 
the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.  
Morning dose: If more than [ADDRESS_196812] 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. 
Evening dose:  If more than [ADDRESS_196813] 
should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual 
time. 
Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time. 
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity 
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in 
Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing 
(Section 9.1.3 ). 
9.[ADDRESS_196814] interrupted study drug for >[ADDRESS_196815]’s clinical stability and should consider resumption of study 
drug only after the subject is clinically stable and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in 
administering study drug to the subject.  
The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for 
any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. The medical monitor 
should be notified of any plan to discontinue study drug. 
9.8.1 Liver Function Tests 
The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of alanine transaminase (ALT) or 
aspartate transaminase (AST) >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin >2 × ULN 
that are derived from centrally submitted samples. 
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or A ST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by 
[CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_196816] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72 hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued  if the following criterion is met: 
 Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved. 
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to 
baseline. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminases return to b aseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study 
drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 
4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_168792]18- 445-110, Version 1.0 Page 25 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_196817] develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is 
considered a serious adverse event  (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical monitor of 
any rash that results in interruption of study  drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), or is an  
SAE. Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., 
complete blood count with differential, liver function test), photographs of the rash, and 
dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered 
clinically appropriate.  
9.[ADDRESS_196818] meets any of 
the following criteria: 
 Meets any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (discontinuation) criteria (Section  9.8) 
 Becomes pregnant (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
If a subject does not return for  a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety 
Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section  9.1.3), and follow up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs. 
If a subject withdraws consent or  assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. 
Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study ends, and may 
use the samples and information in the development of the study compounds, for other drugs and 
diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will 
not be able to request the withdrawal of his or her information from the study data. A subject 
may request destruction of the samples collected from him or her during the study as long as 
those samples can be identified as his or her samples. 
With the exception of subjects who cannot ac cess the commercial product after regulatory 
approval because reimbursement by [CONTACT_423]’s insurance carri er (whether government or 
private payer) is not yet available or because the subject lacks insurance coverage, subjects who 
become eligible to receive commercially available TC by [CONTACT_168793] a physician may be 
discontinued from study drug dosing and will complete the ETT Visit before beginning 
commercially available TC dosing. The Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required if the subject 
immediately continues on commercially available TC. 
If evaluation of efficacy data from the parent study suggests that the VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment 
does not provide clinically meaningful benefit for  subsets of subjects included in these studies, 
Protocol VX18- 445-110, Version 1.0 Page 26 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Vertex may recommend that subjects with relevant genotypes discontinue from the study. In 
addition, if local health authorities decline to approve VX -445/TEZ/IVA, or if clinical benefit is 
not demonstrated for the use of VX-445/TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in specific 
subpopulations enrolled in this study, subjects with the relevant CFTR  genotypes may be 
discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to 
the safety and efficacy observed for the relevant subset of subjects.

musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed 
when medically indicated. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations 
will be reported as AEs. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. The subject will be instructed to rest for at least [ADDRESS_196836] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
schedule of assessments ( Table 3-1 ). Additional standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at any 
other time if cli nically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following 
guidelines: 
 The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG. 
 The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline 
or an absolute QTcF  value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be 
performed approxima tely 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of 
the QTcF values from these r epeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from 
baseline or ≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 
2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further 
details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual.

12.3.1 General Considerations 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the 
SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as 
Protocol VX18- 445-110, Version 1.[ADDRESS_196849] units (metric or SI) will be converted 
with the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_196850] 
recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA either in the parent study or the open-label study, as applicable. The baseline 
value for the long -term efficacy analysis will be defined as the most recent non-missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
parent study. For assessments collected in duplicate or triplicate, the baseline will be defined as 
the average of non-missing values. 
Baseline characteristics  of subjects in the open-label study will be the same as the baseline 
character istics in the parent study. 
Change (absolute change)  from baseline  will be calculated as post-baseline value - baseline 
value. 
The Efficacy Analysis Period  in the open-label study will include the time from the first dose of 
study drug in the open-label study to the last scheduled efficacy visit in the open-label study, 
unless otherwise specifie d. 
The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period  in the open -label study will include the time from the 
first dose of study  drug in the open-label study to [ADDRESS_196851] dose of the study drug in 
the open-labe l study or to the completion date of study participation (as defined in Section  9.1.5 ), 
whichever occurs first. 
The long-term efficacy analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_168796]-label study.

post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing in 
the open-label study, concomitantly during the TE Period in the open -label study, or beyond the 
TE Period in the open -label study, it will be considered in all [ADDRESS_196853] data listing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Study drug exposure will be summarized for the OL-SS in terms of treatment a subject received 
in the open -label study, defined as [(the last day of study drug in the open-label study − the first 
day of study drug in the open-label study) + 1 day], regardless of study drug interruption. 
Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_168798]-FAS, and will be calculated as: 100  [1 – (total number of days of study drug interruption in 
the open-label study) / (duration of study drug exposure in days in the open-label study)]. A 
study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. 
In addition, percentage of tablets taken in the open-label study will also be summarized overall 
and by [CONTACT_168799]-FAS, and will be calculated as 100  [(total number of

13 PROCEDURA L, ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) a fter the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs will 
be assessed and those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be 
documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be 
provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the 
absence of a diagnosi s, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE 
(e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of 
the following: 
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093]. 
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_196857]’s cli nical status indicates a life-threatening AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study 
participation, as defined in Section 9.1.5 . 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_196858]’s source documents. The following data will be docu mented for 
each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer. gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2018). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 a nd 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.”  When 
considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those in the 
CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be 
determined accor ding to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with  regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Causality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table 13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_196859] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational stud y drug.  
Protocol VX18- 445-110, Version 1.[ADDRESS_196860]’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_196861] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table 13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
Protocol VX18- 445-110, Version 1.0 Page 45 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, n ot 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through 
completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_168800] 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety 
Protocol VX18- 445-110, Version 1.0 Page 46 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS 
within 24 hours of identification .  
For S AEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through 
completion of study participation, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well 
as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to 
report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: 
Email:  [EMAIL_3373]  (preferred choice) 
Fax: +[PHONE_3678]  
For tec hnical issues related to submitting the form, contact [CONTACT_756]: +[PHONE_3679] 
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_168801](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters 
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and 
participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory 
requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for 
the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/IEC of all 
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects.

accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely manner, consistent with Good Publication 
Practices .17_ENREF_17   
Publication Planning : Vertex staff along with the lead principal investigators, the steering 
committee, and/or the publication committee will work together to develop a publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship of publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria18: 
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; and 
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.

Vertex Pharmac euticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols  
Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with 
these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and 
statistically significant improvements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well 
tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects.  
During this COVID -19 pand emic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel 
participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize 
any unnecessary risk to COVID -[ADDRESS_196875] 
to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable.  
Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. 
There are no operational changes to the  study protocols for subjects who can travel to the study 
sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot  travel to the 
study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are 
being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the 
COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to 
ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies.  
Addendum Vers ion 3.0 summarizes  additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical 
studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety.

distance VA with study lenses, collected in logMAR, for each eye.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
No inferences are to be made on the primary effectiveness endpoint; therefore, no hypotheses 
are formulated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
Descriptive statistics wil l be presented.

6.6 Handling of Missing Data  
All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analysis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out for the primary analysis.  
6.7 Multiplicit y 
No multiplicity adjustment needs to be considered for the effectiveness endpoints since no 
formal hypothesis testing will be conducted.  
6.8 Safety Analysis  
The safety endpoints for this study are AEs, biomicroscopy findings, and device deficiencies.

7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES  
Terms and Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in 
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device (test product ). Note: For s ubjects, 
this definition includes events related to the test product , the 
control product , or the procedures involved. For users or other

product . 
Adverse Device 
Effect (ADE)  AE related to the use of an investigational medical device (test 
product ) or control product . Note: This definition includes AEs 
resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, 
deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; any 
malfunction; and  use error or intentional misuse of the test product 
or control product .  
Anticipated Serious 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Serious ADE  which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome 
has been identified in the risk management file.  
Device Deficiency  Inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Note: This definition 
includes malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Malfunction  Failure of a medical device to meet its pe rformance specifications 
or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications 
include all claims made in the labeling of the device. The intended 
performance of the device refers to the intended use for which the 
device is labeled or marketed.  
Non-serious Adverse 
Event  AE that does not meet the criteria for a n SAE . 
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  AE that led to any of the following:  
• Death.  
• A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either 
resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, ie, it 
does not include an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
b) any potentially sigh t-threatening event or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266].  
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not conside red 
an SAE. In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243288]:

overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician's office or an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi [INVESTIGATOR_222228]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13270], the event is serio us. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” occurred, the event  should be 
considered serious.  
d) a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).  
e) any indirect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic 
test results when used within manufacturer ’s instructions 
for use.  
• Fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
Refer to Section 7.[ADDRESS_295180] 
(SADE)  ADE  that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of 
an SAE . 
Significant Non -
Serious Adverse 
Event  A significant non -serious AE is a symptomatic, device -related, 
non-sight threatening AE that warrants discontinuation of any 
contact [CONTACT_13297] [ADDRESS_295181] that results in a different medical device 
respon se than intended by [CONTACT_13298].

constitute a use error.

Population.  
• The Modified Intent- to-Treat Population (mITT) will consist of all subjects who are transplanted.  The 
mITT analyses will be considered secondary analyses of effectiveness.  
• The Donor Liver P opulation will consist of all donor livers which have preservation initiated using the 
OCS Liver System .   
Effectiveness 
Analysis The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the Per Protocol and mITT Populations.  The Per Protocol analysis 
will be considered the primary analysis.  Multiple imputation methods will be used for data imputation for any 
patients with missing values for this endpoint.  
 
Each secondary effectiveness endpoint will be summarized using counts and percentages and an exact 95% confidence interval for the true percentage based on the binomial distribution.   The secondary effectiveness 
endpoints will be analyzed using the PP and the mITT Populations.  The Per Protocol analysis will be considered 
the primary analysis.

For livers that are not transplanted, the reason(s) for non -transplantation (including device failure) will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  The number and percentage of donor livers in the Donor Liver 
Population for which these was a device fa ilure will also be presented.

• It lacks any perfusion capabilities to maintain the liver in a near-physiologic
 (in- vivo-
like) environment after the donor liver is retrieved from the body of the donor 
(Vogel, et al., 2012).  This limitation results in significant underutilization of the 
donor livers with fatty cells (macrosteatotic livers) and DCD livers.  This further limits the use of these donor livers that otherwise are functioning normally in the body of the donor.  
• It lacks any ability to evaluate organ metabolic state and function after procurement and preservation to determine the suitability of the donor livers for transplantation (Vogel, et al., 2012).  This significantly limits the utilization of donor livers that are subjected to the negative, non-physiologic conditions of brain death in the donor and it severely limits the utilization of DCD livers. 
1.2. Potential Clinical Solutions to Overcome Limitation s in Donor Liver 
Utilization  
Over the past 15+ years, there has been a global focus on ex -vivo organ perfusion in a near 
physiologic condition as a promising technique to overcome the current challenges in organ preservation and to potentially increase utilization of donor organs (liver, lung, heart, and kidney) that are currently not used due to shortcomings of cold storage (Olthoff, et al., 2010) . 
Isolated liver perfusion has been extensively studied for over 30+ years using a variety of different perfusates and perfusion temperatures.  More recently, there has been an international focus in the liver transplant clinical and scientific community on normothermic liver perfusion using blood based perfusate to minimize the negative impacts of cold ischemic preservation on donor livers for transplantation.  In addition, by [CONTACT_407457], donor livers from heart beating or DCD donors can be assessed ex-vivo for suitability for transplantation.  
The TransMedics’ OCS Liver System technology is a portable system for ex -vivo perfusion and 
assessment of the donor livers for transplantation.  The OCS Liver System maintains the donor 
liver in a metabolically active and functioning state (producing bile), by [CONTACT_407458]-based perfusion solution.  The OCS Liver System is intended to significantly reduce ischemia and reperfusion injuries on the donor livers and enable metabolic and functional assessment of donor livers to assess their suitability for transplantation.  The OCS Liver System may enable the following clinical advantages: 
• Reduction of the ischemia and reperfusion injuries on the donor livers during preservation, thus, eliminating the significant logistical and geographical barriers to Liver transplantation that currently exist with cold storage preservation. 
• Optimization of donor liver ex-vivo environment by [CONTACT_407459], while also maintaining near normothermic condition to avoid the negative impact of cold temperature on fatty livers. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-102019 
 
Revision 2.0          Page 10 of 41 • Ex-vivo assessment of donor liver metabolic and functional state utilizing standard 
clinical tests of liver enzymes, bile production and lactate metabolism, enabling the 
transplanting clinical team to judge the suitability of the donor liver fo r 
transplantation and minimizing the risk of transplanting questionable donor livers 
into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
In summary, there is a public health need for technologies, like the OCS Liver System, that can address the current shortcomings of the standard of care cold storage preservation for liver transplantation.  Addressing the shortcomings of cold storage will allow increased utilization of donor livers, including fatty livers and DCD livers, and will help to overcome current geographical and logistical challenges to utilization of the existing donor pool.  Enabling more liver transplants will help to address the disparity between the number of patients on the waiting list and the availability of donor livers. 
 
1.3. Subject E nrollment and Health Insurance 
Approximately 30-40% of liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_407432].  Therefore, it is expected that Medicare patients will consent to participate in this study.  Since Medicare patients in need of transplantation do not differ from transplant candidates receiving coverage from other payors, Medicare patients will be treated in the same manner as all other study Subjects and will realize the same potential benefits and risks experienced by [CONTACT_407460]. 
2. SUMMARY OF PRIOR TESTING AND INVESTIGATIONS 
2.1.  OCS Liver System Nonclinical Testing  
The OCS Liver System is CE-marked and has undergone extensive preclinical testing to demonstrate its safety, effectiveness, and readiness for clinical use, before placement on the EU market.  The Liver Perfusion Set has also been evaluated and tested in accordance with ISO-[ZIP_CODE] “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices.”  These test results demonstrated that the device and its materials are biocompatible and suitable for their intended use.  The Liver Perfusion Set will be provided sterile using validated methods, and is appropriately packaged to maintain sterility.  The system has also undergone extensive preclinical bench testing for: electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility, and validation and verification testing (including validation of the device software).  All tests and results have demonstrated that the OCS Liver System meets its expected performance specifications and is safe and suitable for clinical use. 
Functional animal studies have demonstrated the safety, suitability, and performance of the 
OCS Liver System for preservation of donor livers. 
2.2. OCS Liver PROTECT Study 
The PROTECT Study is a prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized study of the OCS Liver being conducted in the U.S .  The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the OCS to

Liver Graft-Related Adverse Events (LGRAEs) are those which have any untoward effect on the health or safety of the patient and that are related to the transplanted liver function (except for acute rejection).  LGRAEs will be collected from the time a subject is transplanted with a liver 
preserved on OCS until the completion of the 30-day follow-up evaluation.  A LGRAE will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
9.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An adverse event will be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Results in, leads to, or contributes to, a death 
• Is life-threatening 
• Results in permanent disability or incapacity (i.e., permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure) 
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] 
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude a permanent disability or incapacity 
• Results in fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital anomaly/birth de fect. 
Only liver graft-related SAEs will be followed until their resolution. 
9.3. Anticipated and Unanticipated Adverse Events  
The investigator will assess each adverse event for whether it is anticipated or unanticipated.  An unanticipated adverse event is defined as any adverse effect on health or safety, or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the safety, or welfare of subjects.

9.4. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)   
An UADE means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified or encountered before at least once in standard clinical practice, in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-[ADDRESS_513829] .  The description of 
the adverse event will include: the date of onset, duration, severity, seriousness, the 
relationship of the event to the trial treatment, anticipated or not, and any treatment required.  All liver graft-related serious adverse events occurring during the course of the first [ADDRESS_513830] -transplant will be reported to TransMedics, Inc., as well as documented on the 
appropriate electronic case report form(s).  For all liver  graft-related SAEs, the investigator is 
required to supply any additional data that may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  Additionally, any serious adverse events (SAE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE ) 
should be reported to TransMedics, Inc., as soon as possible after the investigator learns of the event.  LGRAEs will be recorded up to the 30-day follow-up or through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407445] [ADDRESS_513831] patient safety, 
may specify a different follow-up period.  The Sponsor is responsible for the classification and reporting of liver graft-related adverse events to the appropriate regulatory authorities, and for 
the on-going safety evaluation of the trial in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] and governing 
regulatory requirements. 
9.6. Relationship of an Adverse Events (AEs) to OCS Liver  System   
The investigator will assess the relationship of the Adverse Event (AE ) to the OCS Liver System.  
The relationship will be assessed using the following categories:  
• Definitely Related:  There is a reasonable causal and temporal relationship between preservation with the OCS Liver System and the adverse event. 
• Probably Related:  It is more likely than not that there is a reasonable causal relationship between preservation with the OCS Liver System and the adverse event. 
• Unlikely Related:  There is a temporal relationship with preservation with the OCS Liver System and the adverse event, but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the trial device and the event. 
• Unrelated:  There is no relationship between preservation with the OCS Liver System 
and the adverse event. 
9.7. Severity  
The investigator will rate the severity of the adverse event using the following categories: 
• Mild:  The adverse event is transient and/or easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423]. 
• Moderate:  The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities. 
• Severe:   The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities. 
9.8. Pre- Existing Conditions  
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be reported as adverse events. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-[ADDRESS_513832] deviation, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  
All statistical procedures will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or higher.  
10.2. Analysis Populations  
10.2.1.  Per Protocol Population  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all subjects who are transplanted and have no 
major protocol violations and for whom the donor liver received the complete preservation procedure.  The major protocol violations that will exclude a subject from this population are the following:  
• Ineligible for the study according to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_407446] 
• Ineligible for the study according to the donor organ inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• Failure to complete adequate post-transplant assessments to support the primary, secondary or safety endpoints 
• Other major protocol violations. 
The primary analysis of effectiveness and of secondary and othe r endpoints will be based on 
the PP Population. 
10.2.2.  Modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
The Modified Intent-to-Treat Population (mITT) will consist of all subjects who are transplanted.  
The mITT analyse s will be considered secondary analyses of effectiveness.  The safety analysis 
will also be based on the mITT population. 
10.2.3.  Donor Liver Population  
The Donor Liver Population will consist of all donor livers which have preservation initiated 
using the OCS Liver System.   
10.3. Data Analysis 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for this 
study and will be finalized prior to the database lock.  Statistical summaries described in the sections below will primarily be provided for all subjects (i.e., overall summary) in the analysis populations of interest unless otherwise stated. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-[ADDRESS_513833] disposition will be summarized and presented for the number and percentage of 
subjects who were enrolled, screen failures, completed the study, and discontinued early (including reasons for discontinuations). 
10.3.2.  Major Protocol Deviations 
Major protocol deviations will be identified and documented based on a review of potential 
deviations.  The potential major protocol deviations will be identified before database lock, either through programmatic checks of study data (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria violations), as well as through review of selected data listings (e.g., site-entered comments).  The potential major protocol deviations to be reviewed include, but are not limited to, subjects who did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria or eligibility was not adequately verified. 
Individual major protocol deviations will be presented in a data listing.  The number and 
percentage of subjects with major protocol deviations will be summarized by [CONTACT_407465]. 
10.3.3.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics, including (age, gender, race, and ethnicity where applicable), and other baseline 
characteristics collected at screening, such as height, weight, body mass index will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  These data will be presented as a listing.  
10.3.4.  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint   
The primary effectiveness endpoint for this study is the incidence of Early Liver Allograft 
Dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, defined as presentation of one or more of the 
following criteria: 
• AST level > 2000 IU/ml within the first 7 postoperative days; 
• Bilirubin  ≥ 10 mg/dl on postoperative day 7;  
• INR ≥ 1.6 on postoperative day 7; or  
• Primary non-functioning graft within the first 7 days. 
This endpoint will be analyzed using the Per Protocol and mITT Populations.  The Per Protocol analysis will be considered the primary analysis.   
Subgroup analyses of the primary effectiveness endpoint will be performed for the following 
subgroups of patients: 
• DCD (donation after circulatory death) patients 
• Fatty liver patients 
• Donor Age  
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_407447] > 30. 
No data imputation or statistical tests will be performed for these subgroup analyses. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-102019 
 
Revision 2.0          Page 28 of 41 10.3.5.  Secondary Effectiveness and OCS Donor Liver Assessment Endpoints  
The secondary effectiveness endpoints for this trial are as follows: 
• OCS donor liver assessment during perfusion, defined as, among donor livers 
preserved using OCS for the entire preservation period, the proportion of livers on which measurements of all of the following during perfusion will be available on OCS device before transplant 
- Lactate level (every two hours) 
- Average bile production rate (based on total bile production volume and 
duration of OCS perfusion) 
- Hepatic artery pressure (continuously) 
- Portal vein pressure (continuously) 
• OCS Measurements during organ perfusion 
• Patient survival at Day-[ADDRESS_513834] -transplantation 
• Patient survival at time of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407448] -transplantation. 
These endpoints will be analyzed using the Per Protocol and mITT Populations, with the Per Protocol analysis being considered the primary analysis.  Multiple imputation methods will be 
used for data imputation for patients with missing values for these endpoints. 
Subgroup analyses of the secondary endpoints will be performed for the same subgroups of 
patients as for the primary effectiveness endpoint.  No data imputation or statistical tests will be performed for these subgroup analyses. 
10.4. Analysis of Safety  
Safety will be analyzed principally by [CONTACT_407456]-related serious adverse events (SAEs) up to the 30-day follow-up after transplantation.  This endpoint is defined as the average number of liver  graft-related serious adverse events through the [ADDRESS_513835], consisting of the following serious adverse events (at 
most one per type per person): 
• Primary non-function (defined as irreversible graft dysfunction requiring emergency liver re -transplantation or death within the first 10 days, in the absence of 
immunologic or surgical causes) 
• Ischemic biliary complications (ischemic biliary strictures, and non-anastomotic bile duct leaks) 
• Vascular complications (liver graft-related coagulopathy, hepatic artery stenosis, hepatic artery thrombosis and portal vein thrombosis) 
• Liver allograft infections (liver abscess, cholangitis, etc.). 
In addition, the numbers and percentages of subjects experiencing at least one liver graft-related AE, at least one (definitely or probably-related) device-related AE, at least one 
unanticipated AE, and at least one serious AE, and the number and percentage of deaths will all

Revision 2.0          Page 30 of 41 11. RISK ANALYSIS 
This clinical trial has been designed to ensure that the benefits and knowledge gained from the 
trial outweigh the potential risks to the subjects.  The subjects are adults undergoing primary liver transplants.  
11.1. Potential Risks 
The potential risks to subjects from participation in this clinical trial include the following:  
• Potential Risks Associated with Liver Transplant Procedures:   
Potential risks associated with any liver transplant procedure include post-operative 
complications, such as graft failure, primary graft dysfunction, rejection, infection and other organs/systems complications, graft vessel disease (an expression of chronic rejection), abnormal kidney function, diabetes, high level of cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer and neurological complications. 
• Potential Risks Associated with the OCS Liver System:   
Subjects have the risk of not receiving organs preserved with the OCS Liver System under certain conditions including: (1) the OCS Liver System may not function properly, or there may not be personnel available trained in the use of the OCS Liver System or (2) the OCS Liver System may malfunction, or the medical staff may make an error which could lead to damage of the donor liver.  If this occurs, the subject will have to wait for a new donor liver to become available.  In no case does the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_407449].  
As with any medical device, there is always a risk of extremely rare or previously 
unknown side effects developi[INVESTIGATOR_407450].  However, at this time, there are no known potential risks other than those associated with liver transplant procedures performed under the current standard of care. 
• Potential Risk of Using a Donor Liver that is Unsuitable for Transplantation: 
Regardless of the preservation system that is used, there is the risk that a patient can 
receive a liver that does not adequately function.  There is the possibility that the donor liver may not meet transplantability criteria after OCS preservation and would be turned down for transplant.  The anticipated frequency of this event is known.  There is a risk that the surgeon may transplant a liver that does not function or functions poorly after transplant.  This risk exists for any liver preservation technology. 
11.2. Manner in Which the Risks Will be Minimized  
The Sponsor has relied upon a number of different means, including the device design, risk analysis and management process, preclinical testing, prior clinical testing and the clinical protocol itself, to minimize the risks to subjects and to protect their safety and welfare.  
The OCS Liver System has undergone extensive preclinical and animal studies to demonstrate 
that the device performs as intended and all material are biocompatible.  Previous clinical studies, including the Liver PROTECT study, have demonstrated the safety of the device. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-102019 
 
Revision 2.0          Page 31 of 41 In addition, this clinical protocol incorporates several procedures to minimize the risks to 
subjects and to ensure the benefits of the clinical trial outweigh its potential risks. 
• The donor liver acceptance criteria after OCS Liver System perfusion and assessment are based on clinically relevant markers for perfusion of donor livers on OCS and clinical standards of accepting conventional donor livers for transplantation.  Thus, the donor liver will be fully assessed based on the current standards of evaluating donor liv ers 
before acceptance for transplantation.  
• As with any liver transplant procedure, subjects will be monitored before, during and after the operative procedure.  The investigators have extensive experience with liver transplants and will be trained (or have already been trained) on the use the OCS Liver System to further minimize risk. 
• The trial will be monitored to ensure the identification, documentation, and analysis of adverse events; and to ensure compliance with the protocol and procedures that are in place for conducting research to protect the safety and well-being of all subjects. 
Lastly, the OCS Liver PROTECT study has not raised any questions regarding safety of the device , 
and no safety issues or concerns have been raised by [CONTACT_1758]’s independent DSMB. 
 
11.2.1.  Potential Benefits  
The low utilization of donor livers has contributed to the severe shortage of donor livers.  The 
OPTN/SRTR Annual Report indicates that, 12 months after listing, 18% of patients will die or 
become delisted (Kim, et al., 2019).  
The OCS Liver System’s preservation and assessment capabilities could potentially increase the rate of utilization of donor livers and reduce waiting list time and mortality.  In addition, the OCS Liver System’s ability to assess donor livers allows for the assessment of the function of the donor liver before it is transplanted. 
11.2.2.  Risk: Benefit Ratio 
Based on the above, the benefits of using OCS Liver System technology to preserve and assess 
livers to ensure their suitability for liver transplantation outweigh the potential risks to trial subjects.  
12. DEVICE/SITE MANAGEMENT 
12.1. Packaging and Labeling  
The OCS Liver Perfusion Set and accessories will be supplied sterile and are intended and labeled for single use. 
The OCS and its components will be clearly labeled as an investigational device according to 21

Revision 2.0          Page 36 of 41 15.3. Interim Monitoring Visits 
Interim monitoring visits will be conducted periodically by [CONTACT_407469] a 
mutually convenient date with the site.  The monitor will visit each site as needed to ensure the following:  
• Facilities continue to be adequate and acceptable. 
• Informed consent has been obtained. 
• The protocol is being properly followed and carried out by [CONTACT_407470]. 
• The IRB has approved or been notified of any protocol changes. 
• Accurate, complete and current records are being maintained, and the information recorded and submitted to the Sponsor is representative of the subject’s record and other source documents. 
• Accurate, complete and timely adverse event reports are being submitted to the Sponsor.  
• The reason for a subject’s withdrawal from the trial has been documented. 
• Reports are being submitted to the IRB and Sponsor. 
15.4. Frequency of Monitoring Visits  
The frequency of monitoring visits will be determined on the basis of several factors, including the duration of the trial, number of subjects enrolled, number of investigators/sites, complexity of the trial, and number of outstanding issues from previous visits.   
15.5. Close-out Visit 
The close -out visit may be combined with a monitoring visit.  The following tasks will be 
completed at the close-out visit:  
• Ensure that all electronic forms have been completed. 
• Ensure that any database queries have been resolved. 
• Remind the investigator of the obligation to retain study records and any other post-
study obligations. 
15.6. Additional Auditing 
Regulatory authorities may also audit the investigator during or after the trial.  The investigator will contact [CONTACT_76631], and will fully cooperate with the audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner. 
15.7. Protocol Deviations 
This trial will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation in which the protection, safety, and well-being of a subject requires a protocol deviation, based on the judgment of the investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designated by [CONTACT_093]).  If the deviation from the protocol is necessary to protect the 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS-LVR-[ADDRESS_513841] in an emergency, such protocol deviations will be 
reported to the Sponsor and the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after 
the emergency occurred.   
In the event of a deviations from the protocol due to an accident or mistake (e.g., protocol-
mandated assessment not performed or done out of window), the site will document the deviation on the Protocol Deviation eCRF.  All efforts should be made to keep protocol deviations to a minimum.  
15.8. Clinical Events Committee 
The Sponsor will utilize an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC).  Responsibilities of the CEC and frequency/scheduling of CEC meetings will be performed as outlined in the CEC charter. 
15.9. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established by [CONTACT_407471], the safety data and the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints.  The DSMB will make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuation, modification or termination of the clinical trial.  Further details on member responsibilities and frequency/scheduling of DSMB meetings are contained in the DSMB charter.  
15.10.  Investigator Device Training 
Device training will be provided to all new team members at an investigational site who have no experience with the OCS Liver System operation, prior to patient enrollment in the trial.  Device training, when necessary, will be conducted at the TransMedics clinical training facility or equivalent training facility.  
15.11.  Confidentiality 
All information generated in this trial will be considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the trial without written prior permission from the Sponsor.  Authorized regulatory officials and Sponsor personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records.  All investigational devices and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, 
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_1034].  Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_407472].   
15.12.  Amendment Policy 
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201], except if the deviation from the protocol is necessary to protect the life and physical well-being of a subject in an emergency

PROTOCOL  
Liver Parenchyma Tissue Sample:   
• Each tissue specimen is a 2.0 cm long 16 -gauge needle biopsy taken perpendicular to 
the liver capsule from the right lobe.  It should be stressed that the needle NOT be 
inserted parallel to the capsule. 
• The tissue sample can then be placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, which is standard at most institutions.   
• The specimen container must be CLEARLY LABELED with an anonymous c ode and 
specimen information.  Bar coding is preferable.   
• The label should also contain the timing of the biopsy:  a) donor pre-retrieval; b) post-preservation (before implant); and c) post-reperfusion.  
Timing of Liver Biopsy Samples:  
• Liver tissue samples taken at the following timepoints: 
- Donor liver pre -retrieval.  Only d onor livers that are clinically suspected to be 
fatty by [CONTACT_407473], will require a pre-retrieval biopsy readout to estimate the degree of macrosteatosis and confirm eligibility (≤40% macrosteatosis) 
- Post-OCS preservation at the end of back preparation and immediately before the start of re-implantation  
- 90-120 minutes after reperfusion of the transplanted liver (prior to abdominal closure). 
Bile Duct Specimens (if applicable):   
• Any tissue trimmed from the bile duct or cystic duct should be placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin, as above, and CLEARLY LABELED, as to the center and participant and location of the sample.  For example, 001-001 "distal common bile duct trimming."   
Timing of Bile Duct Specimen:  
• Pathology sample of common bile duct taken post -preservation: 
- Post preservation at the end of back preparation and immediately before the start of re-implantation OR 
- Post reperfusion-Prior to biliary anastomosis.

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_615035] recent amendment.
Amendment INT-6(03November 2017)
This amendment is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union ,in that it does not significantly 
impact the safety or physical/men tal integrity of subjects, nor th e scientific value of the study.
The overall reason for the amendm ent: The overall objective of this amendm ent is to include minor changes and 
corrections for consistency within the protocol, and to align the protocol with the sponsor’s current protocol 
template.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: To clarify that tapering off of treatment after study completion or at early  withdraw al is not 
mandatory linked to the use of study drug but is also possible w ith commercially available product.
6. Dosage and 
Administration; 9.1.1. 
Overvie wThe term “study drug” was replaced by [CONTACT_479250] “topi[INVESTIGATOR_479111]” to allow  the use of commercially ava ilable drug for tapering off.
Rationale: To clarify that the decision regarding subects’ eligibility to participate in the optional Post Study 
Follow -up phase is based on local dual energy x-ray absorptiom etry (DEXA )scan results (change in Z-score of -
0.5 or greater). This is because the central DEXA scan results are available only with delay, and the decision 
should be made on the day of the regular M12 visit.

Approved, Date: 3 November 2017Amendment INT-5(24August 2017 )
This a mend ment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, in that it does impact the scientific 
value of the trial .
The overall reason for the amendm ent: The overall objective of thisamendment is to improve a 
slow er-than-expected study enrollment . At the current rate of subject randomization, the previously agreed -upon 
milestone for the study completion will not be met. Two major revisions, which should lead to a higher enrollment 
rate w ithout impacting the overall study objectives and data analysis ,will be implemented inthis amendment: 
The inclusion criterion # [ADDRESS_615037] enrollment –from “up to [ADDRESS_615038] 3 months” to “up to 10seizures within 
the last 5 months” –and
An optional use of local laboratory evaluations as basis for randomization (in addition to the mandatory 
central laboratory evaluation), although the central laboratory evaluation results will be used for 
change -from -baseline analyses. The optional use of a local lab for th e evaluation of 25 -hydroxy -vitamin 
D, 1,25 -dihydroxy -vitamin D, Parathyroid hormone (intact) and IGF -[ADDRESS_615039] 
objected that a s creening period of up to 28 days before initiating a drug treatment for new -onset, pediatric 
seizure disorder is not a reasonable w aiting period for the subjects, their parents, and treating/referring 
physicians. It is expected that a shorter minimum scree ning period w ill improve the enrollment rate.
In addition, minor changes were included to specify theuse of local DEXA scan results for deciding about the 
subject’s eligibility to participate in the optional Follow -Up phase, and a clarification that the screening period 
should start no more than 35 days before baseline ,instead of “28 ± 7 days”, and may be as short as possible if all 
appropriate screening assessments will have been completed .
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: The expansion of inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_615040] 
1seizure, but no more than 10seizures in 5months (that is, a seizure frequency of approximately no greater than 
2seizure epi[INVESTIGATOR_479112]), the loss of prospective subjects will be reduced , while the expected efficacy of 
monotherapy, using either of the two study drugs, would not be adver sely affected. Moreover, this revision is 
expected not to change the treatment that each patient would otherw ise receive if the patient were to receive 
treatment outside of the study.

before the study drug treatment can be initiated.

25-hydroxy -vitamin D;1,25-dihydroxy -vitamin D;Parathyroid horm one 
(intact) ;and IGF -1.
To reduce the duration of the screening phase , oneor moreof these laboratory 
parameters may be evaluated at the local laboratory ,at the discretion of the 
investigator .In such instance, the local laboratory instructions should be 
followed and local reference ranges should be applied. The local laboratory 
results should be used for decision regarding randomization . The central 
laboratory evaluation results will still be obtained and will be used for change -
from -baseline analys es. The additional use of a local laboratory might lead to an 
increase in blood volume to be drawn from the subject at screening.
Rationale: To ensure that the initial 24-hour urine collection will be completed before initiation of study drug 
therapy and the 24 -hour urine collection at Month -12during study drug therapy .

Rationale: To clarify that the screening phase is any period up to 35 days. The previous Time and Event Schedule 
described a screening phase of 21 to 35 days (28 ±7days ). A screening phase of less than 21 days is desirable and 
this is reflected in the updated Time and Event Schedule .

Amendment INT-3(15October 2014)
This amendment is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, in that it does not significantly 
impact t he safety or physical/mental integrity of subjects, nor the scientific value of the study.
The overall reason for the amendment: The overall reason for the amendment is to change the phase of the study 
from Phase 4 to Phase 3 , due to investigational monotherapy dosing for study medications in some countries, and to 
add a subspecialty referral for clinically important reductions in bone mineral density Z -score.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)

Title page Phase of the study changed from Phase 4 to Phase 3.
Rationale: For subjects w ith a clinically relevant drop in bone mineral density Z-score, a consultation may be 
recommended at the discretion of the investigator to assess the subject and guide potential management of the case.
Sec. 9.3, Safety 
Evaluations, Bone 
MineralizationLanguage added for the investigator to make an appropriate referral (ie, subspecialty 
consult) for further evaluation of subjects who develop treatment -emergent clinically 
significant bone mineral density Z -scores (at 6 month or 12 month measurement) .
Rationale: To provide consistent interpretation of all renal ultrasound results (ie, screening, 6 -and 12 -month 
results) in all patients across sites , central rather than local readings will be performed.
Time and Events Schedule; 
Sec. 9.3, Safety 
Evaluations, Renal Stone 
EvaluationText changed to indicate that renal ultrasounds will be read and interpreted centrally 
rather than locally (local reading at the screening visit is acceptable to determine 
eligibility fo r study enrollment) , and that both the technician administering the text 
and the central and local readers are blinded to study drug treatment .
Rationale: Clarified that subjects willnot be discontinued from the study for exceed ingcurrently labeled, 
maximum recommended doses if higher doses are required for optimal clinical effect ,as judged by [CONTACT_093] . 
In the event a subject takes a higher -than-recommended dose, their data collected w hile receiving higher doses may 
be ana lyzed separately. Higher doses could possibly confound safety evaluations including DEXA scans, laboratory 
tests (eg, bicarbonate), and renal ultrasounds (eg, increased nephrolithiasis). 
Synopsis; 
Section 6, Dosage and 
AdministrationAdded language that subjects will not be discontinued from the study if 
recommended maximum doses of study medication are exceeded. For any subject 
that exceeds the maximum recommended daily dose, data collected subsequent to the 
use of higher doses may be analyzed in a secondary analysis for each safety outcome 
of interest. 
Rationale: Evaluation of concomitant medications at screening visit is needed to determine if subjects meet 
inclusion/ exclusion criteria regarding whether they are treatment naïve or have previous treatm ent with AEDs.
Time and Events Schedule Added evaluation of co ncomitant medications at screening visit.
Rationale: To provide flexibility in the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) meeting frequency according to the 
needs of the study.
Sec. 11.5 Data Monitoring 
CommitteeChange DMC meetings from minimally on a quarterly basis to minimally on a 
semiannual basis .

STATISTICA L METHODS
Sample Size Determination
A total of 282 randomized subjects, 141 in each treatment group, will be enrolled inthe study. The 
sample size takes into account a1-year dropout rateof 29%, which is a conservative estimate based on 
the dropout rates was observed in a previous monotherapy study in the 6-to 15-year-oldage group ,Study 
TOPMAT -EPMN -106, including a dro pout rate of 22% in the study overall (both double -blind and open -
label phases) and a dropout rate of 35% for the double -blind phase. The sample size was estimated in 
order to achieve a sufficient precision for the estimates of the treatment effect on the key endpoints. The 
precision of the confidence interval ( CI)estimates for the key safety parameters are shown below:
Annual change in BMD (L1 -L4) Z-score: In the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS), 
mean annual change in BMD (L1-L4) Z-score in6-to 15-year-old healthy subjects was, as expected, 
minimal (0.01 -0.07). The standard deviation (SD) varied from 0.3 to 0.48 across sex and age groups. 
Assuming an SD of 0.4, with 100 completed subjects per group, the 95% CI for the treatment 
difference will have a precision of 0.12.
Annual change in height Z -score in the 2-to 9-year-old age group: In the monotherapy epi[INVESTIGATOR_479134] -EPMN -106, the observed change from baseline in mean height Z -score at 1 year among the 
2-to 9-year-old subjects trea ted with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400 mg/day was -0.18, with an SD of 0.28. Assuming 
that 53% of the subjects will be recruited in the 2 to 9-year-old age group, ie, 53completed subjects 
per treatment group, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will have a precision of 0.11.
Incidence of kidney stone formation: In the studies TOPMAT -PEP-3001 and TOPMAT -PEP-1002 in 
infants (1 month to 2 years of age), a 7% incidence of kidney stones was observed during the1-year 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_479135]. A sample size of 100completed subjects per treatment group 
will provide a 95% CI (Wilson score CI) for the treatment difference with a width of 0.12, assuming 
that the incidence of kidney stone formation is 7% and near zero in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_479136], respectively.

observed after 1 year of treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400 mg/day .Assuming an SD of 0.43, a sample 
size of 100completed subjects per treatment group will provide a 95% CI with a precision of 0.12.

Pharmacologic Profile
Pharmacologic effects that may contribute to the anticonvulsant activity  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479140] -activated sodium channels; potentiation of the ability  of 
γ-aminobuty rate (GABA) to activate some GABA Areceptors; inhibition of the kainate or 
∝-amino -3-hydroxy-5-methy lisoxazole -4-propi[INVESTIGATOR_479141] N-
methy l-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors; and a modest negative modulatory  effect on 
L-type and R-type voltage -activated calcium channels. Some studies suggest topi[INVESTIGATOR_479142], but this may be secondary  to effects on

seizure rate, percent age oftreatment responders, and global assessments made by [CONTACT_479255]. Dosages above 400mg/day  (600, 800, or 1,000 mg/day ) have not been shown to 
improve responses in dose -response studies in adults with POS.33

topi[INVESTIGATOR_24170] a lower dosage (400 mg/day vs. 50 mg/day ; p=0.0002 [log-rank test]). The 
separation between the groups in favor of the high-dosage group occurred early in the titration 
phase and was statistically  significant as early as 2 weeks after randomization (p=0.046), when, 
by [CONTACT_479256], subjects in the high-dosage group achieved a 
maximum topi[INVESTIGATOR_479165] 100 mg/day . The high-dosage group was also superior to the 
low-dosage group with respect to proportion of subjects remaining seizure -free, based on the 
Kaplan -Meier estimates, for at least 6 months (82.9% vs. 71.4%; p=0.005) and for at least 1 year

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_479167]; neuropsychiatric events of mild or moderate severity  are 
the most common treatment -emergent adverse events across subject populations. In general, 
there were no noteworthy  changes in clinical laboratory  analytes other than the expected 
decreases in serum bicarbonate/CO 2levels in topi[INVESTIGATOR_479168]. Metabolic acidosis, 
considered to be possibly  related to the carbonic anhy drase -inhibiting effect of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], has 
been reported less frequently  in adults compared with children but was most common ininfants
(1 to 24 months of age). In adolescents with migraine, there was no clinically  significant effect 
on serum CO 2.Overall , the incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory  findings are not 
notably  different for pediatric and adult subjects. 
Several issues of special interest have emerged during the development of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], including 
effects on liver function; metabolic acidosis; effects on growth and maturation; vision 
abnormalities (acute myopia and secondary  angle-closure glaucoma); oligo hidrosis, 
hyperthermia, and secondary  rash; hyperammonemia and encephalopathy , and kidney  stones. 
These are discussed in brief below, and are described in further detail in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
Safety Issues of Clinical Concern
Effects on Liver Function
Comprehensive review of clinical study  and postmarketing data revealed no evidence of direct or 
cumulative hepatotoxicity  by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_052]. Across study  populations (adjunctive epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y, 
monotherap y epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y, and migraine), hepatic event rates and la boratory  liver function test (LFT) 
values for topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] -treated subjects were similar to those of placebo -treated subjects and, 
generall y, better than those of subjects treated with comparator medications (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
valproate, and lithium). Spontaneo usly reported hepatic events are very rare (<1/10,000 
patient -years). Based collectively  on clinical study  and postmarketing data, the majorit y of 
hepatic events are transient and mild tomoderate in severity . Moreover, hepatic adverse events 
that were considered serious, led to discontinuation, or involved markedl y abnormal LFT values 
often were confounded by  [CONTACT_479257].33
Metabolic Acidosis
Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (ie,decreased serum bicarbonate below the 
normal reference range in the absence of chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_479169]) is associated with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237644]. This metabolic acido sis is caused by [CONTACT_479258][INVESTIGATOR_479170]. Such electrol yte imbalance has been

treatment, although cases can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decreases are 
usually  mild to moderate (average decrease of 4mEq/L  at daily  dosages of 400mg/day  in adults 
and at approximately  6mg/kg/day  in children); rarely, subjects can experience severe decreases, 
to values 10mEq/L .[ADDRESS_615073] growth and maturation in some 
children. Body weight was evalu ated among pediatric subjects 6 to 15 years of age in clinical 
studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_479171] y, and in 1 of these studies (study  TOPMAT -EPMN -106) 
body  mass index (BMI) was evaluated according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. 
Among pediatr ic subjects administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_479172] -EPMN -104, TOPMAT -EPMN -105, and TOPMAT -EPMN -106, mean body  weight 
increased in the double -blind treatment phase; most subjects experienced an increase or no 
change in body  weight. Of those with weight loss, most exhibited decreases of 1% to 9%. 
Adverse events of weight loss were reported in 21% of pediatric subjects but none was serious or 
treatment -limiting. In the open -label extension of monotherapy  treatment studies
TOPMAT -EPMN -104and TOPMAT -EPMN -106, mean body  weight of pediatric subjects also 
increased . 
During the double -blind phase of study  TOPMAT -EPMN -106, mean BMI decreases were 
observed for approximately  half of the pediatric subjects in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 50-/400-mg/day  group 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400-/400-mg/day  group, with most of the remaining subjects showing no change 
in BMI. Larger BMI decreases followed 400 mg/day  topi[INVESTIGATOR_479173] 50 mg/day . Based 
on CDC criteria, topi[INVESTIGATOR_479174]. Mean BMI decreases ( -1.3kg/m2) were observed at 
6 months among pediatric subjects whose dosage increased from 50 to 400 mg/day  during this 
study 's open -label extension .39

monotherap y studies . These results indicate that,in general, children continue to grow while 
receiving topi[INVESTIGATOR_479175], although at a rate slower than their normal healthy  
counterparts.33
Vision Abnormalities (Acute My opia and Se condary  Angle -Closure Glaucoma)
A medical condition consisting of sudden worsening of vision and an elevation of fluid pressure 
in the eyes (secondary  glaucoma) has been described in clinical studies and post-marketing 
reports in subjects taking topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], usuall y at the beginning of their treatment. In contrast to 
primary  narrow -angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary  angle-closure 
glaucoma associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_479176]. 
Symptoms include acute onset (within 1 month of initiating topi[INVESTIGATOR_214379] ) of decreased 
visual acuit y and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, anterior chamber 
shallowing, ocular hyperem ia (redness) ,and increased intraocular pressure. Mydriasis may or 
may not be present. The primary  treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479177] y as possible according to the judgment of the treating ph ysician.[ADDRESS_615074] of these events were reversible after topi[INVESTIGATOR_479178]. If visual problems occur at any time during topi[INVESTIGATOR_237644], consideration 
should be given to discontinuing the drug .
Oligohidrosis, Hy perthermia, and Secondary  Rash 
Oligohidrosis (decreased sweating) and hyperthermia , infrequently  resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
has been reported in clinical studies and post-marketing reports in association with the use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]. These cases were characterized by [CONTACT_479259]. Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated 
environmental temperatures. The majority  of the reports have been in children. Skin erythema 
has been reported secondary  to the hyperthermia and oligohidrosis and should be monitor ed; 
adequate h ydration is encouraged . 
Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy  
In clinical studies and post-marketing reports, concomitant administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479179] y in

Approved, Date: 3 November 2017Subjects With Partial -Onset Seizures
In pediatric subjects experiencing POS, levetiracetam is associated with somnolence, fatigue, and 
behavioral abnormalities.24
In a double -blind, controlled study  in children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_479187], 22.8% of 
levetiracetam -treated subjects experienced somnolence, compared with 11.3% of placebo 
subjects . The design of the study  prevented accurately  assessing dose-response effects. No 
subject discontinued treatment for somnolence. In about 3.0% of levetiracetam -treated subjects 
and in 3.1% of placebo subjects ,the dos age was reduced as a result of somnolence.24
Asthenia was reported in 8.9% of levetiracetam -treated subjects , compared with 3.1% of placebo 
subjects . No subject discontinued treatment for asthenia, but asthenia led to a dos age reduction in 
3.0% of levetiracetam -treated subjects compared with 0% of placebo subjects .24
A total of 37.6% of the levetiracetam -treated subjects experienced behavioral symptoms 
(reported as agitation, anxiety , apath y, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability , 
hostility , hyperkinesia, nervousness, neurosis, and pe rsonality  disorder), compared with 18.6% of 
placebo subjects . Hostility  was reported in 11.9% of levetiracetam -treated subjects , compared 
with 6.2% of placebo subjects . Nervousness was reported in 9.9% of levetiracetam -treated 
subjects , compared with 2.1% of placebo subjects . Depression was reported in 3.0% of 
levetiracetam -treated subjects , compared with 1.0% of placebo subjects .24
A total of 3.0% of levetiracetam -treated subjects discontinued treatment due to psychotic and 
nonpsy chotic adverse events, compared with 4.1% of placebo subjects . Overall, 10.9% of 
levetiracetam -treated subjects experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation 
or dosage reduction, compared with 6.2% of placebo subjects .24
Subjects With My oclonic Seizures
During clinical development, thenumber of subjects with myoclonic seizures exposed to 
levetiracetam was considerabl y smaller than the number with partial seizures. Therefore, 
underreporting of certain adverse events was more likely  to occur in the myoclonic seizure 
population. In adult and adolescent subjects experiencing myoclonic seizures, levetiracetam is 
associated with somnolence and behavioral abnormalities. It is expected that the events seen in 
POS subjects would occur in patients with JME. In a double -blind, controlled study in adults and 
adolescents with JME experiencing myoclonic seizures, 11.7% of levetiracetam -treated subjects
experienced somnolence compared with 1.7% of placebo subjects . In 1.7% of 
levetiracetam -treated subjects and in 0% of placebo subjects ,the dosage was reduced as a result 
of somnolence.

Clinical Protocol TOPMATEPY4067 Amendment INT -6
38
Approved, Date: 3 November 2017Non-psychotic behavioral disorders (reported as aggression and irritability ) occurred in 5% of 
the levetiracetam -treated JME subjects compared with 0% of placebo subjects . Non-psychotic 
mood disorders (reported as depress ed mood, depression, and mood swings) occurred in 6.7% of 
levetiracetam -treated JME subjects compared with 3.3% of placebo subjects . A total of 5.0% of 
levetiracetam -treated subjects had a reduction in dosage or discontinued treatment due to 
behavioral or psychiatric events (reported as anxiety , depressed mood, depression, irritability , 
and nervousness), compared with 1.7% of placebo subjects .
In a well-controlled clinical study  that included both adolescent (12 to 16 years of age) and adult 
subjects with myoclonic seizures, the most frequently  reported adverse events associated with 
the use of adjunctive levetiracetam , not seen at an equivalent frequency  among placebo -treated 
subjects , were somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis. The different pattern of adverse events, 
as compared with subjects with POS, is likely  due to the much smaller number of subjects in the 
JME study .24
Subjects With Primary  Generalized Tonic -Clonic Seizures
During clinical development, the number of subjects 4 years of age and older with PGTCS 
exposed to levetiracetam was considerabl y small er than the number with POS. As in the POS 
subjects , behavioral symptoms appeared to be associated with levetiracetam treatment. Gait 
disorders and somnolence were also described in the study  in PGTCS, but with no difference 
between placebo and levetiracet amtreatment groups and no appreciable discontinuations. 
Although it may be expected that drug-related events seen in POS subjects would be seen in 
PGTCS subjects (eg, somnolence and gait disturbance), these events may not have been 
observed because of the smaller sample size .[ADDRESS_615077] commonly  associated (≥3% insubjects receiving levetiracetam) with 
discontinuation or dosage reduction in the well-controlled pediatric POS study  were asthenia, 
hostility , and somnolence. The adverse event most commonly  associated (≥3% in subjects
receiving levetiracetam) with disco ntinuation or dosage reduction in the well -controlled pediatric 
JME study  was anxiety (2 subjects, 3.3%), but the small study  size (a total of 113 subjects 
enrolled with JME) limits the conclusions that can be drawn. The PGTCS study  was too small to 
adequatel y characterize the adverse events leading to discontinuation or dosage reduction.24
Hematologic Abnormali ties
Levetiracetam -treated pediatric subjects with POS experienced small, but statistically  significant, 
decreases in white blood cell (WBC )and neutrophil counts and increases in lymphocy te counts, 
as compared with placebo. In awell-controlled study , more levetiracetam -treated pediatric 
subjects with POS had a possibly  clinicall y significant abnormally  low total WBC value (3.0%

treatment groups with respect to neut rophil count . No subject was discontinued secondary  to low 
WBC or neutrophil counts. Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed 
in subjects with JME, the limited number of subjects limits the conclusions that can be drawn .[ADDRESS_615078] Abnormalities 
There were no meaningful changes in mean LFT values in controlled studies in adult or pediatric 
subjects ; LFT abnormalities were similar in drug-and placebo -treated subjects in controlled 
studie s (1.4%). No pediatric subjects were discontinued from controlled studies due to LFT 
abnormalities.[ADDRESS_615079] been reported in patients receiving marketed levetiracetam worldwide

suppression identified in some of these cases), Stevens -Johnson syndrome, thrombocy topenia, 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_188599], and weight loss. Alopecia has been reported with levetiracetam use; 
recovery  was observed in the majority  of cases where levetiracetam was discontinued.

Levetiracetam is not approved as monothera py for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ; however, investigator -initiated 
studies of children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_479188]. These monotherap y studies

1.2. Overall Rationale for the Study
Among its various pharmacologic actions, topi[INVESTIGATOR_24157] a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and may 
induce metabolic acidosis, and other changes (eg, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, and elevated 
urine pH) that may be associated with an increased tendency for kidney  stone formation.41
Chronic metabolic acidosis may be associated with abnormal bone mineralization and/or 
homeostasis of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus. Childhood is a critical period for bone 
mineralization and growth. The effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479190], bone mineralization ,and kidney 
stone formation have not been fully  and systematically  evaluated or well characterized in 
pediat ric populations.

For each subject, his or her parent(s) (preferably  both parents, if available) or a legally 
acceptable representative(s), as required by [CONTACT_427], must give written consent 
(permission) according to local requirements after the natur e of the study  has been fully 
explained and before the performance of any  study -related activity . Children (minors) or subjects 
who are unable to comprehend the information provided can be enrolled only after obtaining
consent from parents or a legally  acceptable representative. Assent must be obtained from 
children (minors) capable of understanding the nature of the study , typi[INVESTIGATOR_479194] [ADDRESS_615082] provided informed assent/consent refers to the subject (assent as 
applicable) and his or her parent(s) or the subject's legal guardian(s) or legally  acceptable 
representative(s) who have provided consent according to this process. Minors who assent to a 
study  and later withdraw their assent should not be maintained in the study  against their will, 
even if their parents still want them to participate.
The study  will include the following 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 28 days, an open -label 
treatment phase of 1 year's duration, and a posttreatment phase of 30 days’ duration. There may 
be an optional post-study  follow -up phase to obtain dual energy  x-ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) 
measurements in a subg roup of subjects who experience a clinically  important reduction (change 
in Z-score of -0.5 or greater) in BMD, based on local DEXA scan results, after [ADDRESS_615083] a repeat DEXA scan 6months 
after discontinuation of study  drug.
To minimize any bias in measurement, after randomization 3 of the safety  assessments will be 
obtained in a blinded fashion, inc luding the DEXA scan, renal ultrasound, and height.
Screening Phase:
Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Section 4, Subject Selection) will be eligible 
to enter into the study . They  (and/or their parents or legally  acceptable representatives) will sign an 
informed consent/assent form as appropriate (see Section 16.2.3 , Informed Consent) and enter a 
screening phase of up to 35days. During the screening phase, subjects will be assessed for study

description). Information will be transcribed onto the case report form (CRF). Seizure diaries will 
be maintained with the source documents.
Open -Label Treatme nt Phase:
Immediately  following the Screening Phase, qualified subjects, based on inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups during the open -label treatment 
phase: topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (up to 350 mg/day  in subjects 2 to <10 years of age, and up to 400 mg/day  in 
subjects 10 to 15 years of age) or levetiracetam (up to 60 mg/kg/day ). Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_479195] (efficacy  and safet y) during the open -label treatment phase but 
may not exceed these m aximum dosages. 
Only  AED monotherapy will be used for both treatment groups. However, subjects will not be 
discontinued from the study  if 1 or more concomitant AEDs are added after initiating treatment 
with study  drug. Data will be collected prior to the use of the concomitant AED(s) for the 
primary  analysis. Data subsequently  collected while on the concomitant AED(s) will be anal yzed 
in a secondary  anal ysis for each safet y outcome of interest.
All subjects will enter a 30-day posttreatment phase after completing the open -label treatment 
phase.
The open -label treatment phase has [ADDRESS_615084] on Day  1 (Visit 2). The Day  1 visit will serve as the baseline visit. 
All procedures on Day 1 (except dispensing of study  drug) should be completed before 
randomization.
Study  drug will be titrated as tolerated to the maximum recommended dosage for optimal clinical 
effect over approximately  6 to 8 weeks, based on titration guidelines according to clinical 
response (see Section 6, Dosage and Administration). For all subjects, at any  time, up -titration of 
open -label study  drug may be slowed down if clinically  indicated for tolerability , and may be 
accelerated if clinicall y indicated for seizure control. 
Subjects will return for a clinic visit at Month 1 and Month 2 for dispensing of study  medication.

3.2. Study Design Rationale
A study  population from 2 to 15years of ageis appropriate for this study  because this is the 
approved pediatric age group for topi[INVESTIGATOR_479171] y.Levetiracetam is indicated as 
adjunctive therapy for POS in adults and children ≥1 month of age with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ),PGTCS 
(adults and children ≥6 years of age with idiopathic generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ), and myoclonic 
seizures (adults and children ≥12 years of age with JME). It has been studied as monotherap y in 
pediatric subjects down to neonates and has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in all 
treatment settings . Evaluation of this target age group will provi de long-term systematic 
assessments of important safety  issues ,eg,chronic metabolic acidosis and effects on growth, 
bone mineralization, and nephrolit hiasis. Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_479263] (2 to 
5years of age, 6 to 9years of age, 10 to 12 years of age, and 13to 15years of age) in order to 
examine anydifferences in thesafet y profile between prepubescent children and postpubescent
adolescents . A study  duration of [ADDRESS_615090] clinically  important 
treatment -related effects on key safety  parameters (growth retardation , bone mineralization ,or 
kidney  stone formation ). See also Section 16.1, Study -Specific Design Considerations .

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_615091] and results (eg,difficult regimens requiring too many 
tablets may result in poor compliance, protocol violations ,or subjects prematurely droppi[INVESTIGATOR_479196] ), a double -blind approach is not optimal. An open -label study  is considered to be 
optimal given that the study  population will include pediatric subjects down to [ADDRESS_615092] attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenl y balanced 
across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity  of statistical comparisons across treatment 
groups.
Levetiracetam is an appropriate comparator because of its established efficacy for target seizure 
types, relativel y low toxicity , and lack of significant known risk of kidney  stones or possible 
deleterious effects on bone or growth. Levetiracetam is not approved as monotherapy  for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ; however, studies of children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_479188]. Notabl y, 
these monotherap y studies used the same titration and maint enance dosing as pi[INVESTIGATOR_479197]; overal l efficacy  and safet y outcomes were similar in both treatment settings.21,24,29,43On 
this basis, the FDA -approved dosing recommendations for levetiracetam (titration schedule, 
dosing frequency ) will be used in this study . 
Study  drugwill be given as monotherapy  only, since use of any concomitant AED may
potentially  confound results. However, subjects will not be discontinued from the study  if 1 or 
more concomitant AEDs are added after initiating treatment with study  drug. Data will be 
collected prior to the use of the concomitant AED(s) for the primary  analysis. Data subsequently 
collected while on the concomitant AED(s) will be analy zed in a secondary  analysis for each 
safet y outcome of interest.

5. TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND BLINDING
Procedures for Ra ndomization and Stratification
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated 
randomization schedule prepared before the study  by [CONTACT_43754]. 
The randomization will be balanced using randomly  permuted blocks and will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_479265] (2 to 5years of age, 6 to 9 years of age, 10 to 12 years of age, and 13to 
15yearsof age). The enrollment will be monitored throughout the study  to ensure that subjects 
are enrolled for each integer year in each treatment group. 
Based on this information , the interactive web-based response system (IWRS) will assign a 
unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study  drug kit 
for the subject. As subjects are randoml y assigned to treatment, the IWRS will assign a study  
drug kit to be dispensed at that visit. New study  drug kits will be assigned each time the IWRS is 
accessed for dispensing additional study  drug.
Blinding
As this is an open -label study , blinding procedures are not applicable for tre atment assignment.
To minimize any bias in measurement, after randomization [ADDRESS_615118] of the study  data. Procedures for 
main taining the blind will include the following (further details will be provided in a separate 
Blinding Plan for this study ):
Separate secure locations for blinded and unblinded study  documents
A separate office or ph ysical space for obtaining the height measurements
Blinded staff will not be permitted access to areas where unblinded activities are performed.
Measures will be required to ensure no overlap of equipment. Height will be measured by a 
trained individu al who is blinded (unaware of the treatment); blinded height measures are not 
to overlap assessments of unblinde d assess ments (weight and vital signs) .The same blinded

Blinded height measures are to be recorded in the source documents, or provided to the 
unblinded study  coordinator for entry into the source documents. The unblinded study  
coordinator will then enter this data, along with other visit data, into the CRF.
Documented measures will be required to ensure that no communication of blinded vs. 
unblinded data takes place in the same office suite.
6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTR ATION
Subjects will be randomly  assigned to receive unblinded, flexible dosages of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479204]:
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]: weight -based dosing for subjects 2 to <10 years of age, not to exceed 
350mg/day , as tolerated ; not to exceed 400 mg/day in subjects 10 to 15years of age, as 
tolerated
Levetiracetam: weight -based dosing for all subjects 2 to 15years of age, not to exceed 
60mg/kg/day , as tolerated
Subjects will receive study  drugin a twice -a-day regimen (BID). The first dose of study  drug on

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_479205] 2 to <10 Years of Age
Dosing in subjects 2 to <10 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the 
initial dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_479206] 25 mg/day,administered nightl y for the first week. Based 
upon tolerability , the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day  (25 mg BID) in the second week (see 
Table s1 to 3 in the titration schedules in Attachment 2). Dosage can be increased by 25to 
50mg/day  each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the maximum recommended dosage
should be attempted over 6to 8weeks. Based upon tolerability  and seizure control, the rate of 
titration may be adjusted to achieve optimal clinical response . The total daily  dosage should not 
exceed the maximum maintenance dosage for each range of body  weight (Table 1).Subjects 
with a body  weight >38 kg will be assi gned to the titration schedule for subjects 10 to 15 y ears of

soon as possible. However, if the subject is within 6 hours of taking the next scheduled dose, he 
or she should wait until then to take theusual dose of study  drug and skip the missed dose.
Subjects should not take a double dose in case of a missed dose.
Subjects should be titrated and maintained according to clinical response, eg,titration may be 
slowed on the basis of tolerability  and may be accelerated for the purposes of seizure control. 
Maint enance dosage s should be based on optimal clinical response and may be adjusted at any 
time during the open -label treatment phase. Subjects are recommended not to exceed maximum 
recommended maintenance dosages; however ,subjects will not be discontinued from the study  if 
higher doses are required for optimal clinical effect as judged by [CONTACT_093] .Data collected 
while on dosages that exceed maximal recommendations may be analy zed separatel y,as 
appropriate.
Once a subject completes the study  ordiscontinues early from the study , at the discretion of the 
investigator , he or she will either continue on commerciall y available topi[INVESTIGATOR_479211] a period of up to [ADDRESS_615123] will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the

withdrawn in one -third decrements during the 6-to 8-week titration period.
Only  AED monotherap y will be used for both treatment groups. In the event of insufficient 
seizure control or intolerability , it should be explored first if a dosage adjustment of the study  
drug might be useful before adding another AED . However, subjects will not be discontinued 
from the study  if 1 or more concomitant AEDs are added after initiating treatment with study  
drug. Data will be collected prior to the use of the concomitant AED (s)for the primary  analysis. 
Data subsequently  collected while on the concomitant AED (s)will be analy zed in a secondary

9.1.1. Overview
The Time and Events Schedule that follows the synopsis summarizes the frequency  and timing 
of safet y, PK, and other measurements applicable to this study .
The study  includes 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 35days, an open -label treatment phase 
of 1 year'sduration (including titration andmaintenance ), and a posttreatment phase of [ADDRESS_615126]-study  follow -up phase to obtain DEXA  measurements in a subgroup of 
subjects who experience a clinically  important reduction (change in Z-score of -0.5 or greater) in 
BMD, based on local DEXA scan results, after 1year of treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], to determine 
whether a decrease in BMD after or during 1year of treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_479212] .
These subjects will have a repeat DEXA scan [ADDRESS_615127] will be approximately  44.7 mL

Atthe discretion of the investigator, oneor more of these laboratory  parameters may be 
evaluated at the local laboratory to reduce the duration of the screening phase .In such 
instance s, the local laboratory  instructions should be followed and local reference ranges 
should be applied. The local laboratory  results would be used for decision regarding 
randomization . The central laboratory  evaluation results will be used for study  data analysis. 
The additional use of a local laboratory  might lead to an addit ional amount of blood volume 
to be drawn from the subject at screening.
Urinaly sis will be performed by  [CONTACT_2237] , and will include dipstick and sediment 
as noted below. If dipstick result is abnormal, flow cytometry  will be used to measure 
sediment. In case of discordance between the dipstick results and the flow cytometric results, 
the sediment will be examined microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y.

Urine Pregnancy  Testing (for girls of childbearing potential only)to be obtained at all visits 
after screening during the open -label treatment phase . If a girl starts menstruating and 
becomes of childbearing potential during the study , urine pregnancy  testsshould be obtained 
at all subsequent visits during the open -label treatment phase.
24-Hour Urine Collection: A 24-hour urine collection will be analyzed for pH, calcium, 
citrate, phosphorus, and creatinine levels. Collection instructions and storage conditions will 
be specified in the laboratory  manual. A 14-day window on either side of the scheduled 
Month 6 visit will be allowed for 24 -hour urine collection. The collection at Month 12 should 
be completed before the Month –[ADDRESS_615140] is still receiving study –drug therap y.
Additional use of local laboratories is allowed in cases where safet y follow -up is time-critical 
and the central laboratory  results are not expected before the need to take actions for safety 
reasons.
After consultation with the medical monitor , investigators may obtain additional laboratory
assessments and/or advice from local medical consultants in the event of any  clinically  important 
safet y concern.
Bone Age Radiograph
A hand/wrist x-ray will be obtained in the nondominant hand/wrist to determine bone age at 
baseline and at Month 12 (or final study  visit if a subject discontinues prematurel y).20This will 
be read and interpreted locally .

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_615141] an 
ECG at screening with no “abnormal, clinically significant” interpretations by a local 
cardiologist .
During the collection of ECGs, subjects should be in a quiet setting without distra ctions (eg, 
television, cell phones) . Subjects should rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5minutes before 
ECG collection and should refrain from talking or moving arms or legs. If blood sampling or 
vital sign measurement is scheduled for the same time point as ECG recording, the procedures 
should be performed in the following order: ECG, vital signs, blood draw.
Vital Signs
Vital signs will be recorded at the times given in the Time and Events Schedule. Measurement of 
vital signs includes axillary  temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842],and blood pressure .
Temperature will be assessed using anaxillary  thermometer; if temperature is ≥38.0 C, the 
temperature should be repeated immediatel y and both values recorded in the CRF. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_479217] 30 seconds. Blood pressure and heart rate 
measurements should be assessed with a completely  automated device (if available) consisting of 
an inflatable cuff and an oscillatory  detection system. All values will be registered ona built-in 
recorder so that measurements are observer -independent. If an automated device is not available, 
all manual heart rate measurements will be measured each time for a full minute to minimize the 
effects of heart rate variability . Blood pressure w ill be measured with t he cuff placed on the right 
arm. An appropriate size cuff has 1) an inflatable cuff bladder width that is at least 40% of the 
arm circumference (at a point midway  between the olecranon and the acromion) and 2) a cuff 
bladder length th at covers 80% to 100% of the circumference of the arm. 
Orthostatic vital signs will be obtained for all subjects pending cooperation of subjects. A set of 
3 measurements will be obtained at baseline only, separated by[CONTACT_479271] 10 minutes. 
Thereafter, only 1orthostatic vital sign measurement will be taken at all subsequent visits. The 
method for obtaining orthostatic vital signs will be as follows: subject will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 
5minutes prior to measurement, and stan ding for 2 minutes prior to measurement.
Physical Examination
Physical examinations and anthropometric measurements ,including weight, height, and pubertal 
stage according to Tanner’s classification ,37will be performed at the times specified in the Time 
and Events Schedule.
Height will be assessed using a wall-mounted stadiometer . Height will be read to the nearest 
0.1 cm; measures are to be repeat ed at least 3 times . Based on previous measurements and

additional measurements until 3 approximately  consistent measurements are obtained. All 
3final measurements will be recorded in the CRF ; all measurements will be recorded into the 
source documents .To obtain accurate measures, shoes and hair adornments should be 
removed and the child should be positioned with heels, buttocks ,and back of head against 
the stadiom eter.
The healthcare professionals who measure height at each visit must be trained in the 
standardized procedure. If possible, the same individual and the same equipment should 
collect all height measurements at each study  site, to help ensure consisten cy of 
measurements. 
All study  site personnel performing the height assessment must be blinded to study  treatment 
assignment and the rest of the subjects’ data to avoid/minimize bias. A blinded study  nurse or 
other staff will measure the height of the subject and record it in the source documents ,or 
provide it to the unblinded study  coordinator for entry  into the source documents. The 
unblinded study  coordinator will then enter this data, along with other visit data, into the 
CRF. The location for the height measurement data should be kept separate from the rest of 
the study  data, and procedures must be in place to ensure maintenance of the blind .
Body weight will be measured using digital electronic or beam balan ce scale to the nearest 
0.1kg.Prior to weight measurements, the scale should be set to zero to avoid drift in 
equipment functioning . Subjects will be weighed in examination gowns or in lightweight 
clothing and without shoes . If possible, weight measurements should be taken at the same 
time of day after the bladder is emptied so subjects are alway s evaluated inthe same 
physiologic state.
Tanner staging of subjects ofage [ADDRESS_615143] or by  a phy sician trained in the method .27

spent in a 24-hour day in 1 of 4 categories of activity /inactivity  to assess physical activity  levels 
on the basis of the standardized and validated activity  questionnaire. The total number of hours 
each subject spends in each category  will beprocessed to determine the activity  score on a scale 
of -100 (100% inactive) to +100 (100% active). A value of [ADDRESS_615147] spent 
12hoursof the day  active and an equal number of hours inactive.22
Renal Stone Evaluation 
Renal ultrasounds (at screening , Month 6, and Month 12/early withdrawal ; without sedation and 
after a 3-hour period during which only water, juice, or electroly te solution will be permitted, as 
clinically  indicated) will be performed under blinded conditions (after randomization) by a 
qualified radiologist or nephrologist at each site with age-appropriate inducers. The ultrasounds 
will be read/interpreted centrall y(local reading at the screening visit is acceptable to determine 
eligibility  for randomization ; both the local and central readers will be blinded to the study  
treatment group ). If possible, exam ination s should be done by [CONTACT_479274]. 
Subjects with definite renal stones, nephrocalcinosis, or hydronephrosis at screening will be 
excluded from the study . Other abnormalities will be followed in subsequent examinations, 
which may occur more frequentl y at the discretion of the investigator in collaboration with the

Cogstate administration method . All tests will be managed and scored centrally  by [CONTACT_479276]. The 
Battery  includes tests that assess information processing speed and fine motor skills ,attention, 
learning and memory , working memory , and executive functions. The tests were designed for 
multiple assessments over a short time period, with virtually  no practice effects in adults and 
children. The pediatric version of the card tests (Detection Test, Identification Test, One Card 
Learning Test, and One Back Test) use cards with age-appropriate designs (ie, colors, shapes, 
and numbers) rather than using cards from a French playingcard deck. However, the paradigms 
are the same.
The Detection Test is a measure of information processing speed and fine motor skills, and 
uses a well -validated simple reaction time paradigm with card stimuli. I n this test, the play ing 
cards are all red and black. The subject is asked to press the Yes key as soon as the card in 
the center of the screen flips over.
The Identification Test is a measure of visual attention and uses a well-validated choice 
reaction time paradigm with card stimuli. In this test, the playing cards are all either red or 
black. The subject is asked whether the card currentl y being presented in the center of the 
screen is red. The subject responds by [CONTACT_479277].
The One Card Learning Test is a measure of visual recognition memory and uses a well-
validated pattern separation paradigm using card stimuli. In this test, the cards are similar to 
those found in a deck of playing cards. The subject is asked whether the card currently  being 
presented in the center of the screen was seen previously  in this test. The subject responds by 
[CONTACT_21953]. Because no card has been presented yet, the first response is 
alway s No.
The One Back Test is a measure of working memor y and uses a well-validated n-back
paradigm using card stimuli. In this test, the cards are similar to those found in a deck of 
playing cards. The subject is asked whether the card currentl y being presented is the same as 
the one presented immediately  previously . The subject responds by [CONTACT_479278]. Because no card has been presented y et, the first response is alway s No.

Approved, Date: 3 November 2017The Groton Maze Learning Test is a measure of problem solving and reasoning and uses a 
well-validated maze learning paradig m. In this test, the subject is shown a grid of boxes on a 
computer screen. A pathway  is hidden among these possible locations. Each box represents 
move locations, and the grid refers to the box array (eg, 10 × 10). Subjects are required to 
find the hidden pathway  guided by [CONTACT_479279]. Feedback is given with visual and auditory 
cues (green check marks and red crosses) to indicate whether the selected box is correct or 
incorrect. There are a specific number of well-matched alternative pathway s available. The 
software records each move as an error or as a correct move. 
The Cogstate pediatric normative database consists of cognitive tests from over 55,[ADDRESS_615151] scales (One Card Learning Test, One Back
Test, Detection Test, Identification Test) in 10-to 18-year-old children, but there are data on the 
Groton Maze Learning Test in younger children. Furthermore, the Cogstate tests have been 
shown to have demonstrated utility  in pediatric clinical studies in oncology , and in the treatment 
of disorders such as attention -deficit/hy peractivity  disorder, HIV, neurodevelopmental disorders, 
and sickle cell disease.
The semantic item “Animal s”from the Word Generation subtest of the NEPSY -II (A 
Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment) will be included in this study .This test 
measures verbal productivity  through the ability  to generate words within specific categories and 
is a commonly  used and standardized measure of language and executiv e functioning in children 
and adolescents. This will be administered by  [CONTACT_479280] a 
study -specific rater training plan. The test will be scored by [CONTACT_479281] .
Developm ental As sessments in Subjects 2 to 5Yearsof Age
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale will be administered for subjects 2 to 5years of age, to 
assess developmental level and adaptive functioning . For very young children, the behaviors 
assessed are closel y correlated with developmental milestones.
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale , version IIfocuses on behaviors needed to operate inan
age-appropriate manner inthe individual’s environment. It is age-specific and provides an 
assessment of function in the domains of communication, daily  living, socialization, and motor 
skills, as well as a composite scale. The Vineland scores have a mean of [ADDRESS_615152] 
deviation of 15 ,based o n a normative population sample.6,36

The CBCL is a widel yused method of identify ing problem behavior in children.1,2It is a 
component in the ASEBA . It is a detailed, specific measure of competencies, adaptive 
functi oning, and behavioral/emotional problems in children ,split into competencies and 
problems. The CBCL  has been shown to have good reliability  and validity ,2and has been used in 
many  pediatric populations with different disorders, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y.5,13,[ADDRESS_615153] (CBCL/1½ -5) is intended for 
use with children 18 months to 5 y earsof age (seeAttachment 6for an example) .The school -age 
version (CBCL/6 -18) is for children 6 to 18 y ears of age (see Attachment 7for an example).
The checklists consist of a number of statement s about the child's behavior, eg,"Acts too young 
for his/her age. "Responses a re recorded on a Likert scale: 0= not true, 1=somewhat or sometimes 
true, 2=very  true or often true. The preschool checklist contains [ADDRESS_615154] contains 112 questions.
Similar questions are grouped into a number of syndromes, eg,Aggressive behavior, and their 
scores are summed to produce a score for that s yndrome. Some sy ndromes are further summed to 
provide scores for Internalizing (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, and Somatic 
Complaints) and Externalizing problem scales (Rule -Breaking Behavior and Aggressive 
Behavior). A total score from all questions is also derived. For each syndrome, problem scale ,
and the total score, tables are given that determine whether the score represents normal, 
borderline, or clinical beha vior. These categorizations are based on quantiles from a normative 
sample.
Suicidality
The C-SSRS is a low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and will be 
administered at every  visit, to assess suicidal ideation , intent, and behavior.31The scale will be 
administered by [CONTACT_3462] (either non-expert, eg, study  coordinator, or clinical expert, eg, 
MD or PhD psychologist) , asking questions of the subjects (preferable, if cooperative) or 
parents/caregivers for subjects who are not cooperative . If possible, the same individual should 
evaluate the subject at all visits. The assessment will be administered for subjects 6 to 15 y ears of 
age and will not be administered for subjects 2 to 5 years of age.Examples of the scales are 
provided in Attachment 8(Baseline) and Attachment 9(Since Last Visit).

11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analy ze the study  data is outlined below. 
Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan.
11.1. Subject Information
All subjects who are randomized will be included in the anal ysis population. 
11.2. Sample Siz e Determination
A total of 282randomized subjects, 141 in each treatment group, will be recruited to the study . 
The sample size takes into account a 1-year dropout rate of 29%, which is a conservative 
estimate based on the dropout rates observed in a previous monotherapy  study in the 6-to 
15-year-oldage group ,Study TOPMAT -EPMN -106, including a dropout rate of 22% in the 
study  overall (both double -blind and open -label phases) and a dropout rate of 35% for the 
double -blind phase .The sample size was estimated in order to achieve a sufficient precision for 
the estimates of the treatment effect on the key endpoints. The precision of the confidence 
interval (CI) estimates for the key  safet y parameters are shown below:
Annual change in BMD (L1-L4) Z-score: In the Bone Mineral Density  in Childhood Study  
(BMDCS), mean annual change in BMD (L1-L4) Z-score in 6-to 15-year-old health y 
subjects was, as expected, minimal (0.01 -0.07).35The standard deviation (SD) varied from 
0.3 to 0.48 across sex and age groups.35Assuming an S D of 0.4, with 100completed subjects 
per group, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will have a precision of 0.12.
Annual change in height Z-score in the 2-to 9-year-old age group: In the monotherap y 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_479220] -EPMN -106, the observed chang efrom baseline in mean height 
Z-score at 1 year among the 2-to 9-year-old subjects treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400 mg/day 
was -0.18, with an SD of 0.28.40Assuming that 53% of the subjects will be recruited in the 
2-to 9-year-old age group, ie, 53completed subjects per treatment group, the 95% CI for the 
treatment difference will have a precision of 0.11.
Incidence of kidney stone formation: In the studies TOPMAT -PEP-3001 and 
TOPMAT -PEP-1002 in infants (1 month to 2 years of age), a 7% incidence of kidney  stones 
was observed during the 1-year topi[INVESTIGATOR_479135].11,38A sample size of 
100completed subjects per treatment group will provide a 95% CI (Wilson score CI) for the

Approved, Date: 3 November 2017treatment difference with a width of 0.12, assuming that the incidence of kidney  stone 
formation is 7% and near zero in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_479221], 
respectivel y.
Change in weight Z-score in the 2-to 15-year-old age group :In the monotherapy  epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y 
study  TOPMAT -EPMN -106, a -0.59 decrease from baseline in weight Z-score, with an SD 
of 0.43, was observed after 1 y ear of treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400 mg/day. Assuming an SD 
of 0.43, a sample size of 100completed subjects per treatment group will provide a 95% CI 
with a precision of 0.12.
11.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Data will be listed for all subjects with available plasma concentrations per treatment group . 
All concentrations below the l owest quantifia ble concentration or m issing data will be labeled as 
such in the concentration data presentation . Concentrations below the lowest quantifiable 
concentration will be treated as zero in the summary  statistics. All subjects and samples excluded 
from the anal ysis will be clearl y documented in the study  report.
For each treatment group, descriptive statistics, including arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of 
variation, geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum will be calculated for the
topi[INVESTIGATOR_479222] .
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_479223] p lasma concentrations will be provided as listings .
11.4. Safety  Analyses
The key  safet y endpoints will include:
Percent ageof subjects with kidney  stones 
Change from baseline in weight Z -score over time
The following height analy ses will be conducted for prepubertal subjects (2 to 9 years of 
age), subjects 10 to 15 years of age , and subjects 2 to 15 years of age :

Change from baseline in biochemical markers of bone mineralization including: serum levels 
of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, parathy roid hormone (intact), 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D, 1,25 -dihyroxy vitamin D, and IGF -1
Change from baseline in serum and urine laboratory  tests, eg, bicarbonate, ammonia, renal 
function tests, and LFTs
Change from baseline in bone age
Z-scores for the DEXA scans will be calculated locally  at baseline and at M12 to determine 
eligibility  for the study and the Post-Study  Follow -Up phase, and centrally  for all statistical 
analyses. The Z -score calculation will take the DEXA machine and the subject’s age, sex, height, 
and ethnicit y into consideration . The reference databases for calculating the Z-scores are 
provided in the DEXA Manual for this study .
Longitudinal endpoints will be analy zed using a mixed -model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis. The MMRM model will include treatment group, age group, visit, treatment -by-visit 
interaction, baseline measure, and baseline -by-visit interaction. An unstructured covariance will 
be used. Other appropriate covariance structures will be explored as needed. Confidence 
intervals with 95% confidence for the estimate d treatment differences will be provided at each 
time point as appropriate. For proportion endpoints, 95% confidence intervals will be provided 
for the treatment difference. Each of the endpoints will also be summarized by  [CONTACT_551].
Seizure counts , cognitive, developmental level ,and behavioral assessments will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_267978] .The incidence of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors as 
determined b y the C -SSRS will be summarized by  [CONTACT_267978].
For the cognitive assessments, standardized change from baseline scores will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_479282], 
relative to the expected within -subject standard deviations for each Cogstate task. For the tasks 
for which lower scores indicate improvement (eg, Detection Test and Identification Test), the 
score will bemultiplied by (-1), so that negative standardiz ed scores represent a decline in 
cognitive performance consistently  across all ta sks.

of a meaningful decline will be identified using a binary  flag, where 1 repres ents a meaningful 
decline from b aseline and 0 otherwise. 
Group -based summary  data (frequency  distribution of the binary  flags) will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_479283].
In addition to the above endpoints, other safety -related endpoints may be included in the 
analyses and summarized if deemed necess ary.
Adverse Events
The verbatim terms used in the CRF by [CONTACT_23820] (MedDRA). All reported adverse events 
with onset during the treatment phase (ie, treatment -emergent adverse events , and adverse events 
that have worsened since baseline ) will be included in the analysis. For each adverse event, the 
percentage of subjects who experience at least 1occurrence of the given event will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_22975] b y age group.
Summaries , listings, datasets, or subject narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those 
subjects who die, who discontinue treatment due to an adverse event, or who experience a severe 
or a serious adverse event.
Adverse events of clinical interest for topir amate are: effects on liver function; metabolic 
acidosis; effects on growth and maturation ;vision abnormalities ;oligohidrosis with 
hyperthermia and rash; hyperammonemia and encephalopath y;kidney  stones ;cogniti ve

Descriptive statistics of changes from baseline will be summarized at each scheduled time point.
11.5. Data Monitoring Committee
Anextern al, independent DMC will be established to review safet y data on at least a semiannual 
basis (or more frequentl y,if necessary ) and ensure the continuing safet y of the subjects enrolled 
in this study .After the review, the DMC will make recommendations regarding the continuation 
of the study . The details will be provided in a separate DMC charter.
The DMC will include experts from pediatric subspecialties and one statistician. The DMC 
responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in its c harter.
12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicin al (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not

77
Approved, Date: 3 November 2017related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in ons et or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the informed 
consent /assent form (refer to Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_615160] adverse event 
recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based onICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dosage :
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or signi ficant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations , such asimportant medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738].
These should usually  be considered se rious.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
Anadverse event is considered unlisted ifthe nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information. For topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] , the expectedness of an adverse 
event will be determined by [CONTACT_83408]'s Brochure.33For 
levetiracetam , the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_479284].[ADDRESS_615161] ion12.1.2 .

Approved, Date: 3 November 201712.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explana tion, eg,
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg, confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely , eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship 
in time is very  suggestive (eg, it is confirmed b y dechallenge and rechallenge).
12.1.3. Severity Criteria
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated ,causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity .
Severe :Extreme distress ,causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal every day activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit yof events not directly  
experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory  abnormalities).
12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety  events of interest on a sponsor medicinal product that may require expedited reporting 
and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:

Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor medicinal product
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the 
sponsor medicinal product, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the CRF.
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
All adverse events and special reporting situations , whether serious or non-serious, will be 
reported from the time a signed and dated informed consent form is obtained until completion of 
thesubject's last study -related procedure (which may include contact [CONTACT_20687] -up of safety).
Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously  reported to the investigator within [ADDRESS_615162] be recorded using medical terminology  in the source document and the CRF. Whenever 
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology 
(eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739] "). Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_23740] . All measures required for adverse event 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.
The sponsor assumes respo nsibility  for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory  
authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational 
institute where required) all serious adverse events that are unlisted (unexpected) and associated 
with the use of the study  drug. The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report these 
events to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) 
that approved the protocol unless otherwise required an d documented by  [CONTACT_6179]/I RB. 
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, subjects or 
parents/caregivers must be provided with a "wallet (study )card"and instructed to carry this card

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_615168] on growth, bone mineralizat ion, and kidney  stone formation. The study  
is designed to assess these issues in comparison with levetiracetam monotherapy .The study  is 
designed as a randomized, active -controlled, open -label study ; however, to eliminate bias, after 
randomization the key safet y outcomes (DEXA scan, renal ultrasound, and height) will be 
obtained in a blinded fashion.
Ethical concerns include the enrollment of pediatric subjects and the requirement for them to 
taper off their current AED. Performing this study  in children isjustified because it remains 
unclear how long term AED may impact normal bone mineralization and development. Overall, 
an extensive clinical database that included children from age [ADDRESS_615169]’s cu rrent AED treatment.
Levetiracetam is an appropriate comparator because it has demonstrated efficacy  and safety  in a 
number of investigator -initiated studies when used as monotherap y in dosage s similar to those 
used in the current study . It also has relati vely low toxicity , and specifically  a lack of significant 
concerns for risks for kidney  stones or possible deleterious effects on bone or growth. Other 
AEDs that might be considered as a comparator beside levetiracetam include carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
lamotrigine, or valproic acid. However, there are possible concerns with all of these AEDs. 
There are many publications in the literature that suggest carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_479233] , 
increase serum alkaline phosphatase and decrease serum calcium and phosphorus, which might 
suggest problems with bone development. Lamotrigine has potentially  serious toxicity  especially 
serious rash (eg, Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_23936]) and there are various 
publications that suggest that valproic acid may also have deleterious effects on decreasing 
BMD .
A 1-year study  duration is justified based on the following:
The American Academy  Pediatrics Clinical Report Bone Densitometry  in children and 
adolescents states that the recommended interval between repeat DEXA scans depend son 
progression of bone disorder, with a minimal interval between scans of6months, but often 
1year or more may be appropriate to allow measurable change to occur.3The Position 
RWJ -[ZIP_CODE] -000(topi[INVESTIGATOR_052])
Clinical Protocol TOPMATEPY4067 Amendment INT -6
86
Approved, Date: 3 November 2017statement on DEXA scans in children and adolescents from ISCD statesthat in pediatric 
patients, repeat scans should generall y be obtained within 1 to 2 years for clinical purposes 
and in some settings, such as a patient in a research study  and/or receiving a therapeutic 
skeletal agent, every  6 months.18The shorter 6-month interval may reveal trends in skeletal 
losses and gains, reflecting variations in bone turnover from either a chronic disease or 
intervention, but ones not yet clinically  significant. The ISCD suggests aminimum 
monitoring time interval of 6months for repeating B MD measurement .4
Abnormaliti es in height have been detected during [ADDRESS_615170]-baseline height or BMI data and also included an open-label extension phase.9During 
thecombined double -blind and open -label extension, there was a small percentage of 
children who met height criteria for growth delay .
Renal stones as documented by [CONTACT_479286] a 1-year 
treatment duration with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] . Results from the open -label extension study  performed in 
284 infants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  1 to 24 months of age treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_479234] 1 yearshowed 
that 18 of 284 subjects (6.3%) had nephrolithiasis detected by [CONTACT_479287]  4 to 
5months into the study .11
Additional ethical concerns relate to consent/assent and ensuring that ethical principles related to 
pediatric subjects as vulnerable subjects arein effect, primarily  to ensure that total allowable 
blood volumes are not exceeded during study  conduct.
Potential subjects and their guardian swill be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the 
study  and, during the study ,they will be given any new information that may affect their decision 
to continue participation. They  will be told that their consent /assent to participate in the study  is 
voluntary  and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty  or loss of 
benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Enrollment will only be allowed if 
parents/legall y accept able representatives orsubjects are fully able to understand the risks, 
benefits, and potential adverse events of the study , and provide their consent /assent voluntaril y. 
When referring to the signing of the informed consent form, the terms legal guardia n and legally 
acceptable representative refer to the legall y appointed guardian of the child with authority  to 
authorize participation in research. For each subject, his or her parent(s) (preferabl y both parents, 
if available) or a legall y acceptable repre sentative(s), as required by [CONTACT_427], must give 
written consent (permission) according to local requirements after the nature of the study  has 
been fully  explained and before the performance of any study -related assessments. Assent must 
be obtain ed from children (minors) capable of understanding the nature of the study , typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y

even if their parents still want them to participate.
The total blood volume to be collected during the study  is less than 3 mL/kg body  weight per 
8-week period (approximatel y 11.0mLor less at each visit), consistent with the guidelines for 
total allowable blood volumes drawn from pediatric subjects from multiple sources ,including NIH

withdrawal from the study , if applicable.
In addition, the author of an entry  in the source documents should be identifiable.
At a minimum, the type and level of detail of source data available for a study  subject should be 
consistent with that commonly  recorded at the site as a basis for standard medical care. Specific 
details required as source data for the study  will be reviewed with the investigator before the 
study  and will be described in the monitoring guidelines (or other equivalent document).
The following data will be recorded directly  in the source documents and then entered into the 
CRF : 
Race
Blood pressure and heart rate
Height –A blinded study  nurse or other staff will measure the height of the subject and 
record it in the source documents ,or provide it to the unblinded study  coordinator for entry 
into the source documents. The unblinded study  coordinator will then enter this data, along 
with other visit data, into the CRF .
Weight 
Details of ph ysical examination

17.5. Case Report Form Completion
Case report forms are provided for each subject in electronic format. 
Electronic data capture will be used for this study . The study  data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_479294] , and transmitted in a secure manner to the 
sponsor withi n the timeframe agreed upon between the sponsor and the site. The electronic file 
will be considered to be the CRF.
Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the CRF. Any 
such worksheets will become part of the subject 's source documentation. All data relating to the 
study  must be recorded in CRFs prepared by [CONTACT_456] . Data must be entered into CRFs in 
English. Designated site personnel must complete the CRF as soon as possible after a subject 
visit, and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that all subjective measure ments (eg, pain scale 
information or other questionnaires) to be recorded in the CRF are completed by [CONTACT_97527]. The investigator must verify  that all data 
entries in the CRF s are accurate and correct.
All CRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by [CONTACT_154984] -site personnel. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool.The investigator or 
an authorized member of the investigational staff must adjust the CRF (if applicable) and 
complete the query .
If correc tions to a CRF are needed after the initial entry  into the CRF, this can be done in 
3different way s:
Site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to 
an auto query  (generated by  [CONTACT_66832]) .
Site manager ca n generate a query  for resolution by  [CONTACT_479295] f.
Clinical data manager can generate a query  for resolution by  [CONTACT_479295] f.
17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
associated personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456], and direct 
transmission of DEXA, and clinical laboratory  data from a central laboratory  into the sponsor 's 
RWJ -[ZIP_CODE] -000(topi[INVESTIGATOR_052])
Clinical Protocol TOPMATEPY4067 Amendment INT -6
95
Approved, Date: 3 November 2017database. Written instructions will be provided for collection, preparation, and shipment of 
samples. 
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study personnel before the 
start of the study .The sponsor will review CRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-site 
monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with 
the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the clinical study
database they  will be verified for accuracy and consistency  with the data sources .
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s).
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investiga tor retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator must permit access to such reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  sitevisit log that will be kept at the site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the 
monitor will compare the data entered into the CRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source 
RWJ -[ZIP_CODE] -000(topi[INVESTIGATOR_052])
Clinical Protocol TOPMATEPY4067 Amendment INT -6
96
Approved, Date: 3 November 2017documents). The natur e and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all 
sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and 
investigational staff and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_350975]. If electr onic 
records are maintained at the investigational site, the method of verification must be discussed 
with the investigational staff. 
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the data record ed in the CRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings 
from this review of CRFs and source documents will be discussed with the investigational staff. 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last study  assessment forthe last subject 
participating in the study. The final data from the investigational site will be sent to the sponsor
(or designee) after completion of the final subject assessment at that site, in the time frame 
specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study  at any time
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Investigational sites will be closed upon 
study  completion. An investigational site is considered closed when all required documents and 
study  supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of an investigational site by [CONTACT_43218]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor 's procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_74169]
Discontinuation of further drug development

Materials and Labeling
The central laboratory will provide the investigational site with blood collection tubes, storage tubes, preprinted 
labels (or tubes labeled with preprinted labels), and related supplies for the collection and shipment of PKsamples. 
Labels should be attac hed to the storage tubes at least [ADDRESS_615188].
Detailed information regarding the collection and storage containers will be provided in the laboratory manual from 
the central laboratory.
Preparation of Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]
Collect 1mL of blood into the appropriate K 2-EDTA -containing collection tube (eg, Vacutainer) at each time 
point.
Record the exact date and time of sampling in the CRF or laboratory requisition form, as appropriate.
Gently invert the tubes [ADDRESS_615189] mixing, before processing.
Centrifuge blood samples at room temperature within 1 hour(s) of co llection at 1,300 g for 10 minutes, unless 
otherwise specified by [CONTACT_4497], to yield approximately 0.4 mL of plasma from each 1 mL whole blood 
sample.
Transfer all separated plasma immediately with a clean, disposable glass or polyethylene pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (use 1 new 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_479249]) to a pre -labeled storage tube (3.6 -mL NUNC Cryotube , Cat. No. 366524 or 379189).
Store plasma samples in an upright position in a freezer, at a set temperature of –20C until transfer to the central 
laboratory.
The time betw eenblood collection and freezing the plasma should not exceed 2 hours.
Ship specimens to the central laboratory according to the instructions provided.
Questions regarding handling the plasma PKspecimens should be addressed to the contact [CONTACT_479298].
Alternative procedures w ill not result in a protocol amendment if approved by [CONTACT_107335].

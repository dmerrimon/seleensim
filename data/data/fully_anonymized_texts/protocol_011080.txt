CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 2of 154VERSION HISTORY
Version 1.0, 25 June 2020
Initial creation
Version 2.0, 30 July 2020
The protocol was revised to address the FDA  recommendations received on 17 and 28 July 2020:
Section [IP_ADDRESS] was updated to reflect changes in the haematologic toxicity dose modifications 
management. 
 Table [ADDRESS_965970] the following: 
 A second instance of Grade 3 neutropenia with documented infection and/or fever should 
result in adavosertib discontinuation. 
However, it is proposed that in exceptional circumstances, the investigator/treating 
physician may consider continuing dosing at dose level -2 only when the benefits are 
considered to outweigh the risks and after approval by [CONTACT_1689] . 
 Table [ADDRESS_965971] the following: 
 Further dose reduction to dose level -[ADDRESS_965972] instance of Grade 2 thrombocytopenia. 
 Action for all events of Grade 2 thrombocytopenia should be taken when the sample was 
obtained at pre -dose assessment, rather than during the cycle. 
 Discontinuation of adavosertib on a third instance of Grade 3 thro mbocytopenia.
However, it is proposed that in exceptional circumstances, for example, when a patient is 
objectively benefiting from several cycles of treatment and the investigator/treating 
physician considers that the benefit to the patient of continuing on treatment outweighs the 
risks, that the dose be resumed at dose level -2 after approval by [CONTACT_1689] .
 Table 13 was revised to provide further guidance on dose interruption and dose reduction steps 
if the patient has a recurrent Hb <9 but ≥8 g/dL.
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] were updated to provide additional clarity on the management of 
non-haematologic toxicities, with detailed information on dose modifications for the management of 
gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities.
 New tables were added to provide clarity on the management of non -haematologic toxicities 
(Table 14), with detailed information on dose modifications for the management of diarrhoea 
(Table 16) and nausea and vomiting (Table 17).

The option of the third dose reduction has been removed and text revised in Sections 1.1, 6.6 
(including Table 9) and 8.3.13.
Sections 1.1, 4.1, and [IP_ADDRESS] were updated to clarify that m aturity of data will also be taken into 
account when selecting the date for primary analysis.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] was updated to clarify that a separate analysis will be performed using those 
confirmed responders that have been followed for a minimum o f 6 months after response and using 
all confirmed responders regardless of follow -up time.
Sections 4.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] were updated to clarify that all diagnostic tumor tissue samples should be 
submitted, not only if the diagnostic sample is different from the 
Section 4.[ADDRESS_965974] a change in tumor assessment frequency from “every 
6weeks for the first 24 weeks ” to every “[ADDRESS_965975] 48 weeks. ”

not applicable for this study .
Version 3.0, 20 April 2021
The protocol was revised to address the recommendations of the Safety Review Committee received 
on 9thApril 2021.
Recommendation 1: Additional safety haematology and clinical chemistry assessment along on -site 
visit on Day 15 (+/ -1 day window) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Safety haematology and cli nical 
chemistry assessment along on- site visit on Day 5 (+/ -1 day window) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, in

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 2b, Open -label, Single -arm, Mul ti-centre Study  assessing the Efficacy 
and Safety  of Adavosertib as Treatment for Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Serous Carcino ma 
(ADAGIO)
Short Title: Phase 2b Study  of Adavosertib as Treatment for Uterine Serous Carcinoma
Rationale: 
There i s an important unmet medical need for treatments in uterine serous carcino ma (USC), 
an aggressive variant of endo metrial carcino ma, with an increased likelihood of recurrence 
and limited treatment options; the overall [ADDRESS_965990] imated to be only 35 
to 50% for women wit h Stage I -II disease and 0 to 15% for women with Stage III -IV disease. 
Data from The Cancer Geno me At las (TCGA) have shown that USC exhibits several genet ic 
alterati ons that coul d make this variant more likely to respond to WEE1 kinase inhibit ion. 
Specifically , USC exhibit s high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 to 92% of cases) as well 
as high rates of mutation or amplification in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1 , 
FBXW7 , MYC , RB1, CCND1 , TAF1, and KRAS/NRAS .
This Phase 2b study  aims to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of adavosertib, an inhibitor of the 
tyrosine kinase WEE1, in participants with recurrent or persi stent U SC who have previously 
received at least 1 prior platinum based chemotherapy  regimen for the management of USC.
Objectives and Endpoints
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by [CONTACT_710422] (ORR). ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with 
measurable disease at baseline who have a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as 
determined by [CONTACT_168863] 
(BICR) per RECIST v1.1.
Secondary
 To ev aluate efficacy of adavosertib by 
[CONTACT_710423] 
(DoR). DoR is defined as the time from the date of first 
documented response until date of documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_19377], or 
death in the absence of disease p rogression.

by [CONTACT_710428] (OS). OS is defined as time fro m date of first dose until the 
date of death due to any cause.
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by [CONTACT_710429] 
(DCR). DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who 
have a best overall response of CR or PR or who have 
stable disease for at least 5 weeks after start of 
treatment (to allow for an early assessment within the 
assessment window).
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
adavosertib. Plasma concentration of adavosertib: C trough (pre-dose)
and C max.
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 
adavosertib in participants with USC. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of 
AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, 
and AEs leading to dose interruptions, dose reductions, 
and dose discontinuation s.
 Vital signs parameters include systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, and pulse as well as heart rate, body 
temperature, body weight, height, and BMI.
 Laborato ry parameters include clinical chemistry and 
haematology parameters as well as urinalysis.

in eligible participants with histologically confirmed recurrent or persistent USC (for the 
purposes of this study , this includes parti cipants with endometrial carcino ma of mixed 
histol ogy where the serous component comprises at least 10% of th e tumour [ McMeekin et al 
2007]), evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1, and who have received at l east1 
prior platinum based chemotherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC. Participants with 
carcinosarcomas are not eligible. There is no restriction on the number of prior lines of 
systemic therapy  a parti cipant m ay have previ ously  received, and the platinum based
chemotherapy may  have been given in the adjuva nt setting. 
Parti cipants are requi red to provi de a form alin-fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumour

Statistical methods
The All Pat ients Set will include all participants who have signed the informed consent form 
(ICF) (ie, screening failures plus participants dosed) and will be used to d escribe the patient 
disposi tion. The Full Analysis Set (F AS) and the Centrally Confirmed Analysis Set (CCAS) 
will both be used for all analyses of the efficacy endpoints, and the F AS will be used for the 
safet y endpo ints. The F AS will include all participa nts who received at least one (non -zero) 
dose of study  treatm ent. The CCAS includes all centrally confi rmed USC parti cipants who 
received at least one (non -zero) dose of study  treatment. The Pharmacokinet ics Analysis Set 
will include all dosed participants who had at least one measurable plasma concentration 
collected post -dose which was obtained without any deviat ion or event thought to 
significant ly affect the PK analysis.
The primary  endpoint of ORR (defined as the percentage of participants with a confi rmed 
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR], based on a subset of all treated participants 
with measurable disease at baseline per Blinded Independent Central Review [BICR]), and its 
90% and 95% confidence interval (CI) (Clopper- Pearson) will be summarized. .Summaries of 
ORR will be based on imaging BICR; ORR per investigator review will be a sensit ivity 
analysis. The primary analysis will be performed, in both the F AS and centrally confirmed 
USC popul ations, [ADDRESS_965995] 
progressed or died due to any  cause, whichever is earlier . Maturi ty of durati on of  response 
(DoR) data will also be taken into accoun t when select ing the data cut -off (DCO) date for 
primary  analysis No further analyses wil l be performed beyo nd the primary analysis.
An interim analysis is planned after approximately [ADDRESS_965996] ical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and will include a more 
technical and detailed description o f the stati stical analyses. A  Cont inuous Monitoring Plan 
(CMP) will also be produced to describe the ap proach, decisio n criteria, statist ical analyses 
and co mmunicat ion plan for conti nuous m onitoring in this study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 31of 1542 INTRODUCTION
Adavosertib (AZD1775) is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase WEE1. [COMPANY_008] is 
develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_710393] a range of therapeutic indicat ions, including recurrent or persistent 
advanced/metastatic uterine serous carcino ma (USC) and other advanced so lid tumours.
2.[ADDRESS_966009] 1 prior platinum based
chemotherapy regimen for the management of USC. The rationale for conducting the study  is 
supported by  [CONTACT_3162]:
Unmet medical need: USC is an aggressive variant of endom etrial  carcino ma, wi th an 
increased likelihood of recurrence and limited treatment options, with the overall 5 -year 
survival for USC estimated to be only 35- 50% for women wit h Stage I -II disease, and 
0-15% for women with Stage III- IV disease (Achary aet al 2005) 
Mechanism of act ion of adavosertib (see Sect ion2.2.3 )
: data from The Cancer Geno me 
Atlas (TCGA) have shown that USC exhibits several genet ic alterations that could make 
this variant more likely to respond to WEE1 kinase inhibit ion. Specifically , USC exhibi ts 
high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 -92% of cases) in co mbinat ion with high rates of 
mutati on or am plificat ion in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1, FBXW 7, MYC, 
RB1, CCND1, TAF1, and KRAS/NRAS (Cancer Geno me Atlas Research Network 2013 , 
Zhao etal2013) 
Clinical data fro m an ongo ing Phase 2 clinical study o f adavosertib in participants with 
recurrent or persistent USC: preliminary object ive response rate (ORR) of 29.4% 
(95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%; n=34) 
(Liuet al 2020) 
The background to the rationale is summarised below in Sect ions2.2and
 2.3.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32of 154prevalence in developed countries and the highest incidences have been observed in the US, 
Canada, and Northern and Western Europe ( Bray etal2018). From  2006 to 2015, the 
incidence rate increased by  [CONTACT_2902] 1% per y ear and fro m 2007 to 2016, the death rate increased 
by [CONTACT_2902] 2% per y ear 
(Amer ican Cancer Society2019 ).
USC i s one of the l ess comm on variants of endometri al cancer. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_710394] 10% of all endometrial cancer diagnoses, it accounts for up to 39% of 
endo metrial cancer -related deaths ( Hamilt onet al 2006). Unlike the more commo n 
endo metrioid variants of uterine cancer, the majority  of wom en wi th USC have a high ri sk of 
relapse, even in the absence of tradit ional “high -risk” features, suc h as myo metri al invasi on or 
lymphovascular invo lvement, and USC histology is considered to be high -risk and high -grade 
by [CONTACT_710430] (NCCN) guidelines ( NCCN 2019). 
The overall [ADDRESS_966012] imated to be only 35 -50% for women wit h Stage I -II 
disease, and 0 -15% for women with Stage III- IV disease ( Acharya et al 2005) . 
2.2.[ADDRESS_966013] of care for 
participants with recurrent, metastatic, or high risk endo metrial cancer is combinat ion 
chemotherapy wit h carboplat in and paclitaxel ( NCCN 2019). More recently, targeted 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_710395], but results thus far have been 
disappoint ing. One area of great interest has been targeting of HER2/neu, which has been 
reported to be highly expressed in between 17 and 50% of women wit h USC 
(Talwar and 
Cohen 2012), and case reports of trastuzumab activit y have been reported (Santin etal2008 ; 
Talwar and Cohen 2012). A case report describes the clinical response of a heavily pre -treated 
patient wi th a recurrent USC, overexpressing HER2/neu at 3+ level by [CONTACT_9064]  
(IHC), to anti -HER2/neu ant ibody-drug-conjugate trastuzum ab-emtansine (TDM -1) wi th 
complete resol ution of a large metastatic, radiat ion/chemotherapy resistant tumour 
(Santin et 
al 2017 ). However, a Gynecologic Onco logy Group study  of single -agent trastuzumab in 
33wom en wi th HER2 -positive endo metrial cancer (of whom  11 had USC) di d not 
demonstrate si gnificant acti vity, wi th no wom en achieving a tumour response 
(Fleming et al 2010). A recent study  (Fader et al 2018 ) com pared carbopl atin-paclitaxel wit h 
and wit hout trastuzumab in participants with primary  advanced or recurrent HER2/neu-
positive USC ( defined by  [CONTACT_710431] 3+ or 2+ with gene amplification confirmed by  
[CONTACT_95732],and with a serous component of ≥10%) reported increased 
progression -free survival (PFS) for participants treated wi th the combinat ion compared to 
those on the carboplat in-pacli taxel  control  arm; medi an PFS was 8.0 m onths (carboplat in-
paclitaxel) versus 12.6 months (carboplat in-pacli taxel -trastuzum ab; p=0.005; hazard ratio:
0.44; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.76). Further invest igation of these result s is 
needed to determine the impact on overall survival (OS) in this patient populat ion.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33of 154Inhibit ion of programmed cell death -1 receptor (PD -1) signalling by  [CONTACT_710432] (pembro lizumab) or co- inhibit ion of angiogenesis (via vascular endothelial growth 
factor -mediated suppressio n; lenvatinib) and PD -1 signalling is emerging as an efficacious 
anti-tumour strategy  for the treatment of endo metrial cancer ( Makker et al 2019 ). 
KEYNOTE -146/Study  111 assessed l envat inib/pembrolizumab co mbinat ion in participants
with advanced endom etrial carcino ma. In the 94 participants with tumours that were not 
microsatellite instabilit y high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), the combinat ion 
demonstrated an ORR of 38.3% (95% CI: 29%, 49%), with a complete response (CR) rate of 
10.6% (n=10) and a partial response (PR) rate of 27.7% (n=26) 
(FDA 2019, Makker et al 
2019). In the US, the FDA has recently approved pem brolizumab for the subset of women 
with MSI -H, m etastati c disease, and the combinat ion of pembro lizumab/lenvatinib for the 
treatm ent of participants with advanced endom etrial  carcino ma that i s not MSI -H or dMMR, 
who have disease progression fo llowing pri orsystemic therapy and are not candidates for 
curative surgery  or radi ation 
(FDA 2019).
Deficient mismatch repair has been reported in 33.5% (n=65/194) of endo metrioid tumours 
and 1.6% (n=1/61) of serous tumours 
(Aghajanian et al 2018 ), and MSI -H in 40% of 
endo metrioid tum ours and 2% of serous tumours ( Cancer Geno me Atlas Research 
Network 2013). While USC participants are thus predominant ly microsatellite stable (not 
MSI-H), several ongo ing studies are exploring the addit ion of a PD -1/programmed death -
ligand 1 (PD -L1) inhibitor to standard of care combinat ion chemotherapy  in the first -line 
advanced disease setting (clintrials.gov), and new treatments potentially beyo nd the use of 
PD-1/PD -L1 are urgently needed. Durvalumab wit h or wi thout ol aparib, as mai ntenance 
therapy  after first -line treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer (DUO -E; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), is current ly being invest igated. Therefore, USC still represents an area of 
unmet medical need. 
2.2.3 Adavosertib
Adavosertib is an inhibitor of WEE1, a protein ty rosine kinase. WEE1 phosphorylates and 
inhibits cyclin -dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK1 and CDK2) and is invo lved in regulat ion of 
the intra -S and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. Proper funct ioning of these checkpo ints is essent ia
l 
for DNA metabo lism and the DNA damage response ( Coleman and Dunphy 1994, Parker and 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99206] -Worms1992).
Activity of CDK1 (also called cell divisio n cycle 2 protein, or CDC2) drives a cell fro m the 
G2 phase o f the cell cycle into mitosis. In response to DNA damage, WEE1 inhibits CDK1 to 
prevent the cell fro m dividing unt il the damaged DNA is repaired (G2 checkpoint arrest).  
CDK2 activit y drives a cell into, and through, S -phase of the cell cycle in which the geno me is 
duplicated in preparation for cell divisio n.  Inhibit ion of WEE1 is expected to cause aberrant ly 
high CDK2 act ivity in S-phase cells t hat, in turn leads to unstable DNA replicat ion structures 
and ult imately DNA damage.
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 [COMPANY_008]
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 34of 154Inhibit ion of WEE1 is expected to release a tumour cell fro m DNA damage induced arrest at 
the G2/M boundary , so that unrepai red DNA damage m ay be taken into mitosi s (M-phase).  
Since cancer cells exhibit higher levels o f endogenous damage than normal cells, as well as 
exhibit ing loss of 1 or m ore DNA damage response capabilit ies, this is expected to 
preferentially enhance cancer cell death through mitotic catastrophe compar ed to norm al cells.  
In the nonclinical setting, adavosertib has demo nstrated significant single -agent ant i-tumour 
activit y in cancer cell models associated with high levels o f endogenous replication stress 
resul ting fro m a combinat ion of G1/S checkpo int deficiencies due to p53 m utations or 
CDKN2A deletions and the over -expressio n of oncogenic drivers such as MYC, mutant 
KRAS or the amplificat ion of Cyclin E. 
As USC exhibits high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 -92% of cases) in co mbinat ion with 
high rates of mutation or am plificati on in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1 , 
FBXW7 , MYC , RB1, CCND1 , TAF1 and KRAS/NRAS (Cancer Geno me Atlas Research 
Network 2013, Zhao et al 2013 ), this tum our ty pe is expected to have high levels of 
replicat ion stress and endogenous DNA damage, and is therefore expected to be sensit ive to 
WEE1 kinase inhibit ion.

the blood. Other identified risks include s epsis and febrile neutropenia . 
Sepsis has recently been categorised as an ident ified risk wit h adavosertib therapy . 
Adavosertib has a well characterised safet y profile, and the toxicit y is considered manageable 
with effective toxicit y management, including dose delays, dose reductions, intermittent 
dosing and/or the use of supportive care approach in the participants with poor tol erance.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35of 1542.3.2 Benefit Assess ment
Liu et al  (Liuetal2020 ) recent ly assessed the activit y of adavosertib as monotherapy  in 
recurrent U SC (n=34, evaluable) in an ongoing Phase 2 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A preliminary 
ORR of 29.4% (95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%), including 9 partial responses (8 confirmed and 
1unconfirmed) and 1 complete response, was observed. The median PFS time was reported to 
be 6.14 m onths (95% CI: 4.21 months, 9.92 months), and the proportion of participants
progression -free at 6 months (PFS6) was 59.6% (95% CI: 40.6%, 74.3%). The m edian 
durati on of  response (DoR) was 9.03 months (95% CI: 5.29 months, NA).
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Treatment options for USC are limit ed (see Section 2.2.2 ), with poor 5 -year estimated OS 
(35-50%, Stage I -II disease; 0 -15% Stage III -IV disease;
 Achary aetal2005). Overall, based 
on the available clinical efficacy and safet y data and the limited long
-term efficacy  provided 
by [CONTACT_710433] f or USC, the benefi t/risk assessment supports the 
proposed invest igation of the therapeutic efficacy of adavosertib in participants with USC in 
second line plus setting.

4.1 Overall Design
This Phase 2b, single -arm, mul ti-centre study  will assess the efficacy and safet y of adavosertib 
in eligible participants with histol ogically confirmed recurrent or persistent USC (for the 
purposes of this study , this includes parti cipants with endometrial carcino ma of mixed 
histol ogy where the serous component comprises at least 10% of the tumour [ McMeekin et al 
2007]), evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1, and who have received at least 1 
pri
or platinum based chem otherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC. Participants with 
carcin osarcomas are not eligible.
Parti cipants are requi red to provi de a form alin-fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumour 
sample , collected as part of routine clinical pract ice, for central testing and central 
confirmat ion of USC diagnosis. This should preferably be an FFPE tissue block, or if not 
possible, freshly -cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collect ed tumour 
tissue that should be a sufficient quantit y to allow for the central confirmation o f USC and 
 (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). For the US C central confirmat ion, haematoxylin and 
eosin (HE) -stained slide(s) of the sample used by [CONTACT_710437] y shoul d also be 
submitted. Further details on tissue specificat ions are outlined in the Pathology  Manual ,

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Adavosertib is under investigat ion by [CONTACT_285988] a range of therapeut ic indicat ions 
including recurrent or persi stent advanced USC and other advanced so lid tumours. Given its 
mechanism o f action (see Sect ion2.2.3 ) and benefit/risk assessment (see Section 2.3), there is 
strong rationale for the evaluation o f adavosert ib in participants with USC in the second- line 
and bey ond treatm ent setting where standard of care treatment options ar e limi ted.
The single -arm, open -label study  design is a standard design for a Phase [ADDRESS_966021] ive of the study  is to assess efficacy (ORR, as determined by [CONTACT_710440] [BICR]) of adavosertib.
The eligibi lity criteria have been desi gned to recruit a patient population that is representative 
of those wi th recurrent or persi stent USC, and who have received at least 1 prior platinum 
based chem otherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC (the platinum based chem otherapy  
may have been received in the adjuvant setting). 
4.3 Justification for Dose
The study  was init iated wi th a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of adavosertib  300 mg QD 
for 5 days fo llowed by  2 days off in Weeks 1 and 2 out of a 21- day schedule .This dos e and 
schedule were established based on the safety , PK and clinical activit y observed in PN011 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), REFMAL 398 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and a Phase 2 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Clinica l Study Protocol –6.0 [COMPANY_008]
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42of 154PN011 and REFMAL 398 were Phase 1 studies designed to determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD)/RP2D for adavosertib mo notherapy  using different dose levels and schedules as 
well as QD and twice daily  (BID) dosing ( Takebe etal2018, Falchook etal2019). Steady -
state pl asma concentration at the 300 mg dose was above that required to pr ovide the 
necessary  IC 50for phosphorylated CDK1 activit y that had been determined preclinically as 
well as being within the preclinically
-defined targeted cell kill range (500 to 1000 nM) for 
approximately  16hours post -dose, supporting adequate target co verage.
The preclinical dose -PK-PD-efficacy modelling , based on two independent animal cancer 
models and the m athemat icalmodelling l ooking at the bio logically  effective dose for 
adavosertib mo notherapy  activit y,has confirmed thekey factors for dose dec ision inthe order 
of importance are asfollows: dose, foll owed by [CONTACT_710441], 
followed by [CONTACT_710442]. The latter two are important because both in 
preclinical animal models, and in the early clinical experience, thedose of adavosertib 
requi red to provi de efficacy  coul d not be sustained as a con tinuous treatment schedule and 
therefore an intermittent sch edule was needed for RP2D.  Mult iple intermittent schedules were 
assessed in preclinical animal models including 5days on/2days off, 7days on/7days off, 5days 
on/9days off or 3days on/4days off.
These preclinical data ident ified that:
1The pharmacokinet ics of adavosertib on single or repeat dose in the mouse could be 
accurately modelled.
2Preclinical doses of between 60 mg /kgQD and 90 mg/kg QD were effect ive in inducing 
tumour regressi on across m ultiple m odels.
3Time and dose dependence of pCDK1 and RRM2 expr ession (a surrogate of CDK2 
activat ion) could be modelled with a single IC 50value of 0.[ADDRESS_966022] dose (90 mg/kg) 
while a schedule of 5 days on 2 day s off represented the optimal intermittent schedule in 
terms of efficacy  and preclinical  safety  studies.
6The preclinical efficacious doses of adavosertib of between 60 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg are 
equivalent to the free drug exposures obtained by [CONTACT_710443] [ADDRESS_966023] ively.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 43of 154Clinical act ivity of adavosertib as monotherapy  was evaluated at RP2D in recurrent USC 
(n=34, evaluable) in an ongoing Pha se 2 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ( Liuet al 2020 ). A 
preliminary ORR of 29.4% (95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%), including 9 partial responses 
(8confirmed and 1 unconfirmed) and 1 complet e response, was observed. The median PFS 
time was reported to be 6.14 months (95% CI: 4.21 months, 9.92 months), and the PFS6 was 
59.6% (95% CI: 40.6%, 74.3%). The median DoR was 9.03 months (95% CI: 5.29 months, 
NA). The most frequently observed AEs inclu ded di arrhoea (85%), anaemia (65%), fat igue 
(65%), and nausea (62%).
As of [ADDRESS_966024] to change. Overall, 96 (95.0%) participants have experienced TEAEs. The most 
commo n (≥ 30%) TEAEs were diarrhoea (63 [62.4%] participants ), nausea (60 [59.4%] 
participants ), anaemia (49 [48.5%] participants ), fatigue (39 [38.6%] participants ), 
thrombocytopenia (37 [36.6%], constipat ion (37 [36.6%] participants ), neutropeni a (36 
[35.6%] participants ) and asthenia (36 [35.6%] participants ). Overall, 40 (39.6%) participants
have experienced SAEs; those experienced by > 1 (1.0%) patient were neutrophil 
count

[3.0%] participants each); and vo miting, fat igue, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, syncope, pleural 
effusio n, embo lism, hypotension, and acute kidney injury (2 [2.0%] participants each). Forty
participants (39.6%) had an adverse event leading to dose reduction. 
At the time of this DCO ,five cases of sepsis in the ADAGIO study  were reported; three 
events recovered, and two events were fatal. Four of these five sepsis cases (including the two 
fatal cases) were associated with Grade [ADDRESS_966025] two 
cycles of treatm ent and these four cases had either a baseline or on -study  decrease in 
creatinine clearance to <50 ml/min. Both fatal ities (Grade 5 biliary sepsis [not related to 
adavosertib per invest igator]; Grade 5 urosepsis [related to adavosertib per invest igator]) 
occurred in pat ients who had a pre -existing infect ion (biliary) or a specific predilection for 
infect ious com plicat ions (vesico -vaginal fistula).
To understand the relat ionship of adavosert ib exposure and severe haematological events in 
monotherapy  treatm ent, a pool ed exposure
-safet y analysis was perform ed and showed that 
there is a strong correlat ion between adavosertib plasma exposure, and the predicted 
probabilit y of Grade ≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The predicted probabilit y of 
neutropeni a and thrombocy topeni a increases as adavosertib plasma exposure increases. The 
model predicted probability of developi[INVESTIGATOR_710396] (Grade ≥ 3) at m edian and 95th 
percent ile of AUCss after 300 mg QD dosing is 12.9% and 45.0 %, respectively, while at 250 
mg QD dosing it is 10.6 % and 20.4 %, respectively. This indicates approximately 18% and 
55% reduction of predicted probabili ty of neutropenia at 50thand 95th percent ile of exposure, 
respectively , when the dose i s reduced to 250 mg QD from 300 mg QD, irrespective of

QD, the risk of seve re neutropenia and haematological toxicit ies will be reduced.  Clinical 
benefit is expected to be maintained at the reduced dose of 250 mg. 
A starting dose of adavosertib at 250 mg QD (5 days on, 2 day s off in Weeks 1 and 2 out of a 
21-day schedule) is re commended for adavosertib mo notherapy  clinical  devel opment.  Thi s

reason, in future studi eswith adavosertib m onotherapy  a starting dose of 250 m gQD will be 
used (for further details refer to Investigator’s Brochure ) . In the ADAGIO study  no further

aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], as exposur e to adavosertib increased by ~60% 
when aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_173322] -administered with adavosertib. The 
observed increase in adavosertib exposure is likely the 
result of CYP3A4 inhibition by [CONTACT_173369][INVESTIGATOR_053]. This increase in 
exposure is statistically significant. At the s elected MTDs, 
this increase may also be of clinical importance.  
Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed 
throughout the study.  These herbal medications 
include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wort, 
kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), yohimbe, saw 
palmetto, and ginseng.  Participants should stop using these herbal medications [ADDRESS_966053] dose of adavosertib.
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.See Appendix D
Grapefruit, Seville oranges and their products 
(eg,juice, marmalade, etc.)As grapefruit and Seville oranges are moderate inhibitors 
of CYP3A4, these fruits or their products should be 
avoided while taking adavosertib.  
Receipt of live virus and live bacterial vaccines is 
not permitted while the participant is receiving

Table8 Restricted Concomitant Medications
Restricted Medication/Class of Drug Usage
Inhibitors or substrates of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) In vitro studies have shown that adavosertib may be a 
substrate and inhibitor for human P-gp. Caution should be 
exercised when agents that are inhibitors or substrates of 
P-gp are administered concomitantly with adavosertib (see 
Appendix D).
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 [COMPANY_008]
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56of 154Restricted Medication/Class of Drug Usage
Substrates of Multidrug and Toxin Extruder 1 
(MATE1) and MATE2K transporters 
(eg,cimetidine, acyclovir, fexofenadine) Caution should be used when administering substrates of 
MATE1 and MATE2K transporters (eg, cimetidine, 
acyclovir, fexofenadine) as the clinical relevance of 
adavosertib inhibition of the MATE pathway is not known 
in these compounds.
Metformin Metformin should be used with caution. Adavosertib has 
been shown to be an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2K 
transporters. A drug interaction with substrates of either 
transporter cannot be ruled out, the most important 
substrate known to date being metformin.
BCRP substrates with narrow therapeutic index Recent in vitro transporter studies have shown adavosertib 
to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC 505.1 µM). This finding is 
particularly relevant for drugs administered orally where 
exposure is normally limited by [CONTACT_69811] -mediated efflux, in 
particular some statins, such as rosuvastatin. Other drugs 
where the disposition is mediated via BCRP should be 
administered with caution, dose modification considered or 
substituted by [CONTACT_173370].

waivers or exempt ions are not allowed.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant shoul d continue or discontinue 
study  interventi on.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essent ial and required for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria. The invest igator will maint ain a screening log to 
record details o f all participants screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the t ime frame defi ned in the SoA.
The am ount of  blood collected from  each participant over the duration of the study , 
including any  extra assessments that may be required, will be approximately  450 mL.

particularly wit h response on non -target lesio ns or the appearance of new lesio ns, it is 
advisable to continue treatment until the next sch eduled assessment (or sooner assessment, if 
clinically indicated) and reassess the participant ’s status. If repeat scans confirm progression, 
then the date of the init ial scan should be declared as the date of progression.
The same imaging modalit y and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT 
scans of the chest and MRI scans of the pelvis) should be performed at baseline and at all 
follow-up time -points if possible. Guidelines on the valid methods of assessment and the 
evaluat ion of object ive tumour response using RECIST v1.1 are provided in Appendix A.
Efficacy assessments of confirmed ORR, DoR, percentage change from baseline in tumour 
size, PFS, and DCR will also be derived (by [CONTACT_38227]) using RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_966064] Research Organisat ion (CRO) to enable 
BICR up to the primary analysis DCO (when the last participant has their last scheduled visit, 
or 6months after last participant first dose, whichever is earlier). After the primary analysis 
DCO, images will no longer need to be collected centrally . Ongoing collect ion of 
site-reviewed tum our assessment is required and must be recorded in the eCRF . Radi ological

8.2.1 Physical Exa minations
The physical examinat ion will  be perform ed at timelines as specified in the SoA  (Secti on1.3). 
A complete physical examinat ion will be performed and will include an assessment of the 
following: general appearance, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardi ovascular, abdo men, skin, head and neck 
(including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thy roid, musculo -skeletal  (including

8.2.3 Electroc ardiograms
ECG will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA  (Secti on1.3). A 12-lead safet y 
ECG (paper ECG printout of 10 seconds for investigator review) will be taken at screening, 
and if a prolongat ion of the QT c interval is detected this must be closely mo nitored as 
clinically indicated, and to the best of clinical practice. 
The parti cipants will rest for at least [ADDRESS_966067] be in the same supi[INVESTIGATOR_710402] (m aximum  30degrees flexio n in the hip and feet not 
in contact [CONTACT_309351] f ootboard) at the recording t ime point.
If one ECG demonstrates a QT cF > 480 m sec, then a m ean QT cF of ≤[ADDRESS_966068] igator will judge the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnor mal, it 
will be decided as to whether or not the abnormalit y is clinically significant or n ot clinically  
significant. The paper copy  of each ECG reading will be retained with the participant’ s 
completed source docum ents. Any clinically significant abnormal ities detected require 
triplicate ECG results. At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, [ADDRESS_966069] ion and reporting processes (see 
Secti on8.3). 
Attention shoul d be paid to any  detected i ncreases in QT c interval. Participants who develop a 
single rest ing value of QT c interval o f >480 m sec or a shift from baseline o f ≥ 60 ms, should 
pause taking adavosertib. Dosing may be resumed at the same or reduced dose after retur n of 
the resting QTc interval to Grade 1 or baseline has been confirmed and correction of possible 
electroly te imbalance has been made, if needed, following cardiologists ’s advice. For m ore 
details, see Sect ion8.3.13.2 and Table15.
Moni toring of QT c, checking and correction of abnormal electrolyte levels and renal function 
are advised, especially in case of severe/pro longed diarrhoea. If QT c increases markedly fro m 
baseline but stays below the above limit of Grade 1 (per CTCAE v5.0), a cardiologist ’s advice 
is reco mmended.
The concomitant use of ondansetron (known to prolo ng the QT c interval in rare cases, per 
labelling) should be taken into account when interpreting QT cchanges.

Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at any  time during the cy cle 
at the discretion of the invest igator . The date, time of collect ion and results (values, units and 
reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .
The clinical chemistry , haematol ogy, urinalysis and pregnancy  test will  be perf ormed at a l ocal 
laboratory  at or near to the investigator site. Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary  
depending on lab oratory  method used and routine practice at the site. 
Com plete haematol ogy blood counts and clinical chemistry  will be obtained for all 
participants at visits on Day  1, Day 5, Day  8, Day  12 and Day  15 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and 
at the beginning of each t reatm ent week (on Day  1 and Day  8) in Cycle 3 onwards. Creatinine 
clearance (CrCl ) must be estimated using the Cockcroft -Gault equation at all visit s. On dosing 
days, the results must be reviewed prior to dose administration to ensure that they  meet the 
dosing thresho lds. For management of adavosertib -related toxicit y management, refer to 
Secti on 8.3.13.
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test during 
screening and a confirmatory  negative test prior to dosing on D ay [ADDRESS_966070] shoul d be repeated prior to dosing 
and, if posit ive, the participant discont inued from study treatment immediately .
The l aboratory  variables presented in Table10will be measured as a minimum (so me of these 
variables may be measured at baseline only) . 
The invest igator should make an assessment of the available results with rega rd to clinically 
relevant abnorm alities. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values shoul d be 
repeated as clinically indicated and recorded on the eCRF . The laboratory  resul ts shoul d be 
signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory  variables. For inform ation 
on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.

8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the 
clinical study  report (CSR). 
Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  values, vital signs and 
ECG abnormalit ies shoul d therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil any  of the SAE

If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to di sease progressi on, shoul d 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related t o the disease under study  (see Secti on8.3.7 ).
8.3.6 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry  may requi re further 
evaluat ion and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_966076] together with total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_966077] 
will need to be reported as SAEs if criteria are met for a Potential Hy ’s Law case. Pl ease refer

the severit y of the di sease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of new or progression of exist ing metastasis to the primary ca ncer under study

8.3.12 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for the study  drug that ei ther causes ha rm to the parti cipant or has the 
potenti al to cause harm  to the parti cipant.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error has:
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were identified that could have led to an error

Day 3 (±1 day ) of Cycle 1 and 2 to assess for AEs potenti ally related to adavosertib. In the 
event of significant diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomit ing, or reduced oral intake, it is strongly 
recommended that the participant is considered for IV fluid rehydration therapy and 
supportive care measures.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99of 154Appendix AGuidelines for Evaluati on of Objective Tumour Response 
using RECIST v1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours)
Introduction
This appendix details the implementation o f Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumours 
versio n 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) guidelines (Eisenhau er et al  2009) for this study  with regard to 
investigator assessment of tumour burden including protocol- specific requirements for this 
study . The differences from the published RECIST v1.1 guidelines are the exclusio n of 
clinical examinat ion and ultrasoun d as valid m odali ties to eval uate T arget Lesions (TL), 
Non-Target Lesions (NTL) or new lesio ns; and a clarification o f the use of 18FDG -PET to 
ident ify new lesio ns. 
Definitions of measurable, non -measurable, target and non -target lesions
Measurable:
A tumour lesi on that can be accurately  measured at baseline as ≥[ADDRESS_966118] 
diameter for non -nodal  lesions or ≥15 mm in short axis diameter1for lymph node lesio ns 
with com puted tom ography  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) and that is 
suitable for accurate repeated m easurements.
Non-measurable:
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis diameter at baseline2).
Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the followin g: bone l esions, l eptom eningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio n and abdominal masses/abdo minal 
organom egaly  identified by  [CONTACT_324691] (manual palpat ion) that is not 
measurable by [CONTACT_462].
Previously  irradiated l esions3
                                               
1The short axis is defined as the longest axis perpendicular to long axis.
2Lymph nodes with <[ADDRESS_966119] been 
previously irradiated are typi[INVESTIGATOR_331514] -measurable and as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of 
the NTL assessment.

Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100of 154Skin l esions
Special cases:
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue com ponents, 
can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y. Blast ic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in 
the sam e pat ient, these should be selected over cy stic lesi ons as TLs.
Target Lesions (TLs):
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline. Lymph nodes, in any locat ion (local/regional and distant), are collect ively 
considered as a single organ, with a maximum o f 2 lymph nodes as TLs. A bilateral organ (eg, 
adrenal glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or a mult ilobed organ (eg, lung) is each 
considered as a single organ.
Tumour lesi ons selected for fresh screening biopsy should not be selected as TLs, unless 
imaging occurred at least ~2 weeks after biopsy, allowing time for healing.
Non-Target Lesions (NTLs):
Addit ional measurable lesio ns not recorded as TLs and non -measurable lesio ns (o r sites of 
disease) shoul d be i dentified as NTLs at baseline.

Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC [ADDRESS_966121], abdomen 
and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and fo llow-up visi ts. Any other 
areas of disease involvement (eg, brain) should be addit ionally  imaged based on the si gns and 
symptoms of individual participants . In participants who are sensit ive to intravenous CT 
contrast, a non -contrast CT examinat ion of the chest and an MRI with intravenous MRI 
contrast of the abdo men is appropriate. In participants with severely  com promised renal 
function a non -contrast CT examinat ion of the chest and abdo men is appropriate. For brain 
lesion assessment, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method over IV  contrast -enhanced 
CT. It is strongly  recommended to maintain use of the same imaging modalit y (CT or MRI), 
acquisit ion protocol , facility and scanner across all imaging t ime points per patient.
Clinical examination 
Clinical examinat ion of skin/surface lesio ns (by  [CONTACT_73018]) will 
not be used for RECIST assessments. Tumours ident ified by [CONTACT_710462].
Chest X -ray
Chest X -ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL. Chest X -ray can, however, be 
used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns.
Plain X- ray 
Plain X- ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence 
of new bone lesio ns. 
Ultrasound 
Ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for RECIST assessment of tumours as it is not a 
reproducible a cquisit ion method (operator dependent), is subject ive in int erpretati on and m ay 
not provi de an accurate assessment of true tumour size. Tumours ident ified by [CONTACT_73019].

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102of 154Endoscopy and laparoscopy 
Endoscopy  and l aparoscopy  will not be used for tumour assessments as they  are not validated 
in the context of tumour assessment.
Histology and cytology
Histology on tum our bi opsy  samples will not be used as part of the tumour response 
assessment as per RECIST v1.1. 
Results of cyto logical examinat ion for the neoplastic origin o f any effusi on (eg, asci tes,
pericardial  effusi on, pleural  effusi on) that appears or worsens during the study  will not be 
used as part of the tumour response assessment in this study. An effusio n that appears or 
significant ly worsens (fro m trace to large) radio logically by  [CONTACT_4654]/MRI ana tomical scans will be 
considered to be disease progression due to New Lesio ns or progression of NTLs, 
respectively .
Isotopic bone scan 
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by [CONTACT_4654] , MRI, or 
X-ray at baseline should be re corded as NTL  and followed by [CONTACT_73020]. 
Isotopi c bone scans m ay be used as a method of assessment to ident ify the presence of new 
bone lesio ns at follow -up visi ts. New l esions m ay be recorded in case posit ive hot-spots 
appear on a bone scan that were not present on a previous bone scan; however, a newly 
observed equivocal hot -spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlative imaging 
(CT, MRI, X -ray) of the sam e anatomical region shall not be the only  trigger fo r a PD 
assessment at that timepoint.

evidence of ne w lesions on CT/MRI scans then fo llow-up CT/MRI assessments should be 
continued, scheduled as per protocol or as clinically indicated, in order to confirm new 
lesions.
Tumour response evaluation
Schedule of evaluation
Baseline assessments should enco mpass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the 
disease under evaluation and should addit ionally investigate areas that may  be involved based 
on si gns and symptom s of individual participants and should be performed wit hin the 28 days 
prior to Day  1 of Cycle 1 of study  treatm ent and i deally as close as possible to the start of 
study  treatm ent. F ollow -up assessments will be performed at the times specified in the SoA 
(see Section 1.3).
If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent assessments at their scheduled imagin g visi ts.
Target lesions
Documentation of target lesions
A maximum o f 5 measurable lesio ns, wi th a maximum  of 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes collect ively considered as a single organ), representative of all lesio ns involved 
shoul d be i dentified as TL  at baseline. T arget lesio ns should be selected on the basis of their 
size (l ongest di ameter for non -nodal  lesions or short axis diameter for nodal lesio ns), but in 
addition shoul d be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesio n, which can be measured 
reproducibly , shoul d be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL  shoul d be docu mented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in 
millimetres. At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL  will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diamete rs. At follow -up visi ts the sum of diameters for all TL  will be 
                                               
4A positive FDG -PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake ( eg, standardised uptake value) 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue or liver is observed.

Special cases
For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_966122] diameter. For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis 
diameter. 
If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a 
lesion appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New 
Lesio n.
If a TL split s into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. 
If 2 or more TLs merge, t hen the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be 
recorded for one of the lesio ns and 0 mm recorded for the other lesio n(s). 
If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assi gned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the 
size of the lesio n. 
When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, definit iveradiotherapy , embo lisation, surgery , 
etc. during the study , the si ze of  the TL shoul d still be provided where possible and the 
intervent ion recorded in the RECIST case report form. If a TL has been co mpletely 
removed (surgery ), the l ongest di ameter shoul dbe recorded as [ADDRESS_966123] ive tumour visit

Non-target lesions
Evaluation of non -target lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL  shoul d be i dentified as NTL  at

at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL  response shoul d be 
recorded by  [CONTACT_3170] . This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL  at the invest igational site a t each visit

Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more NTL
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. U nequivocal pro gression 
may be due to an important progression in one lesion only or in several 
lesions.  In all cases the progr ession MUST be clinically significant for 
the phy sician to consider changing (or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, in

discontinuat ion of therapy . A modest ‘increase ’ in the size o f one or m ore NTLs is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progressio n status.
New lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of 
one or m ore new l esions is assessed as progression. The finding of a new lesio n shoul d be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in i maging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour . If a new l esion is 
equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should 
be cont inued unt il the previously new lesio n has been assessed as unequivocal and then the 
progression date should be declared using the date of the init ial scan when the new lesio n first 
appeared.
A lesio n ident ified at a fo llow-up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a ne w lesi on and will indicate di sease progressi on.

for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_45806] .
Patients wi th ‘symptom atic deterioration ’ requi ring disc ontinuat ion of treatment without

a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid t umours is the chest, 
abdo men and pelvis. Coverage should enco mpass all areas of known predilect ion for 
metastases in the disease under evaluat ion and should addit ionally invest igate areas that may 
be involved based on signs and symptoms o f individual participants . Because a lesio n later

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 108of 154ident ified in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesio n 
represent ing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the extent of 
imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent fo llow-up time points. This will enable better 
consistency not only o f tumour measurements but also ident ificat ion of new disease.
b.IV contrast administration : Optimal visualisatio n and m easurement of m etastases in so lid 
tumours requi res consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of 
scanning. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and 
(optimally) about the sam e time frame after inject ion on each examinat ion. An adequate 
volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to 
best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  given pat ient. 
It is very  important that the sam e techni que be used at baseline and on fo llow-up examinat ions 
for a given pati ent. For participants who develop contraindicat ions to contrast after baseline 
contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -
enhanced) should be performed should also be based on the tumour ty pe, anatomic location o f 
the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior scans if possible. 
Each case should be discussed with t he radio logist to determine if substitution of these other 
approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable fro m that 
point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modalit y and 
interpretati on of  non-target disease or new lesio ns, since the same lesio n may appear to have a 
different size using a new modalit y. Oral  contrast is recommended to help visualise and 
different iate structures in the abdo men. 
If iodine contrast m edia is medically  contraindica ted at baseline or at any  time during the 
course of the study , the recommended methods are: CT thoracic (chest) examinat ion without 
contrast and abdominal (and pelvis) MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed, CT 
without IV contrast is an option for t he thorax and abdo men (and pelvis) examinat ion. For 
brain imaging, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method.
c. Slice thickness and r econstruction interval: It is recommended that CT scans be 
perform ed at 5 mm  cont iguous slice thickness and this guidel ine presumes a maximum 5 mm 
thickness in reco mmendat ions for measurable lesio n definit ion. Except ionally , parti cular 
institutions may  perform medically  acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If 
this occurs, the minimum size o f measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice 
thickness of the baseline scans.
All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where 
lung and soft tissue windows should be considered. When measuring lesio ns, the TL  shou ld be 
measured on the same window setting for repeated examinat ions throughout the study . All 
images from each examinat ion shoul d be included in the assessment and not “selected ” 
images of the apparent lesio n.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 109of 154MRI Scan
MRI has excellent contrast, spatial a nd tem poral  resol ution; however, there are many image 
acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly impact image qualit y, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_72922] y 
and measurement. Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI i s variable gl obally . The m odali ty 
used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesio ns should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally , axial  imaging of the abdomen and 
pelvis (and other anatomies [eg, neck]) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging alo ng with 
gadolinium -enha nced imaging can be performed. The field of view , matrix, number of 
excitat ions, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppressio n and fast sequences should be 
optimised for the specific body  part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. CT of the 
chest is typi[INVESTIGATOR_710414] (heart, major 
blood vessels, breathing) associated with MRI. It is beyo nd the scope of this appendix to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts and di seases. 
Ideally , the same ty pe of  scanner shoul d be used and the image acquisit ion protocol should be 
followed as closely  as possible to pri or scans. Body  scans shoul d be perform ed wi th 
breath -hold scanning techniques if possible.
More details on the recom mended imaging parameters can be found in the image acquisit ion 
guidelines.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116of 154Appendix DGuidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Adavosertib 
with Concomitant Medications
The potential for drug -drug interaction described in this protocol are based on findings from in 
vitro studies and clinical experience.
A formal clinical  drug interacti on study  (D6014C00006) evaluating the effect of 
adavosertib on pharmacokinetics of subst rates for CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 has been 
conducted in advanced so lid tumour participants . The results of this study  suggest that 
adavosertib is a weak inhibitor of these enzymes and is unlikely to result in clinically 
significant drug interacti on. 
The fo llowing treatm ents and the m edicat ions listed in this Appendix are prohibited or should 
be used wit h caution. Any further questions regarding conco mitant treatm ents shoul d be 
referred to the Medical Monitor.
Prohibited Medications
Adavosertib is predominan tly metabo lized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Strong or moderate inhibitors or 
inducers o f CYP3A4 are prohibited unt il addit ional data on drug -drug interactions (DDIs) 
beco mes available. As grapefruit and Seville oranges are known to contain moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4, th ese fruits or their products (including marmalade, juice, etc.) 
shoul d be avoi ded while taking adavosertib.
An exploratory  assessment of the effect of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_710415] a drug interact ion bet ween adavosertib and 
aprepi [INVESTIGATOR_053], as exposure to adavosertib increased by ~40% when aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_710416]-administered with adavosertib. The observed increase in adavosertib exposure is likely 
the resul t of CYP3A4 inhibit ion by [CONTACT_173369][INVESTIGATOR_053]. This increase in expo sure is statist ically 
significant. At the sel ected maximum tol erated doses (MTDs), this increase may also be 
of clinical importance. Therefore, concomitant treatment with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_710417]. 
Herbal preparations/medicat ions are not allowed throughout the study . These herbal 
medicat ions include but are not limited to those containing: St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra 
(ma huang), gingko bilo ba, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), y ohimbe, saw palmetto,
and ginseng. Participants should stop using these herbal medicat ions [ADDRESS_966133] 
dose of adavosertib.
No other anticancer -therapy  (chemotherapy, immunotherapy , horm onal anticancer 
therapy , radi otherapy  [except for palliat ive local radi otherapy ]), bi ological therapy  or 
other novel agent is to be permitted while the participant is receiving study medicat ion.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117of 154Receipt of live virus and live bacterial vaccines is not permitted while the participant is 
receiving study  medicati on and during the 30- day follow -up peri od. Inact ivated flu 
vaccines are permitted.
Medications to be used with Caution
In vitro studies have shown that adavosertib may be a substrate and inhibitor for human 
P-glycoprotein (P -gp). Caution should be exercised when agents that are in hibitors or 
substrates of P -gp are administered concomitant ly with adavosertib (see relevant section 
below).
in vitro transporter studies have shown adavosertib to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC 50 
5.1μM). This finding is particularly relevant for drugs admin istered orally where 
exposure is normally limited by [CONTACT_69811] -mediated efflux, in particular so me statins, such as 
rosuvastatin. Other drugs where the disposit ion is mediated via BCRP should be 
administered with caution, dose modificat ion considered or substit uted by  [CONTACT_710464].
Metformin should be used wit h caution. Adavosertib has been shown to be an inhibitor of 
MATE1 and MATE2K transporters. A drug interaction with substrates of eit her 
transporter cannot be ruled out, the most important substrate k nown to date being 
metformin.
In addit ion, any other drugs should be avo ided at the invest igator ’s discretion if, in their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, the co -administration with adavosertib may increase the risk of a clinically significant 
drug interaction.

substrates are shown below . This is not an exhaust ive list and further details can be found at

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Repo rting
E [ADDRESS_966134] a causal relat ionship with this tr eatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered.
E 2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any  study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -partici pant hospi [INVESTIGATOR_122568] n of exist ing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may requi re medical  
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally  be 
assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medical Event ’ 
criterion shoul d be used. In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual 
event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be asses sed 
and reported as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history  
and progression occurs during the study , but the progressi on does not change treatment and/or 
prognosi s of the m alignant tum our, the AE m ay not fulfil the attri butes for being assessed as 
Serious, al though reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and 
shoul d occur . Also, some t ypes of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a 
routi ne treatm ent that does not require hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], m ay be assessed as Non -Serious; 
examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy .

rare, progression –undergo transformat ion (eg, Richter's transformat ion of B cell chronic 
lymphocy tic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lympho ma) should not be considered a new 
malignant tumour .
Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening ’ means t hat the participant was at immediate risk of death fro m the AE as i t 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant ’s death. ‘Life-threatening ’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72917] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmissi ons and/or surgi cal 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the participant or may  
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123of 154Intensity rating scale:
The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Inst itute CTCAE versio n 5.0 will be 
utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned 
CTCAE grades, the recommendation in th e CTCAE cri teria that converts mild, moderate and 
severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program websi te (http://ctep.cancer .gov). The applicable 
versio n of CTCAE should be d escribed clearly .  
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] E 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix
 E 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix

3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reason able possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host or environ mental  factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a 
re-challenge .
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if perf ormed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 [COMPANY_008]

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124of 154In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related ’ is made if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal  relati onship is meant to convey , in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. W ith no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
E 4 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended fa ilure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant 
or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances wer e recognised that coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug no t administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125of 154Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should b e at room  temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion
Wrong drug administered to participant
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take m edicati on
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
H 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to i dentify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy ’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy ’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion8.3.[ADDRESS_966138] igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The investigator is responsible for dete rmining whether a participant meets PHL  
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL  and HL  events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including cent ral and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL  
criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724] a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL  from 
a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review adve rse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL  events.
The invest igator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL  criteria to agree whether HL  criteria are m et. HL  
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  
other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_244993] 
(IMP). 
The inves tigator i s responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL  cases and for 
reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs according to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
H 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (AL T) ≥ 3x upper limit of 
norm al (ULN) together  with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 132of 154Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together  with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug. 
For PHL  and HL  the el evation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL  must o ccur.
H 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL  it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  parti cipant who m eets any of the fo llowing identificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3xULN
AST ≥ 3xULN
TBL ≥ 2xULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a participant meets any of the PHL  identification criteria, in iso lation or in co mbinat ion, 
the central  laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent t o 
[COMPANY_008] representative). 
The invest igator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL  
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the invest igator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_244994]
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  eCRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  results the invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section H 2for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_710465] (incl uding both central  and l ocal 
laboratory  resul ts)

H4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the participant does not meet PHL  criteria the investigator will:
Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the pa rticipant has not met PHL criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study  Protocol .
H4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the participant does meet PHL  criteria the investigator will:
Dete rmine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
treatm ent (See Secti onH 6).
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central  Study  Team .
Within [ADDRESS_966139] igator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘y es/rel ated’ 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For parti cipants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the participant’s 
condi tion.
The Study  Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  parti cipants’ fo llow
-up (including any further laboratory  testing) 
and the continuous review of data.
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_33157]:
Moni tor the parti cipant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physic ian. This includes deciding which of the tests 
available in the HL lab kit should be used.
Com plete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information beco mes available 
#A ‘significant ’ change in the participant ’s condi tion refers to a clinically  relevant 
chang e in any  of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (AL T, AST or total bilirubin) in 
isolation or in combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The 
determinat ion of whether there has been a significant change will be at the d iscret ion of the 
investigator, this may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any  uncertaint y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134of 154H 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL  criteria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL  criteria other than DIL I caused by  [CONTACT_86184], and to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin [ADDRESS_966140] and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the [COMPANY_008] standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AL T or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay , of over 15 cal endar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 [COMPANY_008]
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 135of 154Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
suppleme ntary informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
H 6 Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met 
Before and After Starting Study Treatment 
This sect ion is applicable to participants with liver met astases who m eet PHL cri teria on study  
treatm ent, having previously met PHL  criteria at a study  visit prior to starti ng study  treatm ent.
At the first on -study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL criteria being met the invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the participant ’s condi tion#compared wi th 
the last visit where PHL  criteria were met#
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant ch ange, notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform  the central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in 
Secti on H 4.2  
H 7 Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a participant meets PHL  criteria on study  treatm ent and has 
already met PHL  criteria at a previous on study  treatm ent visi t.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. 
The invest igator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being 
met and answer the following quest ion:
Was the al ternat ive cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being met found 
to be the di sease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infect ion or liver disease or did the participant meet PHL  criteria prior to starting study 
treatm ent and at their first on -study  treatm ent visi t as described in Sect ionH 6of this 
Appendix?

administration by [CONTACT_148703]/her caregiv er
Prior to at -home or remote location investigational product administration, the investigator 
must assess the participant or his/her caregiver to determine whether they  are appropriate for 
at-home or remote location administration of investigat ional product. Once the participant or 
his/her caregiver is deemed appropriate for at- home or remote location administration, he/she 
must receive appropriate training. All necessary supplies and instructions for administration 
and docum entati on of  invest igational pr oduct administration will be provided. More 
inform ation related to the visit can be obtained via a telemedicine or home/remote visit.

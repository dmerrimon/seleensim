 2 1 Introduction  
This document is  a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted in accordance with 
US government research regulations, and applicable international standards of Good Clinical Practice, 
and institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1     Backg round  
Surgical treatment of focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_649224] 30% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_649225] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_17115]  (Kwan & Brodie 2000). Randomized control led trials revea l that in appropriately se lected 
surgical populations, epi[INVESTIGATOR_649226] (Engel et al 2012) .  
 
Patients whose seizure foc i are close to the motor  cortex remain a challenge due to the potential risk of 
motor deficits after the surgery. Accurate mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649227].  Currently intra -operative direct current stimulation (DCS ) is the gold standard , 
and is the clinical standard of care for surgical planning . if epi[INVESTIGATOR_649228]. A subdural grid is implanted for intracranial EEG monitoring and seizure foci localization. After enough interictal or ictal events are captured, the patient will have 
functional mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649229].

However,  noninvasive functional mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649230], via TMS and other non- invasive modalities 
such as f MRI or MEG, would optimize  presurgical planning and patient counseling.  In addition, in some 
cases, presurgical evaluation could determine whether  a surgical resection is feasible, or whether the 
patient would be a better candidate for another procedure such as responsive neurostimulation (RNS) or vagal nerve stimulation (VNS)  which would spare overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_649231] . Furthermore in the 
pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_67513], presurgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649232] (sometimes to the contralateral hemisphere), such that surgical resection of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_649233] a functional deficit.  
 A
 neurostimulation technique,  navigated  transcranial magnetic stimulation ( nTMS) is a potential ly 
valuable tool for  preoperative motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Previously there have been several studies to test the 
accuracy of TMS to DCS, and in comparison with other noninvasive modalities, including magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional MRI  (fMRI) (Najib 2011; Romero 2011, Tarapore 2012, 
Krieg 2012) , suggesting that nTMS can have an extremely high degree of functional accurac y, identifying 
primary motor cortex within 2 mm of accuracy, and with a high positive and negative predictive value (Tarapore 2012) .   
 A similar neuronavigated device, the integrated Nexstim device manufactured by [CONTACT_649283], was FDA 
approved for presurgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] 2009 (Please see appendix).   We are testing the Magstim 
Rapid
2 TMS coil and Brainsight Neuronavigation system (instead of the Nextstim) because the dual 
system allows co -registration to the patient’s structural MRI , functional MRI(fMRI) or EEG.  Furthermore, 
                                            
1 Electrical stimulation of the cerebral  cortex will be conducted utilizing a NicoletOne Cortical Stimulator 
which delivers a constant current output.  The stimulus  parameters are set to a pulse width of 500 
microseconds, pulse frequency of 50 Hertz and maximum train duration of 5 seconds.   The stimulus 
current is  manually controlled during the stimulation and ranged from 1 mA to 12 mA.   Stimulation is 
applied to adjoining electrode pairs.  Responses are confirmed with repeat stimulation and testing at the 
initial pair and with  adjoining electrodes when necessary.  Electrical stimulation is started at 1 mA and 
gradually increased in increments of 1- 4 mA  until a maximum of 12 mA was achieved or until after -
discharges are seen or  a functional response is observed.  Positive and negative functional sites will be 
recorded.

 3 the dual system is a more flexib le system  for other research use with other stimulation devices (such as 
transcranial direct current stimulation and simultaneous EEG recording) and robotic devices.  
 
We propose an open -label feasibility study  to test the accuracy of  nTMS to the gold standard DCS, 
as well as to fMRI (an adjunctive presurgical planning tool), in determining both positive and 
negative motor sites, and correlate with clinical outcomes.  
 
1.2    Investigation device: TMS basics  
Application of  magnetic pulse for motor cortex stimulation was developed decades ago (Barker 1985). 
TMS machine consists of a coil which generates a brief, powerful magnet ic field . As the current passes 
through the coil, it generates a magnet field that can penetrate the scalp and skull and in  turn induce an 
electric  current in the brain tissue ( Kobayashi  & Pascual -Leone  2003) . When pyramidal neurons of the 
primary motor cortex are stimulated by [CONTACT_649284], the resultant motor evoked potential (MEP) 
triggers small movements in the relevant muscle groups, which can then be detected via 
electromyography  (EMG) . (Fig 1  adapted from Kobayashi  & Pascual -Leone  2003) 
 
 
 
TMS can also be integrated with a neuronavigation system, allowing for coregistration with an anatomical 
scan , such as MRI scan. This navigated TMS (nTMS) system allows for more precise position of coils 
during the brain stimulation and generate motor maps of high resolution. (Gugino et al., 2001; Julkunen et 
al., 2009; Kring et al., 2001) .  
 
Single pulse and repetitive pulse TMS are both used in neurological research studies and clinical 
practice. Repetitive TMS can induce lasting changes in cortical excitability and it has been approved for  
treatment of depression. Single pulse TMS will be used in our study for motor cortex mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
The practical application of TMS  is simple.  The TMS  stimulation is  administered on skull over the motor 
cortex via the guidance of MRI anatomical scan, surface EMG was appl ied on individual target  muscle 
(Fig 2 , pi[INVESTIGATOR_649234] 2011).  
  Fig 1 Principle of TMS : The current f lowing 
briefly in the coil generates a changing magnetic field that induces an electric current in the tissue, in the opposite direction. A motor response can be detected on electromyography 
when motor cortex is stimulated.

We will be  using the Magstim Rapid2, which is a microprocessor -controlled machine which delivers both 
single and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).   The proposed device is not currently FDA 
approved for presurgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], but is approved for peripheral nerve stimulation ( K051864) .  
However, the Nextstim TMS system is currently FDA approved for presurgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (K091457 ).  
 Currently, there have been a number of clinical protocols using TMS, which have considered TMS a non-significant risk device.  
 The TMS device poses a non- significant risk be cause 
 
1. The device is not an implant with potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of subject . 
2. The device is not purported for use supporting or sustaining human life with potential for serious risk to health safety or welfare of subject . 
3. The device is not for substantial use in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health with a potential for serious risk to health safety or welfare of subject . 
4. The device does not otherwise present a serious risk to the health safety or welfare of a subject . 
We anticipate that this will be a step toward eventual wider application of TMS.  
 
In particular, because TMS will be applied as single pulses to determine motor evoked potentials (MEPs) , 
there will be no modulation of cortical excitability .  
Single pulse TMS produces  monophonic magnetic field 
pulse of peak amplitude range of 1 -2 Tesla is achieved to discharge a capacitor, and is commonly used 
for research and diagnostic purposes.   
 
In a review by [CONTACT_649285] (2005) of TMS in in persons under the age of 18, there were 35 studies using 
single pulse TMS involving 980 children; with a single seizure reported, even in children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_649235] (which is associated with an increase d risk of seizures).  In a more recent meta -analysis of 
data from 165 pediatric subects from 2009 to 2014, there were no seizures or severe related adverse events were reported with single pulse TMS.  For these reasons, IRBs at other peer institutions incl uding 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Kennedy -Krieger Institute, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724], and University of 
Pennsylvania and the NINDS have rendered single  pulse TMS studies in children minimal risk
. 
 
Magnetic fields attenuate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_563934], so it seems unlikely that the fetus might be directly 
affected by [CONTACT_7712]. T here are anecdotal reports of pregnant women who underwent successful rTMS Figure 2. Photograph showing the navigated 
transcranial magnetic stimulation system in

against the patient's head. The 3D 
reconstruction of the patient's brain is

2008; Ross 2007). Nevertheless, the effects of the TMS  device on the reproductive system (sperm, eggs)

participation in this study .  
 
As evidence of safety, the Nexstim TMS system, which provides exactly the same type of single TMS 
described here, is approved for  use as a tool to perform mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649237] (December 2009, FDA approval notice K091457), for pre -surgical 
planning (for example, in epi[INVESTIGATOR_649238]). The Magstim Rapid² is 
developed and manufactured in accordance with US 21 CFR 820 and is cleared in the [LOCATION_003] under 510(k) number K051864 for the stimulation of peripheral  nerves.  However, unlike the Nexstim system, which is 
fully integrated with a built in -neuronavigation system, the neuronavigation system (Brainsight) 
compatible with Magstim permits targeted neuronavigation with MRI layered with fMRI, EEG, or NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy), permitting greater research flexibility and other modalities of validating 
motor and other eloquent function .
  
 
TMS  Advantages:  In this study, TMS  is safe, non- invasive, and offers a potentially useful adjunctive test 
for presurgical planning.   The stimulation coil can be easily placed precisely on interested cortical surface 
with guidance of anatomical scans . TMS  session does not interfere with other treatment or diagnostic 
tests.  
1.3    Clinical Data  to Date  
Cortical function m appi[INVESTIGATOR_649239] . Accurate coil position can be achieved with nTMS and t he system achieved an error of 
less than 3 mm in about 95% of the stimulation (Romero et al., 2011) . Eva luation of the physiologic 
responses, revealed no significant differences between MEP latency, amplitude, and area among 
sessions  in the same subject. In addition, comparing the motor map parameters revealed no significant 
differences between map area, volume, and amplitude in the 2 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_119696] ( Fig. 3). (Romero et al., 
2011; Krieg et al., 2012) . 
 
Motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649240] .  Maps of motor 
system generated with TMS have been demonstrated to correlate well with those generated by [CONTACT_649286] (Tarapore et al., 2012; Takahashi  2013) . In addition, nMTS  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649241] s. (Frey et al., 2014; Kreig et al., 2012; Takahashi  2013).

1.4     R esearch Risks & Benefits  
1.4.1    Risks of Investigational Device s 
Generally TMS  is safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and neurological patients, as long as 
general safety recommendations  are followed (Wasserman 1998) . TMS  applied as single pulse mode 
does  not carry the risk of significant magnetic field exposure since the total stimulation time is  short , and 
modulation of cortical excitability is highly unlikely . Single -pulse TMS does not cause any detrimental 
effect s on EEG or cognitive and motor test performance (Bridgers and Delaney, 1989; Bridgers, 1991) 
and can be safely used in children (Eyre et al., 2001). According to a consensus statement on the safety 
of TMS  (Rossi et al 2009) , known side effects of TMS include transient headache (which occurs 
occasionally) , syncope (mostly likely an epi[INVESTIGATOR_649243] , which 
occurs rarely ), local pain (rarely) , neck pain  (rarely), toothache (rarely) paresthesias (rarely); p ossible 
transient hearing changes  (rarely)  and possible  malfunction of electric device only if TMS is delivered in 
close proximity with devices (rarely) (Ross i 2009).  The overall incidence of these mild adverse events are 
thought to be approximately 5%, with headache being reported as the most common (Maizey 2013). , Side effects are transient, and have not been reported to induce permanent neurological changes (Rossi et al 2009, Evans 2007) . 
The most serious possible side effect of TMS is that of an induced seizure.  To date,  there have been a 
total of 16 reports of seizures  associated with TMS, of thousands of published studies.  Previously the risk 
of inadvertently induces seizures is estimated to be less than 1 in 1000 rTMS procedures (which is 
considered a higher risk procedure than single pulse TMS  as used in this protocol), a higher risk than 
most commonly prescribe antidepressants (O’Reardon et al 2005)   In a safety review  of TMS, Hallet et al  
(2007) report [ADDRESS_870135] case, Haupt's et al (2004) report a generalized tonic 
clonic seizure in a patient with multiple sclerosis using single pulse TMS at 66% of TMS output.  The 
authors suggested that the use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_649244]'s seizure 
risk. In the second case, Tharayii et al (2005) reported a generalized seizure in a patient with bipolar Fig. 3. Example of interpolated cortical ma ps 
of the motor representation for the contralateral FDI muscle in [ADDRESS_870136] averaged 
peak -to-peak amplitude MEP was elicited (ie, 
hot spot). The 2 subjects shown underwent 2 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_119696] (initial session top, second session bottom). No significant differ ences 
were observed in motor map parameters 
between the 2 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_119696].  (Romero 
et al., 2011)

 7 depression taking chlorpromazine and lithium, both medications known to increase seizure risk .   To date, 
there has been a single report of an induced focal motor seizure during single pulse TMS of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_649245] a known epi[INVESTIGATOR_649246] (Classen et al 1995). These few reported 
seizures were not associated with long term adverse outcome ( Schrader et al.  2004).  
 
In the event of a concurrent seizure during stimulation,  one or more co- investigators with specialty 
training in epi[INVESTIGATOR_649247] . If there is immediate cause for concern the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- PI [INVESTIGATOR_649248] , including direction to the emergency room if needed.  If any other unanticipated 
adverse events occur  which are thought to be related to study intervention, the patient will be withdrawn 
from further participation in the study. Though our clinical trial will include a safety -monitoring plan, there 
are no known severe or lasting adverse effects with TMS  using proper set -up.  
 
1. Though minimal, due to the concern of potential increased seizures with TMS, we will monitor 
increase in seizure severity attributable to TMS by [CONTACT_649287]  (defined as occurring within 20 minutes  of 
stimulation) .  In addition, subjects will be asked to keep a seizure diary for the 7 days prior to 
stimulation, and the 7 days  after stimulation.  Instances where seizure frequency increased 
after TMS will be reported to the IRB within 1 week . 
2. If a self -limited, short (<5 min) complex partial seizure or evolution into generalized tonic 
clonic seizures occur during the procedure, TMS mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649249] .

1.4.[ADDRESS_870137] the confidentiality of subjects. After enrollment, patient identifiers will be linked to sequential numerical codes (Subject #1, #2, etc.). The detailed results of the research will be 
kept in a separate research file maintained by [CONTACT_649288] a locked cabinet in [CONTACT_32830]'s office. The numerical code key will also be maintained in a locked cabinet in [CONTACT_32830]'s office 
and accessible only to investigators.    If the patient is consented, and then withdraws from the study, their 
PHI will be discarded.  
 
F
urthermore, there is minimal risk of the electromyography (EMG) procedure).  EMG is a noninvasive 
procedure which measures the compound muscle action potential (CMAP), experienced by [CONTACT_167213] a muscle twitch over the abductor pollicis brevis over the base of the thumb.  EMG in this case will be 
measured by a surface electrode, which will be applied via an electrolyte gel and reinforced by [CONTACT_12896].  The 
patient may have a local allergic reaction to the gel and/or tape, which will be evaluated by [CONTACT_099].  
1.4.3    Potential B enefits  
TMS is ab le to provide functional anatomy  that can be used during surgical interventions and help in 
presurgical planning, potentially reducing the need for a more prolonged intraoperative mappi[INVESTIGATOR_223117].  nTMS may be a useful adjunctive presurgical planning tool, in addition to other non- invasive  
 modalities including magnetoencephalography or functional MRI (fMRI).   In addition, presurgical TMS

(Najib 2011) . 
 
Because this is a feasibility study, results of nTMS motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649252] , therefore subjects may not benefit individually from 
this study . The ongoing practice during this study will be the use of DCS as standard of care. However 
knowledge gained from this study will benefit others in the future.

 8 In particular, because TMS for motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649253] (see page 2, Background section), we would 
like to include subjects from the ages of 12- [ADDRESS_870138] reorganized as a result of early brain injury and/or ongoing seizure activity (in some cases completely to 
the contralateral hemisphere), and who are less likely to tolerate other presurgical modalities such as 
functional MRI ( fMRI ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ).   
 
The current study presents experiences which would be reasonably commensurate (or even less risk)  
with those expected in their actual medical evaluation for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58741], most notably direct cortical 
stimulation for determination of functional cortex.   The procedures would present no more than a minor 
increase over minimal risk, including the low possibility of an induced seizure (discussed on pages 4- 5, 
under risks of investigational device), loss of confidentiality, and skin irritation from the EMG electrodes.  There have never been reported any incidents of extreme pain, discomfort, stress or harm associated 
with single pulse TMS as described in our protocol.   Any potential harm associated with TMS will be 
transient and reversible. To mitigate these minor risks, either [CONTACT_32830] and [CONTACT_6033], who  regularly see 
children and adolescent on the outpatient and inpatient services (the latter while on call on the weekend)  
and who have specialty training in epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], will be physically present during stimulation.   However, to 
ensure maximum comfort and safety for children, the first 3 subjects run on this protocol will be adults (over 18 years old).  Furthermore, to fully communicate the nature of these risks, adequate provisions are 
made for soliciting the assent of children and permission of their parents or legal guardians.  
2 Study Obj ectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
We propose a phase 1 clinical trial to examine the degree of concordance between n euronavigation  
guided TMS (nTMS) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in identifying hand motor cortex in adults and 
children undergoing epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] s urgery .

4.[ADDRESS_870145] Recruitment and Screening 
We will announce the opening of the trial with a group email sent to the NYU Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_649261] .  We will identify potential subjects at surgical conference, during which all epi[INVESTIGATOR_649262] -making regarding the patients’ surgical planning, and maintaining regular 
communication with attendings  about pote ntially eligible subjects  (see recruitment email).  
 
For potentially eligible outpatients,  a research team member will discuss a subject’s eligibility with their 
treating epi[INVESTIGATOR_427785].  If the patient is deemed an appropriate subject, the treating epi[INVESTIGATOR_649263] a study team member to 
contact [CONTACT_649290].  The study team member will then discuss study details with the patients. The treating physician will not be asked to 
provide any details of the proposed study. When possible, i.e., when potential subjects are identified, he 
or she will meet with Dr s. Liu, Friedman, or Chen  in person to review the study and TMS  technology and 
study design.   
 
Patients (or their parents/guardians) contact[CONTACT_3012] (or who call in) will be  pre-screened over the 
telephone using  the IRB approved telephone script, which reviews study rationale, activities, and includes 
a brief questionnaire to assess  eligibility criteria. We will obtain a waiver of documentation of consent for 
the minimal risk phone pre- screening since we will obtain verbal consent.  Furthermore, for patients who 
do not continue to sign the written consent (either b ecause they are deemed ineligible or do not want to 
participate in the study), we will immediately destroy all information we collected from them .   We will give 
these  patients  (or parents/guardians)  a copy of the study information sheet, either in person or via mail .

5 Study Device  
5.1 Description 
Preoperative mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649264]2 (Magstim)  brain stimulation system . It 
delivers a biphasic TMS pulse from a figure- of-eight coi l with an outer diameter of [ADDRESS_870147]'s head size and shape into account.  The estimates  of the induced electric field are based on a 
dynamic spherical model adjusted in real time and the physical parameters of stimulation.  
 
Brainsight Navigation,(Rogue Resolutions) will provide the hardware and software environment to guide 
TMS application in a manner which is co- registered to the patient’s MRI Brain.  With combined use of the 
Magstim Rapid2 and Brainsight,  the TMS coil can be navigated and positioned over a specified target 
location based upon the MRI Brain, thereby [CONTACT_649292] a spatially precise manner.  
 Neither the Magstim Rapid2 or Brainsight are FDA approved.  However, the combination of Magstim 
Rapid
2 and Brainsight NeuroNavigation system is comparable to the Nextstim TMS system, which was 
FDA approved in 2009 for use in presurgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (see attachment). Brainsight NeuroNavigation 
system is a non- significant risk device, as there it represents an imaging tool complementary to the TMS 
machines, and does not make contact [CONTACT_10970].  
5.[ADDRESS_870148]  MEP Reponses  form the muscle interested , The resting motor threshold (r MT) was 
determined at the hand hotspot.  rMT is defined as minimal stimulation intensity  capable of generating an 
MEP in 50% of cases. Muscle representation areas relevant for clinical decisions were mapped with an 
intensity  of 110% of rMT. Cortical muscle  presentation areas  were stimulated by [CONTACT_649293] s ulcus . The stimulation coil was hold tangential  to the scalp. T he

5.6.2   Dispensing and Return 
The device will not be dispensed to subjects.  
6. Study procedures  
6.1    Baseline Visit: Informed Consent and baseline neurological visit (30 min) 
This visit may happen in conjunction with a planned clinical visit. Patients will be educated on study 
design and eligibility requirements.  If they are eligible and agree to study participation, they will be sign 
the informed consent.  They will then be asked to maintain a [ADDRESS_870152] study visit.   
6.2    Visit  2: nTMS session  (2 hours) 
For this session, the patient will visit the Ambulatory Care Center, [ADDRESS_870153] (eithe r [CONTACT_32830] or Friedman) will be present during the stimulation. A questionnaire regarding 
side effects will be given to patients . Detailed description of TMS session can be found in section 3.1.1 .  
Patients will then be asked to keep a 7 day seizure diary after the study visit.  
6.3    Visit 3: Post -operative clinic visit  (30 min)  
Patients will also be followed approximately 1 months  after epi[INVESTIGATOR_58819] , in conjunction with their 
regularly scheduled clinical visits . A complete neurological exam will be performed and a questionnaire  
(Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire)  will be administered to detect any changes in motor strength 
and function after surgery.    
7.  Statistical Plan  
7.[ADDRESS_870154] a 50% difference between nTMS and DCS mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
assuming alpha 0.[ADDRESS_870155] profile and seizures  we propose to add ~1/[ADDRESS_870156] from this procedure.  
7.2    Statistical Methods  
Maps of stimulation locations corresponding to hand and arm  muscle groups will be formed. The distance 
between the averaged positive nTMS stimulation site s for each type of motor response (APB, ADM, etc)  
and the corresponding averaged DCS site  will be  calculated , according to co -registered 3D coordinates in 
MRI anatomical space . For DCS,  the center of the electrode eliciting motor response with the lowest 
current will be defined;  when stimulation of several electrodes elicited motor  response with the same 
minimum current, the average ECS site of these electrode centers w ill be used instead. The weighted 
mean of the D CS map will also be calculated.   
 
The distance between the averages of  nTMS and DCS maps, between the site eliciting a motor response 
with a  minimum current and between the average of the nTMS map and the weighted average of the ECS 
map w ill be calculated.

8.     Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1      Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of  the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ( i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (
 including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
U
nanticipated Adverse Device Effect   
An Unanticipated Device Effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life- threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Serious injury  
Any injury or illness that is any one of the following:  
• life-threatening  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure 
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
 
Adverse Event  
(a) In parallel with recording the primary outcome, we will monitor for increase in seizure severity 
attributable to TMS by [CONTACT_649295]. 
Instances where seizure frequency increased after TMS  will be reported to the IRB within 72 hours . 
 (b) If a self -limited, short (<5 min) partial seizure or evolution into generalized tonic clonic seizure occur, 
TMS mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649249].  
 (c) If a secondarily generalized (convulsion starting in one area of body and then spreading to other 
areas) or 2 partial seizures occur during treatment, the patient will be withdrawn from further partic ipation 
in the study.  
 
(d) If any other unanticipated adverse events occur, the patient will be withdrawn from further participation in the study.

 All adverse device effects occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each 
event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse device effects that are still ongoing at the en d 
of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse device effects that occur after the study period will be recorded and reported promptly (see section 8.3 below)  to 
the IRB, the device manufacturer (Magstim), and the FDA.   
 The minimum initial information to be captured in the subject’s source document concerning the adverse device effect includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• Device model and serial number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onse t • Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
• Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• Whether the event is serious and reason for classification as serious  
8.3  Reporting of Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
8.3.1    Investigator reporting: Notifying the IRB  
Federal regulations require timely reporting by [CONTACT_649296].  The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, 
though Investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements of their 
IRB of record.  
 Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than10 
working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– U
nexpected:  An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.   
– Related to the research procedures : A n event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_118689].   
– Harmful:  either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
• Unanticipated adverse device effect :  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application, or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

 15 Other Reportable events:  
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than10 working days :  
• Complaint of a research subject when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations  ( includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations 
from the IRB approved protocol) for any  of the following situations:   
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• B reach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of  the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower -than- expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market)  
 R
eporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the Reportable New Information 
submission (including a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above 
criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation) .

Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_58783]  
[ADDRESS_870161] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why.  Only site PIs and study team members will 
have access to PHI.  Outside collaborators will only have access to patient’s de- identified data.  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all  information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
 
Data will be coded in an anonymous fashion, according to enrollment order (eg P001, P002, etc).  
9.2     Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other  activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3      Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the it em is 
not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any 
entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry 
and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.

10.2      Auditing a nd Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
11        Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA 
Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing  to the investigator before commencement of this study.   
 All adult subjects  (or parents/guardians for minors)  for this study will be provided a consent form 
describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decis ion about 
their participation in this study.  [CONTACT_32830]  and [CONTACT_6033] will be allowed to consent patients.  All have 
significant experience with patient oriented clinical research, and are specialists in epi[INVESTIGATOR_649269] , and have significant clinical experience with both adults and children. Only subjects, 
their family members, and study team members will be present during the consent process to protect 
patient privacy.   For potential subjects ages 12- 17, a separate assent form for subjects aged 12- 14 (see 
attached) and aged 15- 17 (see attached)  will be used to obtain assent. Furthermore, the permission of 
both parents will be obtained, unless  (1) one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not 
reasonably available, or (2) only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.  
 See Attachment [ADDRESS_870163] Informed Consent Form.  This consent form will be submitted 
with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study 
procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_11867]/guardian for minors , and the

Validation of Presurgical Motor Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649218]: June 4, [ADDRESS_870164] compensation . Patients will be compensated $50 an hour for their participation in this 
study, or an expected total of $200.  The investigators believe this is reasonable given that participation in 
the study constitutes [ADDRESS_870165] of the initial neurological consultation (visit 1) prior to surgery,  as 
well as the routine follow up within 6 months  after the surgery is considered part of routine clinical care, 
and will be billed to the patient’s insurance company.   Furthermore the cost of epi[INVESTIGATOR_58741], including 
subcortical grid implantation, and functional mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], is considered part of routine clinical care. There will 
be no cost of participation to the patient.

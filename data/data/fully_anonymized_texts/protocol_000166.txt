Protocol
Objectives
Overall objectives
One approach to decrease b urdensome end-of-life 
transitions and treatments for PWD is to engage 
family decision-makers and, when possible, PWD, in advance care planning (ACP) conversations. 
These discussions should be documented and summarize the persons values, preferences for care, and 
treatment decisions in ways that facilitate communication with care providers. ACP is particularly 
important in dementia given the progressive nature of the disease that leads to gradual and irreversible 
loss of decision-making capacity. As a result, family caregivers are often called upon to make a variety 
of decisions related to care.  Many PWD want to share in healthcare decision-making, but are often 
excluded from these conversations. Thus, resources to assist PWD and their family caregivers engage in 
ACP must use a shared decision-making approach that balances patient autonomy with declining 
capacity. Support for family caregivers also requires attention to the complexities of surrogate decision-
making including: 1) ensuring that surrogate decision-makers (SDMs) decisions are informed by [CONTACT_48677] 8 of 14incapacitated persons values and preferences; 2) supporting SDMs in the common situation in which 
they did 
not have conversations about end-of-life care when the PWD was cognitively intact; and 3) 
attending to the uncertain legal status of formal advance directives completed by [CONTACT_707461]. Given that 
most PWD receive either short- or long-term care in a nursing home (NH) as their disease advances 
(described more fully in the Overall Research Plan), NH admission represents a critical opportunity for 
goals of care conversations and documentation of care preferences. Indeed, when these discussions 
occur, and PWD and SDMs are supported in articulating goals, most choose less aggressive approaches 
to care. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_707451], the NH admission process 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_707452], although families of NH 
residents with advance dementia report that the most common care decisions they face involve feeding 
problems, infections and pain. Web-based ACP platforms facilitate completion of advance care plans, 
improve decision-making quality, and enhance shared decision making. However there are few studies 
that examine ACP in PWD, especially in the NH setting. Of the existing ACP platforms, most were 
developed for use with all older adults or those with advanced cancer or heart disease. Two recent 
randomized clinical trials examined the effects of dementia-specific ACP video decision aids; they 
showed increased rates of goals of care discussions and ACP completion. Although these results are 
promising, both investigative groups recommended integrating the decision aid into NH practice and 
more robust ACP programs. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_707453]. 
Moreover, the platform enables the development of written care plans that can be incorporated into the 
NHs electronic health record (EHR) and easily shared with caregivers and clinicians.
Background
The Our Care W ishes 
(OCW) platform has undergone extensive mixed-methods testing and is already 
in use by [CONTACT_707462]. OCW was rigorously developed and refined to optimize ACP 
completion rates. It has been tested among more than 3,000 patients. More than 70% of patients who 
have engaged with the platform have completed an ACP, and the sites Net Promotor Score, a standard 
measure that assesses the users likelihood to recommend a product or service, is 80%. The platform 
also has a back-end interface that enables care plans to be automatically uploaded into EHRs. It is being 
studied in an ongoing RCT of ACP for bone-marrow transplantation patients. These findings support the 
feasibility of having PWD and their caregivers complete OCW, as well as the need for further 
refinement of the content to meet the needs of PWD.
Study Design
Design
Our application is grounded in the Ecological Model of Patient Centered 
Communication. There is a 
growing body of research demonstrating that aligned and documented ACP communication is 
associated with better outcomes for PWD. Aim 1: Tailor the OCW platform. Several adaptations are 
needed to ensure that OCW: 1) specifically addresses end-of-life issues for PWD and their SDMs; 2) 
aligns with the legal requirements and ethical principles involved in surrogate decision-making; 3) 
addresses the needs of diverse users; and 4) integrates seamlessly with the PointClickCare EHR used by 
[CONTACT_707463]. To meet these goals, we will convene a stakeholder 
group of clinicians with expertise in NH and dementia care, PWD and their family caregivers, an 
ethicist, and an eldercare attorney. This group will advise us on content and the interface. The group 
will meet 7-[ADDRESS_961309] that the elements 
suggested for revision will include content regarding: 1) principles of shared decision-making; 2) the 
role of caregivers as SDMs; 3) the natural progression of dementia; 4) common end-of-life decisions; 
and 5) the benefits and burdens of interventions for PWD. Aim 2: Examine the user interface and 
acceptability of the OCW-Dementia platform.  To evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the 
platform, we will recruit up to 10 Genesis staff members (based on suggestion from Genesis 
management), and they will assent to comment on the platform and accompanying Qualtrics surveys. 
Study team members will interview Genesis staff on their reactions to the platform and surveys and take 
notes on the reactions. These interviews will take place virtually via BlueJeans and will not be recorded. 
Staff will not submit or discuss any identifiable information and will be instructed to not discuss any 
identifiable information of patients/residents of Genesis. The website and survey links will be emailed 
to Genesis staff and they will review the website and surveys prior to the interviews. At the beginning of 
the interview, study team members will confirm Genesis staff assent to participation and remind them 
Page [ADDRESS_961310] up 
to half an hour. T
o evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the platform, we will also recruit up to 
15 Healthy Patterns Sleep Study participants (IRB protocol # 825000) for virtual beta testing of the 
website. Participants will be selected if they have previously agreed to being contact[CONTACT_707464] a computer or smartphone on which to view the website and surveys. Participants will be 
recruited as dyads (caregiver and person with dementia). Dyads will consent to the study staff 
contact[CONTACT_707465]. Qualtrics surveys will be administered before and after the viewing of the website; 
surveys will ask dyads for their feedback on the website and their confidence making decisions about 
future care. Virtual beta testing platforms will depend on the participants' ability and resources, and may 
include telephone, Skype, FaceTime, or BlueJeans and any internet browsers. Study staff will take notes 
on the reactions of dyads in order to improve the website and user experience after beta testing. When 
filling out the surveys, no identifiable information will be collected. The calls and/or video chats will 
not be recorded. Each Healthy Patterns participant within each dyad will receive $[ADDRESS_961311] up 
to an hour. Some identifiable information (name, DOB, email address, phone number, address) will be 
entered in the website but will not be used or recorded in the study. The website is hosted by [CONTACT_707466], 
which is a Penn approved hosting platform. The site is encrypted with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to 
protect participant information. Aim 3: Randomized Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Setting/sample. We will conduct the pi[INVESTIGATOR_707454] (urban, suburban, rural). We will also 
include at least one facility that serves mostly minority populations to test the effectiveness of the 
OCW-Dementia module among racially and ethnically diverse PWD. We will recruit up to 50 patients/
residents and their SDMs. Eligible PWD will be receiving short-or long-term care at a participating NH, 
have documented moderate to severe cognitive impairment and have an identified SDM. We will 
exclude residents clearly exhibiting terminal decline, thereby [CONTACT_707467]. Study 
team members will work with Genesis staff to recruit dyads (Genesis residents and their family 
members or supportive decision-makers (SDMs) who are interested in participating in the study. Study 
team will read an assent script to interested SDMs, gain verbal assent and then send SDMs the study 
summary and copy of the assent script. After verbal assent is acquired, dyads will be assigned to the 
intervention group or usual care arm. At each site, up to [ADDRESS_961312] of 2020 and end by [CONTACT_471043] 2020. All study activities will end December 2020.

Genesis leaders to expand recruitment to additional facilities. There are 25 Genesis facilities within a 
25-mile radius of the Penns campus. For Aim 3, Study team members will work with Genesis staff to 
recruit dyads, ie. Genesis residents and their supportive decision-makers (SDMs) who are interested in 
participating in the study. Study team will read an assent script to interested SDMs, gain verbal assent 
and then send SDMs the study summary and copy of the assent script. After verbal assent is acquired, 
dyads will be randomized to the intervention group or usual care arm. At each site, up to [ADDRESS_961313] confidence in decision making surveys.
Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media avenues 
(examples include: Facebook, Twitter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does

Procedures
Aim 2: For participants 
recruited in the beta testing trial, study personnel will convene PWDs and their 
caregivers via video chart to administer the pre-survey and facilitate completion of OCW-Dementia. 
One week later, study personnel will call PWDs and caregivers to administer the post survey. 
Participants will be paid after completion of post survey. Aim 3: In the usual care arm, Genesis staff 
will follow their facilities standard admission policies, which include asking about the presence of 
advance directives, and offering assistance in completing an AD in accordance with state laws. Staff or 
study personnel will administer the pre-survey at the time of usual care and then administer the post 
survey and COVID-[ADDRESS_961315] survey and COVID-19 survey one week after website completion

Analysis Plan
We will 
use Z-tests to test our hypothesis that a significantly higher percentage of participants in the 
intervention group will complete an ACP compared with those in the usual care group. We adjust for 
participant characteristics due to the small sample size, but only the most important characteristics 
using likelihood ratio testing to avoid an overfit model. To generate new hypotheses, we will examine 
differences between groups with regard to demographic and clinical variables using parametric t-tests or 
nonparametric Wilcoxon tests (for continuous variables) and Fishers Exact tests for binary variables. To 
explore differences in Decisional Conflict scale scores, we will conduct a two-group independent T-test. 
Based on estimates derived from the Genesis EHR, we expect that 30% of PWD/SDM in the usual care 
arm will have a completed ACP within several weeks following admission to participating NHs. In the 
intervention arm, we estimate that 70% of SDMs/PWD will complete an ACP, as has been found among 
other OCW users (see Preliminary Studies). Enrolling 25 participants in each arm would yield 91.5% 
power to detect this difference of 70% vs. 30% ACP completion rate between the intervention and 
control groups. This calculation is based on a 1-sided Z-test with pooled variance and a significance 
level of 0.05.

Page 13 of 14Consent
1. Consent Process
Overview
Two 
groups of individuals will be participants in this research study, i.e. primary participants - Persons 
with Dementia (PWD) and their surrogate decision-maker (SDM) or caregivers.  For Aim 2, Genesis 
staff will verbally assent to participating in a discussion with the study team and providing feedback on 
the platform and surveys. Healthy Patterns Sleep Study dyads will verbally agree to take the surveys 
and tell the study team about their experience with the website. Dyads will also document consent by 
[CONTACT_18943] a box on each survey that states that by [CONTACT_136251], they demonstrate their full consent to 
participation. For Aim 3, With help from Genesis staff, study team members will recruit dyads, ie 
Genesis residents and their supportive decision-makers (SDMs) who are interested in participating in 
the study. After expressing interest, study team members will call SDMs of residents to read a Penn 
approved assent script and answer questions about the details of the study. After verbal assent is 
confirmed, SDMs will receive a copy of the assent script and study summary. Consent will be 
documented at the time of survey administration. Prior to answering survey questions in Qualtrics, 
dyads will check a box next to language that states, by [CONTACT_707470], you demonstrate your full 
consent to participation. Consent will be documented at administration of both pre and post surv eys.
Risk / Benefit
Potential Study Risks
You may 
become uneasy or tired during the assessment process. You may become slightly agitated with 
a stranger. While this rarely occurs, the study staff is trained to handle these minor discomforts. The 
study staff members are also trained to detect impending frustration or agitation before it becomes a 
problem. They will know when to stop the assessment or activity before a person becomes upset. There 
is the possibility that taking part in the study will not affect agitation or that agitated behaviors may 
become worse. You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions, or you are completing 
questionnaires. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer. Information 
obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential as much as possible.
Potential Study Benefits
There is no benefit to you. Howev
er, your participation could help us understand participant reactions to 
the Our Care Wishes Dementia website, which can benefit you indirectly. In the future, this may help 
other people capture their medical care preferences.  Will I receive the results of research testing? Most 
tests done in research studies are only for research and have no clear meaning for participants. Research 
results will not be returned to you because they will only be used for Our Care Wishes Dementia 
website development.  What other choices do I have?  Your alternative to being in the study is to not be 
in the study.  What happens if I do not choose to join the research study?  You may choose to join the 
study, or you may choose not to join the study. Your participation is voluntary.  There is no penalty if 
you choose not to join the research study. You will lose no benefits or advantages that are now coming 
to you, or would come to you in the future. Your therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], social worker, nurse, or doctor will not be 
upset with your decision.  If you are currently receiving services and you choose not to volunteer in the 
research study, your services will continue.   When is the study over? Can I leave the study before it 
ends?  The study is expected to end after all the information has been collected. The study may be 
stopped without your consent for the following reasons:  o The PI [INVESTIGATOR_707457]/or

Page 11PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rational e:
Transthy retin am yloid disease is a rare and fatal condition characterized by [CONTACT_498477] (a plasma protein) in various organs and tissues. 
Deposition of TTR amy loid is associated with twodistinct clinical prese ntations: 
transthy retin familial amy loid poly neuropathy  (TTR -FAP) when the peripheral nerves are 
primarily  affected and transthy retin am yloid cardiomy opath y (TTR -CM) when the heart is 
primarily  affected. Both TTR - FAP and TTR-CM are associated with geneti c variants of 
transthy retin but TTR -CM may  also occur in the absence of an y genetic mutation and may  be 
due to wild- type TTR amy loid deposition.  At this time, w ith the exception of the approval of 
tafamidis for TTR -FAP in the European Union (EU) and Japan
, there are no approved 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_498421].
TTR -CM occurs when TTR amy loid fibrils infiltrate the m yocardium, leading to deposits of 
extracellular amyloid. Deposition of transthy retin fibrils occurs between the myocardial cells 
and pro duces a thickening and stiffening of the my ocardial tissue. This infiltration of the 
myocardium results in diastolic dy sfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomy opath y, 
congestive heart failure, and ultimately death .
[COMPANY_007] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_498422], an oral small molecule, for the treatment of transthy retin 
amyloid diseases.  Ithas been demonstrated to bind selectivel y to TTR in human blood and 
slow fibril formation in vitro ( Razavi 2003 ).40  It binds to the 2thyroxine binding sites with 
negative cooperativity
, exhibiting dissociation constants of 2 nM [Kd1] and 154 nM [Kd2] 
(DeVit 2006)11and kinetically  stabilizing the TTR tetramer when bound (Sekijima 2009).46
TTR stabilization has been hypothesized to lead to slowing or halting of disease progression.  
This hy pothesis was confirmed in a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 18 -month study  in 
subjects with TTR -FAP, in whic h those subjects receiving tafamidis had better neurologic 
outcomes compared with those receiving placebo. In order to improve the understanding of 
the natural history  of TTR -CM, a longitudinal, observational clinical stud y of 29 subjects 
with either the 
V122I genetic variant (11subjects) or wild- type (18 subjects) associated 
TTR -CM (Transth yretin Amyloid Cardiac Study; TRACS) was undertaken.  A follow -up 
Phase 2 open- label interventional study  (Study  Fx1B -201) demonstrated TTR stabilization in 
subjects w ith V122I and wild -type TTR -CMandan acceptable safet y profile following 
[ADDRESS_641125] of tafamidis on the corrected QT (QTc) 
interval inhealth y volunteers.  The primary  objective was to characterize the effect of a 
supra -
therapeutic tafamidis concentration (~20 μ g/mL ) on the QTc interval relative to 
placebo in healthy  volunteers.  A supra -therapeutic, single, [ADDRESS_641126] increases in the QTc interval .

Page 12Objectives and Endpoints :
The objective of this study  is to deter mine the efficacy , safety, and tolerability  of tafamidis in 
subjects with transthy retin cardiom yopath y
The primary  objective is to assess the efficacy , safety , and tolerability  of an oral dose of 
20mg or [ADDRESS_641127] of care, for 30 months in subjects diagnosed with either a 
TTR variant or wild- type TTR -CM.  The study  is designed to assess the potential for benefit 
from treatment with tafamidis relative to placebo based on all -cause mortality  and frequency
of cardiovascular -
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (including heart failure, arrh ythmia, my ocardial 
infarction, and stroke as well as other cardiovascular -related events) .
Primary  Anal ysis:
The primary  anal ysis uses a hierarchical combination apply ing the method of 
Finkelstein -Schoenfeld (Finkelstein 1999)16toall-cause mortality  and frequency of 
cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ,which is defined as the number o f times a subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (ie, admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for cardiovascular
-related morbidity.
Secondary  Endpoints:
Analy sis of the following k ey secondary  endpoints will follow an alpha conserving strateg y:
1. Change from Baseline to Month [ADDRESS_641128] (6MWT) (Appendix 4).
2.Change from Baseline to Month 30 on the Kansas City  Cardiomy opathy  
Questionnaire Overall Summary  s
core (KCCQ- OS)(Appendix 1.1).
The following additional secondary  endpoints will be anal yzed without a n alpha conserving 
strateg y for multiple comparisons
:
1.Cardiovascular -related mortality ,
2.Frequency  of cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,
3. All- cause mortalit y,
4.TTR Stabilization at Month 1.
Study  Design:
This is an international, multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, 3- arm 
study  with a 30- month treatment phase wherein subjects with transthy retin cardiom yopath y, 
due to either variant or wild -type TTR, will receive eithe r 20 mg (n= 80) or 80mg (n = 160) 
tafamidis or matching placebo (n = 160) once daily , in addition to standard of care .  The 

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine

daily  for subjects who experience adverse events that may  be associated with the tolerability  
of treatment with tafamidis .
Selection of S ubjects:
Subjects that will be included into the protocol must meet specific inclusion criteria that 
include but is not limited to the following :
1. A medical histo ry of Heart Failure (HF) with at least 1 prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498423] (without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) manifested b y signs or s ymptoms of 
volume overload or elevated intracardiac pressures (eg,elevated jugular venous 
pressure, shortness of breath or signs of pulmonary  congestion on x- ray or 
auscultation, p eripheral edema) that required/requires treatment with a diuretic for 
improvement .
2. E vidence of cardiac amyloid by [CONTACT_422878] y with an end -diastolic 
interventricular septal wall th ickness > 12 mm .
3. P resence of am yloid deposits in biopsy  tissue and TTR precursor protein

3. U se of certain non- steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs ( NSAIDs ), see Section 5.8.1 .
4. M odified Body  Mass Index (m BMI )below 600.
Study  Treatment:
Investigators will confirm the eligibility  of each subject to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.
An Interactive Response Technolog y (IRT)system will assign a unique subject identification 
number sequentiall y to each subject who has signed the informed consent document (ICD).  
This identify ing number will be retained throughout the duration of study  participation.
Subject eligibility  for partic ipation in the treatment phase of the protocol will be determined 
following the assessments at the Screening and Baseline visits. Subjects will be screened for 
eligibility  and those who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria ,
will be randomized. There will be a treatment assignment stratif ication by [CONTACT_498478]-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine

Statistical Method :
Sample Size
The target sample size is 400 subjects.   Sample size estimation assumptions incl ude a n
all-cause mortality  rate of 12.5% for the tafamidis group and 25% for the
placebo group and 
1.5 cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498424] 
2.5cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498425] (Connors 2011).9  With a 
treatment duration of 30 months and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two -sided test), a
sample size of 
300 ( n=12 0for placebo , n=60 for 20 mg, and n=120 for 80mg) y ields a 
power over 90% (for the pri mary  comparison) , which assumes pooling of the tafamidis 
20mg and 80 mg dose groups .  An alternative assumption of 30% reduction in mortality  
(17.5 % for tafamidis and 25% for placebo) yields a power of approximately  80%.   Sample 
size estimation was perfo rmed based on simulations, given that no closed -form sample size 
estimation solution is available for the primary analy sis method.

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine
B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 15In this rare disease area, prior information on treatment response is limited.  A sample size of 
300 subjects would provide o ver 90% power with 50% treatment effect (reduction in 
mortality ).  That assumption is based on open- label, unc ontrolled data with tafamidis and 
represents a large effect in the area of cardiovascular studies.  Based on the uncertaint y of the 
assumptions du
e to limited data, the target sample size is 400 subjects
(n=160 for placebo, n=80 for 20 mg, and n=160 for 80 mg) .
Analy sis Populations
The intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis set will include all subjects in the safet y population who 
had at least [ADDRESS_641130]-B aseline efficacy  evaluation (ie, post -Baseline hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study  visit, 
or date of death). The per protocol (PP) anal ysis set will include all subjects in the I TT set 
who did not violate any  inclusion/exclusion criteria and who did not have protocol vio lations 
considered to impact the interpretation of the primary  efficacy  analysis. The safet y analysis 
set will include all subjects who are enrolled (randomized) and received at least 1 dose of 
double -
blind medication.
Primary  Efficacy  Anal ysis
The primar y anal ysis will be based on the ITT analy sis set and will combine the subjects in 
the tafamidis 20 mg and tafamidis 80mg group
s (including subjects in the [ADDRESS_641131] had a dose reduction to 40 mg) into one pooled group. This pooled group 
(tafamidis) will be compared with the placebo group using the Finkelstein -Schoenfeld 
method . The test is based on the principle that each subject in the clinical study  is compared 
to every  other subject within strata in a pair -wise hierarchical fashion usi ng all -cause
mortality  first, assigning a +1 to the “better” subject and a 
-1 to the “worse” subject. The 
stratified test statistic is based on the sum of these scores within strata.   The null hy pothesis 
for the primary  anal ysis is that neither all-cause mortality  nor frequency of 
cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498426]. The corresponding alternative hy pothesis is that at least one and possibly  
both all-cause mortalit y and frequency of cardio vascular -
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498427].

Page 251.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Indication
Tafamidis is a small molecule that has been demonstrated to stabilize transthy retin and is 
being developed for the treatment of TTR -CM.  Tafamidis has alread y been approved in the 
European Union for the treatment of Transthy retin Familial Amy loid Poly neuropathy  
(TTR -FAP) in adult patients with stage 1 sy mptomatic poly neuropathy .  It has also been 
approved in Japan b y the Ministry  of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to delay  the 
peripheral neurological impairment of transth yretin familial amyloid pol yneuropath y.
1.2.Background and Rationale
Amy loido sis is a severely  debilitating condition induced by  [CONTACT_498481], or amy loid, within the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair
normal function. Different precursor proteins have been associated with amy loid
ca
rdiom yopath y,including immunoglobulin light chains (associated with primary  or AL 
amyloidosis), serum am yloid A (associated with secondary or AA amyloidosis) and
transthy retin (TTR) representing the most common inherited am yloidosis. Transthy retin 
(also referred to as pre -albumin), a 127- amino acid, 55 kDa protein that is primarily  
synthesized in the liver, is a transport protein of thy roxine and retinol- binding protein-retinol 
(vitamin A) complex (Blake 1978 ,Monaco 1995).3,34  A mutation in TTR accelerates the 
process of fibrillogenesis whereb y the tetrameric structure of the TTR protein dissociates 
leading to amy loid deposition (Nilsson 1975 ,Saraiva 2001).36
,45  Dissociation of the TTR 
tetramer into monomers is the initial and rate
-limiting step in amy loidogenesis ( Nilsson 
1975, S araiva 2001 ).36,45
Transthy retin am yloidosis can present as either a hereditary  or an age -related disease. The 
major phenoty pic presentations of TTR amy loidosis include 
transthy retin familial amy loid 
polyneuropat hy (TTR -FAP), which can present with sensorimotor and autonomic
polyneuropathy  and transthy retin cardiom yopath y (TTR -CM), which can present in either a 
genetic variant or a wild -type form (the latter is also known as senile s ystemic amy loidosis or 
SSA).
More than [ADDRESS_641147] 22 mutations as well as wild- type protein are associated with 
transthy retin cardiomy opathy .  The V122I (valine replaced by  [CONTACT_498482] 12 2) 
mutation is the most common, with an estimated prevalence of 3.3% in the African American 
population (Buxbaum 2006)6with variable clinical penetrance of approximately 
30% (Jacobson 2011).30
In the elderl y, wild -type (normal) TTR may  become structurall y unstable and result in 
deposition of amy loid fibrils, primarily  in heart tissue, and may lead to diastolic dy sfunction, 
restrictive cardiom yopathy and heart failure (Pages 1973, Saraiva 2001, Hammarström 2002, 
Quintas 2001).45,25,38  The frequency of TTR am yloid deposition in cardiac ventricles 
reported from autops y studies in subjects >80 years of age range from 1.8% (Jacobson 
1997)29to 16.5% (Cornwell 1983)10, with a rate of clinical cardiac dis ease premortem of 
34% (Cornwell 1983).10

Page 26TTR -CM is a late onset disease with s ymptoms t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_498429] 60 years 
or older, though the L111M variant may  express TTR -CM in subjects at an earlier age.
Symptoms of TTR -CM are not mutation- type dependent andare typi[INVESTIGATOR_498430], and include d yspnea on exertion, orthostatic hy potension, and s yncope, as well as 
conduction abnormalities, including bundle branch block, atrioventric ular block, sinoatrial 
block, and atrial fibrillation.  Objective measures of cardiac involvement include abnormal 
electrocardiogram (ECG) with findings including low voltage, left and right ventricular wall 
thickening by  [CONTACT_6751] ,and elevated cardi ac biomarkers (Connors 2009).8  These 
findings are non -specific for heart failure, making the diagnosis of cardiac amy loidosis 
difficult and resulting in likely  under diagnosis of this condition (Falk 2011).15
Median survival from diagnosis for patients with TTR -CM was 
41months in a study  of the 
V122I mutation and median survival was reported as 46 months for wild- type (Connors 
2011).[ADDRESS_641148] patients with cardiac amy loidosis is from cardiac causes, including 
sudden death, heart failure, and m yocardial infarction (Kyle 1996, Smith 1984).31
,47
Except for s ymptom management , such as use of diuretics for s ymptoms of heart failure and 
pacemaker placement for cardiac arrh ythmias, the only  treatment option currently  available 
for TTR -CM patients is orthotopic liver transplant .  This may be combined with heart 
transplant, depending on organ availabilit y, patient capacit y to tolerate the combined 
transplant, and the severity  of cardiac am yloidosis at the time of transplant.  Transplantation 
of the liver removes the primary  production site of amy loidogenic mutant TTR protein and 
replaces it with the production of wild -type TTR ( Lewis 1994, Holmgren 19 93).33,27  The 
Familial Amy loidotic Polyneuropathy  World Transplant Registry  (FAPWTR) includes data 
on combined heart and liver transplant that indicates that this procedur e is relatively  
infrequent, documenting 6 cases out of 575 transplantations ( Herlenius 2004
).26  The mean 
age of those undergoing combined heart and liver transplant was older (58
5years) than 
those undergoing liver transplant alone (40 11years, p<0.001).
Tafamidis is an oral small molecule, under development by  [CONTACT_4618], as a disease modify
ing 
therapy for TTR am yloid diseases.  It binds to the thy roxine binding sites on the TTR 
tetramer, thereb y preventing destabilization into the monomeric form.  It has been 
demonstrated to bind selectivel y to TTR in human blood and slow fibril formation in vit ro 
(Razavi 2003).40  It binds to the 2 thy roxine binding sites with negative cooperativity , 
exhibiting dissociation constants of 2 nM [K d1] and 154 nM [K d2] (DeVit 2006)11and 
kinetically  stabilizing the TTR tetramer when bound (Sekijima 2009).[ADDRESS_641149] udy Fx-005, a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
18-month study  in subjects with TTR -FAP, in which those subjects receiving tafamidis had 
better neurologic outcomes compared with those receiving placebo.  In order to improve the 
understanding of the natural history  of TTR -CM, a longitudinal, observational clinical study  
of 29 subjects with either the V122I genetic variant (11 subjects) or wild -type (18 subjects) 
associated TTR -CM (Transthy retin Am yloid Cardiac Study ; TRACS) was undertaken.  A 
follow -up Phase 2 open- label interventional study  (Study  Fx1B -201) demonstrated TTR 

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine
B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 27stabilization in subjects with V122I  and wild -type TTR -CM, an acceptable safet y profile, and 
apparent stabilization of disease following 12 months of tafamidis 20 mg given once dail y 
compared with the unmatched historical control cohort (TRACS).  In study  Fx1B-201, 
tafamidis effectivel y stabilized TTR in 34 of 35 (97.1%) subjects, representing both 
wild-type and V122I, at Week 6, with approximately  88% stabilized throughout the 
12months of the study .  Of note, tafamidis has also been studied in TTR- FAP and effectivel y 
stabilized TTR in 98% of subjects as well as demonstrating effects relative to placebo on 
clinical measures (Coelho 2012).7
Study Fx-002 was a Phase 1 study  designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and 
pharmacokinetics of orally  administered tafamidis in healthy  male and female volunteers at 
single doses up to 120 mg and 3 multiple escalating doses (15, 30 and 60 mg) administe red 
as solution in comparison to placebo once dail y over 14 days .  Study  Fx1A -109 was a 
Phase 1 study  in healthy  volunteers designed to evaluate the cytochrome P450 induction 
potential of tafamidis 20 mg administered for 14 day s.  In Fx - 002, t he mean (stan dard 
deviation) Cmax value on Day  14 for the 60 mg solution was 4.40 (1.16) g/mL .  The mean 
(standard deviation) Cmax on Day  14 for the 20 mg capsule was 2.66 (0.55) g/mL in 
Fx1A -
109.
There were no dose -limiting safet y or tolerability issues 
noted during the Phase [ADDRESS_641150] been reported.
Study  B3461040 was
a Phase 1, randomized, double -blind, crossover, ascending dose 
escalation stud y to assess the safet y and pharmacokinetics of tafamidis doses greater than 
120 mg as oral solution in healthy subjects.  Single doses of tafamidis up to 480 mg were 
well tolerated in the study  population of healthy  adult Asian men.
The transth yretin (TTR) % stabilization data from Study  B3461040 ( Figure 1)suggest that a 
plateau is achieved as the molar ra tio of tafamidis: TTR plasma concentration (MR) 
increases.  Based upon the data available prior to conducting Study  B3461040, it was 
believed that exposures achieved following a tafamidis dose of 20 mg once daily  (QD) were 
sufficient to approach the TTR % stabilization plateau.  The data from Study  B3461040 
suggest that doses higher than [ADDRESS_641151] 
be assumed.  Mean TTR concentrations observed at Baseline in Study  Fx-005 (24.7 mg/dL ) 
and in patients with V122I  mutations in Study  Fx1B-201 (13.5 mg/dL ) and the Transthy retin 
Amy loid Cardiac Study  (TRACS) (14.9 mg/dL ) are assumed for the calculations that follow: 
a 20 mg QD tafamidis dose at stead y
state produces a mean MR in the range of 1.2 to 
3.2from mean minimum concentration at stead y state (C min,ss) to maximum concentration at 
steady  state (C max,ss), which is below the plateau region of the data depi[INVESTIGATOR_123614](Figure 1).

values of 3.5 to 9.6, which are approaching or on the plateau region of TTR % stabilization.

Based upon the TTR % stabilization data, tafamidis d oses of 20 and 80 mg will be used in
Study  B3461028.  The 20 mg dose will provide additional safety  and efficacy  data for that 
previously  studied dose in TTR -
FAP.  The 80 mg dose is approaching maximal TTR % 
stabilization, which has the potential for increased efficacy  over the [ADDRESS_641152] of tafamidis on the 
corrected 
QT (QTc) interval inhealthy volunteers.  The primary  objective was to characterize 
the effect of a supra -therapeutic tafamidis concentration (~20 μg/mL ) onQTc interval 
relative to placebo in healthy volunteers.   The primary  analysiswas to compare the 
time-matched mean differences in QTc interval using Fridericia’s correction method (QTcF) 
between tafamidis and placebo at each post
-dose time.  The secondary  ECG endp oint was to 
compare the mean difference in QTcF interval between moxifloxacin and placebo at the 
historical moxifloxacin median Tmax of [ADDRESS_641153] increases in Q Tcinterval .
TTR -CM is a rare disease with very  little available published information.  Based on th
is, the 
natural history  and disease progression of TTR -CM were prospectivel y evaluated in a 
non-interventional study  involving 29 subjects ( Transthy retin Amy loidosis Cardiac Study  
[TRACS] ; Study Fx-
001; Ruberg 2012 ).[ADDRESS_641154] s were elderl y (mean age approximately  76 y ears), with significant 
disease duration (approximately  8 years), and signs and sy mptoms of mild to moderate 
cardiac d ysfunction ( 94% with NYHA Class I or II) at the time of enrollment.  Age, sex, and 
age at TTR s ymptom onset were similar between the TRACS and Fx1B -
[ADDRESS_641155] s in the TRACS study  had an NYHA class of III or higher 
(7/29, 24.1%) than in Study  Fx1B -201 (2/35, 5.7%) at B aseline.
Following [ADDRESS_641156] of care, 
2/35 (5.7%) subject s died, 9/35 (25.7%) experienced at least one cardiovascular -related
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 9/35 (25.7%) experienced the composite endpoint of death or 
cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Results were similar between the TTR genoty pe 
groups.  A Kaplan -Meier analysis of survival from time of diagnosis for the study  
demonstrate dan approximately  87.5% survival rate at 30 months.  These data were 
numericall y better than that reported in the TRACS historical control cohort (which it should 
be noted was not a matched cohort and had greater disease severity  at Baseline) , during 
which the 12- month rate of death, cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498431]/ cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498432] 6/29 (20.7%), 10/29 (34.5%) and 
13/29 (44.8%), respectively .
Cardiac biomarkers (NT -proBNP, troponin I  and T) at Baseline were elevated i n study  
Fx1B -
201. The re were elevations in NT -proBNP over [ADDRESS_641157] (Appendix 4).  At 12 months, 75% of the subject s in Fx1B -[ADDRESS_641158] in distance walked ( mean change from B aseline 
of -11 meters).  This maintained functional walking capacity  is in contrast to the deterioration 
observed in TRACS at 12 months (mean change from B aseline of - 44 meters).

echocardiograph y parameters over time.  For the wild -type subject s, who were the majority  
of subject s in the study , the deterioration in ejection fraction ( -4.4%) and st roke volume 
(-1.9 mL) observed in the Fx1B -201 study  was less than that observed in TRACS 
(-11.3% and -9.0 mL, respectivel y) at [ADDRESS_641159] s that underwent cardiac MRI.  In these subjects in the Fx1B -201 study , there was a 
decrease in the percent of left ventricle (LV) mass with amy loid observed at 12
months, 
while there was an increase in L V mass with amy loid observed in TRACS.
Baseline electrocardiogram and 24- hour Holter monitoring demonstrated substa ntial 
conduction and rh ythm abnormalities, including bundle branch blocks and atrial 
fibrillation/flutter.  There were no clinically  relevant changes over time in these assessments, 
with perhaps slight improvement in cardiac autonomic function in study  Fx1B-201 as 
demonstrated b y improved heart rate variability indices.
Over the 12 months of tafamidis treatment in study  Fx1B
-201, quality  of life and functional 
status was maintained ,as assessed b y the Short Form -36, patient reported health survey  
(SF-
36), t he Kansas City  Cardiomy opath y Questionnaire ( KCCQ ) ,(Appendix 1.1)and the 
Patient Global Assessment ( PGA )
(Appendix 3).The majority  of these results were also 
better when compared with TRACS.
Seve
n subject s participat ed in both TRACS (median follow -up 12.5 months, with range of 
6-26 months) and Protocol Fx1B - 201. All seven subject s completed [ADDRESS_641160] of 
care in TRACS.  The rate of cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498433] 12-month periods, with some evidence of stabilized cardiac function (ejection fraction 
and fractional shortening) observed following treatment with tafamidis.
The ty pe and incidence of adverse events observed in study  Fx1B -[ADDRESS_641161] was diagnosed with primary  
(light chain) amyloid cardiomy opath y, a disease for which tafamidis is not designed to be 
effective, approximately  [ADDRESS_641162] frequent adverse events overall were related to sy mptoms and epi[INVESTIGATOR_498434] (d yspnea, cardiac failure and edema).
  Eighteen (51.4%) subject s reported at least one 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) that was considered at leas t possibly  related to 
study  medication .  The most common (>5%) treatment -related TEAEs included urinary  tract 
infection (20.5%), balance disorder (14.3%), ageusia (8.6%), constipation, diarrhea, edema 
peripheral, fall, weight increased, decreased appetite and d yspnea (5.7% each). The majorit y 
(≥85%) of subjects experienced TEAEs considered mild or moderate in severity .One 
adverse event ( AE)of hyperkalemia ,reported during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498435] ,was considered life -
threatening and not 
related to tafamidis.
In stud y Fx1B -201, a total of 15 (42.9%) subjects reported 41 treatment -emergent serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ), with the majority  cardiac in nature. Serious adverse events reported 
by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_641163] included cardiac failure congestive ( reported in 9 patients ), atrial 
fibrillation and fall (3 subjects each), cardiac failure, s yncope (2 subjects each). The reasons 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498436], aga in primarily  cardiac in 
nature (eg, worsening congestive heart failure ).
Renal function was abnormal overall at Baseline, and suggestive of pre- renal azotemia with 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) elevated to a greater degree than creatinine.  BUN remained 
stable in subjects with wild- type disease but there was evidence of progressive worsening in 
the four African- American subjects with V122I.  NT -proBNP and troponin I  and T were 
elevated at Baseline, but remained stable through [ADDRESS_641164] population, but change in these functions over time. This current 
interventional study  is designed to evaluate whether stabilization of TTR by  [CONTACT_498483] -CM.

medication and dosing regimen.
1.2.2. Dose Rationale
This protocol will employ  tafamidis meglumine at20 mg and [ADDRESS_641165] observed with naturally  occurring protective trans -suppressor 
variants.  It is hy pothesized that tafamidis would stop or slow the pro gression of TTR -CM
and therefore represent a disease modify ing therapy .
Complete information for this compound may  be found in the Single Reference Safet y 
Document (SRSD) , which for this study  is the Investigator Brochure (IB).
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOIN TS
2.1.Objectives
The primary  objective of this study  is to assess the efficacy  of an oral dose of [ADDRESS_641166] of care, for 30 months in subjects diagnosed with variant or wild -type TTR 
cardiom yopath y (TTR -CM).
2.2.Endpoints
This protocol w ill use an independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) to determine 
whether certain investigator- reported events meet the definition of disease -related efficacy  
endpoints, using pre- defined endpoint criteria thereby [CONTACT_498484] .  Sites will submit a Serious Adverse Event notification for all deaths and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], as outlined in Section 8.14.[ADDRESS_641167] y with regulatory  and 
industry  standards .  In the event there is insufficient information for the adjudication process 
to classify  either a mortality  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498437], then the event will be classified as “indeterminate”.  In the adjudication process, 
cases with at least some information indicating a contributory  cardiovascular cau se, including 
ambiguous cases, will be adjudicated to the cardiovascular- related category.  Details of the 
actions and responsibilities of the EAC can be found in the EAC Charter and EAC 
Guidelines ,the latter of which have been incorporated into the EAC C harter .

Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed 
with adverse event reporting as well as the conduct of 
ECGs, clinical laborator y testing, vital signs, and physical examinations.
3.STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, international, three -arm, parallel design, placebo -controlled, 
randomized study
 with a 30- month double -blind treatment phase, to determine efficacy ,
safet y and tolerability of tafamidis on clinical outcomes in subjects with either transth yretin 
genetic variants or wild -type transthy retin resulting in amy loid cardiomy opathy  (TTR -CM).
There will be approximately  400 subjects enrolled in thestudy in a 2:1:2 ratio 
(placebo:20 mg: 80mg).  The subjects will be allocated to the 3 arms of the study  in the 
following manner: n=160 in the placebo arm , n=80in the 20 mg arm, and n=[ADDRESS_641171] the option of 
blinded treatment re -assignment and potential dose reduction (seeSection 5.5). Subjects will 
be stratified 
during enrollment by  [CONTACT_498485] (variant and wild- type) and structured such 
that greater than 30% of randomized subjects have a TTR mutation and greater than 30% of 
subjects have a diagnosis of wild
-type TTR cardiomy opath y, with the intent to enroll
comparable numbers between the variant and wild -typegroups
.  
Enrollment may  be closed for either wild- type or variant stratum in order to enroll at least 
30% of subjects with each TTR genoty pe (wild
-type and variant ).
Additionally , stratification to treatment assignment will be done for B aseline severit y of 
disease based on NYHA classification (NYHA Class I
and NYHA Classes IIand III
combined )
.  Stratification will be implemented in order to maintain a balance of both TTR 
genoty pe and disease severity  across the treatment assignments. The site will ensure a 
Month [ADDRESS_641172] ’s vital status and whether the subject 
has had a heart and / or liver transplant or implantation of cardiac mechanical a ssist d evice .  
Upon completion of the study  at the Month 30 visit, subjects may  be eligible for -treatment 
with tafamidis in a separate extension study (B3461045) , which will permit the collection of 
additional safet y and efficacy  data , and may  include the assessment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
mortality ,
and other outcomes relating to disease progression.  For the purpose of this study , 
30 mont hs is defined as 910 days.  
Eligibility  for the extension study  (B3461045) requires 
subject participation in this study  at least through Day  896 (Month 30 minus 2 weeks).

PF-[ADDRESS_641173] eligibility  should be reviewed and documented by  [CONTACT_36534] y qualified member

4.3.Life Style Guid elines
4.3.1. Contraception
In this stud y, fertile male subjects and female subjects who are of childbearing potential will 
receive tafamidis, which has been associated with teratogenic risk.  Subjects who are, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexuall y active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) 
must agree to use [ADDRESS_641180] and his/her partner (s)from the list of 
permitted contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been 
instructed in their consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use [ADDRESS_641181]’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart.   In addition, the investigator or designee 
will instruct the subject to call immediately  if 
[ADDRESS_641182] or partner .
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include
the following:
1.Established use o f hor monal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) ,provided the subject or 
male subject’s partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire 
study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time 
to ensure effectiveness,
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD) ,
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie,foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate ,
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate ,
5.Bilateral tubal ligation /bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y
or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label) .
4.4.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
trial is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_74071]’s manual.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study  number, 
contact [CONTACT_498489] a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subjects 
participation in the study .  The help desk number can also be used by  [CONTACT_293067], however it should only  be used in 
the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and 

PF-[ADDRESS_641183] to meet inclusion/ exclusion criteria. 
An Interactive Response Technolog y (IRT) system will assign a unique subject identification 
number sequentiall y to each subject who has signed the informed consent document (ICD).  
This identify ing number will be retained throughout th e duration of the study  participation.
Subject eligibility  for participation in the treatment phase of the protocol will be determined 
following the assessments during the Screening period and at the Baseline ( Day 1)visit.
Subjects will be screened for e ligibility  and those ,
in the judgment of the investigator, who 
meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria ,will be randomized .There 
will be a treatment assignment stratifi cation by [CONTACT_498490] (variant or wild -type) as well 
as by[CONTACT_498479] (NYHA Class Iand NYHA Classes IIand IIIcombined ).Subjects 
will be assigned to blinded treatment with either tafamidis [ADDRESS_641184] of care (eg, diuretics) for 30 months . Other than 
Week 2, Month 1and Month 3
, study  visit s willbe at 3 -month intervals (Month 6, 9, 12, 
etc.).  Subjects must return for their appointment before their blinded study  drug supply  is 
exhausted.  Subjects must bring all of their study  medication walle ts and their Subject Dail y 
Dosing Diary to each appointment.  The site will collect all 
study  medication wallets
dispensed at the previous visit and dispense a new set of study  medication wallets and a 
Subject Daily  Dosing Diary to the subject.
5.2.Breaking th e Blind
The reason for breaking the blind for an individual subject may  include the following:
1. A serious, unexpected/unlisted, treatment- related event for reasons of subject safet y.
2.An urgent safet y measure taken b y the investigator or [COMPANY_007] to protect su bjects 
against immediate hazard to health.
3.A potentially  life threatening drug interaction.
4.Ethical considerations such as a medical emergency  where understanding the 
treatment allocation is necessary  to adequately manage the subject’s condition.  I n 
this case, an attempt should be made to contact [CONTACT_498491].

Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 42Whenever possible, the investigator or sub- investigator should consult with a member of the 
study  team ( eg, the clinical trial manager or the monitor) prior to breaking the blind for an 
individual subject.  After reviewing and approving the investigator’s request, the study  
clinician will provide written authorization (email) to the investigator to break the blind.
If unable to contact a member of the stud y team, the investigator may  break the blind for a 
given subject experiencing an SAE or other medical emergency  where knowledge of the 
treatment assignment will affect treatment decisions.
Breaking the blind will be done electronicall y and instructions will b e given at a training 
session for the protocol.
5.3.Dosing Adherence
Subjects will be instructed to take the medication on a daily  basis.  They  will also be 
instructed to bring all of their study  medication back to the study  site, including used and 
unused st udy medication wallet s, at each scheduled study  visit so that the total amount of 
drug taken can be determined and unused medication collected b y site personnel.  S tudy drug 
capsule count will be performed at each scheduled visit for all subjects or as per local 
regulations.  The need for adherence with study  drug administration will be reinforced at 
each stud y visit.
For the purpose of promoting dosing adherence, the sites will calculate the number of days 
dosed divided by  [CONTACT_28991] s participating in the study  for each study  visit to provide 
a measure of treatment adherence .  As part of study  data anal ysis, subjects will be considered 
to be adherent to the dosing requirements of the study  if they  have taken [ADDRESS_641185] 80% of the day s of study  participation.  Subjects with less than 
80% dosing adherence will be excluded from the per protocol anal ysis set.
Subjects will be randomized to blinded therapy  with either [ADDRESS_641186] of either 3 capsules of blinded placebo and 1 capsule of blinded tafamidis 20 mg, 
4 capsules of blinded tafamidis 20 mg, or 4 capsules of blinded placebo.

5.5.Administration
Subjects will be instructed to take 4capsules per day  from an individual row on the 
dispensed study  medication wallet and to take the capsules with a glass of water.  Subjects 
will swallow the study  medication whole, and wi ll not manipulate or chew the medication 
prior to swallowing. Subjects will be instructed to dose at a consistent time of day . Subjects 
will be instructed to start taking their medication each day  in the morning (AM dosing) ; 
however, it is permitted for subjects to take his/her medication in the PM prior to a clinic 
visit when the timing of pharmacokinetic ( PK)sample collection is prohibitive for adherence 
with AM dosing
.  Subjects should not take an extra dose of medication in the event that a 
dose from a previous day is missed and should resume dosing [ADDRESS_641187] 
Daily  Dosing Diary , when to take their medication prior to their next study  visit . This is 
especiall y important if the next visit has a collection of blood sample (s)for PK analy sis.  
Knowing the actual time of dosing is essential for appropriat e anal ysisof samples for TTR 
stabilization ,TTR and oligomer concentration ,andfortafamidis pharmacokinetic 
measurements ,as required and specified in Section 7.7.[ADDRESS_641188] this dosing time in the case repor t 
form (CRF).  On specified study  days (Months 1, 18, and 24), subjects will take their 
medication during the clinic visit andsubjects will be reminded to not take their daily  dose 
on those day s until instructed by  [CONTACT_96937] .
Subjects should be instruc ted not to take more than [ADDRESS_641189] 7 hours (± 2.5 hours) prior to the timing of PK sample.  On the day  prior to Month 
6 and Month 12 visits, subjects are permitted to take their usual AM dose and then take the 
next day ’s dose in the PM if necessary  to adhere to the PK sampling schedule.  
In the event that subjects experience adverse events that may  be associated with the
tolerability  of treatment with tafamidis that may  impact dosing adherence ,they should return 
to the clinic with their medication.   If the investigator assesses that the tolerability  issue is 
persistent and anticipated to impact dosing adherence and that the subj ect’s safet y is not 
compromised by  [CONTACT_43893], then the subject may receive 
blinded treatment 
re-assignment and potential dose reduction .
Prior to 
blinded dose reduction, the site should collect a PK sample, noting the actual time of 
last dosing and the actual time of PK sample collection.   The site personnel will enter the 
subject’s 
study -specific identification ( SSID)number into the I RT sy stem and request 
blinded dose reduction .  The I RT sy stem will provide a new container number for blinded 
treatment re -assignment for this subject.  If the subject was receiving the 80mg dose, then 
the re -assignment will be to 
[ADDRESS_641190] ’s vital 
status / transplant status 
[ADDRESS_641191] should be stored at controlled room temperature 15 -
25° C (59 -77° F). 
Investigational product sshould be stored in their original container and in accordance with 
the label .

PF-[ADDRESS_641192] be capable of measuring and documenting ( for examp le,via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature prod ucts).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure which ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available .  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to co
nfirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they aremaintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery . The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to thestorage 
conditions described in the labeling , as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007] .
Once an e xcursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational prod uct after the 
temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation.  Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home 
investigational product
.
5.7. Drug Accountability
At each scheduled clinic visits starting at Month 1; subjects will bring their Subject Daily 
Dosing Diary and their study  medication wallets with them to the site.  Beginning at the 
Month [ADDRESS_641193] any  unused medicine, determine dosages taken, and 
store returned drug for disp osition.  See Section 5.3 for documentation of dosing adherence.
The investigator’s site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the drug supp liesas outlined in the in the monitoring plan .
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site) .

PF-[ADDRESS_641194] (eg, at the site ).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental reg ulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618], and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.8.Concomitant Treatments
Medications taken within [ADDRESS_641195] dose of trial medication will be 
documented as concomitant medications.
Concomitant Treatment is defined as ongoing or initiated at any  time on or after Baseline 
(Day  1)of the study  through the final stud y visit. Concomitant treatments include an y 
substance ingested, injected, absorbed, inhaled, or otherwise enters the body  for a t herapeutic
purpose regardless of number of doses taken. This includes prescription and 
over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal remedies.
Subjects may  use supplements and medications during the course of the study  with the 
exception of those listed in Section 4.[ADDRESS_641196] of Care: Medications indicated as standard of care should be stabilized for at least 
4weeks of therap y (other than diuretics) prior to Baseline.
Changes in diuretic dose are permitted within 4 weeks of the Baseline visit
.
5.8.1. Contraindicated Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_498441].  Some NSAI Ds, like diflunisal,
can bind to the thy roxine binding sites on transthyretin (Almeida 2004 ).[ADDRESS_641197] 30 day sprior to theBaseline visit (Day  1).Permitted 
NSAIDs include: acet ylsalicy lic acid, etodolac, ibuprofen, indometha cin, ketoprofen, 
nabumetone, naproxen, nimesulide, pi[INVESTIGATOR_18234], and sulindac.  Use of an y other NSAIDS 
requires agreement with the Sponsor’s clinician or medical monitor.
1.Use of an y investigational therap y during the study is not permitted.
2.Use of difl unisal 
or an yother investigational therapy  during the study  is prohibited .
The presence of diflunisal in the blood will be measured at Screening and at various 
times throughout the study in order to document whether the subjects are taking a 
contraindica ted medication so that they  can be appropriatel y counselled . Such 
subjects will be handled as protocol violators in the anal ysis as described in the 
Statistical Analy sis Plan.
3.Additionally , the use of tauroursodeox ycholate and doxy cycline is not permitted .

6.STUDY PROCEDURES
Every  effort should be made to ensure that scheduled v isits are completed according to the 
Schedule of Activities onthe prescribed day s and protocol required tests and procedur es are 
completed as described.  From time to time there may  be circumstances, such as a c onstraint 
on travel for health -
related reasons, that a clinic visit may not be possible .  In these cases, 
with prior discussion and approval from the sponsor, alternative options for completing the 
visit may be considered.  Additionally , visits should be c ompleted as close to the scheduled 
timeframe as possible but not to exceed 1week of the target date for the Month 1 visit and
2 weeks of the 
target dates for subsequent visits.  
The duration of this study is 30 months.  Follow -up visit dates should be based on the date of 
the Baseline visit, not the date of the previous follow- up visit.  I f the Baseline visit ,for 
example, is on the 15thof the month, the Month 1 visit is to be scheduled on the 15thof the 
next month 1 week ).  The Month 3 visit is to be scheduled on the 15thof the 3rdmonth from 
the Baseline visit 2 week s).
The Month 30 visit is to be scheduled 910 day s following the Baseline visit ( 2 week s),and 
can be determined b y the use of the Visit Calculator , located in Firecrest .
6.1.Screenin gPeriod
The following evaluations will be performed and laboratory  samples collected for all subjects 
during the S creening P eriod prior to starting drug (eg,Day -45to Day  -10).  If tests cannot be 
performed ,if tests need to be repeated orif there are extenuating circumstances the 
Screening period may  be extended following written authorization fr om the study  clinician . 
The duration of the Screening extension will be no more than [ADDRESS_641199] does not confirm the abnormal value (ie,it is within the 
normal range), the investigator is required to again repeat the specific laboratory  test. If this 
further repeat test confirm s a value within the normal range, the last repeat ed normal value is 
entered into the database.   If the further repeat test value is abnormal, this value will be 
entered into the database and th e subject will be considered a Screen failure.
Written subject informed consent will be obtained prior to an y study -related procedures.

Page 64Additionally , except for subjects who are randomized into the extension study  (Study  
B3461045), subjects will have a 4 -week (28 calendar day s) safet y follow -up visit after the 
last dose of the study  medication for collection of adverse events.  This visit can be 
completed b y telephone.
6.2.14. Dialysis or Hemofiltration Treatments and Tafamidis Concentrations
Should a subject require dialy sis or hemofiltration at an y time after randomizati on while on 
study  treatment, the subject should have blood samples collected for tafamidis concentrations 
around the time of renal replacement therap y.  The timing of the sample collection will 
depend on the t ype of renal replacement therap y administered. For hemodialy sis or 
hemofiltration, samples should be collected on the date of the renal replacement therap y both 
prior to administration and after administration.  When peritoneal dial ysis is administered, 
the first sample should be collected at initiati on of the first exchange.  The second sample 
should be collected after the first exchange is completed (if performed outside of the home) 
or at least [ADDRESS_641214] exchange (if administered at home).  Every 
effort should be mad e to collect these samples on the date of the subject’s first administration 
of renal replacement therapy  in the study ; however, if this is not possible, the samples should 
be obtained as soon as possible on the date of a renal replacement therap y treatmen t.  If 
necessary , the sample collection can be obtained using the guidelines for lab sample 
collection in the Guidance for Remotel y Conducted Study  Visits provided for the study . At 
the time of sample collection, the date and time of the last dose and the date and time of 
sample collection must be recorded.
6.3.Subject Withdrawal and Vital Status / Transplant /Cardiac Mechanical A ssist 
Device Status Follow -up
Subjects may  withdraw from 
the study  at an y time at their own request, or they may  be 
withdrawn at an ytime at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety  or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol required schedule of stud y 
visits or procedures at a given study  site.
Due to the inclusion of all-cause mortalit y inthe primary  anal ysis, a Release of Medical 
Information Form will be required of all subjects for the purpose of access to medical records 
as well as for obtaining vital status / transplant /cardiac mechanical a ssist d evice status 
follow -
up with the subject’s primary  physician or with death registries. The signing of this 
Release of Medical Information Form is in addition to the Informed Consent Document.  In 
some cases, sites may combine these two forms into a single form, as is their standard 
practice.
In the situation where the subject or the alternative designated contact (ie, individual 
identified in the Release of Medical Information Form) cannotbe reached, attempts will be 
made to ascertain the vital status / transplant /cardiac mechanic al assist d evice status of the 
subject by [CONTACT_498493], where available and allowable b y local law. Depending on the local law, this 
search will be conducted by  [CONTACT_498494] ,his/her designee at the study  site.

PF-[ADDRESS_641215]’s vital status / transplant /cardiac mechanical a ssist d evice status 
thro
ugh [ADDRESS_641216] return for a final study  visit (if applicable) and 
return all unused investigati onal product(s), and follow -
up with the s ubject regarding an y 
unresolved adverse events (AEs).
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected, except f or ascertaining vital status / transplant /cardiac mechanical a ssist d evice
status 
at [ADDRESS_641217]’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, 
the site should document and sign the 
reason for the subject ’s failure to withdraw consent in 
writing.
6.3.1. Subject Withdraw al for Heart or Liver Transplant ation or Implantation of 
Cardiac Mechanical Assist Device
Subjects may  be on a transplant list at the time of randomization.  However, i f a subject 
chooses to accept a donor organ transplant during the study or undergoes implantation of a 
cardiac mechanical assist device , they  will stop taking blinded study  medication and be 
discontinued from study  participation prior to the transplant operation .  Vital status / 
trans plant status 
for the subject will be established through 30 months (910 day s) following 
the Baseline visit
.  Subjects who discontinue from the study  due to transplantation or 
implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device will be handled in the statist ical analy sis 
as described in 
Section 9.2.1.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However
,it is antici pated, that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform assessments as planned . In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary  
to ensure the safet y and well-being of the subject.  When a protocol required assessment 
cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any  corrective 
and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure th at normal processes are adhered to,
as soon as possible.  The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine
B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 66All visits will be scheduled from the Baseline visit on Day 1, so that study  participation will 
befor 30 months.  In the event that an actual clinic visit day  differs from the scheduled clinic 
visit day , the next visit will be scheduled according to the original timing relative to Baseline 
so that the study  schedule is maintained.
7.1.
Biopsy Documentation of Amyloid Deposition
In the event that there is no documentation of prio r biopsy  and demonstration of TTR 
amyloid deposition by [CONTACT_5640] m ass spectrometry , immunohistochemistry  or scintigraphy [See 
Section 4.1], c ardiac or non -cardiac tissue will be biopsied and test ed by [CONTACT_498495]’s standard of care and evaluated with 
Congo red stain or alcian blue stain. 
Stained tissue will be viewed under polarized light used to demonstrate amy loid 
characteristic ‘apple -green’ birefringence.  For subjects without identification of a TTR 
variant and demonstr ation of amyloid deposition who may  have a diagnosis of wild -type 
TTR -CM (SSA), analy sis will be performed to confirm the pre cursor protein basis for 
amyloid deposition, by  [CONTACT_5640] : mass spectrometr y, immunohistochemistry  or scintigraph y
[
see Section 4.1].
7.2.TTR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_498443] a documented prior genot
ypi[INVESTIGATOR_498444].  Subjects without prior 
genoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_498445] a blood sample forTTR genot ype testing .  The sample 
will be sent to a reference laboratory  for complete genomic sequencing.
Complete information on sample colle ction, storage, and sample transport for genoty pe
confirmation aredetailed in a separate l aboratory  
manual.
7.3. Renal Function Assessment
Renal function will be assessed using the modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD )equation for estimated gl omerular filtration rate (eGFR).
eGFR (mL /min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (S cr)-1.154x (Age)-0.203x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if 
African -American) [ from http://nkdep.nih.gov/lab-evaluation/gfr/estimating.shtml ].
7.4. Modified Body Mass Index
Transthy retin, in the monomeric form, can enter cardiac and neural tissues.  As part of the 
polyneuropathy , TTR can cause severe gastrointestinal problems resulting in wasting.  A 
means of determining if there is gastrointestinal involvement in subjects is to calculate their 
mBMI .  Body  Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight (kg) / [height (meters)]2.  The 
mBMI  is calculated by  [CONTACT_498496] (g/L ).

7.5.1. M arkers of Drug Response
Variation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may  help to explain some of the 
variability  in response seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred to 
as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research.  Comparing the DNA, RNA, protein, and 
metabolite variation patterns of subjects who respond well and those who respond poorly  to 
treatment may  help to better define the most appropriate group of patients in which to target a 
given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for exploratory  pharmacogenomic/biomarker 
analyses and retaining them in the Pfi
zer BioBank makes it possible to better understand the 
drug’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, 
exposure, efficacy , tolerability , or safet y not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study.  
Providing these bi ospecimens is a required stud y activity  for study  sites and subjects, unless 
prohibited as such b y local regulations or ethics committee decision.
To protect subjects’ confidentiality , the banked biospecimens and data generated from them 
will be coded with the subject’s study  ID number.  Samples will be kept in a facilit y 
accessible only  by [CONTACT_195152] -swipe.  Data will be stored on password -protected computer 
systems.  The key  between the code and the subject’s personal identifiers will be held at the 
study  site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not 
have access to the key  nor any  personally  identify ing information.  Biospecimens will only  
be used for the purposes described here and in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet; an y other uses require additional ethical approval.  Unless a time 
limitation is required by  [CONTACT_240846], biospecimens will be 
stored indefinitely to allow for future research on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_498446], in cluding 
research conducted during the lengthy drug development process and also post -marketing 
research.  Subjects can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at an y time 
by [CONTACT_7328] a request to the investigator, in which event any  remainin g biospecimen will be 
destroy ed; data already  generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect 
the integrity of existing analy ses.  It is very  unlikely  that results generated from the 
biospecimens will have any  clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual 
study  participants.  Subjects are notified in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet that their results will not be given to them, unless required by [CONTACT_147655], in which case results will be returned via the investigator.  Results will not be 
provided to family  members or other ph ysicians; nor will they  be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record.  There is no intention to contact [CONTACT_498497].
Ablood biospecimen Prep D1 (K 2EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA 
analysis) will be collected at the Baseline visit to be retained for potential 
pharmacogenomic/biomarker anal yses related to drug response, unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168039].  P utative safet y biomarkers, drug metabolizing 
enzy me genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism 
of drug action may  be examined.

Page 68The Banked Biospecimens will be collected from all subj ects unless prohibited by [CONTACT_168039].  Detailed collection, processing, storage and 
shipment instructions are provided in the central laboratory manual .
It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may  result in com mercially viable products.  
Subjects will be advised in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that 
they will not be compensated in this event.
7.5.2. Additional Research
Unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_427], subjects will be asked to indicate on a consent form 
whether they will allow the Banked Biospecimens to also be used for the following research:
Investigations of the disease under stud y in the clinical trial, and related conditions ,
Biospecimens may be used as controls.  This includes use in case -control studies of 
diseases for which [COMPANY_007] is researching drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; use in characterizing the 
natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, proteins, and metabolites; and use in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_498447]/biom arkers .
Subjects need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimen
s specified in Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_641218] reports associated with 
TTR -CM, as well as an y additional co -morbid conditions or sy mptoms.   Medical history  will 
be updated at the Baseline visit for changes since the Screenin g visit.
7.6.2. Physical Examinations and Height and Weight Measurements
All subjects will undergo a physical examination during 
the Screening Period andthe Month 
30 visit or Early  Study  Discontinuation, including assessment of the following body  systems:

7.6.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be recorded at each study  visit.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_498449]’s arm supported at the 
level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  The same arm (preferabl y the 
dominant arm) wil
l be used throughout the trial.  The subject should be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 
3minutes before the supi[INVESTIGATOR_498450].  Standing blood pressure should then 
be measured approximately [ADDRESS_641219] assumes the standing position.  The 
same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly calibrated, will be used to measure 
blood pressure at each time point .  The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse 
rate are acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be m easured in the 
brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds.  When the timing of these measurements 
coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate should be obtained prior to 
the nominal time of the blood collection.
7.6.4. Electrocardiograms
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed for all subjects at Screening , Baseline, 
Months 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30.  Where possible, ECGs will be performed before blood 
pressure or pulse measurements or blood collection.  For ECG recordings, the subjects will 
remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_498451] 5 minutes before recording the ECG.
The following ECG parameters will be assessed: PR, RR, QRS ,QT,andQTc (B and F) 
interval, heart rate, and overall interpretation, with recording of an y abnor mal findings. 
Ten-second rhy thm strips will accompan y each ECG. For subject entry  into the study , each 
ECG will be recorded and read locally  by [CONTACT_977], and the 
clinical significance of 
ECG findings will be assessed b y the investigator.
In addition, for overall anal ysis of the ECG parameters, each ECG will be digitalized and 
sent to an independent ECG laboratory that will conduct a centralized review of the results 
for confirmation by [CONTACT_28997] .
Detailed instructions for performing ECGs areprovided in a separate study  laboratory  
manual (Centralized ECG Procedure Manual) .
7.6.5. Echocardiograms
Echocardiograph y (2D Doppler) will be performed for all subjects at Screening and Months 
6, 18, and 30 (or Earl y Study Discontinuation).   The assessment of end- diast olic 
interventricular septal thickness for stud y entr y will be based on the echocardiogram 
performed at the Screening visit as interpreted b y the independent central laboratory .If the 
Screening echocardiographic recording is not clear enough to accuratel y determine the 
end-diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness, it must be repeated.  Each 
echocardiogram will be recorded and reviewed locally b y the clinical site, and the clinical

7.6.7. Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test, with sensitivity  of at 
least 25 mIU/mL , will be performed at the 
Screening and Baseline visits before 
investigational product administration and at the end of treatment visit .  A negative 
pregnancy  result is required before the subject may receive the investigational product.  
Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever one menstrual cy cle is missed during the active 
treatment perio d (or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspected), repeated at and 
Months 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (or Early Study Discontinuation) to confirm that the subject 
has not become pregnant during the study .  In the case of a positive hCG test, the subject will 
be discontinued from the study .  Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as per request of 
IRB/IECs or if required by [CONTACT_427].

(Appendix 1.1) (Green 2000)19is a 23- item subject -completed questionnaire that 
assesses health status and health -related quality  of life in subjects with heart failure. Items 
assess the ability  to perform activities of daily  living, frequency  and seve rity of sy mptoms, 
the impact of these s ymptoms, and health- related quality  of life. Response options vary  by 
[CONTACT_53007]. Scoring y ields scores for 6 domains (Phy sical limitation, Symptom stability , 
Symptoms, Self -efficacy , Social limitation, and Quality  oflife), two summary  scores 
(Functional summary  and C
linical summary ), as well as an Overall Summary  score. Domain 
scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 range; higher scores indicate better health status. It takes 
approximatel y 4-[ADDRESS_641221] to complete the KCCQ.
Subjects will complete the KCCQ at the Baseline visit and at Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 
30(or Earl y Stud y Discontinuation) as listed in the Schedule of Activities
. In each instance 
of administration, the KCCQ should be completed by  [CONTACT_498499]-
5D-3L(Appendix 2)and PGA assessments (Appendix 3).
The KCCQ can be found in Section Appendix 1.1.
[IP_ADDRESS]. EQ-
5D-3L
The EQ -5D- 3LAppendix 2(3 levels version) is a brief, self-administered generic health 
status instrument that takes about 5 minutes to complete (Euroqol Group 1990).[ADDRESS_641222] part
,respondents are asked to rate their current 
health state on 5 dimensions (mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and 
anxiety  or depression) wi th each dimension having three levels of function (1=no problem, 
2=some problem, and 3=extreme problem).  The second part is a subject’s self -rating of 
current health state on a Visual Analog Scale (EQ -5D VAS) with endpoints labeled ‘best 
imaginable health state’ (score of 100) and ‘worst imaginable health state’ (score of 0). The 
scores from the 5 dimensions may  be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a 
utility  score.
Subjects will complete the EQ-5D- 3L(Appendix 2)at the Baseline visit and at visit Months 
6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (or Early Study Discontinuation) as listed in the Schedule of Activities.
Subjects should complete the EQ -
5D-3Lafter the KCCQ (Appendix 1.1).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Assessment (PGA)
The subject’s overall health status will be assessed by  [CONTACT_121602]. At Baseline ,subjects will be 
asked to rate their cur rent health on the PGA using seven response options that range from 
“Normal, not at all ill” to “Among the most extremely  ill”.At follow -up visits subjects will 
be asked to rate thechange in their health status since Baseline
.
Subjects will complete the PGA at the Baseline visit and at Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 
30 (or Earl y Stud y Discontinuation) as listed in the Schedule of Activities . Subjects should 
complete the PGA after the KCCQ (Appendix 1.1)andEQ-5D-3L(Appendix 2).
The PGA can be found in 
Section Appendix 3.
7.7.2. TTR Stabilization , TTR Oligomer 
Concentration, and TTR Concentration 
Measu rements
One (1) whole blood sample will be collected at Baseline andMonths 1, 6, 12, 18, 24 ,and 
30(or Earl y Stud y Discontinuation) at times of sampling for tafamidis concentration, to test 
for stabilization of TTR and TTR concentration .  These samples w ill be analy zed using 
validated anal ytical method s in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures.  
Detailed instructions for collection, storage, labeling, and shipment of all samples are 
provided in a separate study  laboratory  manual.
These samples may  also be used to validate and implement an assay  to measure TTR 
oligomer concentration.   Subjects at selected centers wi ll be asked to provide a urine sample 
to be used in assay  development for measurement of TTR oligomer concentrations in urine.   
For those subjects who provide consent, a 10 mL  aliquot of urine will be collected ( starting at 
the earliest possible prospective visit for the subject ) atMonths 12, 18, 24, and 30 (or Earl y 
Study  Discontinuation) ; this aliquot will be obtained from the ur ine sample already  collected 
for urinal ysisat these visits.  
Additional instructions for collection, storage, labeling, and shipment of all samples are
provided in the study  laboratory  manual.
7.7.3. Diflunisal Concentration
After the recording of ECGs, Echocar diograms and blood pressure , ablood sample will be 
collected to determine if the subject has taken diflunisal .  The blood sample for this 
assessment will be taken at Screening, Baseline and Months 1, 6, 18, and 30.  Use of 
diflunisal during the study  is not permitted .  Subjects taking diflunisal will be appropriatel y 
counselled. Such subjects will be handled as protocol violators in the analy sis as described in 
the Statistical Analy sis Plan.
Samples will be analy zed using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with [COMPANY_007] 
standard operating procedures.

PF-[ADDRESS_641223] (6MWT)
A 6MWT will be conducted during the 
Screening period and at the Baseline visit and at 
Month 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 visits (or Early Stud y Discontinuation) .There will be one 
6MWT during the Screening period.  Subjects who are unable to walk [ADDRESS_641224] will be conducted in accordance with guidelines established b y the American 
Thoracic Society .
Detailed instructions for conducting the 6 MWT areprovided in Section Appendix 4.
7.7.5.
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association Classification
Subjects will be evaluated using the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) classification at
Screening, Baseline, and at Month 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30.
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Classification:
Class I
Subjects wi th cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of phy sical activity .  Ordinary
physical activity  does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dy spnea, or anginal pain.
Class II
Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of phy sical ac tivity . They  are
comfortable at rest. Ordinary  physical activity  results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dy spnea, or 
angina pain.
Class III
Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of phy sical activity . They  are
comfortable at rest. Less t han ordinary  physical activity  causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dy
spnea, 
or anginal pain.
Class IV
Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in inability  to carry  on any  physical activity  without
discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency  or of the anginal s yndrome may be present 
even at rest. If any physical activity  is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Pharmacokinetic samples, to determine the tafamidis concentration, will be collected at 
Baseline (pre -dosing) and at Months 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (or Earl y Study 
Discontinuation) .  For the Month 1, 18, and [ADDRESS_641225] consider travel time to clinic and 
other procedures to be performed at that visit. It is imperative that the actual clock time of 
dosing on the specified day s and the actual clock time o f tafamidis concentration sample 
collection on the day of each clinic visit is recorded .
1.At the Baseline ( Day 1) visit, tafamidis concentration samples will be collected 
pre-dose.
2. At Month 1, a tafamidis concentration sample will be collected pre-dose and at 
3 hours (± 1.5 hours ) post -dose.
3.At Month 6, a tafamidis concentration samples will be collected at 7 hours 
(±2.5hours) post -dose.
4. At Month 12, a tafamidis concentration sample will be collected at 7 hours 
(±2.5hours) post -dose.
5. At Month 18, a tafamidis concentration sample will be collected at 1 hour 
(±30 minutes) post- dose.
6. At Month 24, a tafamidis concentration sample will be collected at 1hour 
(±30 minutes) post-dose.
7.At Month 30 (or Earl y Study Discontinuation) , a tafamidis concentration sample can 
be taken at an y time during the clinic visit and the actual time of dosing and sample 
collection will be recorded.
In addition, should a s ubject require dial ysis at an y time after randomization while on study  
treatment , the subject should have blo od samples collected for tafamidis concentrations on 
the date of dial ysis both prior to dialy sis and after dialy sis.  Every  effort should be made to 
collect these samples on the date of the subject’s first dialy sis treatment in the study ; 
however, if this is not possible, the samples should be obtained as soon as possible on the 
date of a dial ysis treatment.  I f necessary , the sample collection can be obtained using the 
guidelines for lab sample collection in the remote visit guide for the s tudy.At the tim e of 
sample collection, the date and time of the last dose and the date and time of sample 
collection will be noted.

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or susp ected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections.
For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a nSAE
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_36545] a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted by  [CONTACT_1034], any  non- serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as a n SAE .  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
trial.
8.2.Reporting Period
For 
SAE s, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent, which i s obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_641227] 
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product are to be reported to the Sponsor.   AEs (both serious and non -serious) should be 

PF-[ADDRESS_641228] ’s last visit.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject , administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dep endency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose ,
Drug withdrawal ,
Drug misuse,
Drug interactions,
Extravasation,
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ,
Exposure via breastfeeding ,
Medication error ,
Occupational exposu re.

PF-[ADDRESS_641229], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page and 
on the SAE form when appropriate .  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor 
should be notified immediately .
Medicat ion errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product ,
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the adverse 
event (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated adverse event(s) arecaptured on an 
adverse event (AE) CRF page .
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows:
1.Test result is associated with acco mpan ying symptoms, and/or
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
3.Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or oth er therap y, and/or
4.Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an erro r does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
1.Results in death.
2.Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death) .

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine
B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 813.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11636] .
4.Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions).
5.Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject ,or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
The following events must be considered medically important and have the same reporting 
requirements as SAEs:
Amy loidosis or heart failure resulting in organ transplantation (regardless if the 
subject was pre- planned or on a waiting list for an organ prior to study  start);
Amy loidosis or heart failure resulting in cardiac mechanical assist device 
implantation (regardless if the procedure was pre- planned).
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse E vents
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_134988] y 
database (see 
the section s on Endpoints and on Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total biliru bin levels that meet the criteria outlined 
below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events.
The threshold o f laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual B aseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory
 values:

3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent w ith a total bilirubin values  [ADDRESS_641230] with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase values 2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting AL T or AST or total bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold va lues should be used in the definition 
mentioned above .
For subjects with pre -existing AST or AL T Baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values  2times the Baseline values and  [ADDRESS_641231], or [ADDRESS_641232] (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with :
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range:  
Total bilirubin increased from baseline by [CONTACT_8895] [ADDRESS_641233] orif the 
value reaches 
≥[ADDRESS_641234] (whichever is smaller)
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_641235] bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time
(PT)/ international norma lized ratio ( INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , 
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug 
and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel 
history ,history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver 
or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( eg, biliary  tract) may  be wa rranted. All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above , with no 
other cause for 
liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be 
considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availabil ity of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s 
Law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in toa hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843]. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronar y care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit) . An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance .

work -up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality) ,
Social admission ( eg,
subject has no place to sleep),
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam ination ,),

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31013] a medical AE ,
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the Baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as 
AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AEand the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 848.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  Asevere event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reportin g requirements 
if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to sugg
est a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section 8.134.1 on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study  records.
In addition, if the investigator determines a
nSAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or havi ng been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product.  An example of environmental exp osure 
would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman 
(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic 
products).

B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 852. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental expos ure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If astudy  subject or study  subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the i nvestigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the 
[COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (AE) report f orm and 
Exposure in Utero (EIU) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In 
addition , the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a 
[COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been 
exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EIUForm.  This must be 
done irrespective of whether an AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see 
below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is condu
cted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EIU reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a fo llow-up 
to the initial EIUForm.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can 
be assessed at the time of birth.  I n the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination 
should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus 
should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are 
conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie,ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAE s follows:
1.Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion .
2. N eonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_641236] .
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide th e study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document in the source

Page 868.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to drug safety  unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy  of the 
completed SAE r eport form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (see also Section on Subject Withdrawal and 
Vital Status / Transplant /Cardiac Mechanical A ssist D evice Status Follow -up
Withdrawal due to AEshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes , 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page.
When a subject withdraws because of a
nSAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regu lations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_641237] b e made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .

PF-06291826 Tafamidis Meglumine
B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 87For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporti ng specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, t his will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications
, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative.
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) , which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_103].  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be re flected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The primary  comparison of interest is the pooled tafamidis 20 mg and 80mg treatment 
groups vs. placebo.  The target sample size is 400 subjects.
Asample size of 400 subjects is based on findings from study  Fx1B -201 (a 12- month, 
open -label stud y of tafamidis in TTR -CM subjects), TRACS (an observational study  with no 
treatment intervention other than standard of care in TTR -CM subjects) , an understanding of 
current clinical outcomes in this populati on, and the uncertainty of the assumptions derived 
from these limited data.
Given that no closed -form sample size estimation solution is available for the primary  
analysis method , sample size estimation was performed based on simulations
.
Sample size assum ptions include:

B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 881. A ll-cause mortalit y rate of 12.5% for the tafamidis group and 25.0% for the placebo 
group (ie, a 50% reduction in mortality  with treatment) .
2.1.5 cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498424] 
2.5cardiovascular -relate d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498425] .
3. T reatment duration of 30 months.
4. S ignificance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-sided test) .
With these assumptions, 300 subjects (n=120 for placebo, n=60 for 20 mg, n=120 for 80 mg) 
yields a power of over 90% for the primary  comparison.  A more conservative assumption of 
30% reduction in mortality  (17.5 % for tafamidis and 25% for placebo) y ields a power of 
approximatel y 80%.  With an assumption of 30% reduction in mortality and increasing the 
number of subjects to 400 su bjects (n=160 for placebo, n=80 for 20 mg, and n=160 for 
80mg)yields a power of approximatel y 90%.

The Sponsor notes that a clinically  meaningful change in the all -cause mortality  component 
of the primary analysis could be considered to be as low as a 10% all-cause mortality  
reduction at [ADDRESS_641238] pre sents 
substantial feasibility  challenges to study  completion due to the relativel y small number of 
subjects identified for potential enrollment in this study .
9.2.Analysis Populations
The intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis set will include all subjects in the safe ty population who 
had at least [ADDRESS_641239] Baseline efficacy  evaluation ( ie, post 
Baseline hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study  visit, 
or date of death).  This may  also be referred to as a modified intent- to-treat group but for 
simplicity  will be referred to throughout the protocol and SAP as ITT.  The per protocol (PP) 
analysis set will include all subjects in the ITT set who did not violate inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and who did not have protocol violations considered to impact the interpretation of 
the primary  efficacy  analysis.  The safet y analysis set will include all subjects who are 
enrolled (randomized) and received at least 1 dose of double
-blind medication.

B3461028
Final Protocol Amendment 3, 24 May 2016
Page 89Both the I TT and PP analy sis sets will be used for the primary  analy sis and for the analy ses 
of the key secon dary endpoints, with the I TT being primary .  The secondary  endpoints and 
the exploratory  endpoints will only  be analy zed using the I TT anal ysis set. The Safet y 
Analy sis Set will be used in the anal yses of the safety  data.
9.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The pri mary  anal ysis uses a hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency  of 
cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (which is defined as the number of times a subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] [ ie, admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]] for cardiovascular -related morbidi ty) over the 
duration of the trial. The primary  anal ysis will combine the subjects in the tafamidis 20 mg 
and tafamidis 80mg groups (including subjects in the [ADDRESS_641240] had a dose 
reduction to 40 mg )into one pooled group. This pooled gr oup (tafamidis) will be compared 
with the placebo group using the Finkelstein -Schoenfeld method ( Finkelstein 1999 ).[ADDRESS_641241], assigning a +1 to the “better” subj ect and a -1 to the “worse” 
subject.
If both subjects are dead, then the subject with a longer survival time is assigned +1 .
If one subject is alive and the other is not, the live subject receives a +1 and the 
deceased one a -1.
If both subjects are alive, the comparison uses cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498463]. The subject with the fewer cardiovascular
-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s
(frequency ) receives a +[ADDRESS_641242] statistic is based on the sum of these scores and will be stratified b y TTR genotype 
(variant and wild
-type) and Baseline severit y category (NYHA Classes IandII combined 
andNYHA Class III).
The null hy pothesis for the primary  anal ysis is that neither all -cause mortality  nor frequency  
of cardiovascu lar-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498426].  The corresponding alternative hy pothesis is that at least one and possibly  
both mortality  and frequency  of cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498464].
The term “censored” refers to a subject who discontinues from the trial for reasons other than 
death.  For such subjects, there will be additional follow - up to obtain vital status (and 
transplant /cardia c mechanical a ssist d evice status) at Month [ADDRESS_641243] at Month 30 is missing, then the frequency  
of cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498465] -up times (the shorter 
of the 2 subjects’ stud
y participation) will be used in assigning a +[ADDRESS_641244] drops out but both are know n to b e alive at Month 30, the frequency  of 
cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], at the shorter of their follow- up times (the shorter of 
the 2 subjects study  participation), will be used in assigning a +1 or -1.  Comparisons of 
cardiovascular related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498466] 30 months 
study  duration will be based on the earlier of the two actual stud y durations (day s).
Subject s
, who discontinue for transplantation (ie, heart transplant ation and combined heart 
and liver transpla ntation) or for implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, will be 
handled in the primary  analy sis in the same manner as death.  More specifically, the time of 
the transplant or cardiac mechanical assist device implant will be used in the 
subject -to-subject comparison in the same manner as if the subject had died at that time 
(regardless of an y additional vital status follow -up information).  Data from subjects who 
drop out for a liver -only transplant ation will be handled in the same manner as the data from 
all other censored subject s.
To examine the potential effect of including heart transplant ation or cardiac mechanical a ssist 
device as “deaths” in the primary  anal ysis, a sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed treating 
all transplant ation or card iac mechanical assist device in the same 
manner as an y other 
censored observation.
As an additional sensitivity  analy sis, a multiple imputation analy sis will be applied using the 
method developed b y Rubin (Rubin 1987) .  Combined results will be provided fo r the 
primary  anal ysis (ie,using F inkelstein -Schoenfeld ) as well as for the separate mortality  and 
morbidity  elements.  Details are provided in the SAP.
9.2.2. Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints
The key  secondary  endpoints will be evaluated using a mixed model repeated measures
ANC OVA with an unstructured covariance matrix (or as appropriate); center and 
subject -within -center as random effects; treatment, visit, TTR genoty pe (variant and 
wild-type), and visit-by-treatment interaction, as fixed effects and Baseline score as 
covariate.
The key  secondary  variables are :
1.Change from Baseline to Month 30 in distance walked during the 6MWT
(Appendix 4).
2.Change from Baseline to Month 30 in KCCQ (Appendix 1.1) Over all Summary  
score.
To maintain the ty pe 1 error rate at or below the specified level, a pre -specified hierarchical 
order for testing as indicated above will be used to maintain the overall alpha at 0.05 for 
these twokey secondary  endpoints
.  The multiplic ity procedure will be applied to the I TT 
analysis set only .

Exploratory  anal yses of the key  secondary  endpoints will include results from the MMRM 
analysis at each in dividual time point other than M onth 30.
Additi onal exploratory  analy ses of the key  secondary  endpoints will include results from the 
MMRM analy sis at each individual time point by [CONTACT_7169] (randomized dose group), TTR 
genoty pe (variant and wild -type), and NYHA Baseline classification. Descriptive statistics 
overall, b y dose, b y TTR genotype, and b y NYHA Baseline classification will be provided 
for each time point.
Except for the anal yses by  [CONTACT_2715] , all anal yses of the key  secondary  endpoints, including the 
proposed exploratory  analy ses of these endpoi nts
, willcompare the pooled tafamidis group 
with the placebo group.
9.3.Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
As a secondary  anal ysis, the components of the primary  endpoint ( ie, all-cause mortality  and 
frequency  of cardiovascular -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] )
will be analyzed separatel y.  All-cause
mortality  willbe anal yzed using SAS Proc L ifetest; p -values will be from the log -rank test.  
Kaplan -Meier survival curves for each treatment group along with median survival times (if 
applicable) will be presented.
All-causemortalit y will also be anal yzed using Cox proportional hazards model with 
treatment, TTR genot ype (variant and wild- type), and NYHA Baseline classification (NYHA 
Classes Iand II combined and NYHA Class III)as factors.  Frequency  of

adjusted for treatment duration.
Cardiovascular -related mortality  will also be analyzed using the Kaplan- Meier and Cox 
proportional methods described above.
All the anal yses on the seconda ry endpoints described above will additionally  be presented 
by [CONTACT_498500] (variant versus wild-type), NYHA Baseline classification ,as well as dose 
(randomized dose group) ,and will be considered exploratory .
The proportion of subjects who achieved TTR s tabilization in each treatment group at M onth 
1 will be compared using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for proportions stratified 
by [CONTACT_498501] y (NYHA Class esIand II combined and NYHA Class
III). The anal ysis will be perfor med separatel y by [CONTACT_498502] (variant and wild- type)

proportions stratified b y TTR genoty pes (variant and wild- type).
Analy ses of TTR stabilization at Month 1 by  [CONTACT_2715] (low vs. placebo and high vs. placebo) will 
be compared using a Cochran- Mantel -Haens zel (CMH) test for proportions stratified by  [CONTACT_498505] B aseline severity (NYHA Class esI and II combined and NYHA Class III).
A similar test of proportion will be done on TTR stabilization at all other time points and 
considered exploratory .No subgroup anal yses willbe done at these other time points.
Except for the anal ysesby [CONTACT_7169] , all anal yses of the secondary  endpoints, including the 
proposed exploratory  analy ses of these endpoints, will compare the pooled tafamidis group 
with the placebo group.

Page 949.4.1. Pharmacokinetic Data
Plasma concentrations of tafamidis will be summarized graphicall y and with descriptive 
statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean,
median, andminimum and maximum) by  [CONTACT_498507].  Due to the sparse nature of 
the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme, a population approach will be used for 
pharmacokinetic 
data analy sis.  Nonlinear mixed -effect modeling will be performed to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics of tafamidis.  These tafamidis concentration data may  be 
pooled with data from previous clinical studies for anal ysis.  Results from any  tafamidis 
concentration modeling conducted will be reportedly  separatel y.  If appropriate, these 
pharmacokinetic data may be used for exposure -response anal yses.
To confirm adequate exposures following administration of soft gel capsules in the [ADDRESS_641247] -dose. The expected mean 
steady  state tafamidis concentration is 8.0 ug/mL . If the geometric mean concentration from 
the 80 mg dose group is < 50% of the projected value, the [ADDRESS_641248] access to an y unblinded safet y or efficacy data .Details of the 
analysis procedure will be documented in a PK unblinding plan.
9.4.2. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Modeling
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic (PK/PD) modeling of tafamidis treatment groups may  be 
done using the primary  and/or secondary  efficacy  endpoints compared to the corresponding 
endpoints in the placebo arm.  The basic PK/PD model will consist of structural vari ables for 
treatment arm and the time points out to 30 months.  Additional important covariates (such as 
demographics) may  be added to the PK/PD model during the model building process.  The 
PK/PD model may  contain a time course component that will help des cribe the onset of 
action as compared to the placebo arm.  Other efficacy , safety, and exploratory  endpoints 
may also be modeled as needed to further understand tafamidis response variables. Results 
from an y tafamidis PK/PD modeling conducted will be repo rtedly separately.
9.5.Safety Analysis
The safet y assessme nts in the study  are listed in Section 7.6. All randomized subjects who 
receive at least one dose of study  treatment will be included in t
he safet y analysis.  All 
adverse events that are observed from the time of first dosing with study  medication (at 
randomization) until the end of study  participation will be included in the safet y analysis.  
Adverse events that occurred during treatment wi ll be reported separatel y if the event 
occurred prior to randomization.
All adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570].  The incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_498508].  The incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events will be display ed by  [CONTACT_11370] y and

withdrawal will be tabulated.  All adverse events will be listed .
The following 3 -tier approach will be used to summarize AEs. Under this approach, AEs are 
classified into 1 of 3 tiers. Different anal yses will be performed for different tiers and w ill be 
documented in the statistical anal ysis plan.
Tier-1 events: These are pre -specified events of clinical importance and are 
maintained in a list in the product’s Safet y Review Plan. This list may  be updated as 
more is understood about the drug.
Tier-2 events: These are events that are not T ier-1 but are “common”. A MedDRA 
Preferr ed Term (PT) is defined as a T ier-[ADDRESS_641249] 4 in any  treatment 
group.
Tier-3 events: The se are events that are neither Tier
-[ADDRESS_641250] for each sample 
collection date and time.  The measurement t aken immediately  prior to randomization will be 
used as the B aseline value for calculating changes in vital signs.
Centrally  over -read ECG variables will be summarized by  [CONTACT_498509], PR interval, QRS w idth, QT interval, and QTcB 
(Bazett’s correction) and QTcF (Fridericia ’scorrection) values.  Additionally , the incidence 
of categorical increases in QTc intervals will be provided.  Categories for QTcB and QTcF 
are ≥ 450 msec, ≥480 msec, and ≥ 500 msec.  Categories for QTcB and QTc Fas change from 
Baseline are : ≥ 30 msec increase, ≥ 60 msec increase ,and ≥ 75 msec increase.  QTcF is 
considered the primary  QTc value as this correction is anticipated to be more appr opriate.
All of the anal ysis on the safet y endpoints w illcompare placebo with each tafamidis dose 
(20mg and 80 mg) as well as the pooled group (combined tafamidis 20 mg and 80mg).
The safet y analyses will also be summarized by  [CONTACT_498510].
9.6.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will usean External Data Monitoring Committee (E -DMC )that is independent 
from [COMPANY_007] .  Information regarding the E -DMC can be found in the External Data 
Monitoring Committee Charter, including th e membership of the committee.
The E
-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the study 
according to the E- DMC Charter through safet y interim anal yses of comparisons of safet y 
information across treatment groups.  Any rec ommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the 

PF-[ADDRESS_641251] periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and 
Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may  review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and 
institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents t o perform this verification.   This verification 
may also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the I
nstitutional R eview Board (I RB)/ Ethics Committee (EC), and/or to quality  
assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], 
and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_47615].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator
site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject’s medical records. The investigator will p romptly  provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Befor e response submission to the regulatory  
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are a vailable during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory

CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be da ted, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, ( eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whicheve r is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptabl e to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_641252] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the respo nsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, ( eg,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IEC ).  All correspondence with the
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].

Page 98The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  require ments, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996 & 2008).24,[ADDRESS_641253]’s numerical code to his or her 
actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subject
s’personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document sand an y subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH ,GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and le gal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and an y subject 
recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618] , approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC
before use , and available for inspection
.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject (or a legal representative) , is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any  study -specific activity  is performed. The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document .

Page 9912.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious Breaches of t he Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately.
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y imm ediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH /GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient subjects have been recruited and completed the study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application ( ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticip ated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries
End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as Last Subject Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of tafamidis at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_8906][INVESTIGATOR_4601] (if applicable) within [ADDRESS_641254] extent possible.
15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS
15.1. Communication of Results by [CONTACT_36554].clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical 
Trials Database (EudraCT) and/or www.pfizer.com , and other public registries in accordance 
with applicable local laws/regulations .

1.Where possible, repeat testing should be performed about the same time of day  to 
minimize va riability .
2.A “warm -up” period before the test should NOT be performed.
3.The subject should sit at rest for about [ADDRESS_641276] stand and rate their Baseline dy spnea and overall fatigue using the 
Borg scale.
The Borg Scale:
0 –Nothing at all
0.5 – Very , very  slight (just noticeable)
1 –Very  slight
2 –Slight (light)
3 –Moderate
4 –Somewhat severe
5 –Severe
6
7 –Very  severe
8
9
10 – V ery, very  severe (maximal)
Ask the 
subject what their level of shortness of breath is and then ask what their level of 
fatigue is.
1.Set the lap counter to zero and the timer to [ADDRESS_641277] :

Page 115a.“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_641278] the wall while resting, but resume walking as soon as possible as you are 
able;
b. You will be walking back and forth around the cones.  You should pi[INVESTIGATOR_498474].  “Now I’m 
going to show y ou.  Please watch the way  I turn without hesitation”;
c.Demonstrate b y walking one lap yourself.  Walk and pi[INVESTIGATOR_113988] a cone briskly ;
d.“Are you read y to do t hat? I  am going to use this counter to keep track of the 
number of laps you complete.  I will click it each time you turn around at this 
starting line.  Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSI BLE in 
6 minutes, but don’t run or jog;
e.Do y ou have 
any questions?
f.Start now or whenever you are read y.”
3.Position the subject at the starting line.  You should also stand near the starting line 
during the test.  Do not walk with the subject .  As soon as the subject starts to walk, 
start the timer.
4.Do not ta lk to any one during the walk.  Use an even tone of voice when using the 
standard phrases of encouragement.  Watch the subject .  Do not get distracted and 
lose count of the laps.  Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the 
lap counter once (or mark the lap on the worksheet ).  Let the participant see y ou do it.  
Exaggerate the click using body  language, like using a stop- watch at a race.
a.After the first minute, tell the subject the following (in an even tone) “You are 
doing well.  You h ave 5 minutes to go.”
b.When the timer shows [ADDRESS_641279] the following: “You

Page 116f.Do not use other w ords of encouragement (or body  language to speed up).
g.If the subject stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say  this:  “You can 
lean against the wall if you would like; then continue walking whenever you 
feel able.”   Do not stop the timer.  If the subject stops before the 6 minutes are up 
and refuses to continue (or decides that they  should not continue), wheel the chair 
over for the 
subject to sit on, discontinue the walk, and note on the worksheet the 
distance, the time stopped and the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_498475] y.
5.Post-test: Record the post walk Borg dy spnea and fatigue levels and ask this: “What, 
if anything, kept you from walking farther?”
6.If using a pulse oximeter, measure SpO 2and pulse rate from the oximeter and then 
remove the sensor.
7.Record the number of laps from the counter (or tick marks from the worksheet).
8. Record the additional distance covered (the number of meters in the final partial lap) 
using the markers on the wall as distance guides.  Calculate the total distance walked, 
rounding to the nearest meter, and recording it on the worksheet.
9.Congratulate the subject on a good effort and offer a drink of water.

SUMMARY  19 
Meniere’s disease (MD) affects 2 to 4 people per 10,000 and represents up to 15% of new [ADDRESS_647518] treatment .2 Given the lack of level I  evidence for  MD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we 22 
seek to perform a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, crossover, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] 23 
venlafaxine extended -release (ER) 37.5 mg daily for the prophylactic treatment of MD. 24 
Venlafaxine is a safe and well -tolerated medication,3-5 and it will be trialed at the lower end of 25 
the dosage spectrum typi[INVESTIGATOR_502786].6 No literature exists for the use of venlafaxine 26 
in MD, but there  is evidence that it could be e ffective through both central and peripheral 27 
vestibular -modulating mechanisms.  28 
Venlafaxine is a serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) typi[INVESTIGATOR_285554] [ADDRESS_647519] that selective serotonin reuptake 30 
inhibitors (SSRIs) can be effective in the treatment of MD through serotonin’s ability to 31 
modulate vestibular function in vestibular nuclei, the inferior olive, and the cerebellum.8,9 32 
Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_502787].10 Lamotrigine, a 33 
serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in 34 
treating MD and is currently in a clinical trial .11 Venlafaxine can reduce vasopressin receptor 35 
activation .12 This may reduce endolymphatic hydrops, because the endolymphatic sac expresses 36 
vasopressin receptors which may be important in fluid and ion homeostasis in the inner ear.13-16 37 
Venlafaxine is well -known in the treatment of anxiety and depression ,17,18 which are 38 
common comorbidities in MD19 that may ultimately contribute to a cycle of somatic and 39 
psychological symptoms  synergistically aggravating  disease  perception .19,20 Furthermore,  40 
migraine is quite common in MD.21,22 Venlafaxine has been shown to be effective in the 41 
 Version 12/12/[ADDRESS_647520] in a tertiary, multidisciplinary, vestibular -focused, neurotology 45 
clinic  at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Habib Rizk . [CONTACT_502831] [ADDRESS_647521] coordination, as well as data analysis given his expertise in conducting clinical 48 
trials. Forty subjects will be recruited to achieve 80% power in detecting a t least a  30% 49 
difference in vertigo frequency control . The study will require about 1 4.5 months t o complete: an 50 
8-month recruitment period  to obtain 40 subjects ; and for each subject a 1-month lead -in [ADDRESS_647522] been collected and analyzed. Using patient - 54 
reported symptoms and various validated instruments, the outcome s measured will include 55 
change in vertiginous symptoms, functional level, cognitive function, anxiety and depression 56 
severity,  and quality of life  (QOL) . [ADDRESS_647523] not been trialed in MD, but t hey hold promise as a 60 
non-invasive medical treatment option . 61

1. Quality of life measures and cognitive dysfunction in vestibular p athologies : [ADDRESS_647547] started with the advent of our multidisciplinary vestibular clinic. A large portion 174 
of our patients with dizziness  complain ed of cognitive difficulties. Our current dizziness - 175 
related QOL  questionnaires usually assess  the physical, functional  and emotional dimensions 176 
of a pathology’s impact, with few or non -existent inquiries into the cognitive dysfunction of [ADDRESS_647548]. With the 178 
lack of a standardized tool to measure this impairment, we administered the well -established 179 
general Cognitive F ailure Questionnaire (CFQ) on all our dizzy patients to quantify that 180 
dimension of the QOL that is affected. We found major disparities of cognitive dysfunction 181 
that are driven by [CONTACT_502812], in conjunction with other factors. Vestibular migraine and 182 
Meniere’s disease drove the CFQ scale very high (a). We then proceeded to test the English 183 
version of the newly -developed Neuropsychologic al Vertigo Inventory (NVI). We have [ADDRESS_647549] already obtained pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690]  (b).  In collaboration with U CSF we have also [ADDRESS_647550] to describe the epi[INVESTIGATOR_502789] (c). During the [ADDRESS_647551] to vestibular evoked myogenic 190

2. Radiographic characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with vestibular and 206 
neurotological pathologies : [ADDRESS_647552] was expanded to look at 211 
outcomes of surgery correlated to the skull base thickness and body mass index (BMI) . Once 212 
our vestibular clinic was established, I translated this protocol into our superior semicircular 213 
canal dehiscence (SSCD) patients. We found, interestingly, that despi[INVESTIGATOR_502790] a 214 
lower BMI than our spontaneous leak patients, the SSCD subjects had  a generalized thinner 215 
skull base. This reinforces the possibility of multiple mechanisms, probably autocrine, 216 
independent of i ncreased intracranial pressure, which  participate in some of those 217 
neurotologic pathologies. Other teams corroborated these findings in subsequent studies.  218

otolaryngology. Specially pertaining to head and neck surgery, I uncovered the benefits of 296 
early swallowing exercises for patients undergoing chemoradiation, performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 297 
of a novel free flap monitoring system, revealed mechanical properties of  the nasal septal 298 
cartilage and the effects of surgery  on its integrity , explored the efficacy of various 299 
maxillomandibular procedures in improving sleep apnea, reported on the efficacy of a 300 
treatment protocol for burning mouth syndrome, systematically reviewed the utility of 301 
preoperative imaging for parathyroid disease in patients with concurrent thyroid disease, and 302 
discovered the need for reduced prescription of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a prospective, 303

vestibular diseases, such as Meniere’s disease, vestibular migraine, and benign paroxysmal  324

with dizziness, and found that Meniere’s disease had similar cognitive impairment to 326 
vestibular migraine, both worse than BPPV. We are starting a new prospective phase of the 327

  409 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 23 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  410 
Meniere’s disease (MD) is a major cause of epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c vertigo, affecting around 190  people  per 411 
100,000 in the US.27 It represents up to 15% of new patient consultation s for vertigo i n a tertiary [ADDRESS_647579] been tried  to curtail the symptoms of MD , including lifestyle 416 
modifications with reduction of salt intake  and increase in water intake; medications  such as  [ADDRESS_647580] eroids, transtympanic gentamicin ; and  surgical treatments [ADDRESS_647581]  proven 421 
to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_502794] , such as transtympanic g entamicin, they carry significant  side effects 422 
including hearing loss and tinnitus, which are already cons equences of the disease itself.32 423 
Venlafaxine is a serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) typi[INVESTIGATOR_285554] [ADDRESS_647582] that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs)  can be 429 
effective in the treatment of MD  through central mechanisms.33-35 It has been shown in rats that 430 
serotonin can modify responsiveness to glutamate and N-methyl -d-aspartate (NMDA) in 431 
 Version 12/12/[ADDRESS_647583] inhibitory activity in the 438 
medial vestibular nuclei and excitatory activity in the lateral vestibular nuclei of rats .10 In one 439 
study, 85% of neurons in all vestibular nuclei experienced change in basal firing rate with 440 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_502795], with inhibition in 86% of those tested, acting mainly throu gh alpha2 - [ADDRESS_647584] been found to be expressed in the luminal 451 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_502796],13 and v asopressin is thought to be a potential regulator of 452 
endolymphatic ion and fluid homeostasis .14,15 It has been proposed that similar to how 453 
vasopressin induces translocation of aquaporins into luminal cell membranes in t he kidney, it  454 
 Version 12/12/[ADDRESS_647585] that venlafaxine may be useful in treating MD 462 
through its vasopressin  modulating activity.  463 
A large number of patients with MD suffer from comorbid anxiety and depression .19 One 464 
study found that 70 -80% of patients with active MD could be diagnosed with depression while 465 
the same was true in 32 -39% of those with inactive MD.[ADDRESS_647586] found through a prospective 473 
study of cognitive function in dizzy patients that M D presents with cognitive dysfunction greater 474 
than that of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and comparable to that of vestibular migraine; 475 
and a great deal of this cognitive decline was mediated through depression.52 Venlafaxine is a 476 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 26 
 
well-known and effective treatm ent for anxiety and depression,17,18 and as such, may prove  477 
useful in treating both the psychological and somatic repercussions of MD.  478 
Migraine is comorbid in 22 -56% of MD patients, twice as high as the general [ADDRESS_647587] inner ear blood flow  483 
through the trigeminal nerve.56 It has been hypothesized that chronic under -perfusion may lead to  484 
ischemic injury and incite MD.57 Venlafaxine has shown efficacy in the treatment of 485 
migraineError! Bookmark not defined. and vestibular migraine ,23,24 but it has never been trialed for MD.  486 
Venlafaxine has a well -established safety profile.3 It is well-tolerated in the treatment of 487 
depression.4,5 In addition,  it will be used in the proposed  trial at the lower end of the depression 488 
treatment dosage spectrum ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  >75 mg daily). In a trial of venlafaxine 75 mg daily vs. 489 
placebo for migraine prophylaxis, excellent or good tolerance was reported in 86.7% of patients, 490 
with common side effects of nausea, vomiting, dro wsiness, fatigue, and insomnia.6 It does not 491 
bind significantly to adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, or histamine H1 receptors.7 Thus, it has 492 
a low risk of causing significant anticholinergic side effects.4 493 
High quality evidence is needed when examining MD treatments, especially when 494 
introducing a potential new class of therapy. A 2018 international consensus article provided an 495 
algorithm for MD treatment , which found a lack of level I  evidence for any specific modality.30 496 
Thus, given the evidence discussed suggesting the potential of venlafaxine  as a non -invasive 497 
therapy to alter the natural course of MD through both central and peripheral vestibular 498 
mechanisms, we believe a high -quality pi[INVESTIGATOR_502797] 499

aspects of disease burden (i.e. , vestibular, functional, psychiatric, cognitive, quality of life) 500 
would be worthwhile to prove or disprove the efficacy of this class of medication .  501

Sample Size  523 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 29 
 
This is a randomized, double -blind, crossover trial which will required a treatment group and a 524 
placebo group. Based on a power of 80%, we calculated possible sample sizes using : 1) expected 525 
proportion of subjects achieving treatment success , and 2) difference  in DHI score  needed for 526 
clinical significance . 527 
We estimate 20% of  the placebo group will devel op a good response to treatment (>50% 528 
reduction in vertigo frequency ).59-[ADDRESS_647591] a difference of  30% in success rate, such  that at [ADDRESS_647592] 50% of patients in the venlafaxine  arm will develop a similar response , [ADDRESS_647593] deviation 533 
in score of 21.9 among dizzy patients , and a minimum difference of 18 points after treatment to 534 
signify a significant change in sel f-perceived dizziness handicap.58 Using these values, we 535 
calculate a per treatment arm sample size of 24, which results in 24 total patients needed for the 536 
crossover design.  537 
Using the proportion s sample size calculation (because  it has a greater number of 538 
subjects), and factor ing in a 10% drop -out rate  (e.g., improper medication use, inadequate data) , 539 
a total of 40 patients would need to be enrolled.  540 
 541 
Study Protocol  542 
A timeline summary of the study protocol is presented in Figure 1  and Table 2 . Based on our 543 
high clinical volume o f new dizzy patients (around 80  per month), and that approximately 10% [ADDRESS_647594] a diagnosis of definite MD, w e estimate that 8  patients  can be screened  per 545 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 30 
 
month. Because around 40 % of our referrals are outside the Tri -county area of Charleston, which 546 
may present a problem for follow -up, a conservative estimate of enrollment is 5 subjects per 547 
month . In order to enroll 40  patients, our  total study  period will be approximately 14 .5 months 548

These patients will be  counsel ed about trigger identification  (e.g., dietary , environments, [ADDRESS_647599], lifestyle ). Our migraine treatment strategies are  outlined in Appendix A.  [ADDRESS_647600] of care treatment in clinic. If a patient is interested in participating,  574 
the study coordinator will describe the study protocol, assess the patient’s  eligibility based on the [ADDRESS_647601] pregnancy during the trial period. Once enrolled, the 580 
patient will complete the following  surveys: 1) Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI),58 2) 581

Outcome Measures  622 
Symptoms and Functional Level  623 
The main symptoms of MD to be examined are number of vertigo epi[INVESTIGATOR_502800] 624 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Symptom reduction will be calculated based on the 1995 AAOHNS  guidelines63 for 625 
assessing MD improvement after treatment ( Table 4)  and previous studies on treatment [ADDRESS_647606] defined four categories of response to treatment: 1) very good 630 
response if more than 75% reduction in vertigo spells frequency and/or intensity, 2) good 631 
response if 50 -75% reduction, 3) fair response if 25 -50% reduction, and 4) poor response if less 632 
 Version 12/12/2019 - 34 
 
than 25% reduction. Combining the 2 approaches, our numerical value calculation ( Table 4 ) will 633 
be the mean number of vertigo epi[INVESTIGATOR_169572] 2 months after starting a treatment (either 1st or 634 
2nd treatment phase) divided by [CONTACT_502815][INVESTIGATOR_169572] [ADDRESS_647607] whole number. Our v ertigo control 636 
classes will be defined as follows:  637 
- Class A: numerical value 0 (complete control of vertigo)  638 
- Class B: numerical value 0 -40 or >60% reduction in mean vertigo epi[INVESTIGATOR_502801] (good 639 
control of vertigo)  640 
- Class C: numerical value 41 -80 or 20 -60% reduction in severity (fair control of vertigo)  641 
- Class D: numerical value 81 -120 or -20-20% reduction in severity (no change in vertigo)  642 
- Class E: numerical value >120 or >20% worsening in severity (worse vertigo)  643 
- Class F: secondary treatment initiated due to disability from vertigo (e.g. steroid 644 
injection, gentamicin injection, endolymphatic sac decompression, laby[CONTACT_502814])  645 
We will document  duration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_502802] (aural fullness/pressure, 646 
hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or headache) as well, but will simply conduct direct numerical 647 
comparisons or provide descriptive analyses given their likely subjectivity and variability. 648 
Functional level will be assessed according to the 1995 AAOHNS guidelines63 (Table 5 ) at 649 
every visit.  650 
 651 
Questionnaires  652 
The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI, Appe ndix B ) is a 25 -item questionnaire of self- 653 
perceived handicap from dizziness.58 There are 7 questions in the physical domain, 9 in the 654 
 Version 12/12/[ADDRESS_647608] widely -used survey of self - 656 
report ed impairment from dizziness .58,75 It has also been shown to correlate well with balance 657 
testing.76 The DHI will be used to assess the overall severity of vestibular symptoms in our MD 658 
subjects.  659 
The English version of the Neuropsycho logical Vertigo Inventory (NVI, Appendix C ) 660 
consists of  28-items  with a 5 -point Likert scale for each qu estion .67Error! Bookmark not defined. It was 661 
recently developed as a cognitive assessment specific to patients with dizziness. The NVI 662 
assesses 7 domains of cognition: space perception, attention, time perception, memory, 663 
emotional, visual/oculomotor , and motor. We recently conducted a  prospective study showing [ADDRESS_647609] a difference in cognitive dysfunction among different vestibular 665 
disorders; including MD, vestibular migraine, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and that 666 
it is more sensitive than the DHI in revealing these differences.52 We will use the NVI to gauge 667 
vestibular -specific changes in cognitive impairment after treatment.  668 
The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ , Appendix D ) is a 25 -item survey which 669 
assesses cognitive and executive function not tied to any specific disease state .68 It aims to assess 670 
perception, memory, and motor function in everyday tasks. The CFQ  is valid and well- 671 
established ,77,78 and will be  used as a reference for cognitive dysfunction to gauge the results of 672 
the NVI , since the NVI is a newer survey.  673 
The Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ9 , Appendix E ) is a 9 -item survey  that assess es 674 
the severity of depression.69 It is a  validated tool that  has been shown to be reliable in assessing 675 
outcomes of depression treatment.79 The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ, Appendix F ) 676 
is a 16 -item survey  for assessment of anxiety which has been used to identif y generalized anxiety 677 
 Version 12/12/[ADDRESS_647610] been recognized in MD and it is important to 678

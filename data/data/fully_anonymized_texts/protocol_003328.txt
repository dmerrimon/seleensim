13-JAN-2011  6 SYNOPSIS  
Detailed Title  A phase IIIb, open -label, multi -centre immunization study to 
evaluate the safety of GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ 
HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine administered 
intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6 -month schedule in 
healthy female subjects who received the placebo control in 
the [COMPANY_004] HPV -015 study  
Indication  Cervari x is indicated in females from 10 years of age onwards 
for the prevention of persistent infection, premalignant 
cervical lesions and cervical cancer (squamous -cell carcinoma 
and adenocarcinoma) caused by [CONTACT_494020][INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) types . 
Rationa le for the 
study and study 
design  Subjects in the HPV -015 study either received the HPV -16/18 
L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or placebo control [Al(OH) 3], 
following a 0, 1, 6 -month vaccination schedule. According to 
the HPV -015 protocol, once the HPV -015 study was 
concluded, the control placebo group would be offered the 
HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as well.  
As recommended by [CONTACT_494021] (IDMC), unblinding and cross -over immunization 
of control recipi[INVESTIGATOR_493986]:  
• For subjects who complete study activities after the 
database is frozen for final analysis, unblinding will occur 
within [ADDRESS_635548] visit (LSLV) of 
the final  study visit.  
• Subjects who will not participate in any of the extensions 
will be given the option of unblinding before the database 
is frozen for final analysis upon individual request.  
The HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine is licensed in the 
participating countries, but it is not indicated for the age group 
(26 years and above) involved in the HPV -015 study  and this 
study . Approximately 6 00 subjects from the control placebo 
group are expected to enrol in this study . 
This study is thus being conducted to enable  all women, who 
received the control placebo in the HPV -015 study, to also 
receive HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. Safety data in 
terms of SAEs, medically significant conditions and 
pregnancy (and their outcomes) will be collected during the 
study period.  
Objective (s) • To assess the safety of the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine throughout the study period.

Adequate contraception : Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly (when a pplicable, as 
mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, 
combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable 
progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic 
vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or 
intrauterine device (IUD)  or intrauterine system (IUS), 
vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole 
male partner or male condom combined with a vaginal 
spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository) or 
male condom combined with a female diaphragm, either 
with or without a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository) .  
For azoospermia, ‘documented ’ refers to the laboratory 
report of azoospermia, required for acceptable 
documentation of successful vasectomy in the subject’s 
male partner.  
Adverse event:  Any u ntoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign ( including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For 
marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy),  abuse or 
misuse.  
Eligible:  Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

vaccine/ product:  
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product)  A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, 
including  a product with a marketing authori sation when 
used in a way different from the approved form, or when 
used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use.  
Medically Significant 
Condition:  Medically significa nt conditions are defined as AEs 
prompting emergency room or physician visits that are 
not (1) related to common diseases or (2) routine visits 
for physical examination or vaccination, or SAEs that are 
not related to common diseases.  
Common diseases includ e: upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], 
sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract 
infections,  cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual 
cycle abnormalities  and injury . 
Medically significant conditions include potential 
immune -mediated diseases (pI[CONTACT_28839] s). 
Menopause : Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation 
of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of 
reproductive potential by [CONTACT_43029]. A practical 
definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses 
with an appropriate  clinical profile at the appropriate age 
e.g. > 45 years.  
pI[INVESTIGATOR_493989] -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]) are a subset 
of Medically Significant Conditions that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or

(HPV) infection and is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women worldwide 
[Parkin , 2001a; Parkin , 2001b]. Papi[INVESTIGATOR_493992], members of the papovaviridae family, 
are non -enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of 
proliferative epi[INVESTIGATOR_493993], including benign papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603] (warts) and 
invasive cancer [ Lowy , 2001; Zur Hausen , 2002].  
Currently, over [ADDRESS_635561] basal epi[INVESTIGATOR_493994], they are 
categorized as  cutaneous or mucosal types [ Burd , 2003]. At least [ADDRESS_635562] the genital mucosa [ Bosch , 1995]. HPV types are also 
classified by [CONTACT_494024] -risk (LR) types ( e.g. HPV -6, -11, 
-42, -43, and -44) and high -risk (HR) or oncogenic  types ( e.g. HPV -16, -18, -31, -33, -34, 
-35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [ Burd , 2003]. Persistent infection 
with an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of 
cervical cancer [ Schiffman , 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and 
infection with a HR HPV typ e is supported both by [CONTACT_494025][INVESTIGATOR_493995] 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman  
2005; Burd  2003].  
The distribution of  HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV -[ADDRESS_635563] prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in 
approximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV -18 is associated with 
approximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from 
other oncogenic HPV types such as HPV -45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV 
types (HPV -16 and HPV -18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases 
globally [Clifford  2003] . 
In the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is 
between 5% and 40% [ Baseman , 2005; Franco , 1999]. This wide variation reflects 
underlying population characteristics  (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), 
the use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also di fferences in the sexual activity of 
the individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed 
countries and 15% in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], one author estimated [ADDRESS_635564] women globally [ Bosch , 2002].  
1.2. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ HPV Vaccine  
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004])  Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV 
vaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV -16 and HPV -18 formulated with AS04 ( comprised 
of aluminium hydroxide [Al(O H)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl  lipid A [MPL] ). 
The vaccine contains HPV -16 and HPV -18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an 
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment [ADDRESS_635565] cells and recombinant Baculoviruses 
encoding L1 proteins of HPV -16 and HPV -18. The recombinant expressed proteins 
undergo  self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus -like particles 
(VLPs) [ Kirnbauer , 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations 
demonstrated that the  highest antibody titres were induced by [CONTACT_113879]04 -adjuvanted vaccine 
formulations [ Giannini , 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium 
salts (Al(OH) 3) and 3 -O-desacyl -4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and  is also used in 
other vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in 
haemodialysis patients from the age of [ADDRESS_635566] one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the v accine to be  
generally well tolerated  in women of all ages [ Descamps , 2009].  In this publication ,

irrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV 
types 31, 33 and 45 [Paav onen , 2009 ]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be 
generally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different 
nationalities and ethnicities [ Paavonen , 2007 ]. 
A long -term eff icacy follow -up study in women aged [ADDRESS_635568] incident and persistent HPV -
16/18 infections and their associated cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of follow -up [Gall, 
2007; Harper , 2004 ; Harper , 2006 ; The GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV -007 Study 
Group , 2009].  
When tested in young female adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that 
were approximately 2 -fold higher than those elicited in women 15 -25 years of age 
[Pedersen , 2007]. In women up to [ADDRESS_635569] vaccine dose and these a ntibody levels 
remained significantly higher than those seen after natural infection [ Schwarz , 200 9]. 
The first major market in which the vaccine under evaluation in this study  was licensed  is 
Australia , where licensure was obtained  in May 2007 for use in 10 to 45 year old females . 
The vaccine is marketed under the  trade name [CONTACT_494069] . In September 2007, the vaccine 
was licensed in the European Union for the prevention of high -grade cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN grades 2 an d 3) and cervical cancer causally related to 
HPV types 16 and 18.  In October 2009, Cervarix  has also been approved by [CONTACT_132810] (US FDA ) for use  in females 10 through 25 years 
of age. The vaccine is currently licensed  in over 100  countries  worldwide.

1.3. Rationale for th e study  and study design  
Subjects in the HPV -015 study either received the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or 
placebo  control [Al(OH) 3], following  a 0, 1, 6 -month vaccination schedule. According to 
the HPV -015 protocol, once the HPV -015 study was concluded, the control placebo  
group would be offered the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as well.  
As recommended by [CONTACT_494026] (IDMC), 
unblinding and cross -over immunization of control recipi[INVESTIGATOR_493996]:  
• For subjects who complete study activities after the database is frozen for final 
analysis, unblinding will occur within 4-[ADDRESS_635570] visit (LSLV) 
of the final study vi sit. 
• Subjects who will not participate in any of the extensions  will be given the option of 
unblinding before the database is frozen for final analysis upon individual request.  
The HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine is licensed in the participating countries, b ut it is 
not indicated for the age group (26 years and above) involved in the HPV -015 study and 
this study. Approximately 600 subjects from the control placebo group are expected to 
enrol in this study.  
This study is thus being conducted to enable all wome n, who received the control placebo 
in the HPV -015 study, to also receive HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. Safety data in 
terms of SAEs , medically significant conditions and pregnancy (and their outcomes)  will 
be collected during the study period.

The investigator  or site staff is/are responsible during the study for the detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (A E) or 
serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol .  
Each subject  will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_494038]/ the 
subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious.  
NOTE: The term AE denotes both non -serious and serious adverse events. In this study, 
only SAEs and non -serious AEs that are medically significant conditions will be 
reported.  
8.1. Safety definitions  
8.1.1.  Definition of an adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation  subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (ne w or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Medically significan t conditions  (please refer to Section 8.1.4  for the definition of 
medically significant condition).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and /or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration.  
Examples of an AE DO NOT  include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  33 • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -
mandated procedures (i.e. inva sive procedures, modification of subject’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
Example of events to be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF:  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the 
start of the study (i. e. prior to the first study vaccination).  
NOTE: In this study, only SAEs and non -serious AEs that are medically significant 
conditions will be reported.  
8.1.2.  Definition of a serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence  that: 
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threatening . 
NB: The term ‘life -threatening’  in the definition of ‘serious’  refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might ha ve caused death, had it been  more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493998] . 
NB: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493999]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494000]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494001], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639] ’ occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NB: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza  like illness , and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject . 
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporti ng is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494002] e the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  34 Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsion s 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639] . 
8.1.3.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as  adverse  events or serious adverse events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal  assessments (e.g. ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc ) that are judged by [CONTACT_494039], as defined in Section 8.1.1  or of a SAE, as defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following 
the sta rt of the study will be reported as medically significant conditions or SAEs, if 
applicable.  
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clini cally 
significant.  
8.1.4.  Medically significant conditions  
Medically significant conditions are defined as:  
• AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that are:  
1. not related to common diseases, or  
2. not related to routine visits for physical examination or va ccination  
• SAEs that are not related to common diseases.  
Common diseases include: upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], sinusitis, pharyngitis, 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle 
abnormalities and injury.  
Medically significant conditions include pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]) are a subset of medically significant 
conditions that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic 
disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. AEs that need 
to be recorded and reported as pI[INVESTIGATOR_494003].  
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other immune -mediated diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e.

SAE, as described in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_635596] will be reported to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals as described in 
Section 8.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information f rom 
former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous

Information on pregnancies identified during screening/prior to vaccine administration is 
not required  to be collected  and communicated to safety.  
8.3. Detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse

13-JAN-2011  38 8.3.2.  Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Active questioning to detect  adverse events and serious adverse 
events  
The investigator will inquire about the occurrence of SAEs and medically s ignificant 
conditions, pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes at each visit during the study and at the 
telephone contact [CONTACT_227241] 12. 
All AEs either observed by [CONTACT_494040] a direct question will be evaluated by [CONTACT_494041]/or medically significant conditions . AEs not previously 
documented in the study will be rec orded on the Adverse Event screen within the 
subject's eCRF, if applicable . The nature of each event, date and time (where appropriate) 
of onset, outcome, intensity and relationship to the HPV vaccin e should be entered . 
Details of any corrective treatment should be recorded on the appropriate page of the 
eCRF. Refer to Section 6.6. 
As a consistent method of soliciting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:  
‘Have you felt different in any w ay since receiving the vacci ne or since the previous 
visit? ’ 
AEs already documented in the eCRF, i.e. at a previous assessment, and designated as 
“not recovered/not resolved” or “recovering/resolving” should be reviewed at subsequent 
visits, as necessary. If these have resolved, the documentation in the eCRF s hould be 
completed.  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the e vent. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE on the eCRF  or SAE screens  as applicable. It is not acceptable for the 
investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals 
instead  of the appropriate completed AE/SAE screens  in the eCRF . However, there may 
be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_494006]. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_494007].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
The electronic system using SAE screens in the eCRF will be the primary mode for 
reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals during the study period. In case this electronic 
system for reporting SAEs does not work or after freezing of the subject's eCRF, paper 
SAE Report Forms and the facsimile (Fax) system should be used to report SAEs. Refer 
to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details of the back -up reporting system.

13-JAN-2011  39 [IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Assessm ent of i ntensity  
The investigator will assess  the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all other AEs, including SAEs reported during the study. The assessment will be 
based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensi ty of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF  or SAE screen s, as applicable, 
should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activit ies. 
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which preve nts normal, everyday activities  (In 
adults/ adolescents, such an AE would, for examp le, prevent 
attendance at work/ school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category utili sed for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can 
be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational pro duct 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, based on  natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship 
of the event to the investigational product will be considered and investigated. The 
investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure and/or Product Information for 
marketed products, in the determination of his/her  assessment.  
There m ay be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the SAE to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information, amending the SAE information 
accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.

13-JAN-2011  40 Causality of all other AEs than local (injection site) reactions should be assessed by [CONTACT_494042]:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_73639] ? 
NO : The AE is not causally related to administration of the study 
vaccine(s). There are other, more likely causes and administration 
of the study vaccine(s) is not suspected to have contributed to the 
AE. 
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that th e vaccine(s) contributed to 
the AE.  
Non-serious and serious AEs will be evaluated as two distinct events. If an event meets 
criteria to be determined ‘serious’  (see Section 8.1.2  for definition of serious adverse 
event), additional examinations/tests will be performed  by [CONTACT_494043] . 
Possible contribut ing factors include:  
• Medical history  
• Other medication  
• Protocol required procedure  
• Other proced ure not required by [CONTACT_760]  
• Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable  
• Erroneous administration  
• Other cause (specify).

Outcome of any non-serious AE or SAE reported during the entire study will be assessed 
as: 
• Recovered/reso lved 
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae

  Amendment [ADDRESS_635603] for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.  
Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current [COMPANY_004] policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator safety report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the investigational product and unexp ected. The 
purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the 
product under investigation.  
8.4.3.  Completion and transmission of SAEs reports to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals  
Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator will complete and submit the information in the SAE screens in eCRF within 
[ADDRESS_635604] all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying [COMPANY_004] of the event and completing the 
SAE screens in eCRF. The SAE screens in eCRF should be upda ted when additional  
relevant  information is received WITHIN 24 HOURS . 
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.

information in the SAE  screens of the eCRF WITHIN 24 HOURS after the he/she 
becomes aware of the diagnosis. A field on the SAE screen allows to specify that the 
event is a pI[INVESTIGATOR_348593]. The SAE screens will always be 
completed as thoroughly as p ossible with all available details of the event, in accordance 
with the pI[INVESTIGATOR_159216]. Even if the investigator does not have all 
information regarding a pI[CONTACT_28839], the SAE screens should still be completed within 24 
hours. Once additiona l relevant information is received, the SAE screens in the eCRF 
should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.

Investigators will follow -up subjects:  
• With SAEs or subjects withdrawn from the study as a result of an AE, until the event 
has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeare d, or until the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
• Or, in the case of other non -serious AEs  (medically significant conditions only) , until 
they complete the study  or the y are lost to follow -up.   
Clinically significant labo ratory abnormalities  will be followed up until they have 
returned to normal, or a satisfactory explanation has been provided. Additional 
information (including but not limited to laboratory results) relative to the subsequent 
course of such abnormalit ies noted for any subject must be made available to the Site 
Monitor.  
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests  and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals will be provided with a copy of any available post -mortem find ings, 
inclu ding histopathology.  
8.5. Treatment of adverse events  
Treatment of any adverse event is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according 
to current good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of an 
AE should be recorded in the s ubject’s eCRF . Refer to Section 6.6. 
8.6. Unblinding  
Not applicable.  
8.7. Emergency unblinding  
This study will be open label, i.e. both the investigator and the subject  will be aware of 
the vaccine being administered to the  subjects. Therefore, the information given 
hereunder is limited to the unblinding of SAEs to any third parties (e.g. any doctor other 
than the study investigator), in accordance with [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ standard operating 
procedures.

principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent 
with GC P and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (verifying continuing compliance 
with the protocol, amendment(s), reviewing the investigational product accountability 
records, verifying that the site staff and facilities continue to be adequate to conduct t he 
study ).  
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.  
Direct access to all study -site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDE review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By [CONTACT_494059].

applicable regulations, GCP, and [COMPANY_004] procedures.  
11.3.  Archiving of d ata at study sites  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all site study records in a 
safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely 
retrieval, when needed ( e.g. audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any 
subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting 
systems, and staff. Where permitted by [CONTACT_5751]/regulations or in stitutional policy, 
some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard copy 
(e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic for studies with an eCRF); however, caution needs 
to be exercised before such action is taken. The investiga tor must assure that all 
reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original  and meet 
accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. 
Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an acce ptable back -up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these 
reproductions.  
[COMPANY_004] will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply with all applicable regulatory  requirements. However, the 
investigator/institution should seek the written approval of the sponsor before proceeding 
with the disposal of these records. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that site for the study, as  dictated by [CONTACT_91359], any institutional 
requirements or applicable laws or regulations, or [COMPANY_004] standards/procedures; otherwise, 
the minimum retention period will default to 15 years.  
The investigator/institution must notify [COMPANY_004] of any changes in the archi val 
arrangements, including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, 
transfer of ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site.  
11.4.  Audits  
To ensure compliance  with GCP and all applicable regulatory requir ements, [COMPANY_004] may 
conduct a quality assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory 
inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after 
completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the inve stigator and institution 
agree to allow th e auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and

Rationale/background for changes:  
Due to their potent immune s timulating effect, there are theoretical concerns that 
modern adjuvants like [COMPANY_004] Biologicals' novel adjuvant systems might result in 
undesirable effects on the body's immune system, which could include onset of new or 
exacerbation of underlying autoimmune diseases in particular. Accordingly, a 
heightened surveillance on the occurrence of any such conditions in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_494016]. Protocol 
amendment 1 was hence developed to impleme nt reporting of potential immune -

41. REPORTING & A NALYSIS PLAN SYNPOSIS
Overview Key Elements of the RAP
Purpose This reporting and analysis plan (RAP) details all planned analyses and outputs 
required for the fina l Clinical Study Report (CSR) of study 204471.
The critical components RAP was completed onthe10thFebruary 2016.  This 
document represents the final RAP and will be provided to the study team 
members to convey the content of the Statistical Analysis Complete (SAC) 
deliverable .
Protocol This RAP is based on protocol amendment 1 (Dated: 23-MAR- 2016) for study 
204471 ([COMPANY_004] Document No.: 2015N243304_01 )and the latest version of the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) [eCRF Version 2.1].
Primary 
Objective To determine in a pragmatic setting whether there is an improvement in asthma 
control , from the beginning to the end of the study, when directly switched from 
omalizumab to mepolizumab in subjects with a severe eosinophilic asthma 
phenotype not optimally controlled on omalizumab.
Primary 
EndpointMean change from baseline in ACQ -5 score at Week 32
Study 
DesignAn open label, single arm, 32 -week treatment, multi- center study in subjects with 
severe eosinophilic asthma not optimally controlled with current omalizumab 
treatment who are switched from omalizumab to mepolizumab 100mg 
administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks.
Approximately 120 subjects are expected to be treated with open label 
mepolizumab.
Planned 
AnalysesNo interim analysis of data is planned for this study.
A complete analysis in accordance with all study objectives and endpoints will be 
performed after all subjects have completed the study.
Decisions regarding the analys es, specified in this RAP document, will be made 
prior to Database Freeze of the study data.
Analysis 
PopulationsThe ‘All Subjects Enrolled’ population will be used to summarise Screen and run -
in failures.
The ‘Intent -to-Treat’ population will be used as the primary population to
summarise the study population, and to evaluate efficacy, safety and 
PD/Biomarkers. 
The ‘Per Protocol’ population will also be used as a supporting population to 
evaluate efficacy. Subjects excluded will have protocol deviations considered to 
potentially have an effect on efficacy.
Hypothesis As there is no control arm within this study, comparisons in ACQ score will be 
made back to baseline . 
The potential of a ‘placebo effect’ within the mepolizumab treated subjects was 
considered when the study was de signed and was estimated as an improvement 
of -0.55 from baseline in ACQ score, based on placebo subjects within historical 
mepolizumab severe asthma studies. However, when only previous Xolair users 
were considered, an improvement of -0.11 from baseline in ACQ score was 
observed. 
This study is designed to test the superiority of mepolizumab [ADDRESS_1101819] the
historical ‘placebo effect s’estimated from previous mepolizumab studies . 
Significanc e tests will be performed at the two -sided 5% alpha level (one -sided 
2.5%).
Primary 
AnalysesACQ -5 score will be analysed using a mixed models repeated measures 
analyses allowing for covariates of region, use of baseline maintenance oral 
corticosteroids t herapy (OCS vs no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the 
study (as an ordinal variable), and visit(including baseline visit) .
Secondary 
AnalysesSGRQ score will be analysed using a mixed models repeated measures analysis 
as for ACQ -5.
Frequency of clinically significant asthma exacerbations will be analysed using a 
negative binomial regression analysis 
Blood eosinophil count will be analysed using a mixed model repeated measures 
analysis after log transformation
Safety 
AnalysisSafety data includi ng adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and immunogenicity data will be summarised 
descriptively.

2.1. Changes to the Protocol Defined Statistical A nalysis Plan
Statistical a nalysis chan gesto the originally  planned statistical anal ysis specified in the 
protocol amendment 1 (Dated: 23- MAR -2016) ([COMPANY_004] Document No.: 2015N243304_01)
are outlined in Table 1. 
Table 1 Changes to Protocol De fined Statistical A nalysis Plan
Protocol Reporting & Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan Statistical Analysis Plan Rational for Changes
Analysis of change from baseline 
in ACQ, SQRQ scores will be 
performed using a mixed models 
repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis, allowing for covariates of 
baseline ACQ score, region, 
baseline maintenance OCS 
therapy, exacerbations in the year 
prior to the study (as an ordinal 
variable), visit and an interaction 
term for visit by [CONTACT_798804].
Clinically significant exacerbations 
will be analyzed using a 
generalized linear model with 
covariates for region, baseline 
maintenance OCS therapy and 
number of exacerbations in the 
year prior to the study (as an 
ordinal variable).Baseline values will be 
included as adata poin tin the 
analysis , and there will be no 
covariate adjustment made in 
the model. The change from 
the baseline at Visit X will be 
calculated by:
[CONTACT_798805] X 
minus  Estimated S core at
Baseline .
Clinically significant 
exacerbations will be examined 
using a generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) with no 
adjustments for covariates .This is a single 
treatment arm study 
and comparisons are 
being made directly to 
the baseline values.
Generalised 
estimating equations 
(GEEs) will compare 
the on- treatment 
exacerbation rate to 
the rate within the 12 
months prior to study .

92.3. Study  Design
Overview of Study Design and Key Features
Design 
FeaturesAn open label, single arm, 32 -week treatment, multi- center study in subjects 
with severe eosinophilic asthma not optimally controlled with current 
omalizumab treatment who are switched from omalizumab to mepolizumab 
100mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks.
Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are receiving omalizumab, but 
are not optimally controlled will be eligible to participate and will be identified 
through the ACQ -5 with a screening (Visit 1) and baseline (Visit 2) score of 
≥1.5 and a history of ≥[ADDRESS_1101820] 12 months.
Dosing Subjects will remain on their current maintenance therapy throughout the run -in 
period, including Omalizumab. At Visit 2 subjects will discontinue their 
Omalizumab treatment and be switched to open -label mepolizumab (100 mg 
SC) every 4 weeks for 32 weeks (there is no wash- out period between the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) . If patients require any additional maintenance therapy (except for 
omalizumab), they will remain receiving it throughout the treatment period.
Treatment 
AssignmentAt week 0 (Visit 2) approximately [ADDRESS_1101821] dose being given at 
week 28 (Visit 9). A web based interactive system RAMOS NG will be used to 
dispense mepolizumab from Visit 2 to Visit 9.
Planned 
AnalysisNo interim analysis of data is planned for this st udy.
A complete analysis in accordance with all study objectives and endpoints will 
be performed after all subjects have completed the study.
Decisions regarding the analyses, specified in this RAP document, will be 
made prior to Database Freeze of the stu dy data.
2.4. Statistical Hy potheses
This study  is designed to investigate whether subjects not optimally  controlled on 
omalizumab can be effectively  and safel y switched to treatment with mepolizumab to 
improve asthma control. As there is no control arm in th is study , comparisons in ACQ -[ADDRESS_1101822] h ypothesis to be tested will be for superiority of 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC treatment vs. baseline.

A supporting sensitivity analysis of the Per Protocol (PP) population will also be performed.
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed for all subgroups listed within 
Section 10.10.[ADDRESS_1101827]
We will perform two separate analyses of the primary  endpoint comparing to a historical 
‘placebo effect ’. 
Firstly , as specified in the protocol, a meta -analysis of previous exacerbation double-
blind studies, MEA112997 and MEA115588, g avean estimate of -0.55 (SE: 0.05), for 
the improvement in the ACQ -5 score for placebo subjects at Week 32 compared to 
baseline .The observed improvement in this study  for following me polizumab treatment
will be compared to this historical improvement on placebo.
Secondly , a meta -analysis has been performed of subjects within studies MEA115588 
and 200862 who report edprevious Xolair use, which may represent a more comparable 
population for this study .Study  200862 has completed since the protocol was finalised 
and previous Xolair usage was not collected in study  MEA112997.

8.2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are adverse events associated with th e 
identified and potential risks of mepolizumab. AESI s of anaphy laxis reactions, sy stemic 
reactions, and local injection site reactions are collected via targeted eCRF within the 
study . Events captured on the eCRF as s ystemic reactions will be further cate gorized as 
allergic/h ypersensitivity  reactions or non -allergic reactions. Events with preferred terms 
such as injection related reaction or administration related reaction will be considered 
non-allergic reactions. All remaining events will be considered a llergic/h ypersensitivity  
reactions. 
AESI s of opportunistic infections, malignancies, serious CVT events and serious 
ischemic events will be identified from a list of relevant preferred terms maintained 
within a project level reference dataset created base d on the MedDRA dictionary  
available at the time of database freeze for this study, further details of how relevant 
preferred terms are identified are given in the Program Safety Analysis Plan (PSAP).
Separate summary  tables showing the number and percent of subjects with each t ype of 
AESI , broken down by  [CONTACT_798813]. I nformation will be reported as 
part of the standard AE tables for AESIs of infections, serious infections, neoplasms, 
cardiac disorders and serious cardiac disorders. 
For each t ype of AESI a profile summary table will be produced containing information 
which would include, but not be limited to, the number of occurrences of the event, event 
characteristics, time to onset, intensity , outcome and action taken.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity
Immunogenicit y is a measure of the immune response to a therapeuti c drug (e.g. a 
monoclonal antibody ) resulting in generation of anti -drug antibodies. Clinical samples 
are tested in a sequence of binding anti- drug antibody  (ADA) and neutralising antibody  
assay s:
a)Screening assay . Each sample is tested for the presence of anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA assay ) and initially  declared positive or negative according to assay cut -off 
criteria. Negative samples are not tested further.Positive samples are then tested in 
the confirmation ADA assay . 
b)Confirmation assay . Each positive sam ple from the screening assay  is either 
confirmed positive in this assay  (ADA assay ), or is declared negative and are not 
tested further. Positive ADA samples are then tested in the titer assay  and 
neutralization (NAb) assay .
c)Titration assay . Each positive sample from the ADA confirmation assay  is serially  
diluted to provide a titre, corresponding to the highest dilution factor that still 
yields a positive test result.
d)Neutralising assay . Each positive sample from the ADA confirmation assay is 
tested with the neutralising antibod y assay  and found as either positive or negative 
in this assay  (NAb assay ).
The mepolizumb ADA (screening/confirmation/titration) assay  version 2011N122789 is 
performed at a Alliance Pharma (method 120711M01.V02). The  mepolizumb Nab assay  
version 2011n129752 is being performed within [COMPANY_004].
A table will be produced summarising the number and percentage of negative and 
confirmed positive subjects ADA samples b y treatment group and visit in the ITT 
population. The table will also summaris e the highest assay  result obtained post -
baseline for each subject.
A similar table will also be produced summarising results for the neutralising 
antibody  assay  in the ITT Population, by  [CONTACT_6982].

All immunogenicity  results ( i.e. ADA screening and confirmatory  assay  results, titre 
values, neutralising antibody  results and observed mepolizumab concentration) will

[PHONE_16661].3. Appendix 3: Assessment Windows & Visit Slotting
10.3.1. Assessment Windows
Clinic visits are scheduled to take place as specified in Appendix 2: Time & Events . 
Measurements outside visit windows will not be excluded from anal yses. For all clinic 
visits, nominal visit day s and times will be used for reporting, such that if a subject 
recorded values that were outside of the ±7 day  window for a visit they  will still be 
reported under that visit.
10.3.2. Early  Withdrawa l / Treatment Discontinuation Visits
If a subject withdraws from the study  at a scheduled visit (i.e. completes an Earl y 
Withdrawal 
or Treatment Discontinuation Visit), where endpoint data were scheduled to 
be collected, the data will be summarised and ana lysed (as appropriate) together with data 
from subjects who did not withdraw from the study . If a subject withdraws from the study  
at a scheduled visit at which endpoint data were not scheduled to be collected, or if a 
subject withdraws between scheduled v isits, data will be slotted to the nearest adjacent 
visit where the endpoint data was scheduled to be collected (if data at that visit were not 
recorded) according to the Time and Events schedule ( Appendix 2: Time & Events ). 
For example, if a subject prematurel y withdraws from the study  and completed the Earl y 
Withdrawal Visit at Visit 6 (Week 16) and completes an Earl y Withdrawal Visit which 
includes an FEV 1assessment, the FEV 1data collected will need to be re -assigned to an 
adjacent visit where FEV 1data is scheduled for collection. In this case the FEV 1data will 
be reassigned to Visit 5 (Week 12) (if data at that visit were not recorded) as this is the 
closest nominal visit at which collection of FEV 1data is scheduled.
10.3.3. Unscheduled Visits
For unscheduled visits, similar logic will be applied. If a subject has an unscheduled 
assessment then this data would be slotted to the closest adjacent scheduled visit but only  
if information alread y exists at that visit. If an unscheduled visit occurred between two 
scheduled visits for which data has been reported, then the data from the unscheduled 
visit will remain in the unscheduled visit and will not be used in summary tables and 
analyses (except for endpoints using any  post -baseline data) but will be presented in an y 
relevant listings.

All data will be reported according to the actual treatment the subject received unless 
otherwise stated.
The reported precis ion (decimal places) will follow the IDSL statistical principles but may be 
adjusted to a clinically interpretable number of decimal places . 
Planned and Actual Time
Reporting for tables, figures and formal statistical analyses :
Nominal visits (p lanned time relative to dosing) will be used in figures, summaries, 
statistical analyses and calculation of any derived parameters, unless otherwise stated.
The impact of any major deviation from the planned assessment times and/or scheduled 
visit days on the ana lyses and interpretation of the results will be assessed as appropriate.
Reporting for Data Listings: 
Planned and actual time relative to study drug dosing will be shown in listings (Refer to 
IDSL Statistical Principle 5.05.1).
Unscheduled or unplanned re adings will be presented within the subject’s listings. 
Scheduled v isits outside the protocol defined time- windows (i.e. recorded as protocol 
deviations) will be included in listings, summaries and statistical analyses.
Unscheduled Visits
When possible unscheduled assessments will be slotted to the closest adjacent scheduled 
visit. If an unscheduled visit occurs between two completed scheduled visits, the data from the 
unscheduled visit will not be used in summary tables which are based on by -visit asses sments.

10.6.1. General
Multiple Measurements at One Time Point
There are no scheduled multiple measurements, however, if multiple measurements are 
recorded at a given time point the following process will b e followed, unless a process for
selection of the measurement for the visit is specified:
Mean of the measurements will be calculated and used in any derivation of summary statistics
but if listed, all data will be presented.
Subjects having both High and Low values for Normal Ranges at any post -baseline visits for 
safety parameters will be counted in both the High and Low categories of “Any visit post -

Age
Only year of birth was collected for subjects; actual birth data was not collected.
[COMPANY_004] standard IDSL algorithms will be used for calculating age where the birth date of all 
subjects will be imputed as ‘30th June’.
Birth date will be presented in listings as ‘YYYY’.
Each subject’s derived age will be calculated as an integer value based on their imputed date of 
birth relative to the date of the subject’s screening visit (Visit 1).

FEV 1/FVC Ratio
Pre- and post -bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC ratio will be calculated as the ratio of the FEV 1and FVC 
values.
Length of Omalizumab (Xolair) Use
Number of days exposed to Oma lizumab (Xolair) will be calculated based on the formula:  
For subjects receiving Omalizumab (Xolair) monthly:
Duration of Exposure in Days = Last Omalizumab dose –(First Omalizumab dose) + 29
For subjects receiving Omalizumab (Xolair) twice monthly:
Duration of Exposure in Days = Last Omalizumab dose –(First Omalizumab dose) + 15
Baseline OCS daily dose
Only corticosteroids administered via oral, intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes are to 
be considered when calculating a subject ’s total dai ly prednisone/prednisolone asthma 
maintenance dose at baseline. All steroids administered via a sublingual route will also be 
considered as oral. 
The corticosteroid conversion factors shown below will be used, regardless of the route of 
administration, to scale each corticosteroid dose to a prednisone equivalent dose. These three 
routes of administration (oral, IV and IM) are to be considered equivalent as it has been noted 
that the bioavailability of methylprednisolone is considered to be roughly equivale nt following 
administration as an oral, IV or IM steroid.

Patient Reported Outcomes/Questionnaires
ACQ -5
Each question on the ACQ -5is scored on a 7 -point scale from 0 = no impairment to 6 =
maximum impairment. The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ -5score will be the 
mean of the 5questions, thus giving a score between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely 
uncontrolled) [Juniper , 1999 ; Juniper , 2005 ].
If a subject does not complete 1 of the 5questions at a visit, then the ACQ -5score will be the
mean of the responses to the remaining 4questions at that visit.
If a subject does not complete more than 1 of the 5questions at a visit, then their ACQ -5score
will be set to missing at that visit.
A subject will be deem ed a responder if the subject has a ≥0.5 reduction in ACQ score from 
Baseline. ACQ -5 Responder/Non -responder category will be missing if the overall ACQ -[ADDRESS_1101849] George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)
The SGRQ comprises 50 questions with a recall period of 4 weeks.
Scores are expressed as the percentage of overall impairment with [ADDRESS_1101850].
Scoring of each domain of the SGRQ (Symptoms, Activity, Impacts) and the Total score are 
described in the St George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68153] (Version 2.3).

blood eosinophil count, where applicable, prior to log transforming the data (Note: this 
imputation has typi[INVESTIGATOR_638335] 0.5 * 0.01 GI/L =  0.005 GI/L for pr evious mepolizumab studies). 
10.6.4. Safety
Extent of Exposure
Number of days of exposure to study drug will be calculated based on the formula:  
Duration of Exposure in Days = Last mepolizumab dose –(First mepolizumab dose) + 29
The extent of exposure will also be summarised as the number of study treatments 
administered 
Adverse Events
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_1101852] (AESIs) of anaphylaxis reactions, systemic reactions, and local 
injection site reactions are collected via targeted eCRF.  Systemic reactions with preferred terms 
such as injection related reaction or administration related reaction will be consi dered non -allergic 
reactions; those with other preferred terms will be considered allergic/hypersensitivity reactions.
The AESIs of opportunistic infections, malignancies, serious CVT events and serious ischemic 
events will be identified from a list of rel evant preferred terms maintained within a project level 
reference dataset; created based on the latest version of the MedDRA dictionary available at the 
time of database freeze for this study (See Program Safety Analysis Plan for additional details).
ECG Parameters
RR Interval
All ECG parameters required in this study will be databased, and therefore, further derivations will 
not be performed by [CONTACT_798818]. The definitions of these parameters are given in this 
section.
If RR interval (msec) is not databased, then RR can be derived as :
[1]IfQTcB is machine read & QTcF is not provided, then :
[2]If QTcF is machine read and QTcB is not provided, then: 
If ECGs are manually read, the RR value should be a collected value and will not be derived.
Corrected QT Intervals
When not databased, corrected QT intervals by [CONTACT_35019]’s (QTcB) and Fredericia’s (QTcF) 
formulas will be calculated, in msec, depending on the availability of other measurements.
If RR interval (msec) is provided then missing QTcB and /or QTcF will be derived as :

49ECG Parameters
Individual maximum QTc(F) and QTc(B) values will also be summarised by [CONTACT_798819] (msec) in the 
following categories:
 <= 450
 450 < t o <= 480
 480 < to <= 500
 > 500 
Additionally, individual maximum changes from baseline in QTc(F) and QTc(B) values will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_798820] (msec) in the follow ing categories: 
 < -60
 ≥ -60 to < -30
 ≥ -30 to < 0
 ≥  0 to < 30
 ≥  30 to < 60
 ≥ 60
Laboratory Parameters
If a laboratory value which is expected to have a numeric value for summary purposes, has a 
non-detectable level reported in the database (values b elow the lower limit of quantification), 
where the numeric value is missing, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a character value starting with ‘<x’ or ‘>x’ (or 
indicated as less than x or greater than x in the comment field) is present, the lower limit of 
quantification for t hat particular parameter will be used to impute the corresponding numeric 
value as half the lower limit of quantification for that measure (LLQ/2).
The above imputation of half the lower limit of quantification for that measure (LLQ/2) will also 
be applied to all biomarker parameters.
Regarding blood eosinophil laboratory data please reference Section 10.6.3 .

Data
10.7.1. Premature Withdrawals
Element Reporting D etail
General A subject will be considered to have completed study treatment if he/she 
receives study treatment at Visit 9 (Week 28) and completes the Visit 10/Exit 
Visit (Week 32). 
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if they continu e to 
participate in the study until the Exit Visit assessments have been completed 
(regardless of whether the subject completed the study treatment schedule).
Subjects who discontinue study treatment or withdraw early will not be replaced 
in the study.
Thenumber of subjects who discontinue study treatment or withdraw early will 
be summarised and listed.
All available data from subjects who were withdrawn from the study will be listed 
and all available data up to and including the date of early withdrawal w ill be 
included in summary tables and figures, unless otherwise specified.
Pre-Screen 
Failures, 
Screen 
Failures 
and Run -in 
FailuresFor the purposes of this study pre -screen failures, screen failures and run -in failures 
will be defined as follows:
Subjects will be assigned a study number at the time of signing the informed 
consent (Pre -screen Visit). Subjects who do not progress to the Screening Visit 
will be deemed a pre-screen failure .
Those subjects that complete at least one additional Visit 1 (Screeni ng) 
procedure but do not enter the run -in period will be designated as screen 
failures.
Those subjects that enter the run -in but do not subsequently receive study 
treatment will be designated as run-in failures.
10.7.2. Handling of Missing Data
Element Reporting Detail
General Missing data occurs when any requested data is not provided, leading to blank 
fields on the collection instrument :
oThese data will be indicated by [CONTACT_2224] a “blank” in subject listing displays. 
Unless all data for a specific visit are missing in which case the data is 
excluded from the listing . 
oAnswers such as “Not applicable” and “Not evaluable” are not considered to 
be missing data and should be displayed as missing . 
oResults which are found to be below the limit of quantification (BLQ) are not 
missing data and will be included in all displays. See S ection 10.6 for the 
handling of this data.
The ACQ- 5 score will be considered as missing if <4 items of the questionnaire 
2017N328770_00 CONFIDENTIA L

51Element Reporting Detail
are completed at a vi sit. ACQ -5 Responder/Non -responder category will be 
missing if the overall ACQ -5 score is missing.
If a blood eosinophil count of zero is reported, it will be imputed with half of the 
lowest possible blood eosinophil count, where applicable, prior to log 
transforming the data (Note: this imputation has typi[INVESTIGATOR_638335] 0.5 * 0.01 GI/L = 
0.005 GI/L for previous mepolizumab studies).
Missing values will not be imputed for any of the other endpoints.
Outliers Any subjects excluded from the summaries and/or stat istical analyses will be 
documented along with the reason for exclusion in the clinical study report.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Handling of Missing or Partial Dates
Element Reporting Detail
General The eCRF allows for the possibility of missing or partial dates (i.e., only month
and year is captured) to be recorded for event start and end dates.
The recorded missing or partial date will be displayed in listings as captured.
Concomitant 
MedicationsPartial dates for any concomitant medications recorded in the CRF will be 
imputed using the following convention: 
oIf the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month
oIf the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'D ec' will be used for the month. 
Adverse 
Events, 
ExacerbationsAny partial dates for adverse events and exacerbations will be raised to data 
management. If the full date cannot be ascertained, the following assumptions 
will be made:
oIf the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month. 
oHowever, if these result in a date prior to the start of treatment and the 
event could possibly have occurred during treatment from the partial 
information, then the stud y treatment start date will be assumed to be the 
start date and hence the event is considered On- treatment (worst case), 
as per Appendix 4 : Treatment Phases .
oIf the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month.
The above listed imputations will also be applied when calculating the time to 
onset and the duration of the event containing missing or partial start and end 
dates.
Start or end dates which are completely missing (i.e. no year specified) will 
remain missing, with no imputation applied. Consequently, time to onset and 
duration of such events will be missing.

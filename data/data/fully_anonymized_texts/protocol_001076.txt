  1 INTRODUCTION  
Pelex , Inc. is a medical device company that is dedicated to addressing pelvic health 
disorders. The company is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a non- invasive medical device that uses 
electromyography and neurostimulation to treat incontinence and other pelvic floor disorders.  
In support of its research and development efforts, Pelex is conducting a clinical study to 
assess the efficacy and usability of the electromyography component of the company’s pelvic health product . Five patients suffering from stress urinary incontinence, a  form of pelvic 
floor disorder,  will be recruited to participate and the duration of participation is expected to 
be four weeks . The result of this study will be used to verify that the underlying technology 
functions as expected, identify subject preferen ces for device form factor and other design 
decisions, and capture other patient feedback.  
[ADDRESS_398572] interface 
approximately 12” x 6” whose upper surface is  embedded with disposable electrodes  which 
by a short cable is linked to an enclosed circuit board component . When a pati ent interacts 
with the patient contact [CONTACT_322709] , the electrodes of the sensor array are able 
to detect and measure the patient’s muscle contractions. The circuit board component 
analyzes the collected data and provides feedback to the patient on sensor array placement 
and strength of muscle contractions via a user interface panel consisting of LED s that is 
located on a handheld pi[INVESTIGATOR_322689] a fixed cable.   
The handheld component also houses a cadence LED, which prompts the user through a series of standardized pelvic floor contraction  and relaxation exercises.  
2.2 Proposed Intended Use Statement  
The Pelex Upp  is a non- invasive  electromyography de vice designed to treat stress urinary 
incontinence in adults.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The principal objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of the Pelex Upp  in treatment 
of stress urinary incontinence.  The s econdary objective will be to determine ease  of use of 
the Pelex Upp by [CONTACT_309502].  
 
  4 STUDY OVERVIEW  
4.1 Study  Approach  
Urinary incontinence (UI), as defined by [CONTACT_322710], is among the most  prevalent of all medical conditions, affecting one 
in four adult women and increasing in incidence with age  (1).  Stress urina ry incontinence  
(SUI), which is the involuntary loss of urine during exertion, sneezing or coughing, is the 
most common form of UI (2) and is estimated to be responsible for over $12 Billion in health 
care expenditures annually (3).  SUI is typi[INVESTIGATOR_284411] r esult of weakening of the pelvic floor 
muscles and atrophy of vaginal tissues, both of which occur increasingly with age and after 
childbirth(4).  
         Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322690] (PFM), and can be understood as lying on a spectrum between more 
conservative and more invasive options.  First line (conservative) therapy for SUI typi[INVESTIGATOR_322691], such as more frequent urinating to avoid larger bladder  
volumes, in addition to some form of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)(2), while more invasive options, such as surgery to reconstruct the pelvic floor, are reserved for patients who have failed first line therapy.  
The goal of PFMT is to increase the st rength, coordination and endurance of PFM, 
which allows for stabilization of the urethra and pelvic organs during rises in intra -abdominal 
pressure(5), thereby [CONTACT_322711].  PFMT in the form of Kegel exercises is a well- established form of treatment for urinary incontinence (6), and 
success rates with PFMT for UI approach 84% in selected patients (7; 8), which, combined with their relative simplicity, make them a highly desirable and often -used treatment option.  
Most simply, PFMT is performed in the form of daily timed contractions and relaxations of 
the pelvic floor, typi[INVESTIGATOR_322692] a trained 
professional during a clinic visit (9).  While this has been proven to improve SU I symptoms 
over behavioral therapy alone, PFMT with biofeedback, where a device is used to record the 
biological signal of contraction of the PFM and then present that signal to the user in audio or 
visual form, has been proven to offer even greater benefi t that PFMT alone(10).  Biofeedback 
in the setting of PFMT is accomplished by [CONTACT_322712], or an intravaginal device sensitive to pressure changes, 
both of which can detect contraction and relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles  and allows the 
user to then gain greater awareness of their PFM.  Patients undergoing PFMT plus biofeedback typi[INVESTIGATOR_322693] a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], 
usually over the course of four to six weeks.  
         There is a robust body of evidence supporting use of biofeedback during PFMT in the 
treatment of all forms of urinary incontinence.  In a systematic review in 2011, Herdershee et 
al(10) evaluated all randomized controlled trials (RCT ) that compared PFMT alone to PFMT 
plus various types of feedback, including biofeedback, in treatment of urinary incontinence in women, and found across all studies, patients treated with PFMT plus biofeedback were 
significantly more likely to report impr ovement or resolution of their urinary incontinence, 
 
  though the authors pointed out that the results also could be partially attributable to more 
contact [CONTACT_271941] (10).  In another recent analysis, Glazer et al (11), using 
more inclusive inclusion criteria, also found a general benefit to biofeedback for treatment of 
urinary incontinence when compared not only to PFMT alone, but also medications and 
electrical stimulation.  However, a more recent meta -analysis was more equivocal in its 
findings, with significantly better objective results, such as pad tests, in patients undergoing 
PFMT plus biofeedback, but with not as clear a difference in subjective quality of life (QoL) 
measures as compared to PFMT alone (12).  
         While PFMT plus bi ofeedback has traditionally been performed in a medical facility, 
whether it be a clinician’s office or physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s, more recent research has looked to 
leverage the ability to perform biofeedback at home to improve outcomes.  This movement 
has been aided by [CONTACT_322713], and thus avoid the need for 
recurrent trips to the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322694]’s office.  In a recent study, use of a home 
biofeedback device was found to be as efficacious as a standard twelve week PFM T program 
with four weekly visits to a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322695] (13).  In pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], other devices have also shown promising rates of 
improvement in urinary incontinence when used at home and without other PFMT training 
(14).  The use of medical devices to perform biofeedback at home is not only much more 
convenient than typi[INVESTIGATOR_322696], it has the potent ial to increase access to 
treatment overall.  In a study by [CONTACT_322714], over one third of patients referred to a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322697], with lack of insurance 
being the variable most associated with non- participation in treatment (15).  Considering that 
the out-of-pocket  cost of an initial physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322698] $500 (15), while most 
of the devices designed for home biofeedback use are priced several hundred dollars less 
(13), these devices coul d greatly expand treatment capability.  
         However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_322699], there are still significant 
barriers to use.  Due to the way biofeedback in conjunction with PFMT must be performed, 
specifically capture of the contract ion and relaxation of the  PFM, devices designed for use in 
these setting are either invasive (inserted into the vagina or rectum) or require placement by a trained professional (surface EMG electrodes).  This presents a barrier to use for patients, and 
an opportunity for innovation.  Specifically, the product under investigation, the Pelex Upp  is 
designed for use at home for biofeedback plus PFMT sessions.  It has a non- invasive patient 
interface that takes advantage of the unique anatomical properties of the perineum, the skin 
betw een the anus and vagina or scrotum, allowing the patient to perform PFMT plus 
biofeedback without the need for invasive devices or professionally placed electrodes.  
         The aim of the present pi[INVESTIGATOR_322700] a home setting.  Since PFMT plus biofeedback is considered standard of 
care in patients with SUI who are therapy -naïve, the study subjects will be exposed to no 
greater than normal risk associated with treatment.  Study subjects will u ndergo evaluation 
by a treating physician and will have prescribed a treatment regimen typi[INVESTIGATOR_322701].  
  4.[ADDRESS_398573]’s involvement in the study will be limited to the period between signing of the informed consent form (ICF) and the end of the study, which is expected to be 
four weeks after study initiation.   
5.2.[ADDRESS_398574] ivities  
The study is anticipated to continue for approximately four  weeks, excluding study 
enrollment period . In the event that additional studies are going to be conducted, new 
protocols will be developed specifically for those studies.  
 
 
  5.3 Patient Selection  
The eligibility criteria for prospective enrollment of subjects are shown in Table 1 .  
Table 1.  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Enrollment of Subjects  
Inclusion criteria  Female  
[ADDRESS_398575] two LED 
systems, a power switch and battery compartment for housing of the power source.  The two LED systems will include a “cadence” LED, which flashes in a pre- set pattern for the user to 
follow with contractions of their own pelvic floor muscles.  It will also include a “ response” 
LED, which allows the user to visualized the contracti on of their pelvic floor muscles.  The 
sensor array is disposable, and several replacement sensor arrays will be included, and can be changed at the user’s discretion.  
The Pelex Upp is completely non- invasive and made of hypoallergenic, non- latex materials.  
 
   
 
6.1.2 Safety issues 
The device under investigation is completel y non- invasive, and qualifies as a non- significant 
risk device based on Title 21 CFR 812.2 (c).  Safety issues would include skin abrasions  and 
contact [CONTACT_322715], which has a 
mild adhesive applied to it  
6.1.[ADDRESS_398576] of the 
study. All devices will be logged into the device accountability log. If a device is used in the investigation it will be documented in the device accountability log. Devices returned to the 
Sponsor will be noted as such in the device accountability log. A final accounting of devices will be being presented in the final clinical study report.  
The Investigator shall permit an investigational device to be used only in subjects enrolled in the study. The Investigator shall not supply an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it.  
The Investigator or designee shall document receipt, use, and disposition of the device as it 
relates to:  
• The quantity of the device, dates of receipt, catalogue and lot numbers;  
• The names  of all persons who received each device; and  
• Why and how many units of the device have been returned to Sponsor or otherwise 
have left the possession of the Investigator.  
The devices must be stored separately from other clinical supplies. Opened, unused devices 
must be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on site as directed by [CONTACT_1034].  
The use of the study device outside of this protocol is prohibited. Each investigational site will 
identify a designee who will be held responsible for controlling t he devices and ensuring that 
a device is dispensed only for the purposes of this study. This designee will be expected to retain all unused study supplies until the completion of the study and/or until a representative 
of the Sponsor has inventoried and ma de arrangements to return the supplies to the Sponsor. 
Upon completion or termination of this investigation or the Investigator’s part of this 
investigation, or at the request of the Sponsor, the Investigator shall return any remaining 
supply of the device  or otherwise dispose of the device as directed by [CONTACT_1034].

7.2.1 Collection of data  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of source documents in this study include medical records, memoranda, evaluation checklists, CRF worksheets, and Data Capture 
An Electronic Data Captur e (EDC) system using an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) that 
is compliant with [ADDRESS_398580]; the 
Investigator’s electronic signature [INVESTIGATOR_152428] a testament of the Investigator’s responsibility 
for ensuring that all clinical data entered on the eCRFs are co mplete, accurate, and authentic.  
Subjects will be identified in the EDC by a numeric code used for study purposes.  Subjects 
are not identified by [CONTACT_2300].  Data entry staff are expected to follow data protection practices.  
All procedures for the handling a nd analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
 
1. What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study;  
2. Who will have access to that information and why;  
3. Who will use or disclose that information; and  
4. The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to coll ect or use PHI, the Investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
 
The accountability procedure will consist of Pelex, Inc., the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_322702], respectively, being respo nsible for upkeep of the secured database and the only 
people with access, except for the IRB. The IRB will be allowed to access site, records, etc.  
 
   
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_398581] procedures and may include, 
but is not limited to, review of regulatory do cuments, collection of completed case report 
forms, reconciliation of study records, removal or destruction of ancillary study supplies, 
and informing the Investigator of remaining obligations (e.g., record retention, final 
report submission to the IRB, fi nancial disclosure updates, etc.).  
7.4.2 Suspension or premature termination of the study   
This study may prematurely terminate at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, a change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100], or at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor. If this trial 
is temporarily suspended or prematurely discontinued, Pelex  will promptly notify the 
Investigator(s) and provide instructions. If the study is temporarily suspended, Pelex  will 
provide guidance on timing and procedures for resuming the study. If the study is prematurely 
discontinued, all study materials must be collected and all study forms completed to the extent 
possible. All such materials must be returned to Pelex  upon request.  Reasons for termination 
of the study or a study site may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
● The risks and benefits of continuing the study have been reassessed, and the risks outweigh any potential benefits.  
● The incidence of AEs constitutes a potential health hazard to the subjects.  
● New scientific data do not justify a continuation of the study.  
● The investigator or study site exhibit serious and/or persistent non- adherence to the 
clinical study protocol and/or applicable regulatory requirements.  
● The Sponsor decides to terminate the study at any time for any other reason.  
 
[ADDRESS_398582], 
and then all responses will be aggregated.  
 
  10 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1 Non-Device- Associated Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring during the enrollment period should be documented by [CONTACT_322717], but will not be collected or analyzed by [CONTACT_322718].  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) encountered during study enrollment will be documented by 
[CONTACT_322719]. SAEs are defined under 
current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) guidelines as events that result in one or more of the following: 
● life-threatening illness or injury;  
● permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
● medically necessary in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
● medical or surgical intervention necessary to prevent permanent impairment 
to body structure or function; or  
● fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital abnormality.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_398583] (UADE) event  
A UADE event, as defined by [CONTACT_322720], is any SAE, life -threatening problem, or 
death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device (or with the process of evaluating a device) if 
that SAE, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated, serious, device- associated problem that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or operators using the investigational product system or the comparator product system.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_398584] be reported to the 
Investigator once when site becomes aware of the event. Initial reports may be partial and 
should be updated as additional  information becomes available. All unanticipated adverse 
device effects and all serious adverse events should be reported to the Investigator’s IRB in accordance with the IRB reporting requirements.  
 SAEs will be reported using an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) form, which 
serves the dual role of capturing pertinent SAE information per industry guidelines and 
capturing device information pertinent to medical device standards. Other serious  events that 
affect the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects must also be documented on the UADE form and must be reported immediately to Pelex  and to the Investigator’s IRB according to that 
IRB’s policies.  
 
   
All SAEs that occur during the study period, whether considered to be related to the 
investigational product or not, will be reported within [ADDRESS_398585] below via an EDC notification. 
 
Although all information required for completion of an SAE report form  may not be 
available within the specified time period, the following minimal initial information should be reported: Subject ID #, Site #, an identifiable reporting source name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_3031] (e.g. investigator/study coordinator), which of the 6 SAE criteria identified 
above resulted in the event being deemed “serious”.  IRB reporting requirements may also 
apply for SAEs.

[ADDRESS_398587] and 
Clinical Investigation  
Study device is currently seeking 510(k) approval with the FDA and has been identified as a 
non-significant risk medical device under FDA regulations and guidance documents , 
specifically Title 21 CFR 812.2(c) . Importantly, subjects will experience no greater risk than 
that associated with standard pelvic floor muscle training plus biofeedback treatment.  
 The t ypes of risk associated with Pelex Upp align with those associated with biofeedback 
devices used for PFMT . These risks are all stated in the consent form.   
11.[ADDRESS_398588] and 
Clinical Investigation  
Subjects may benefit from this study through the possible improvement in their stress urinary 
incontinence symptoms. The benefits of the study will also be to the larger population of 
patients with stress urinary incontinence who would potentially benefit from a non- invasive 
device for usage at home in treatment of stress urinary incontinence.  
The studies made possible by [CONTACT_322721] -augmented PFMT performed at home .  
 
  11.3 Minim ization of Risks  
Although the risk to subjects participating in the study is anticipated to be minimal, the 
clinician, at his/her discretion, will not collect data  from those individuals for whom 
collection is judged to pose an unusually high risk of physi cal or mental harm or discomfort.  
 
Participation in this study poses no risk to study personnel other than that normally 
encountered during standard practice. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_322722]:  
 
● Personnel should wear appropriate personal protective equipment to avoid contact [CONTACT_322723].  
[ADDRESS_398589]:  
● Obtain approval to conduct the study from the study site’s IRB;  
● Sign the Protocol PLX -001 Signature [CONTACT_179554]/herself and have all sub- investigators 
sign the Protocol PLX -001 Signature [CONTACT_322733] ; 
● Provide financial disclosures to Pelex  for themselves and all sub -investigators 
participating in study conduct, per Title 21CFR 54 ( see Section 12.4  below).  
 
During the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_42877]:  
● The study is conducted ethically;  
● Case report forms (CRFs), including Subject ICFs, are provided with each transfer of 
data requiring informed consent; and 
● All other study forms are completed as instructed by [CONTACT_322724] . 
 
In the case of completion or termination of the study or an Investigator's role in the study, or at Pelex  request, all study materials must be returned to Pelex . 
12.2  Case Report Forms/Electronic Dat a Records  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method(s) used.  
 
Original CRFs are the sole property of Pelex  and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pelex  or appropriate regulatory 
authorities, without written permission from Pelex . 
 
It is the PI's responsibility to ensure completion, review, and approval of all CRFs. CRFs 
must be signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_173248]. These signatures serve to attest 
 
  that the information contained on the CRFs is true. At all times, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_322703].  
12.[ADDRESS_398590] access to all 
study- related documents to perform verification that the protocol and all applicable current 
Good Laboratory Practices (cGLPs), Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and regulations are 
being followed and to confirm that study documents are complete and accurate. It i s 
important that Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel be made available during monitoring visits and any audits or inspections, and that sufficient time is allotted for the 
process.  
12.[ADDRESS_398591] be documented and promptly reported to Pelex  and, if applicable, to 
the IRB providing oversight of the study. Protocol deviations may result in corrective and

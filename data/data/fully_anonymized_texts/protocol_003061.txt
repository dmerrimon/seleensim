flow to the infant which is seen through decreases in the infant’s heart rate.  
 
Hypothesis or Research Question  
o Hypothesis 1: Laboring w omen  who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419407] ( SCDs ) will experience a  lower incidence of hypotension  compared 
to laboring women who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419408].  
*hypotension is defined as SBP < 90 mmHg or an SBP d ecreases more than 20% 
from baseline  
o Hypothesis 2: Infants of laboring women who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419409] a lower incidence of Category [ADDRESS_528831] on the circulation system; low maternal blood pressure can result in decreased 
perfusion of the placenta and ultimately impact blood flow to the fetus, which is seen via a 
category II or III fetal heart rate monitoring .  While hypotension may not cause problems for 
some non -pregnant women, the fetus in utero is used to and dependent on a certain blood 
pressure threshold . 
 
When hypotension related to epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892], this can occur within 15 -60 minutes after 
placement . The purpose of this study is to build upon this preliminary work and to use a 
randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of SCDs in preventing hypotension 
among a larger sample of laboring women who receive an epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].    
SCDs to prevent hypotension      2 
 
Lower limbs venous compression has been demonstrated to effectively decrease hypotension 
among women undergoing scheduled cesarean section (Cyna, Andrew, Emmett, Middleton, & 
Simmons, 2006; Goudie, Winter, & Ferguson,, 1988; Rout, Rocke, & Gouws, 1993;  Sun et al., 
2004;  Van Bogaert, 1998 ). To date, only one study has examined the use of lower limbs venous 
compression to decrease hypotension in laboring women and found a significant reduction in 
maternal hypotension with the use of SCDs. This study  compared women who used SCDs to  a 
historical co mparison group  of women who received care before SCDs were provided and 
found a decrease in the incidence of maternal hypotension from 23.3% in the comparison 
group to 3.23% in the SCD group.  and the researchers suggest a prospective randomized trial to 
investigate the phenomenon (Peyronnet et al., 2017). The purpose of this study is to build upon 
this preliminary work and to use a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of 
SCDs in preventing hypotension among a larger sample of laboring women who receive an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].   
 
Research Plan   
• Study Design   
This study will use a randomized , non -blinded,  controlled design with two arms:  
o Arm 1: Patient will  receive 1L of LR and have SCDs applied 15 minutes before 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_419410] 1 hour after epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]  
o Arm 2: Patient will receive 1L of LR during and after epi[INVESTIGATOR_419411]  
 
• Setting for the study  
The study will take place on Bethesda North Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Labor and Delivery Unit. This unit 
houses 12 labor rooms and provides care to approximately 10 -12 laboring women each 
day.  
 
• Participants  
The study will enroll 120 women who meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
o Laboring at Bethesda North Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419412] & Delivery Unit  
o Will receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]  
o 37+ weeks gestation  
o Singleton pregnancy  
o Category 1 tracings only before epi[INVESTIGATOR_419413]:  
o Under 18 years old  
o Does not speak English

SCDs to prevent hypotension      3 
o Diagnosis of pre-eclampsia  
o Diagnosis of diabetes  
o Breech presentation  
o Contraindications to lower leg compression (ex: fractured bones in leg, cellulitis, 
lower limb amputation, etc.) 
o Contraindications to receiving 1L of LR 
o Blood pressure on admission SBP> 160 or DBP> 110 
o Fetal heart rate abnormalities before epi[INVESTIGATOR_419414]: A power analysis was conducted using the primary outcome 
variable , maternal hypotension , with  an expected difference similar to that found in the 
Peyronnet and colleagues’ (2017) study (3.23% vs. 23.3%)  (0.3), power of 0.8, and level 
of significance 0.05.  It was determined that [ADDRESS_528832] on 
occurrence of infant Category 2 tracings and to allow for the possibility of removing 
participants from the final analysis due to missing data, we plan to enroll 120 patients 
(60 in each group).  
 
• Data Collection  
Before the study begins, information about the study will be provided to the 
providers. Providers who agree with involvement of their patients will be provided a 
hand -out about the study to give to their patients during prenatal visits and asked 
to mention to their patients that they may be approached about involvement of the 
study when they are admitted. The nurses on the L&D unit will be provided with 
education about the study purpose, exclusion criteria, and procedures.  All nurses on 
the L&D unit have received training in the proper use of SCDs clinically. However, to 
validate and reinforce this knowledge , the nurses on the L&D unit will be provided 
education on proper measurement to determine boot size for SCDs and proper 
boot placement and SCD use.  Nurses will be instructed to call a member of the 
study team immediately if any safety concerns occur related to the SCDs.  
 
When a patient who meets the  inclusion/exclusion criteria is admitted, a nurse will 
describe the study, answer any questions the patient has, and if the patient wants to 
enroll in the study, the study team nurse will review the information consent form.  
After the patient provides written informed consent, the nurse will remove the next 
envelope out of a box of prefilled and sealed opaque envelopes. The envelope will 
provide the Subject ID number to be used on all study -related documentation and 
the study Arm that the patient has been randomized to, either:  
1. SCD Group  + Fluid Bolus  
2. Fluid Bolus Group (no SCD)  
These envelopes will be filled using a computerized simple random number 
generator (1:1 randomization) prior to the start of the study.    
 
SCDs to prevent hypotension      4 
In addition to the group assignment, the envelope will include a data collection 
form. Data will be recorded directly on this form during the patient’s visit. The form 
will collect the following information:  
o Whether patient was assigned to the SCD group or the standard care group   
o Patient demographics including age, weight, and # pregnancies and # births  
o Threshold  systolic blood pressure  (20% decrease from baseline)  – The study 
team nurse will calculate threshold systolic blood pressure by [CONTACT_419426] 0.8  
o Biomed number of SCD machine (SCD group only)  
o Leg measurement for SCD boot size determination (SCD group only)  
o Size of boots placed (SCD group only)  
o Biomed number of boots placed (SCD group only)  
o Time SCDs placed on (SCD group only)  
o Time of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]  
o Whether patient received 1L of LR 
o Time SCDs removed (SCD group only)  
o Did the RN have to perform any interventions to address decreased fetal 
heart rate  during the 1 hour after epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892] ?  Yes/No  
o Did the anesthesia provider treat the maternal blood pressure  during the 1 
hour after epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892] ? Yes/No  
o All BPs and times of maternal blood pressures with SBP<90 or >20% decrease 
from baseline  within the [ADDRESS_528833] 
numbers for any patient who the RN  marked “yes” to “Did the RN have to perform 
any interventions to address decreased fetal heart rate?”  The research specialist 
will send two study team nurses the compi[INVESTIGATOR_419415] a review 
of the medical records of the patients requiring interventions to address decreased 
fetal heart rate. T he same two study team nurses will review all charts throughout 
the study and they will separately determine category of the fetal heart tracings 
and send them to the research specialist. The two study team nurses assigned to 
determine tracing categories will be blinded to which group the patient was in. The 
SCDs to prevent hypotension      [ADDRESS_528834] interrater reliability each week and any 
discrepancies will be sent back to the two raters to review together and come to a 
consensus on category assignment.  
 
• Intervention or experimental aspect of the study  
Patients randomized to Arm [ADDRESS_528835] SCDs placed on their lower limbs 15 
minutes before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_419416]. SCD use is in the Epic order set for laboring patients but is 
rarely used in practice on the unit.  The SCD in clinical use at Bethesda North 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419417], knee length  700 series, Ref: [ZIP_CODE] . In 
this study, the study team is using the device according to the indicated description 
“as the sleeves/cuffs compress the legs/feet, veins collapse, forcing the blood to 
move upward towards the heart” but not for the indicated outcome of “prevention 
of DVTs”; instead the study is testing the use of this device for a new indication – 
for prevention of maternal hypotension.

• Statistical Analysis  
Data recorded  on paper data collection forms  will be entered into  a password 
protected database. Only study team members will have access to the database.  No 
personal information will be entered into the electronic database. Data will undergo 
range checks when entered into the database, and quality control procedures will 
be performed to ensure accuracy of the data in the electronic database.  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using Intellectus Statistics  statistical software.   
The following analyses will be performed to address each hypothesis:  
 
Hypothesis 1: Laboring women who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419418] a lower incidence of hypotension compared to laboring women  who 
receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419408].  
To compare the effects of the  SCDs , a Chi Square test will be used to compare 
occurrence of maternal hypotension  for patients who used SCDs  to patients who 
did not use SCDs .  A level of significance of α=0.05 will be used.   
 
Hypothesis 2: Infants of laboring women who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_419419] a lower incidence of Category [ADDRESS_528837] will be used to compare 
occurrence of Category 2 tracings of infants  of patients who used SCDs  to infants 
of patients who did not use SCDs .  A level of significance of α=0.05 will be used.   
 
Interim data analysis w ill occur (1) once approximately 1/[ADDRESS_528838] been 
enrolled in each group and (2) once approximately 2/[ADDRESS_528839] been 
SCDs to prevent hypotension      6 
enrolled in each group. If interim calculations at time (1) or time (2) note a significant 
difference between groups in maternal hypotension or frequency of category 2 tracings,  
data collection will be completed at that time and final analysis will be completed.  
 
Ethical Considerations  
• Informed consent  
All study staff will complete CITI training.  A study staff member will meet with 
potentially eligible patient s and describe the study and answer any questions.   If the 
patient is  interested and meets all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the study staff 
will review the Informed Consent Form  and obtain written informed consent.   
Patients  will receive a copy of their signed Informed Consent form.  
 
Informed Consent forms will be stored in a locked  room  that only staff will have 
access to.  After the study closes, the signed Informed Consent forms will be boxed 
and sent to off -site storage and securely stored until the infant turns [ADDRESS_528840] copy forms will be shredded.  
 
• Privacy information  
Personal identifiers will not be entered into the  electronic database . Hard copy data 
collection forms and Informed Consent forms will be stored in a locked room that  
only staff will have access to.  Electronic data will be stored on a password -
protected folder on the U drive.  Only study staff will have access to the electronic 
study documents.  After data analysis and dissemination is completed, hard copy 
forms will be boxed and sent to off-site storage and securely stored until the infant 
turns [ADDRESS_528841] /Budget

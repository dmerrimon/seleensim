1. ABSTRACT  
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment adherence is complex and involves glucose monitoring, 
counting carbohydrates, and intensive insulin delivery via injections or insulin pump in response 
to food intake, exercise, and illness to achieve near -normal  blood glucose levels.  Evidence 
demonstrates that adhering to T1D treatment is challenging, especially during adolescence.  
Non-adherence leads to suboptimal glycemic levels that severely compromise health  and 
quality of life.  Suboptimal adherence to T1D treatment regimen is common in >50% of 
adolescents and  directly related to suboptimal glycemic control, increased risk of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421794], and decreased health -related quality of life (HRQOL). 
The maximum benefits of current diabetes technology are limited by [CONTACT_421823], skills, 
adherence barriers, and non -adherence behaviors.10-[ADDRESS_532392] to 
overcome these barriers in order to benefit  from technological advances. Thus, there is a clear 
need for behaviorally focused  interventions to identify  and reduce adherence  barriers.  The 
overall objective of this study is to  identify adolescents with elevated adherence barriers and 
provide  novel tailored mHealth intervention (Diabetes Journey) targeting  these barriers . The 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_421795], acceptability and preliminary 
efficacy of Diabetes Journey  versus enhanced standard of care (control group) i n approximately 
[ADDRESS_532393] intervention responsiveness , as well as  mediators of adherence barriers 
and adherence responsiveness.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
Urgent Need to Improve T1D Adherence and Glycemic Control in Adolescents. Long -term 
T1D complications are related to both glycemic control and T1D duration. There is an urgent 
need to improve glycemic control for adolescents, given that 17% of youth ages [ADDRESS_532394] A1C values >9.5%,2 which is much greater than A1C of <7.5% recommended by 
[CONTACT_11026].6 Further, T1D is a lifelong chronic condition and 
establishing optimal adherence behaviors in adolescence can set the stage for positive 
outcomes in adulthood. Suboptimal adherence to the T1D treatment regimen is directly related 
to suboptimal glycemic control,7,8 increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421794],9 and 
decreased health -related quality of life (HRQOL). Alarmingly, the average A1C of 9% in 13 -17 
year-olds is similar to the average A1C of 9.5% of youth from the Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial more than [ADDRESS_532395] to use 
the technology for it to be beneficial and clearly there is a need for behaviorally -focused 
interventions to identify barriers and improve adherence behaviors.

Adolescence is often accompanied by [CONTACT_421824], feelings of invincibility, and 
decreased parental monitoring.36 Adolescence is the only period of human development in 
which the primary causes of morbidity and mortality are behavioral (e.g., reckless driving) rather 
than disease -based.37 Adolescents are motivated by [CONTACT_421825] (i.e., executive 
dysfunction).[ADDRESS_532396] immediate 
rewards (e.g., omitting blood glucose checks and insulin boluses when out with friends15) and 
less likely to be concerned about the negative consequences of their decisions for the future 
(e.g., blindness, amputation, cardiovascular disease).18, [ADDRESS_532397],16-19 and psychological conditions (e.g., 
depression).20-[ADDRESS_532398] frequently been targeted by [CONTACT_421826], with some 
success. In addition, stress (e.g., negative life events,24 familial,25 T1D burnout) and executive 
dysfunction (e.g., problem -solving, organizing/planning, working memory)[ADDRESS_532399] been addressed in  other chronic conditions 
with both statistically and clinically meaningful improvements (see C1d and C1e) underscoring 
the need for effective intervention in T1D. If the aims of this R01 are achieved, adherence to the 
T1D treatment regimen and A1C will improve.  
 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are Recommended as a Part of Comprehensive T1D 
Care.  Although A1C is recognized as the gold standard outcome in T1D, there is widespread 
recognition of its limitations26 and the need for assessment of meaningful PROs to complement 
existing clinical metrics. Integrating PROs into T1D clinical care is key to: 1) designing 
interventions that are tailored to the needs of adolescents with T1D; and 2) enhancing 
collaboration between families and health care teams by [CONTACT_421827]’ focus beyond 
A1C to better address the broader impact of T1D.27 However, obstacles (e.g., lack of personnel 
to administer and intervene when necessary, lack of referral resources) exist to systematic 
integration of PROs into routine clinical practice, which impedes the ability to provide tailored 
interventions to pati ents during routine clinical care. The integration of T1D-specific PROs into 
T1D clinical care, such as the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence scale and the PedsQL -Diabetes 
Module, is recommended.27 
 
The Barriers to Diabetes Adherence scale  comprises two subscales, including the 
Stress/Burnout and Time Pressure/Planning (executive dysfunction) subscales, that are 
associated with suboptimal adherence ( r=0.21, p<0.05 ) and glycemic levels (r=0.38, p<0.01 ).[ADDRESS_532400] range (0.27 -0.66).28-31 Targeting executive dysfunction is essential because 
some children with T1D demonstrate significant deficits in learning and memory,32 which can 
lead to adherence barriers , including stress33 and poor planning skills,34 and eventual non -
adherence. In addition, severe hypoglycemia has been implicated in executive dysfunction in 
children.35-38 Executive dysfunction is also associated with poor HRQOL ( rs= -0.24 to -0.32, 
ps<0.05 ).4 Specifically, deficits in the ability to problem -solve, initiate tasks, transition between 
activities, and hold information in one’s memory negatively impacts HRQOL in adolescents with 
T1D.[ADDRESS_532401] that stress/burnout and executive dysfunction may be 
critical PROs for clinic -based intervention that have not yet been addressed in pediatric T1D 
adherence interventions. Thus, if the aims of this R01 are achieved, we will systematically 
integrate an extremely important PRO that negatively impacts adherence and A1C – adherence 
barriers.  
 
We are proposing a novel intervention, Diabetes Journey, which will focus on improving 
adherence barriers, specifically Stress/Burnout and Time Pressure/ Planning.  We hypothesize 
the intervention will also improve our secondary outcomes (i.e., adherence, glycemic levels , and 
HRQOL). We will explore whether depressive symptoms and family conflict  moderate 
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. 4 
 intervention effectiveness. In addition, we will explore potential mediators (e.g., adolescent 
distress, executive functioning) of the relationship between barriers and adherence. Notably, the 
primary goal of the current proposal is to assess, intervene on , and improve adherence barriers, 
an important PRO that has been neglected in prior research yet shown to strongly influence 
health outcomes and HRQOL.  
 
Critical Targets for Intervention Include Adherence Barriers via Mobile Health and 
Telemedicine.  Although T1D i nterventions including multisystemic therapy,39,40 problem -
solving,41 copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110],42 and behavioral systems therapy43,44 yield small, but clinically 
meaningful effects on glycemic levels (0.44% reductions5), these effects are insufficient to 
prevent long -term T1D complications. Moreover, these small effects are likely due to lack of 
intervention integration into T1D clinical care and a mismatch between intervention targets and 
the difficulties that plague 1/3 of adolescents with T1D on a daily basis (e.g., stress, executive 
dysfunction).3 Thus, we propose to measure and target adherence barriers for the current 
proposal.   
 
Telemedicine and mHealth (mobile health)  interventions  have  the potential to  significantly  
improve T1D care and health  outcomes  in adolescents , yet there  is a fundamental gap  in the 
extant literature  investigating the impact on  pediatric T1D outcomes. mHealth tools are well -
matched to the information consumption patterns of adolescents as approximately 90% have 
cell phones (73% smartphones), 90% of those with cell phones use text messaging,45 and 91% 
access the internet on their mobile device (with a notable increase in use for minority youth).45 
Using  telemedicine  to deliver interventions with adolescents  in routine T1D clinical care will 
increas e access to adherence interventions, provide flexibility, and decrease  burden  (e.g.,  travel 
time, missed  school). Moreover, it is well -known that there is a 17 -year time lag for translating 
research into clinical practice.46 By [CONTACT_421828],47 “we can more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_421796] -
based findings into clinical practice, and more effectively disseminate novel and impactful 
information to researchers and decision makers.”  
 
Overall Impact  
If successful, the results of this study would have a large impact on pediatric T1D outcomes.  
Telemedicine and mHealth (mobile health)  interventions  have  the potential to  significantly  
improve T1D care and health  outcomes  in adolescents . Knowledge gained in this study has the 
potential to improve the treatment of pediatric T1D by [CONTACT_421829], enhancing 
adherence and T1D management skills that, consequently, would improve health outcomes 
(i.e., A1C) and quality of life in t his population. Data elicited through the study will also allow us 
to modify the intervention to improve the gene ralizability and potential efficacy of the 
intervention for future trials.   
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
We will conduct a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_421797] T1D and their caregivers 
(n=190) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an adherence 
barriers mHealth intervention for adolescents with T1D.  
 
5. DURATION  
Participants will be in the study for [ADDRESS_532402] 
approximatel y 48 months  overall .  
 
6. SELECTION & RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
Study Participants  
Study participants will include n= 190 adolescents , ages 1 2-17, with T1D and their caregivers  
from Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (CCHMC) , the University of [LOCATION_012]  (UF) and 
the University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes (BDC) . Adolescents and 
caregivers will be recruited during routin e diabetes clinic  visits  and will meet the following 
inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. 5 
  
Inclusion Criteria  
• T1D diagnosis >1 year  
• Adolescents with T1D ages 1 2-17 
• Elevations on the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence questionnaire (scores of ≥  2 of 5 for 
the Stress/Burnout and/or Time Pressure/Planning subscales)  based on their previous 
clinic visit scores  
• Ability to read/speak English  (all measures are in English)  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
• Diagnosis of significant developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, 
moderate/severe developmental or intellectual disability)  
• Comorbid medical diagnoses (e.g., cystic fibrosis) with the exception of endocrine 
disorders (e.g., Celiac disease, thyroid)  
 
Recruitment Procedures  
Potential participants meeting eligibility criteria will be identified by a trained research assistant 
in collaboration with the members of the Diabetes teams  at each site . Specifically, patients will 
be pre -screened based on their scheduled appointments for inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
Elevations on the BDA is one of our inclusion criteria for study entry. At CCHMC and the 
University of [LOCATION_012] , BDA elevations will most often be identified by [CONTACT_421830]’s  clinic visit  or through a screening process.  For eligible participants who do not have 
a completed Barriers to Diabetes Adherence (BDA) measure, study coordinators may 
administer a screening BDA t o determine further study eligibility, but only after informed 
consent/assent is obtained. If the participant does not have any elevations on the BDA, they will 
be deemed a screen -fail and will not participate in the Diabetes Journey intervention. If the 
participant completes the BDA at a later clinic visit and has elevations on the BDA that make 
them eligible for study participation, and study staff determine they still meet all other inclusion 
criteria, the participant may be re -consented for study partic ipation at that time.  
 
The University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center  does not administer the BDA clinically.  Thus, 
adolescents from the University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center  who are eligible for Diabetes 
Journey will be identified through an ongoing study at the University of Colorado Barbara Davis 
Center (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Holly O’Donnell) in which participants in that study complete a variety of 
psychosocial questionnaires including the BDA ; this approach is approved by [CONTACT_421831]. If participants are elevate d on Stress and Burnout and/or Time Pressure 
and Planning, a trained research assistant will approach families about participating in Diabetes 
Journey .  
 
At all sites, i f potential participants are eligible, a trained research assistant will approach 
families with adolescents with T1D  either  during a routine diabetes follow -up clinic visit  or via 
other recruitment methods ( i.e., phone calls, recruitment letters) . A thorough overview of the 
study will be provided, including study procedures, benefits, and risks. All questions will be 
addressed, and informed consent/assent will be obtained  if the family agrees to participate .  
 
Following written informed consent from the  caregiver/legal guardian and  adolescent assent, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_20045]/assent forms will be provided to participants at recruitment. 
Subsequently, handouts about diabetes device download will be provided and baseline 
assessment questionnaires  will be completed via REDCap or by [CONTACT_29160]/pencil surveys.  
Recruitment materials, including flyers, scripts, etc. can be found in Appendi ces A, B, and H.   
 
7. PROCESS OF OBTAINING CONSENT  AND ASSENT  
As noted above, once participants are identified as study eligible, they will be approached  
during  or following  their diabetes clinic visit and provided a description of the study (e.g., study 
procedures,  benefits, risks) by a trained research coordinator. Due to restrictions in the wake of 
COVID -19, eligible participants may be mailed recruitment letters and /or called to assess 
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. [ADDRESS_532403] in the study. After  addressing all questions from potential participants, informed 
consent/assent will be obtained by  [CONTACT_7628]. Consent /assent  forms will be signed 
electronically using REDCap, a secure web -based interface supported by [CONTACT_421832] /assent  forms. Should technical issues arise with the 
REDCap interface, paper  copi[INVESTIGATOR_421798]. For all consent /assent  
visits, all pertinent aspects of consent /assent  will be covered including  study purpose, 
risks/benefits, confidentiality, and right to withdraw. Patients will be informed that  their care at 
CCHMC or other collaborating study sites will not be affected by [CONTACT_421833] . A copy of the assent/consent form will be provided to all participants.  
 
For eligible participants who do not have a completed Barriers to Diabetes Adherence (BDA) 
measure upon recruitment, study coordinators may administer a screening BDA to determine 
further study eligibility , but only after informed consent /assent is obtained . If the participant does 
not have any elevations on the BDA, they will be deemed a screen -fail and will not participate in 
the Diabetes Journey intervention . If the participant completes the BDA at a later clinic visit and 
has elevations on the BDA that  make them eligible for study participation, and study staff 
determine they still meet all other inclusion criteria, the participant may be re -consented for 
study participation at that time.  
 
Participants recruited in -person will either complete the informed consent document via e -
consent on a tablet /computer  or via a paper/pencil  form. For participants who decide to 
participate after the clinic visit, we will use telephonic electronic  consent. Specifically, a member 
of the study team will provide a link to access the consent /assent  form in REDCap via email or 
text message. A paper  copy of the  form may also be mailed if  necessary. During the 
consent/assent call,  research staff will ensure all questions are  answered. In compliance with 
CCHMC SOP Number 41 -1.6, study staff will sign and date  accordingly,  on the signature [CONTACT_421845], not necessarily reviewed with 
the family. The method used to obtain participant  consent /assent  will also be  written on the 
Informed Consent Process Note.  
 
8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
After participants provide informed consent/assent  as noted above , baseline questionnaires will 
be completed via REDCap  or by [CONTACT_29160]/pencil (see Table 1). All questionnaires  will be hosted on  
REDCap, a secure web -based interface  or stored in a secure cabinet.  Some questionnaires  are 
completed as a part of standard clinical care and thus may not be repeated, if unnecessary. 
Participant s must provide an email address for the online questionnaires. If they do not have 
one, we will help them create one or we will text the link to their cellular phones. If participating 
caregivers and adolescents prefer to complete paper/pencil questionnaire s, we will provide 
them.  
 
During the visit  or recruitment call , participants will be asked to share  all blood glucose monitors, 
continuous glucose monitors, and/or insulin pumps data for the study via Tidepool (e.g., free 
software for diabetes devices downloads used clinically)  when possible . If data is not shared 
during the clinic visit  or while on the call with study staff , families will be given instructions about 
how to download diabetes device data to Tidepool remotely following their recruitment date.  We 
will also offer a videoconference appointment to assist with the upload.  Families will be provided 
with a username [CONTACT_421846] .  Research staff may contact 
[CONTACT_421834]’ blood glucose monitors , continuous glucose 
monitors,  or pumps. If participants have difficulty with Tidepool, other software used as a part of 
routine cl inical care (e.g., Glooko, Carelink, TConnect) may be used to download  diabetes 
devices . Additionally, Tidepool experts at other sites may be consulted for further 
troubleshooting with Tidepool.  All downloaded data will be de -identified, given a unique ID 
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. [ADDRESS_532404] protected to ensure 
privacy. A medical chart review will also be 
conducted to gather information about 
hemoglobin A1C, data downloaded from 
devices, medications, comorbidities , 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and time since diagnosis.  
 
It is the goal for all  participant  families  to  
complete their baseline visit prior to being 
randomized to intervention. This will include 
completion of  questionnaires and download 
data from their T1D device. However,  
participating families may be randomized  if the 
primary outcome measure (BDA) and a 
baseline A1C within [ADDRESS_532405].  
 
After completion of the required questionnaires 
and A1C at a minimum will be randomized to 
either: Diabetes Journey or Enhanced 
Standard of Care (Figure 1 ).  Stratified block 
randomization with two strata and blocks of 
size 2 or 4 chosen randomly within each 
stratum  will be used and s tratification will be based on baseline A1C (i.e., >9% or <9%), site 
(i.e., CCHMC , the University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center  or the University of [LOCATION_012] ), and 
Barriers to Diabetes Adherence elevation type within the treatment arm (i.e., elevated on one or 
both of the subscales). Th e A1C criter ion was selected because the average A1C in 13 -17 year 
olds with T1D in the US is 9%, which will result in comparable sample sizes above and below 
9%. In addition, although the American Diabetes Association reco mmends an A1C <7%, very 
few adolescents achieve this. Site was chosen as a stratification variable  to ensure balance for 
any site -related differences. This randomization strategy will minimize imbalance of the number 
of participants across groups. The randomization list will be held by [CONTACT_421835].  Participants will be notified of their randomization 
group within 3 business days  of completion of baseline data and be provided with appropriate 
materials (e.g., log -in information or website information and links). Total treatment time is up to 
12 weeks , which coincides with routine quarterly T1D clinic appointments. This also enables 
sufficient time for cancelled and/or rescheduled sessions that are likely to occur given 
adolescents’ busy schedules.   
 
Control Group (Enhanced Standard of Care)  
Participants randomized to Enhanced Standard of Care will receive general education  via the 
T1DToolkit website, as well as  4 Zoom sessions  (e.g., Zoom for Healthcare; See Appendix C)  
with certified diabetes educators (CDEs) from either CCHMC or UF across [ADDRESS_532406] 
of Care group via the T1DToolkit website. D epending on the participant’s elevated score(s) on 
the Barriers to Diabetes Adherence scale , patients will receive information specifically 
addressing elevated scales of the BDA . Treatment fidelity will be assessed via audio recordings 
and completion of checklists, which will be reviewed weekly by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kichler with the CDEs who 
deliver this intervention.

Treatment  (Diabetes Journey)  
All Diabetes Journey participants will first receive the mandatory Introduction and Problem -
Solving Module s. Participants with elevations on only one subscale will then receive 4 additional 
modules based on their individual subscale elevations ( 5 modules total). If the participant is 
elevated on both Barriers to Diabetes Adherence subscales, they will receive all 8 modules . 
This will yield completion of  5 or 8 total modules and  5 or 8 HIPAA compliant video -sessions 
(e.g., Zoom for Healthcare ; See Appendix C ) with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421799] . No therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421800].  
 
The primary foundational skill that will be taught is problem -solving, the first core module. As a 
part of Problem -Solving Module , an engaging and visually appealing video reviewing problem -
solving skills will be viewed. The following approach to teach problem -solving skills will be used: 
1) Define  the problem (e.g., feeling stressed and cannot sleep resulting in high blood glucoses); 
2) Teach  the adolescent to generate several solutions (e.g., deep breathing before bed, 
listening to relaxing music, talking to a caregiver); 3) Evaluate  the pros and cons of each 
potential solution; 4) Select  one solution for implementation; and 5) Review  detailed solution 
with specifics regarding who, when, where, and how the solution will be attempted. The 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421801] a critical role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_421802] -solving skills in daily life. Notably, if 
technical difficulties arise, telephone sessions will be co nducted and audio recorded . If 
adolescents lack access to mobile devices, an iPad will be provided to the participant.

Following the 12 week active intervention phase, participants will complete  
one follow -up visit as shown in Figure 1.  
 
8.1 Data collection procedures and measures  
Participants will complete a demographic questionnaire that provides general information about 
the child’s age, history of T1D, and family information. Both adolescents and caregivers will 
complete questionnaires . All participants will have the  same baseline, post-treatment (3 -months 
from baseline) and follow -up study visits (6 months from baseline) , which includes 
questionnaires, diabetes device downloads, and health outcomes through medical chart 
reviews.  In light of COVID -19, the COVID -[ADDRESS_532407] Survey (CEFIS) will 
be administered to adolescents and caregivers to determine the impact of COVID -19 on their 
functioning (see Appendi ces J and K ). The medical chart review will include  key patient medical 
characteristics (e.g ., insulin regimen type, A1C, PROs collected during routine clinical care)  
 
Sources of data for the current study will include: 1) adherence data downloaded from b lood 
glucose  meters , continuous glucose monitor s, insulin pump s, and hybrid closed loop system s; 
2) REDCap web -based questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_421838], barriers to T1D adherence, health -related quality of life, depressive symptoms, 
T1D distress, executive functioning, family conflict, and feasibility/accep tability of the Diabetes 
Journey intervention; and 3) mail, electronic -mail, and telephone contact [CONTACT_421839]  (See Appendices D, F, and E for relevant 
materials). T1D devices will be downloaded  to industry standard HIPAA compliant software and 
cloud -based programs , which is diabetes standard of care .

8.2 Sample Size Considerations and Power Analysis:  
Sample size for this study is based on our preliminary work with this intervention in epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] 
(i.e., Epi[INVESTIGATOR_421804]), which found moderate to large effect sizes from baseline to 6 -month 
follow -up, ranging from d = 0.55 to d = 0.[ADDRESS_532408]. Additionally, preliminary data on our primary outcomes 
collected at CCHMC from 2016 -2017 (i.e., Stress/Burnout and Time Pressure/Planning 
subscales) show that our patients improve slightly over one yea r with Enhanced Standard of 
Care, corresponding to an effect size of d = 0.19. A Monte Carlo simulation in Mplus with n = 
5000 replications was conducted assuming: 1) proper handling of missing data; 2) 25% attrition; 
3) standardization of all analysis var iables; 4) at least 30% of the error variance in our primary 
outcome (R2 = 0.30) being explained by [CONTACT_421840]; 5) we will 
observe the smallest effect size from our preliminary work in the treatment group (i.e., d = 0.55); 
and 6) we will observe a small improvement in our control group (d = 0.19).  Recent interim 
analyses and meetings with our NIH program officer have yielded a change in our study 
design from a fully powered RCT to detect subgroup differences to a pi[INVESTIGATOR_421805], acceptability, satisfaction and preliminary efficacy differences between the 
control and treatment groups . These new analyses indicate the need for a total sample 
size of n=190 (n=95 in the control group and n=95 in the treatment group) .   
 
9. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
No immediate or direct benefits to patients participating in this study are expected. However, it  
is our hope that participants will have reduced adherence barriers and learn better disease 
management skills. The information obtained from this study can ultimately be used to  increase  Construct Measured  Respondent  Stages and Time points

10. POTENTIAL RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, INCONVENIENCES, & PRECAUTIONS  
There are minimal potential risks/discomforts/inconveniences to participants in this study, no  
greater than those encountered in routine behavioral assessment and clinical care. There are  
no medical risks. All the questionnaires have been used in research, including our own, without  
any reported negative effects; however, it is possible that a small group may feel uncomfortable  
responding to questions. Participants may decline answering questions that cause them to feel  
uncomfortable and will be reminded of this prior to eac h study visit. Participants may also  
withdraw from the study at any time and will be informed of this right during the consent /assent  
process.  
 
If a participant is distressed by [CONTACT_236792], the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_421806]. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_421807]/or intervention. Safety procedures for suicidal ideation and reports of 
abuse/neglect are delineated in our safety monitoring comm ittee plan (See Appendix E). In both 
cases and similar to above, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_421808]/she will assess the risk profile of the caregiver and/or adolescent participant 
with subsequent recommendation s based on the level of risk.  Further, the PHQ -8 assesses 
participants for depressive symptomology. Though the suicidal ideation item has been removed 
from this version (e.g. PHQ -8 not PHQ -9) for the purposes of the current study, a significant 
elevation on the PHQ -8 suggests the participant is experiencing significant depressive 
symptomology. The PHQ is given during routine diabetes clinic visits and data from the 
measure will be entered into REDCap when available. The diabetes clinical team addresses 
elevation s on the PHQ during routine clinical care and thus if elevations are addressed during 
clinic, no further action will be taken by [CONTACT_37152]. However, if the PHQ is only 
administered via the research protocol and there is an elevation on the PHQ, the following 
actions will be taken. REDCap is now programmed to send an alert if anyone scores >10 
(considered moderate risk) on the PHQ. The alert will be sent to the site PI, supervising 
psychologist and coordinators. Results will  also be communicated  to the primary caregiver or 
adult participant within 3 business days  of the elevation  and appropriate referrals to outpatient 
mental health services will be provided , as necessary. In the instance a family is unable to be 
contact[CONTACT_421841] 3 business days despi[INVESTIGATOR_421809], a letter (see  Appendix  P) will be sent 
to the address on file detailing this information. Additional details on these procedures are 
provided in Appendix E.  
 
There is also the risk of possible loss of privacy of data or loss of confidentiality. These risks are  
inherent in all research studies, and a statement to this effect will be included in the informed  
consent /assent  documents . Every effort will be made to ensure that all participant information 
will be kept  confidential. A majority of this study is going to be conducted via Zoom sessions . 
Participants will access or receiv e information from several different sources including REDCap , 
Tidepool, Diabetes Journey  site, T1Dtoolkit site,  and Zoom for Healthcare . De-identified  ID 
number s will be used when possible for the sites . For example, enrolled participants will be 
assigned a secure login ID and password by [CONTACT_421842]/or to  upload diabetes devices through Tidepool or other platforms . Each site will only be 
able to see their own site’s  participants in REDCap, with the exception of the lead site 
(CCHMC).  Additionally, T he University of [LOCATION_012] PI [INVESTIGATOR_421810] e the study 
for the  University of Colorado  Barbara Davis Center . They are all non -paid employees of the 
University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center  and are authorized to have access to the 
University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center  data. The U niversity of [LOCATION_012]  and University of 
Colorado Barbara Davis Center  teams will meet weekly to review the study protocol, monitor 
recruitment and discuss other study related issues that may arise. Participants will be asked  not 
to share their ID or password with anyone else. Use of Prot ected Health Information (PHI)  on 
online measures will be minimized and participants will not be asked to enter their last name,  
date of birth, or medical record number on the online measures. When the study is complete,  
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. [ADDRESS_532411] to compliance with  
federal and state regulations regarding data of this type. Similarly, the Wordpress and 
T1Dtoolkit sites for the  DJ modules will be linked to their study ID and there will be no identifying 
information listed in this  site. Similarly, although Zoom for Healthcare is HIPAA compliant, 
participants will be required to login to the secured Zoom server for sessions  and will be 
provided with the Zoom link to their email accounts . This information and protection of the 
participant’s identi ty will be clarified in the informed consent and assent forms . We will provide 
each participant with a unique anonymous Tidep ool username [CONTACT_2383]  (See Appendix I ). 
Finally, because interventionists can be from CCHMC  or the University of [LOCATION_012] , participant 
information to conduct intervention sessions will be shared with the interventionist and 
appropriate supervisor in order to contact [CONTACT_476].   
 
To communicate study related information across sites, our team will be using Trello, a  task 
management system that is frequently used by [CONTACT_236796]. No identifying information  will 
be entered into the Trello system; however, we will be tracking participants through the study  
procedures using their study ID.   
 
Notably, the only place the study ID will be linked to the name [CONTACT_421847], which is password protected, individually, at each site by [CONTACT_236178] . No other individuals outside of the IRB -approved research team from both sites will have 
access to this  participant database .  
 
11. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
There is minimal risk associated with study participation. If participants feel distressed as a  
result of their participation, they will be encouraged to discontinue. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_421811], 
safety, and risk, as needed. The minimal risks of this study do not  outweigh the potential indirect 
benefits that may be gained through increasing knowledge about  best practices for improving 
adherence  barriers  to treatment in adolescents with T1D.  
 
12. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING  
This is a multisite observational study and is considered minimal risk. Safety monitoring will 
occur at the level of the multiple PIs due to the minimal risk nat ure of the study. See Appendix E 
for details of the NIDDK approved data safety and monitoring plan.  
 
13. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
All study personnel have been trained in data safety and monitoring, privacy and confidentiality,  
minimizing risks related to loss of privacy and confidentiality. We will closely monitor  
performance of our research personnel to ensure the strictest standards. Additional information  
related to privacy and confidentiality is noted above in section 10.  
 
13.1 Data De -Identification : All data will be de -identified with the use of unique assigned study  
identifier codes. No other identifying data such as address, phone numbers, social security  
number, or zip code will be entered on electronic measures. Electronic data files (including  
downloads of data from REDCap measures) will only identify participants via study identifier  
codes and will be password protected. Electronic data files will be maintained on CCHMC hard  
drives.   
 
Because this research study involves payment for participation, we are required by [CONTACT_421843] (IRS) rules to collect and use participant’s social security number ( SSN) or  
taxpayer identification number (TIN) in order to track the amount of money that we pay them.  
Unless they have given specific permission for another use of their SSN or TIN related to this  
research study, we will only use their SSN or TIN to keep track of how much money we pay  
them and their SSN or TIN will not be used as part  of this research study.  
 
Version 1 1 (June 8, 202 3) p. 13 
 13.2 Data Storage and Management  
Informed consent /assent  documents and all electronically  collected data will be maintained in 
RED Cap, a secure web -based platform, and in a password  protected  electronic database on 
CCHMC hard drives. Device data downloaded from Tidepool (a HIPA A compliant website  used 
routine for clinical care ) will be kept in password protected electronic databases at CCHMC. 
CCHMC  is the Primary Site  and will manage all the final deidentified data. Paper informed 
consent /assent  documents will be maintained in locked  storage cabinets, if they are needed, 
and will be kept separate from participant data.   
 
Trello (www.trello.com), a web -based project management tool, will be used to coordinate  
study -related tasks across sites. No identifiable patient information will be saved in this platform.  
Medical chart data will be collected by [CONTACT_421844]  [INVESTIGATOR_421812] . These  risk protection methods have been effectively used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_421813].  
 
Individual data will not be available to anyone not directly  associated with the study. All study  
personnel have been trained in data safety and monitoring, privac y and confidentiality,  
minimizing risks related to loss of privacy and confidentiality. We will closely monitor  
performance of our research personnel to ensure the strictest standards. Study -related  
information will not be released without written permission of the participant.  
 
14. COST OF PARTICIPATION  
There are no costs for participation in this research study. Participants will be responsible for the  
usual costs of medical care.  
 
15. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
Caregivers will be compensated for participation in the study in the form of a reloadable debit  
card (ClinCard ). They  will receive a handout that will explain how to use this card.  A graduate 
incentive schedule will be as follows:

Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all subjects who were randomized. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of post randomization 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/03 Page 12 of 102

protocol deviations, including no treatment or wrong treatment received. Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol (PP) Population will be a subset of the ITT Population and will include subjects who meet 
the following criteria:  
• Meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Has not taken or applied any interfering concomitant medications 
• Completed the following visits:  
o Visit 2 GSP 1, and the required GSP data collection  
o Visit 3 GSP 2, and the required GSP data collection  
o Visit 4 (Day 1) Re-screening /Baseline  GSP 3  and HDSM -Ax, and the required GSP and HDSM -
Ax data collection  
o Visit 10 (GSP 4) Day 41 (± 2 days), and the required GSP data collection  
o Visit 11  (GSP 5) Day 42 (± 2 days), and the required GSP data collection  
o Visit 1 2 (GSP 6) Day 43 (± 2 days) and HDSM -Ax, and the required GSP and HDSM -Ax data 
collection  
Safety Population 
The Safety Population will include all subjects randomized in the study who received study drug at least once. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. If a subject receive s any sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519670], 15% , the subject  will be analyzed  in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563586]. O therwise , the subject 
will be included in the vehicle group. 
Efficacy  
Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints : 
• The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2- point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-7 scale score 
from baseline to end of treatment ( EOT ). 
• The change in GSP from baseline to EOT. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses : 
The primary efficacy analy sis will be performed on the ITT  population. Both comparisons will be conducted 
using two-sided tests at an alpha=0.05 level. Both endpoints will need to demonstrate a statistically  significant 
positive result in favor of the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% for the study to be considered su ccessful.   
The HDSM -Ax-7 co-primary endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression  model with the following 
covariates: treatment , baseline HDSM -Ax-7 total score , and analysis center . 
The GSP co -primary endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of c ovariance (ANCOVA)  model with  fixed 
effects for treatment , baseline ranked GSP, and analysis center . The ANCOVA may use rank -transformed or 
continuous data, pending the outcome of the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_563587]. The normality test will be 
performed prior to multiple imputation and separately for each arm. Should the normality assumption be 
violated for either arm, the primary analysis will use rank -transformed GSP data. If the normality assumption 
holds for both arms, the primary analysis will use continuous GSP data.

Methods for handling missing data for the Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints Before performing the primary analysis for the ITT population, m issing  EOT  HDSM -Ax-7 and GSP values  
for the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arm will be imputed for the co-primary efficacy endpoints by [CONTACT_563641] a control-b ased imputation (CBI) model approach. Whereas,  multiple imputations for  
missing  values in the vehicle group will be perform ed assum ing missing at random (MAR). For the GSP 
endp oint in particular , in order to ensure that  the missing data imputation method is robust to outliers, data 
from subject s that meet the criterion for being an outlier will be removed from the imputation sampling 
database  (i.e., the existing vehicle database ).  
Sensitivity Analyses of the Co -Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
To further explore the robustness of the primary analysis results  to different missing data assumptions, 
analyses using t wo more  imputation methods will be performed: a missing data imputed to failure  approach 
for the HDSM -Ax-7 co-primary endpoint, and a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_563588] -AX-7 and GSP co -
primary endpoints. Additionally, the ranked GSP and non- rank transformed  GSP ANCOVA analyses will be 
repeated  without imputing missing da ta, and again  after removing outlier data. To further  support the results 
of the co-primary endpoint HDSM- Ax-7, analysis of the 7 individual items in the scale will be conducted. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
• The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 1-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-7 scale score 
from baseline to EOT.  
• The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-[ADDRESS_740454] a 70% reduction in GSP from baseline to EOT.  
• The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 1-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-[ADDRESS_740455] a 50% reduction in GSP from baseline to EOT.  
A gated , fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to control the overall familywise error rate for the 
primary and secondary analyses. Testing will be performed first for the two co-primary endpoints. If both null 
hypotheses are rejected at the 2 -sided 0.05 s ignificance level in favor of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in the order as specified above. Testing will continue only if all 
previously tested null hypotheses of no difference have been rejected at the 2 -sided  0.05 significance level in 
favor of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%.   
The secondary efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed using methods similar to what is described for the 
co-primary endpoints.  
Method of Pooling S ites to Generate Analysis Centers  
Subjects from  low enrolling sites will be pooled in order to generate analysis centers.  The minimum number 
of subjects per analysis center is 10. The lowest enrolling site will be combined with the largest enrolling site 
that does not meet the minimum requirement, and then the second lowest enrolling site and the second largest 
enrolling site will be combined, and so on. Further combining will be done until all analysis centers have at 
least [ADDRESS_740456] appropriate HDSM-Ax-7-Item scoring algorithm and to examine internal 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740457] validity (i.e., examination of the magnitude of correlation between the HDSM-Ax total score and key variables such as items 4 and 5 of the HDSM -Ax-7-Item, PG I-S, PGI -C, and GSP), stability, 
reliability, ability to detect change, and interpretability of clinical trial results.  
Safety  
Safety analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_563642]. Treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) descri ptions will be mapped to standard terms, i.e., Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities ( MedDRA ) system organ c lass and preferred term. At each post -baseline visit, the number and 
proportion of subjects reporting any given TEAE will be tabulated cumula tively  by [CONTACT_926]; each subject will 
be counted only once according to the worst severity reported up to the current visit. Separate tables will be

Laborator y parameters will be descriptively summarized (mean, standard deviation , median, minimum, 
maximum) for values obtained at Visit 1 and Visit 12 .  Whereas, vital signs will be summarized in a similar 
manner at each visit.   
Sample Size and Power Estimation  
Sample size estimation was performed for the co -primary efficacy endpoints based on the results of a 
Phase  2b study ( BBI-4000- CL-203): 
• HDSM -Ax-7 responder analysis: 2-point improvement response rates of 29.8% and 53.7% were 
assumed for the vehicle and sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arms , respectively. The power is 0.95 with 
116 subjects per arm and a total of 232 subjects. 
• GSP: using rank transformed GSP data for change from baseline to EOT, a difference of 16.6 in mean 
ranks between the vehicle and sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arms, with a pooled standard deviation 
of approximately 39.5, was used for this purpose. Normal approximation yielded a sample size 
estimate of [ADDRESS_740458] (two -sided p < 0.05) for both co-
primary efficacy endpoints simultaneously is greater than 0.90 (with greater than 0.95 power for each of 
HDSM -Ax-7 and GSP). 
Additionally, sample size estimation was also performed using non-rank-transformed GSP data. An expected 
mean treatment difference  of [ADDRESS_740459] deviation of approximately 170 was used for this 
purpose. This yielded a reduced sample size estimate compared with the target of 300 subjects completing the co-primary efficacy assessments in order to achieve 0.95 power for GSP, further indicating that our sample

size estimations are conservative. Assuming missing data from approximately 15% of subjects, a total of 350 subjects will be targeted for 
enrollment.

1 BACKGROU ND AND CLI NICAL RATIO NALE  
Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating beyond what is expected for thermoregulatory needs and 
environmental conditions. Primary hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating without an alternative origin) is localized, 
characteristically symmetric, and may involve several anatomic areas such as  armpi[INVESTIGATOR_10022], hands, and feet. It affects 
approximately 4.8% of the [LOCATION_002]  (US) population ( Doolittle , 2016 ) and is believed to be caused by [CONTACT_563643]. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563589], significant side 
effects, and/or are invasive and costly.  
Oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_563590], such as glycopyrrolate, have been used to treat hyperhidrosis. The main 
limitations of these drugs are systemic anticholinergic side effects (e.g. , blurred vision, dizziness, dry mouth, 
constipation, urinary retention, and tachycardia). Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563591] a novel, soft- anticholinergic ester 
analog of glycopyrrolate and is  in development for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_563592].  
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563591] a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine receptors located on certain peripheral tiss ues, 
including sweat glands. Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563593], thereby [CONTACT_563644], and as a soft drug, is designed to provide maximal therapeutic 
effect with minimal side effect s. Please refer to the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563594]’s Brochure for more 
information. 
In the current multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], Phase 3 study, Brickell is 
studying the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_519658], 15%, in subjects with 
primary axillary hyperhidrosis over a 6-week period, followed by a 2-week follow-up period.  
Nonclinical Safety Conclusions  
A comprehensive battery of pharmacology, safety pharmacology, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion 
(ADME) , acute to chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity (ongoing), and reproductive toxicity evaluations 
has been conducted to evaluate the safety of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563595]. 
Overall, the results of the nonclinical program support the safe use of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563596]. Please refer to the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563597]’s Brochure for additional information pertaining to the nonclinical studies. 
Prior Human Experience  
Brickell  and its  partner company ( Kaken Pharmaceutical , Japan ) have conducted multiple  clinical  studies of 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563598] [ADDRESS_740462] evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and efficacy of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563599]. Please refer to the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563600]’s 
Brochure for more detailed descriptions and results of the clinical studies.  
Clinical Safety Conclusions   
In studies conducted to date, t hree concentrations  of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 5%, 10%, and 15%, demonstrated 
comparably acceptable safety and tolerability. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or 
moderate in severity with fewer subjects reporting TEAEs in the 5% gel group relative to the 10% and 15% gel 
groups. No deaths or drug-related serious adverse reactions have been reported in any sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563601]. Six serious adverse events have been reported  and all were determined to be unrelated to 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563602].

CONFIDE NTIAL                06 AUG 2020  
Consistent with the soft drug design, a low incidence of systemic anticholinergic adverse events (AEs)  has been 
found in all clinical studies of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654]. The most common anticholinergic AE was dry mouth, 
and all anticholinergic AEs were expected. Of note, the anticholinergi c AEs were predominantly mild or 
moderate in severity and transient in duration  (i.e., resolving gradually with continued use) . All TEAEs 
completely resolved spontaneously with treatment discontinuation. L ocal application site  tolerability reactions of 
burning, itching, pain, erythema, and dryness at the axillae were predominantly minimal in severity and  typi[INVESTIGATOR_563603].  
Clinical Efficacy Conclusions   
Overall, a ll three sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563604], 5%, 10%, and 15%, have exhibited a large r absolute 
mean reduction in gravimetric sweat production (GSP) from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) compared with 
vehicle. Better improvement in GSP response was associated with higher concentrations of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519666]. 
However, while there was a slight trend toward dose response, all gel concentrations were essentially equivalent 
in patient- reported outcome measures based on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure -Axillary 
(HDSM -Ax), Dermatology Quality of Life Index ( DLQI ), and Hyperhidrosis Di sease Severity Score (HDSS) , 
suggesting that all three concentrations are efficacious. The response was seen as early as Day 8 and remained 
consistent throughout the applicable treatment period. 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics  Conclusions   
In PK studies conducted to date,  both sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563605]-4010 could be measured  in the 
majority of subjects. Systemic exposure to sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519665]-4010 appeared to increase in an approximately 
dose-proportional manner when comparing the 5% and 15% gel concentrations, indicating that applying a more 
concentrated gel increased exposure. However, inter- subject variability of PK parameters was extremely high. 
Absorption is thought to be affected by [CONTACT_563645], temperature, hydration, and degree of occlusion.  
Systemic exposure of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519665]-[ADDRESS_740463] dose (Day 1) and also 
after multiple doses (Day 21). Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563606] [ADDRESS_740464] samples analyzed were below 
1 ng/mL, with many below the lower limit of quantification of 0.05 ng/mL for both sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519665]-4010.  
Risk to Subjects   
As an anticholinergic drug, administration of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563607], blurred vision, dizziness, constipation, urinary 
retention, or tachycardia. The previous sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563608] a low 
incidence of these effects, which are generally mild in severity. All such effects have been observed, and as 
expected, to be tr ansient.

to slightly translucent colorless gel and is packaged in a white -colored, metered pump container. One pump 
container is packaged in a carton  with 2 applicators. The total gel volum e in each  pump  container is ~50 mL 
(~43 g). The gross weight of each full container at baseline is approximately 78 to 84 grams.  
Based on one full pump actuation delivering ~0.67 mL of the gel formulation, a total of approximately 38 mL of 
gel is required for 4 weeks (28 days) of daily dosing to the axillae . Ther efore, each pump  container is sufficient 
for ≥[ADDRESS_740475] at Baseline

excursions permitted between 59°F to 86°F (15oC to 30oC). Maintenance of a temperature log (manual or 
automated) is required.   
5.[ADDRESS_740477] will be randomized  via an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to  receive either 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, or vehicle gel (placebo) to topi[INVESTIGATOR_563613], once daily at b edtime, to each axilla 
using the supplied applicators for [ADDRESS_740478] to each axilla using all the gel expressed from 
one full actuation  of the pump per each axilla dose application. Each  full actuation of the pump corresponds to 
approximately 86.5 mg of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563614] 15% investigational product.   
The subject will apply all doses of investigational product at night, prior to going to bed, using the supplied 
applicators. Subjects will apply their first dose of gel prior to bedtime on the night of their Baseline Visit. The 
subject will be instructed to continue applying the investigational product each night with the last application to 
occur the night before attending the end of treatment evaluation (i.e., V isit 12). Subjects should wash the 
applicator each night after dosing. Two applicators are provided in each kit to compensate for loss or damage 
during handling; it is not necessary to use all the applicators over the specified dosing interval. 
To ensure accurate dosing, the study s taff will be instructed to first prime and then weigh each pump container 
before dispensing to the subject. Priming is accomplished by [CONTACT_563649] (5) sequential 
actuations; the dispensed gel from these [ADDRESS_740479]. Over the course of the study, a container will be primed, 
weighed, and dispensed at both the Baseline Visit ( Visit 4, Day 1) and Visit 7 (Day 22) for a total of 2 cont ainers  
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740480] at a next respective visit

End of Treatment visi t (Visit  12), the subject will bring the 2nd container to his/her visit for the final weight 
determination ; however, no additional investigational product will be dispensed. Study subjects may return the 
applicators, or they may discard them after dosing i s completed.  
At each visit, gel application instructions and compliance will be discussed and documented.

• The study product contains alcohol and is flammable. The subject should avoid fire, flames,  or smoking 
during the application and until the gel has dried. The subject should not expose t he container to fire, flame s, 
or extreme heat.  
On the day of a clinic study visit:  
• Showering and shaving  in the morning is permissible. 
• Do not apply any product to the axilla (including S ponsor-supplied non-antiperspi[INVESTIGATOR_563616]). 
• Exercise is to be avoided (e.g., gym, jogging, etc.). 
• Avoid caffeine and tea until the gravimetric assessments are completed.  
5.4 Procedures for Blinding and Unblinding  
This is a double-blind study. All study treatme nts (sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, and vehicle gel) are identi cal in 
color, shape, size, and packaging in order to maintain the blind.  
Subjects, Sponsor personnel, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations personnel, 
data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories will remain b linded to the identity of the treatment from the time of 
randomization until database lock and unblinding, using the following methods: (1) randomization data will be 
maintained by a third party, kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_563652]; (2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_563653], labeling, schedule of administration, and appearance. 
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. 
Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the database, and validated ; subject  
evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the database; and the database is locked.  In the case of a  
medical emergency, the Investigator can break the blind for the subject involved preferably by [CONTACT_563654] (or designee) immediately. After confirmation, the Investigator 
will be contact[CONTACT_85193] a Sponsor representative. The Investigator will record the code break 
in the  subject’s source documents. 
6 CONCOMITA NT MEDICATI ONS/TREATME NTS 
Information  will be recorded  on concomitant medications/treatments (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Tylenol, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
intrauterine device  [IUD], vitamins) taken during study participation, or which may require a washout for study 
participation. Every effort should be made to keep dosing with any concomitant medications consistent/ constant 
during the study.  
6.1 Permissible Medications/Treatments  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject's welfare may be given at the discretion of the I nvestigator. If the 
permissibility of a specific medication/treatment is in question, the M edical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
Subjects will be instructed to not apply any contraindicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_563617] (see list in 
Section 6.2). The Sponsor-supplied non-antiperspi[INVESTIGATOR_563618] [ADDRESS_740485] (suggest applying in the morning).

6.2 Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
The decision to administer a prohibited medication/treatment  is made with the safety of the study participant as 
the primary consideration. When possible, Brickell Biotech’ s Medical Monitor should be notified before a 
prohibited medication/treatment is administered.  
Prior to the inclusion of a subject in the study, as specified in  Sections 4.2 and 4.3 (inclusion/ exclusion  criteria), 
and throughout the duration of the study, the use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited: 
• Anticholinergic agents  used to treat conditions such as , but not limited to,  hyperhidrosis, asthma, 
incontinence, gastrointestinal cramps, and muscular spasms by [CONTACT_250112] (e .g., IV, oral,

7 PROCEDURES  
The timing of each assessment is listed in the Time and Events Table ( Section 7.1).   
Each subject will report for [ADDRESS_740486] visits  (over  11-15 weeks).  
All Screening assessment results must be completed and reviewed prior to the GSP1  Visit (within 31 days). 
Therefore, none of the Screening Visit  days can occur on the same day as the Baseline Visit.  
Subjects may be consented for up to 31 days before the GSP1  Visit . Subjects outside this screening window shall 
be re-consented and certain screening activities may need to be repeated. Prior to enrollment into the treatment 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740487] the Medical Monitor to address such subjects on a 
case-by-case basis.  
In the event of restrictions due to COVID -19, or any other pandemic, the Sponsor may, with IRB approval where 
required, during the study implement some or all study assessments and procedures associated with patient visits 
to be conducted remotely or by [CONTACT_537141] (per FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical 
Products during COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 2020) when the patients’ ability to visit 
investigator sites is impacted.

wellbeing is threatened by [CONTACT_118862]. In the event of premature discontinuation, the Investigator 
should determine the primary reason for discontinuation. A subject may be discontinued from the study if any of 
the following circumstances occur:  
• The subject experiences a SAE  rendering him or her unable to continue study participation. 
• The subject experiences an AE that in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator may pose a significant risk for continued 
participation of the subject in the study . 
• The subject is unable to physically or mentally tolerate the use of the investigational product . 
• An exclusion criterion becomes apparent a t any time during the study ; the Medical Monitor must be contact[CONTACT_563657].  
• The subject is not compliant with the study procedures ; the Medical Monitor must be contact[CONTACT_563658].  
• The subject voluntarily withdraws  from the study. When possible, attempt to identify  the reason the subject 
withdrew consent and document with particular attention paid to whether an underlying AE is at cause.  
• The subject becomes pregn ant. 
• If for any reason per the Investigator’s or the Sponsor’s judgment, discontinuation is in the subject’s best 
interest.  
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the completion of all treatment visits will be asked to complete the 
evalu ations corresponding to Visit 12 (Day 43, End of Treatment). The Sponsor will be notified of early 
discontinuation as soon as possible during the study.

8.1.4  Adverse Events  
Adverse events ( AEs; see Section  9.2) will be collected for all untoward medical occurrences in a subject entered 
into this clinical study (e.g., signed consent), w hether or not a pharmaceutical product has been administered. 
Any event, including local tolerability assessments (see Section  8.1.5 ), that requires specific treatment, results in 
interruption of treatment, or results in discontinuation of the subject from the study will also be reported as an 
AE.   
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal 
questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.   
Appropriate questions include:  
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” 
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact?” 
8.1.5  Local Tolerability Assessments  
Local tolerabi lity assessments ( see Appendix 5 ) will be evaluated through assessment of symptoms at the drug  
application site. These assessments are to be performed for both axillae individually. Subject assessments will be 
made prior to the Investigator assessments.  
Subject Local Tolerability Assessments:  Subjects will be queried about whether any symptoms occurred at the 
study drug application site within the previous 24 hours and further whether any such symptoms persisted longer 
than 1 hour following study drug ap plication. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any burning, stinging, or itching.  
Investigator Local Tolerability Assessments: Investigators will observe for the existence of any significant 
local symptoms at the  study drug application site. Significant local symptoms are defined as those not ordinarily 
observed following application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_119029]. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any erythema or scaling. 
Local tolerability signs and symptoms that result in a subject requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of 
treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will be reported as AEs.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_740498] complete ALL self -assessments while at  the clinic (i.e., HDSM -Ax, DLQI, PGI- S, PGI-C ) prior to 
assessments being made by [CONTACT_737]. Please see Appendix 2  and Appendix 3  (HDSM -Ax by [CONTACT_654] ; also 
includes PGI- S and PGI -C) and Appendix 4  (DLQI)  for a full description of these assessments.  Subjects will also 
have the option to complete an End of Study Survey. The HDSM -Ax, DLQI, P GI-S, and PGI- C assessments, as 
well as the optional End of Study Survey, will be collected electronically using a table t device. Site personnel 
will be trained and a separate electronic clinical outcomes assessment (eCOA ) manual will be supplied. 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740499] Dermatitis (Skin Sensitization) Assessment  
Allergic contact [CONTACT_8748] (ACD), as an AE, may manifest as moderate/severe pruritis and moderate/severe 
erythem a with or without vesicles/bullae.  
In the case of a suspected AE of ACD, the medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_224817]. If the 
medical monitor and the investigator agree that the AE is suggestive of ACD, the assigned treatment should be 
withh eld, the AE documented, and treated, if required, by [CONTACT_563659][INVESTIGATOR_563623]. Once the AE of ACD is resolved, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], any concomitant therapy for this AE should be stopped, and the assigned treatment should be 
restarted (i.e., re -challenge exposure) after discussion with the medical monitor. If there is recurrence, an AE of 
ACD  is confirmed and should be documented as an AE that is related to the assigned treatment.  
8.2 Summary of Methods of Data Collection  
This protocol will utilize validated 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Part 11 complia nt electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) software  and eCOA software  to collect required study data. The Investigator must ensure that data 
are properly recorded on each subject’s eCRFs , eCOAs , and related documents. When changes or corrections are 
made in the eCRF, the EDC  system s will maintain an audit trail of the person making the changes, the date and 
time of the change, and the reason for the change. Only individuals listed on the Delegation of Responsibilities 
Log with responsibility for eCRF completion may make entries in the eCRFs. 
The Investigator or physician Sub-I nvestigator must electronically sign and date each subject’s eCRF  for each 
timepoint completed. Individuals who will be providing electronic signatures must first submit documentation 
with a handwritten signature [CONTACT_28285] a legally binding equivalent to their 
handwritt en signature.  
8.3 Efficacy Measures  
The following assessment measures will be conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy of  sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519673], 15% as indicated in the Procedures  Section 7.1: 
• HDSM -Ax as measured by [CONTACT_423]  
• GSP as measured by [CONTACT_737]

9.2 Adverse Events  
9.2.1  Definitions of Adverse Events  
According to 21 CFR Parts 312.32 and 320.32 (IND Safety Reporting, Applicability of R equirements Regarding 
an "Invest igational New Drug Application" ), Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance for Industry 
(Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting Requirements for Human Drug and Biological Products and Safety 
Reporting Requirements for Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies in Humans) (Federal Register/Vol. 75, 
No. 188/September 29, 2010) and International Council on Harmonisation ( ICH) E2A (Clinical Safety and Data 
Management: Definitions and Sta ndards for Expedited Reporting): 
An adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. 
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to classify a test result, 
medical condition, or other incident as an AE: 
Adverse events will be recorded from the time of in formed consent. 
Abnormal laboratory values should not generally be recorded as AEs unless an intervention is required, the 
laboratory abnormality results in a n SAE , the lab abnormality results in study termination or 
interruption/discontinuation of study t reatment, or the lab abnormality is associated with clinical signs or 
symptoms. When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather 
than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” rather than “low hemoglobin”). 
Complications that occur in association with a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as 
biopsies) should be recorded as AEs. 
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis under a 
single event term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629] .” If possible, abnormal laboratory results that meet the definition of an AE (see above) should be 
reported as a clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal value itself (e.g., “anemia” rather than “decreased blood 
count”). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation and Monitoring Adverse Events  
All AEs encountered during the clinical trial following subject consent through the last study drug visit will be 
recorded on the appropriate Adverse Events e CRF.  
Special considerations:  
Elective procedures or routinely scheduled treatments are not considered AEs. However, an untoward medical 
event occurring in association with a preschedule d elective procedure should be recorded as an AE. 
A baseline condition is not considered an AE unless the condition worsens following study drug administration. 
Death itself is not considered an AE; it is, instead, the outcome of an AE. 
SAEs  that are considered related (i.e., determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related) to sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563624] (see Section 9.4).

CONFIDE NTIAL                06 AUG 2020  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Adverse Events  
For each AE, the start and resolution  dates, intensity, seriousness ( i.e., whether the event meets the definition of 
an SAE [Section 9.3.1 ]), relationship of the event to the study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and 
outcome of the event will be documented on the e CRF.  
Intensity  
The following definitions should be used to assess and grade AE intensity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant.  
Severity  Grade  Description  
Mild  1 Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate  2 Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe  3 Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
Note: a severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  
Relationship  
The relationship of an AE to study drug should be assessed using the guidelines presented in the table below. An 
AE for which there has been no causal relationship reported will require follow-up to determine causality. 
Adverse Event Relationships to Study Drug  
Degree of Certainty  Description  
Definitely Related  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test article; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732], and reappearance of the event on repeated 
exposure (re -challenge).  
Probably Related  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test article; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the  test article; and that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_229767]; and that is unlikely to have 
been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes.  
Possibly Related  An event th at follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test article; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; but may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
Unlikely Related  An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the test article, or most 
likely was caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness , other drug, procedure, or other causes, 
because of their known effects.  
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740501] certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or 
other causes.  
 
Outcome  
Each AE will be characterized according to the outcomes described in the following table:  
Outcome  Description  
Recovered/Resolved  The subject has fully recovered from the event with no observable 
residual effects.  
Recovering/Resolving  The effects of the event are improving, or events have stabilized (are 
constant and not expected to improve or worsen) but have not returned 
to baseline.  
Not recovered/ Not Resolved  The effects of the event are still present and changing. The event is not 
considered stabilized or resolved.  
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  The subject has fully recovered from the event with some observable 
residual effects.  
Fatal  The event was the primary cause of death (may or may not be the 
immediate cause of death).  
Unknown  The event outcome is unknown.  
Death is an outcome of an event and not an event per se . Sudden death or death due to unexplainable cause(s) is 
to be reported, but follow-up will be pursued until cause of death is determined. 
Action Taken with Study Drug  
Action taken with study drug in relation to each adverse event will be characterized as follows:  
• None 
• Drug withdrawn  
• Drug interrupted  
• Dose reduction 
• Unknown 
• Not applicable 
• Other (specify on e CRF)  
9.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that is serious (see definition below) and occurs after administration of study drug must be reported to 
the CRO  Medical Monitor  within [ADDRESS_740502] also be reported to the CRO within 24 hours of discovery of the event.

9.3.1  Definition and Reporting Procedures  
An AE  should be classified as an SAE  if it meets one of the following cri teria:  
Fatal:  The adverse event resulted in death.  
Life Threatening:  The adverse event placed the subject  at immediate risk of death. This classification does not 
apply to an adverse event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The adverse event required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563625] -ups are not serious adverse events by [CONTACT_46668].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563626].  
Disabling/Incapacitating:  Resulted in a substantial and permanent disruption of the subject ’s ability to carry  out 
activities of daily living.  
Congenital Anomaly or Birth 
Defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject  exposed to the study drug or study 
treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
Medically Significant:  The adverse event did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have jeopardized the 
subject  and might have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Every SAE (regardless of suspected causality) should be reported to the CRO  Medical Monitor  within [ADDRESS_740503] /Institutional Ethics 
Committee  (IRB/IEC ) in accordance with federal and institutional laws and regulations.  
Additional updates from the I nvestigator may be necessary as more information becomes availab le on the SAE, 
and all treatment -related SAEs will be followed until the acute event has resolved or stabilized, even if the 
subject discontinues study participation prior to the SAE resolution. Any new information or follow-up 
information pertaining to previously reported SAEs will be reported to the CRO  Medical Monitor  within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the new or follow-up information. The new or follow-up information should be 
faxed to [PHONE_221] (US toll- free: 1 -[PHONE_222]) or e- mailed to safety -[EMAIL_207].  
Any SAE that occurs after study completion, and is considered by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to be related to sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563627], should be reported to the Sponsor. 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting to regulatory agencies. SAEs that 
qualify for expedited reporting will be submitted to regulatory agencies in accordance with federal regulation 
(21 CFR 312.32).

9.5 Pregnancy Reporting  
Sexually active females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) * must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study 
enrollment and must use an acceptable  method of contraception during the course of the study, in a manner such 
that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, FOCBP must be advised of the importance of 
avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion. 
FOCBP must agree to periodic pregnancy testing and use a medically acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study. This includes perimenopausal women who are <[ADDRESS_740505] menses. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:  
• Abstinence for the duration of the study or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy); OR 
• Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods started ≥2 months  prior to 
screening; OR  
• Non-hormonal contrace ption, including IUD ( ≥1-week status post placement) or properly used barrier 
methods (e.g., male or female condoms with or without spermicide, cervical cap/diaphragm  with 
spermicid e). 
* FOCBP for this study includes any premenopausal female capable of becoming pregnant who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation [ ≥6 months prior to baseline] or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmeno pausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months ).   
Subjects who become sexually active or begin to have relations with a partner who is not sterile during the trial 
must agree to use an ac ceptable form of birth control for the duration of the study. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_740506] they might be pregnant (e.g., 
missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or Investigator suspects that a subject may be  pregnant at any time 
during the study, the investigational product must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are 
available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further investigational product and 
must be discontinued from the study. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_740507] the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance 
form. The form will be sent to the CRO  Medical Monitor by [CONTACT_12100] [PHONE_221] (US toll- free: [PHONE_2626]) 
or e-mailed to safety -[EMAIL_207]. The Investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy 
associated with the study therapy and keep careful source documentation of the event.  
Protocol- required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up 
procedures should be considered if indicated, including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_563661] (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the I nvestigator must report to the 
CRO Medical Monitor, on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow- up information regarding

CONFIDE NTIAL                06 AUG 2020  
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal (period immediately before and after birth) and neonatal (infants 
up to 28 days after birth) outcome.   
Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs (or 
SAEs , if they fu lfill the SAE criteria). Offspring will be followed for a minimum of eight weeks.  Any 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test article(s) will be recorded as a 
SAE and details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form. An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
elective or spontaneous, will be reported as a SAE.  
9.6 Other Safety Measures  
Safety will also be assessed by [CONTACT_31029] , laboratory tests, and measurement of vital signs assessed 
as indicated thr oughout the study schedule. Clinically significant changes in these parameters may be captured as 
adverse events.  
10 STATISTICAL PROCEDUR ES

10.3 Analysis Methods  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population with missing values imputed. The co-
primary efficacy endpoints are: 
• The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-7 scale score from 
baseline to EOT  in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% group versus vehicle; and 
• The change in GSP from baseline to EOT in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563628], 15% group versus vehicle . 
Both comparisons will be conducted using two-sided tests at an alpha=0.05 level. Both endpoints will need to 
demonstrate a statistical ly significan t positive result in favor of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% for the study to be 
considered successful.   
The key elements of the primary efficacy analysis for each co -primary endpoint are described below.  
10.3.1  Primary and Secondary Analysis of the HDSM -Ax-7 Co-Primary Endpoint    
Data:  HDSM -Ax-7  total scores 2-point responder status (0, 1) at EOT . Missing data will be imputed first before 
analysis is performed.  
Imputation Model:  Imputation will be item -level. If a subject is missing values for any of items 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 
2c, 2d, or 2e at Visit 4 (Day 1), the Visit 1 (Screening) value will be used as Baseline. If the Visit 1 (Screening) 
value is also missing, the subject will be excluded from all HDSM -Ax-[ADDRESS_740518] (in time) available non-missing value from Day 41 (±2 days) or Day 
42 (±2 days) will be used as the first level of imputation . Should none of the Days  41, 42, and 43 values be 
available,  multiple imputations  of missing EOT  item-level scores will be performed on the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563629]-4000- CL-302/03 Page 50 of 102 
CONFIDE NTIAL                06 AUG 2020  
gel, 15% arm values using a control- based imputations ( CBI) methodology (s ee Section 10.3.4 ). Multiple 
imputations assuming miss ing at random will be performed for missing data for vehicle subjects.  The HDSM -
Ax-7 score will be calculated using the imputed item -level values. Further details on imputation methods will be 
provided in the SAP. 
Analysis Model:   Logistic Regression  Model 
Covariates:   The following covariates  are planned:  
• Treatment (class effect: sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654] , 15% group, vehicle group) 
• Baseline HDSM -Ax-7 total score  
• Analysis center  (see Section 10.3.3 ) 
Hypothesis Tested:  
The null hypothesis 
H0: The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-7 scale score 
from baseline to EOT  is the same in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, and vehicle arms   
will be tested against the two -sided alternative hypothesis: 
H1: The proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement in the HDSM- Ax-7 scale score 
from baseline to EOT  is not the same in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, and vehicle arms . 
Estimand:   The estimand of this co -primary efficacy analysis is the difference  in proportions between 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, and vehicle  arms with a 2 -point improvement from baseline to EOT in 
HDSM -Ax-7 total scores among all ITT subjects, regardless of treatment adherence.  
As a secondary, supportive analysis, change from baseline to EOT will be analyzed as a continuous measure.  
The analysis model will be an ANCOVA model with tr eatment, baseline HDSM -Ax-7 score, and analysis center 
as covariates.  The estimand for this analysis is the difference in mean baseline to EOT changes in HDSM- Ax-7 
total scores between sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, and vehicle arms among all ITT subjects, regardless of 
treatment adherence.   
In addition, a separate site poolability analysis will be performed with analysis center -by-treatment interaction 
terms added to the primary analysis model. An overall p < 0.[ADDRESS_740519] to account for the potentia l heterogeneity. 
10.3.2  Primary and Secondary Analyse s of the GSP Co -Primary Endpoint    
Data: Either rank -based GSP change from baseline to EOT or continuous GSP change from baseline to EOT will 
be analyzed. The GSP assessment is known to be a highly variable measure , and as such, the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_563630] -primary endpoint will be continuous or rank transformed. The 
normality test will be performed prior to multiple imputation for missing data and separately for  each arm. 
Should the normality assumption be violated for either arm, the co-primary endpoint will be analyzed using rank-
transformed GSP data. If the normality assumption holds for both arms, then the co-primary endpoint will be 
analyzed using continuous GSP data.  
For the rank transformation  of GSP measurements at a particular time point , continuous data for all subjects will 
be ranked t ogether without regard  to treatment assignment, from smallest to highest value. The smallest 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740520], the continuous GSP data will be 
ranked separately at each of Visits  2, 3, and 4; the median of the three ranks will be used as baseline value of the 
subject.  Using the measurement data from Visits 10, 11, and 12, the rank- transformed GSP value at EOT will be 
derived in the same manner. For each subject, the difference between the rank -transform ed baseline and EOT 
GSP values (EOT – baseline) will serve as the outcome value for the rank -based GSP ANCOVA analysis.     
Missing EOT GSP data ( continuous data) will be im puted before analysis is performed.  
Imputation Model:  Imputation will be done using continuous data prior to rank-transformation, should the 
normality assumption be violated. For continuous data, subjects  with results  (see Section 10.3.3 ) meeting the 
criterion for “outlier” will be removed from imputation sampling database (i.e. , data for v ehicle patients) prior to 
missing data imputation . From the remaining imputation samplin g database  of continuous GSP measurements, 
multiple imputations of missing EOT sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519666], 15% arm GSP values will be performed using a CBI 
methodology (s ee Section  10.3.4 ). Multiple imputations assuming MAR  will be performed for missing EOT data 
vehicle subjects.  Further details on multiple imputations will be provided in the SAP.  
Analysis Model:  ANCOVA model  (either non-ranked or ranked, pending outcome of normality test)  
Fixed effects:  The following fixed effects are planned: 
• Treatment (class effect: sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654] , 15% group, vehicle group) 
• Baseline GSP  (either non -ranked or ranked, pending outcome of normality test) 
• Analysis center  (see Section 10.3.3 ) 
Hypothesis Tested:  
The null hypothesis 
H0: The rank-based  GSP changes from baseline to EOT  are the same in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 
15%, and vehicle groups 
will be tested against the two -sided alternative hypothesis: 
H1: The rank-based  GSP changes from baseline to EOT  are not the same in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 
15%, and vehicle groups. 
Estimand:   The estimand of this co-primary efficacy analysis is the mean  difference  between treatments , 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, versus vehicle , in the change from baseline to EOT for GSP among all ITT 
subjects, regardless of treatment adherence.  
Additionally , the following secondary and supportive analyses will be performed for the GSP co- primary 
endpoint:  
(a) U sing the same methodology as described above,  an ANCOVA analysis will be performed foreither the non-
rank transformed, continuous GSP data, or the rank transformed GSP data, pending the results of the normality 
test. If the normality assumption is violated and the rank -transformed data are used as the co -primary endpoint, 
analysis of the continuous data will be supportive. If the normality assumption holds and the continuous dat a are 
used as the co -primary endpoint, then analysis of the rank-transformed data will be supportive. 
(b) To further address the potential large variations in GSP data, mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analyses will be performed to estimate the  average  sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% treatment effect over the 
6-week course of treatment, i.e. the average sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% v ersus  vehicle difference  from 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563575]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740521] to missing data, missing data will not be imputed for this analysis.   In 
addition, based on the BBI-4000 CL- 203 results, treatment versus visit interactions are not expected.  Details of 
the analysis models wi ll be provided in the SAP.   
(c) For the primary endpoint of either ranked or continuous GSP (pending normality test results), a  separate site
poolability analysis will be performed with analysis center -by-treatment interaction terms added to the primary
analysis model. An overall p < 0.[ADDRESS_740522] to account for the potential heterogeneity.
10.3.3  Method of Pooling Sites to Generate Analysis Centers  
Subjects from low enrolling sites will be pooled in order to generate analysis centers . The minimum number of 
subjects per  analysis center  is 10.  For sites with <[ADDRESS_740523] 10 
subjects.  All analyses that are controlled  for site will  use this analysi s center  designation.  Site poolability  will 
also be assessed  as described  in Sections 10.3.1  and 10.3.2 . Full details  will be  provided  in th e SAP. 
10.3.4  Handling of Missing Data for the Co -Primary Efficacy Endpoints  in the ITT Population  
For both HDSM- Ax-7 and GSP, multiple imputations for missing  values in the vehicle group will be performed 
assum ing MAR .  For the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% group , multiple imputations using the CBI model will be 
employed as the primary imputation method to handle missing data.  This approach will  adopt a missing not at 
random (MNAR) assumption and missing values in the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, group will be imputed 
based on a distribution with estimated values at visits lost to follow -up similar to that of subjects in the vehicle 
group. This approach further assumes that for the treatment effect observed in sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% 
arm, subjects with missing data gradually trends towards the estimated mean in the vehicle group, i.e., any 
treatment benefit gained is not immediately lost upon withdrawal. The sam e co-primary analysis models will be 
applied to the multiple imputed datasets and the results combined via Rubin’s rules ( Rubin, 1976 ).  
Furthermore, in order to ensure that the missing data imputation method proposed is robust to outliers  for the 
GSP co -primary endpoint , data from subject s that meet the criterion for being an outlier will  be removed  from the 
imputation sampling database as follows . Combining the Vehicle and sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arms, the 
mean and standard deviation will be calculated for the non- missing GSP change from baseline to EOT data. Data 
values more than [ADDRESS_740524] deviation will be re-calculated to see if any 
additional outliers are identified. This process will be repeated until no more outliers are identified. Prior to 
performing imputation for missing GSP change from baseline data in the ITT population, data values 
contributing to the outlying observations will be removed from the imputation sampling database, i.e. the non-
missing vehicle data. With this approach, outlying data will not be propagated during missing data imputation. 
Once an imputation is complete, all original non -missing data and the imputed, previously missing data will be 
used for the GSP ITT analysis.  Further details for this approach will be included in the SAP.

10.3.5  Sensitivity Analyses of the Co -Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
To further explore the robustness of the primary analysis results  to different missing data assumptions, analyses 
using t wo additional imputation methods will be performed as presented below.  Furthermore, the ranked GSP 
and non- rank transform ed GSP  ANCOVA  analyses will be repeated  without imputing missing data, and again 
after removing outlier data. Additionally, the 7 items in the HDSM -Ax-7 scale will be analyzed individually to 
support the primary analysis for this co-primary endpoint.

Unless otherwise specified, sensitivity analyses  pertain to the primary analyses for the co -primary endpoints only.  
A brief description of each sensitivity analysis is provided below; c omplete details  will be included in the final 
SAP.  
Sensitivity Analysis 1: To further investigate the robustness of the GSP co-primary efficacy endpoint, the ranked 
and non- rank transformed GSP analyses will be repeated on all available data only without imputing missing 
data. The methodology will be similar to the primary analysis of the GSP co-primary endpoint.  
Sensitivi ty Analysis 2: To further investigate the robustness of the GSP co-primary efficacy outcome, the ranked 
and non- rank transformed GSP analyses will be repeated after removing outlier data (as defined in Section 
10.3.4 ). The methodology will be similar to the primary analysis of the GSP co -primary endpoint, except that 
outlier data will be removed from the imputed database for these analyses . 
Sensitivity Ana lysis 3: Missing post- baseline HDSM -Ax-7 data will be imputed as failure/non -response in both 
treatment groups. The co- primary efficacy HDSM -Ax-7 analysis will be re -run on the so-imputed HDSM -Ax-7 
dataset and treatment success proportion estimates will be  produced.

Sensitivity Analysis 5: A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to investigate whether any of the individual 
items in the HDSM -Ax-[ADDRESS_740525] a 2 -point improvement in the individual question from baseline to 
EOT. The logistic regression model for the primary analysis for HDSM- Ax-7 will be repeated for each of the 7 
individual items, and each individual question will be analyzed separately. Secondly, one of the 7 items will be 
omitted, and the HDSM- Ax-7 total score will be calculated as the average of the remaining 6 items. The primary 
logistic regression analysis for 2 -point improvement response rate will be performed on thi s 6-item scale. This 
process will be repeated 7 times, each time with a different item of the HDSM -Ax-7 scale removed from 
calculation of the overall score.  
10.3.6  Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
A gated, fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used  in this protocol to control the overall familywise false 
positive error rate for the primary and secondary endpoints analyses. As described above, the primary analysis 
will be regarded as positive and the tr ial will be successful for the co -primary effica cy endpoints if both null 
hypotheses in Section 10.3.1  and Section 10.3.2  of no difference are rejected in favor of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 
15% at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
If both co-primary analyses yield statistically significant result s in favor of the sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% 
group, the three secondary efficacy endpoints specified in Section  10.2.[ADDRESS_740526] been 
rejected at the 2 -sided alpha= 0.05 significance level in favor of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%.     
The HDSM -Ax-[ADDRESS_740527]. All other  exploratory 
efficacy endpoints that involve a  proportion of responders will be analyzed using methods similar to what was 
described for the HDSM -Ax-7 co-primary endp oint. All other exploratory endpoints that involve a change from 
baseline to a  single timepoint will be analyzed using methods similar to what is described for the GSP co-primary  
endpoint. P-values for exploratory efficacy endpoints will be provided for descriptive purposes only and no 
formal hypothesis testing will occur.  All exploratory efficacy analyses will be based on available data and 
missing GSP and HDSM-Ax EOT data imputed.

subjects reporting any given TEAE will be tabulated cumulatively by [CONTACT_926]; each subject will be counted only 
once according to the worst severity reported up to the current visit. Separate tables will be constructed for (a) all 
reported TEAEs, (b) protoco l treatment -related TEAEs, (c)  serious TEAEs, (d) TEAEs leading to protocol 
treatment discontinuation  (e) protocol treatment -related serious TEAEs, (f) severe TEAEs, (g) TEAEs leading to

At each visit, local tolerability assessments  will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_926]. For any symptoms, 
subject severity is the worst severity of the two axillae.  
An overall summary table will also be presented with subject incidences tab ulated according to the worst severity 
experienced while on study. In addition, a t each post -baseline visit, local tolerability will be summarized as 
cumulative shift tables versus  baseline. Subject counts for each symptom will be cross- tabulated with baseline 
severity according to the maximum post- baseline severity reported for either axilla up to the current visit.     
Laboratory parameters will be descriptively summarized (mean, standard deviation , median, minimum, 
maximum) for values obtained at Visi t 1 and Visit 12.  Whereas, v ital signs will be summarized in a similar 
manner at each visit.   
10.5 Sample Size  
Sample size estimation was performed for the co -primary efficacy endpoints based on the results of a Phase 2b 
study ( BBI-4000- CL-203): 
• HDSM -Ax-7 resp onder analysis: 2-point improvement response rates of 29.8% and 53.7% were assumed 
for the vehicle and sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arms , respectively. The power is 0.95 with 116 subjects 
per arm and a total of 232 subjects. 
• GSP: using rank transformed GSP data for change from baseline to EOT, a difference of 16.6 in mean 
ranks between the vehicle and sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% arms, with a pooled standard deviation of 
approximately 39.5, was used for this purpose. Normal approximation yielded a sample si ze estimate of 
[ADDRESS_740530] for the GSP endpoint were used to 
estimate the above sample size a nd power for each endpoint. With approximately 300 evaluable subjects, the 
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_563572]-4000- CL-302/[ADDRESS_740531] (two -sided p < 0.05) for both co-
primary efficacy endpoints simultaneously is greater than 0.90 (with greater than 0.95 power for each of HDSM-
Ax-7 and GSP).

site. Randomization details, including block size, will be prespecified in a randomization plan. 
After subjects qualify for the study ( as determined by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator at the Screening/Rescreening  Visit s), they

Set Up  
IMPORTA NT:  Make sure that you distinguish each gravimetric collection packet Right (R) from 
Left (L) throughout the gravimetric measurement (i.e., during set up, measurement).  
• Clip or shave axilla hair if present. Use an electric razor or clippers so a short stubb le (<1  mm) is 
present (blade shaving may irritate the skin or cause folliculitis;  ok for men and women who use a 
manual razor routinely). Wash and clean the axilla to remove all loose hair or stubble. Towel dry 
the axilla( e).  
• Place the subject in a room w ith controlled humidity and temperature between 20°C and 25°C 
(68°F to 77°F) for at least [ADDRESS_740552] should remain in a 
semirecumbent position.   
• Measurements will be done in the same room throughout the study.  
• To the best  of their ability, t he same Study Site Staff member will perform the evaluation for each 
subject both within and across subjects. If this is not possible  due to  extenuating circumstances 
(e.g., vacation, illness, etc.), another qualified Study Site Staff M ember cross -trained by [CONTACT_563664].   
• Refer to the detailed study training manual and video for step -by-step directions.   
Filter Paper Measurement  
• Prepare the cotton towel, filter paper , and conical tube for the assessment.    
• Place one filter paper and the conical tube  with lid on  the Sponsor -provided balance sensitive to 
[ADDRESS_740553] its weight. Tare the weight of the filter paper and conical tube .   
• Have subject assume a semi -reclining position with the axilla fully exposed and the arm resting 
comfortably above the head.    
• Dry the axilla gently with the cotton towel.  
• Using talc -free gloves, place the preweighed filter paper in the center of the axilla against the 
subject ’s skin, and have the patient carefully fold their axilla down to hold the filter paper in 
place. Immediately start the timer for 5 min utes. Immediately  after 5 minutes , ask the patient to 
lift his/her arm and gently lift the filter paper out of the axilla ry vault and place it into the conical 
tube and replace lid to avoid evaporative loss of fluid.    
• Record the  time and   weight.   
• Refer to detailed study training manual and video for step -by-step directions.

 Original Text  Based on analysis of results from a previous Phase 2b study (CL -203), the following treatment 
differences (and variation) are expected in this 
protocol for the co -primary efficacy endpoints:  
 
• HDSM -Ax-7 responder analysis: an 
expected treatment difference of 23.9% with 
a reference (vehicle group) response rate of 
approximately 29.8%. However, to be 
conservative, the lower limit of a 1 -sided 
75% confidence interval for the difference 
estimate, 18%, was used for samp le size and 
power estimation.   
 
• GSP: an expected mean treatment 
difference of [ADDRESS_740591] 
deviation of approximately 170. However, 
to be conservative, the lower limit of a 
1-sided 62.5% confidence inter val for the 
difference estimate, [ADDRESS_740592] for the GSP endpoint were used 
to estimate power for each endpoint. It is estimated 
that 450 total subjects will need to be randomized 
(in a 1:1 allocation) with 406 subjects completing 
the co -primary efficacy assessments (approximately 
10% drop -out rate). With [ADDRESS_740593] (two -sided p < 0.05) for both co-primary endpoints

simultaneously is greater than 0.90 (with greater than 0.95 power for each of HDSM -Ax-7 and 
GSP).  
 
Additionally, sample size estimation was also 
performed using rank -transformed GSP data. A 
difference of 16.[ADDRESS_740594] deviation of approximately 42 was used 
for this purpose. This yielded a reduced sample size 
estimate compared with the target of 406 subjects 
completing the co -primary efficacy assessments in 
order to  achieve 0.95 power for GSP, further 
indicating that our sample size estimations are conservative. 
 Revised Text  Sample size estimation was performed for the co-primary efficacy endpoints based on the results of a 
Phase 2b study ( BBI-4000 -CL-203):  
 
• HDSM -Ax-7 responder analysis: 2-point 
improvement response rates of 29.8% and 
53.7% were assumed for the vehicle and 
sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654] , 15%  arms 
respectively. The power is 0.95 with 116

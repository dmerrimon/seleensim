RATIONA LE
The protocol has been amended to allow patients who remain on the study and elect to 
rollover into the optional long- term follow -up (LTFU) portion of the study to be followed 
for survival data , and p atients who continue to receive study drug will also be monitored 
for safety events.  Patients on study drug will continue therapy until they have received a 
total of 2 years of atezolizumab treatment (32 cycles) .  Thereafter patients will continue 
to be contact[CONTACT_33426] -up every [ADDRESS_32798] been made:
Section 1.[ADDRESS_32799] current FDA-approved atezolizumab
prescribing information.
Section 2 (Table 3) has been updated to remove independent review facility (IRF)
assessments from study endpoints .
In Section 3.1 language regarding using public resources to obtain survival d ata and 
details on the handling of that data was removed.  Also, language was added that 
allows patients to receive up to a total of 2 years of atezolizumab treatment
(32cycles) .
In Section 3.2it was clarified that collection of LTFU for patients is optional.  Also, 
language was added to define the length of the LTFU .
In Section 4.5.9, language regarding using public resources to obtain survival data 
and details on the handling of that data was removed.   Also the LTFU email address 
was removed.
In Section 5.3.1, adverse event reporting for patients who receive atezolizumab and 
continue in the LFTU portion of the study has been added. All adverse events 
should be reported until [ADDRESS_32800] dose of 
atezolizumab for these patients.
In Section 6, language was added to clarify that the overall survival analysis will be 
updated once the LTFU data is available, and will be summarized in a separate 
report.
In Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_32801] been 
removed.
Appendix 1 was renamed to Appendix 1a (Schedule of Activities ) and footnote “e” 
was revised to re fer to Appendix 1b for assessments related to the LTFU.
Appendix 1b was created to outline the assessments related to the LTFU.

Screening tests and evaluations will be performed within [ADDRESS_32813] evidence of 
radiographic disease progression or loss of clinical benefit.  Data from the latter blood draws will 
be used to explore whether the radiographic findings are consistent with changes in bTMB as 
measured by [CONTACT_33428] -based assay s and to explore possible mutational mechanisms of 
resistance.  Additional blood samples may be taken at each scan as defined in the schedule of 
activities.
Tissue biopsies (tissue blocks preferred) may  be submitted at any time during the study, with 
biopsie s from diagnosis (archival or fresh) and at progression preferred.  For patients who 
provide tissue samples, next generation sequencing (NGS) may  be performed by [CONTACT_33429].  If performed by [CONTACT_33430], the investigator can obtain results from these 
analyses in the form of an NGS report, which is available upon request directly from Foundation 
Medicine.  The investigator may share and discuss the results with the patient, unless the 
patient chooses otherwise.  The Foundation Medicine NGS assay , FoundationOne,has not 
been cleared or approved by [CONTACT_21652].  The NGS report is generated for research 
purposes and is not provided for the purpose of guiding future treatment decisions. Results may 
not be available for samples that do not meet testing criteria.   Patients who are unable to 
undergo biopsy sample collection but otherwise meet the eligibility criteria may still be enrolled 
to receive atezolizumab.
All patients will undergo tumor assessment at baseline and every 6 weeks ( 7 days) thereafter 
regardless of dose delays for the first 12 months following Cycle 1, Day 1.  After 12 months, 
tumor assessment will be required every 9 weeks ( 7 days); tumor assessments will continue 
until disease progression per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_32814].  Patients who discontinue 
treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., toxicity) will continue scheduled 
tumor assessments until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, study discontinuation, 
study completion (i.e., end of study), or death, whichever occurs first.  In the absence of disease 
progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start a new 
anti-cancer therapy, unless consent is withdrawn.
All patients will be followed for survival and anti -cancer therapy while in the study and will be 
given the option of participating in a long- term follow -upwhich will include collection of long -
term su rvival data beyond the end of the study .The optional long -term follow -up will begin 
following the end of the study.  Patients must provide additional consent to participate in this 
optional long -term follow -up. Patients on study drug will continue therapy until they have 
received a total of 2 years of atezolizumab treatment (32 cycles).  Thereafter, patients will 
continue overall survival follow -up every [ADDRESS_32815] dose for a study drug 
discontinuation visit.  Patients who discontinue will not be replaced.
Number of Patients

–A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilizati on 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus).
–Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -
releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.
–The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of contraception.

Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
18/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Investigational Medicinal Products
The investigational medicinal product for this study is atezolizumab.
Test Produc t (Investigational Drug)
Patients will receive 1200 mg of atezolizumab (equivalent to an average body weight based 
dose of 15 mg/kg) administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 ( 3) days.  Administration of 
atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emerge ncy medical facilities and staff who are 
trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.
Non-Investigational Medicinal Products
Premedication with antihistamines may be administered for any atezolizumab infusions after 
Cycle 1.  Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy should continue their use.  In general, investigators should manage a 
patient’s care with supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33378] d per local standards.  
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may  attenuate potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  Therefore, in situations where s ystemic corticosteroids 
or TNF- inhibitors would be routinely ad ministered, alternatives, including antihistamines, 
should be considered first by [CONTACT_1963].  If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic 
corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may  be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician except in the case of patients for whom CT scans with contrast are contraindicated 
(i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance).
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, with caution at the discretion of the treating 
physician, for the treatment of specific adverse events when associated with atezolizumab 
therapy.  
Statistical Methods
Primary Efficacy A nalyses
The efficacy  analy sis population will be based on all patients who have received at least one 
dose of study drug.  The primary  efficacy  endpoint of this study is investigator -assessed 
objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients whose confirmed best 
overall response is either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) per RECIST v1.1.  
For this analysis, patients not meeting these criteria, including patients without at least one post -
baseline response assessment, will be considered non -responders.  An estimate of the ORR 
from all patients who received study drug and the 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_33434].  
Primary Biomarker A nalyses
Biom arker analysis population will be based on all patients who have received at least one dose 
of stud y drug and have baseline biomarker assessment.  Kaplan -Meier (K -M) curves and a log -
rank test will be used to evaluate the differences in investigator -assessed PFS between 
mutation positive versus negative groups at various cutoff points.  Tests will be tw o-sided at a 
significance level of 0.10.
Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for this study is based on the primary efficacy objective and primary biomarker 
objective.  Based on 150 patients, the maximum half width of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the 
estimated ORR will be within 8%.  Additionally, based on 120 biomarker -evaluable patients (80% 
of the study population), with a minimum follow -up of 6 months during the primary  analysis, and 
with 28 patients in the smaller biomarker positive or negative gro up (19% of the study 
population), the study primary biomarker analy sis will have 89% and 79% power to detect PFS 
difference if the hazard ratios of PFS between the biomarker positive vs. negative group is 0.[ADDRESS_32823] 
been enro lled.  The purpose of the interim analy sis is to provide preliminar y results in evaluating 
the biomarker cutoff and to perform a futility analysis.  No conclusions or study 
alterations/terminations are to be made based on the biomarker interim analy sis res ults.  No 
type-1 error adjustments will be made for the interim analysis.

22/Protocol ML39237, Version 51. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON NONSMA LL CELL LUNG CA NCER
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is the most 
common cancer in both men and women, accounting for approximately 224,390 of all 
new cases and nearly 160,000 deaths in 201 6in the [LOCATION_002] (Miller et al. 2016 ; 
SEER Stat Fact Sheet 2016 ). Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is the predominant 
subtype of lung cancer, accounti ng for approximately 85% of all cases 
(Molina etal.2008 ; Howlader etal.2014 ).  NSCLC can be divided into two major 
histologic types:  adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma ( Travis etal.2011 ).  
Adenocarcinoma histology accounts for more than one-half of all NSCLC, whereas 
squamous cell histology accounts for approximately 25% ( Langer et al.2010 ) of NSCLC.  
The remaining cases of NSCLC are represented by [CONTACT_33435], 
neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and poorly differentiated histology.
The overall 5- year survival rate for advanced disease is 2% 4%, depending on 
geographic location ( Cetin etal.2011 ).  Poor prognostic factors for survival in patients 
with NSCLC include advanced stage of disease, poor performance status, a hist ory of 
smoking, and a history of unintentional weight loss at the time of initial diagnosis .  More 
than one-half of the patients with NSCLC are diagnosed with distant metastases, which 
directly contribute to poor survival outcomes .
1.1.[ADDRESS_32826]-line treatment of NSCLC, specifically in patients with actionable driver mutations 
such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) mutations and gene rearrangements 
in anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) (Tsui etal.2016 ).Targeted treatment of these 
“driver” mutations includes the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) such as erlotinib 
and alectinib, which confer objective response rates (ORRs) upwards of 60% 70% 
(Thomas etal.2015 ).  Although these treatments have bec ome the mainstay of first -line 
treatment in patients with these molecular subsets, the frequency of these mutations 
(approximately 25% ) (Shtivelman etal.2014 ), and thus the proportion of patients 
benefiting from such therapy, remains modest.
For patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC not harboring an activating 
EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement, platinum -based doublet chemotherapy 
remains as a first -line therapy and standard of care for NSCLC. A number of clinical 
trials have attempted to identify the optimal doublet for advanced NSCLC.  In 2002, 
results from a Phase III randomized trial comparing four different platinum -based 
doublets were published (Schiller et al, 2002).  In this study of 1155 patients with 
advanced NSCLC, no differences in overall survival (OS) were observed among those 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
23/Protocol ML39237, Version 5receiving cisplatin/paclitaxel, cisplatin/gemcitabine, cisplatin/docetaxel or 
carboplatin/paclitaxel.  Each doublet produced response rates of nearly 20% and a 
median survival of approximately [ADDRESS_32827] since highlighted the importance 
of tumor histology as an important determinant in treatment decisions.  In a recent 
Phase III non -inferiority trial compa ring cisplatin/gemcitabine versus 
cisplatin/pemetrexed in 1725 previously untreated patients, there was no difference in 
OS between the two arms (Scagliotti et al. 2008).  In preplanned subgroup analysis, 
however, patients with adenocarcinoma histology tre ated with cisplatin/pemetrexed had 
a significant improvement in median OS compared to those treated with 
cisplatin/gemcitabine (12.6 versus 10.9 months).  Conversely, in patients with squamous 
cell histology, cisplatin/gemcitabine produced superior surviva l compared to 
cisplatin/pemetrexed (median OS 10.8 versus 9.4 months).  Thus, pemetrexed is now 
approved as part of first -line treatment in advanced, non -squamous NSCLC. 
In a separate study ,the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel result ed in 
an increase in response rate from 15% to 35% and an increase in median OSfrom 10 to 
12 months ( Sandler et al. 2006 ).
Given the limited survival benefit conferred by [CONTACT_33436], thesubstantial 
toxicities associated with therapy (such as febrile neutropenia, myelosuppression, 
nausea, alopecia, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and thegenerally poorly tolerated 
regimens by[CONTACT_33437] -performance -status patients, novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33380] f or NSCLC.
1.1.2 Cancer I mmunotherapy :  Programmed Death-Ligand 
1/Programmed Death-1 Inhibitors and Biomarker Selection
Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which target the programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 
programmed death 1 (PD -1) axis, have emerged as a new standard of care for lung 
cancer and other solid tumors.  Such immunotherapy agents harness the patient’s own T 
cells to kill tumor cells and have resulted in encouraging results from Phase II/III clinical 
studies for recurrent 2L+ NSCLC.  However, only a proportion of patients, roughly 
20%30%, have durable long -term benefit (Barlesi et al.2016; Borghaei etal.2015 ; 
Brahmer etal.2015 ; Vansteenkiste et al. 2015 ; Herbst et al. 2016 ).  Additionally, 
subgroup analyses across these trials suggest that patients with activating EGFR 
mutations do not have improved outcomes on immunotherapy compared with treatment 
on standard chemotherapy, suggesting that these patients should receive appropriate 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33381].  It re mains unknown, however, 
if checkpoint inhibitors have less clinical efficacy compared to standard treatments in 1L 
patients who have EGFR activating mutations.
Pembrolizumab, a PD -1 monoclonal antibody, is now approved by [CONTACT_33438] ( FDA) for first -line treatment of NSCLC in patients with PD -L1 expression 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
24/Protocol ML39237, Version 5on 50% of tumor cells.  In the Phase III label enabling trial, PD -L1 expression was 
determined using tissue- based immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Treatment with 
pembrolizumab resulted in an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 (median OS not reached for 
either treatment arm) and progression -free survival (PFS) HR of 0.5 (median PFS 10.3 
vs.6.0 months) in favor of pembrolizumab over platinum -based chemotherapy (Reck et 
al. 2016 ).  These impressive results are changing the current treatment paradigm for 
first-line therapy and have encouraged upfront tissue testing for PD- L1 to identify 
patients with high PD -L1 tumor expression ( 50% PD- L1, approximately 
30% prevalence). These d ata also provide further evidence to support the use of 
atezolizumab in a similarly PD -L1 enriched population as in the current clinical trial. 
A separate first -line Phase III trial of nivolumab, another PD -1 monoclonal antibody, 
failed to show a statisti cally meaningful difference in PFS between nivolumab and 
platinum -based chemotherapy for patients with PD -L1 expression on 5% of tumor 
cells (median PFS 4.2 vs 5.9; HR 1.15; p 0.2511 ; Socinski et al. 2016 ).  Overall 
survival outcomes were equally di sappointing (median OS 14.4 vs 13.2 months; 
HR1.02).  The prevalence of patients with 5% PD -L1 was roughly 75%.  The stark 
contrast in results from the pembrolizumab and nivolumab trials calls into question the 
reliability of using PD -L1 measured by [CONTACT_33439] a predictive biomarker and underscores 
the importance of identifying alternative methods of diagnostic selection for 
immunotherapy .
Emerging data in the field of cancer immunotherapy suggest that mutational load (or 
mutational burden) may be a better diagnostic for the selection of patients for PD -1/PD -
L1 inhibitors.  This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_33440], such as in NSCLC, may have increased immunogenicity and are 
therefore more susceptible to checkpoint inhibition ( Chen etal.2012 ).  In a recent study 
conducted by [CONTACT_33441].(2015 ), investigators reported that nonsynonymous mutation 
burden, as determined by [CONTACT_28760] -exome sequencing of NSCLC patients treated with 
pembrolizumab, was associated with improved outcomes such as ORRs , durable clinical 
benefit, and progression- freesurvival ( PFS).
Additional considerations in the diagnostic selection of patients include whether an 
appropriate quality and quantity of tissue samples can be collected to test for the 
increasing array of oncogenic driver mutations.  Advances in diagnostic technologies are 
enabling newer less -invasive genomic profiling in the blood via detection of circulating 
tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) (Tsui etal.2016 ).  Currently , commercial tests of ctDNA are 
available to guide treatment for targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The next advance in this field will be 
to develop a ctDNA -based diagnostic to guide treatment for immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_33382]. 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
25/Protocol ML39237, Version 51.1.[ADDRESS_32828] -Line Treatment of Non Small Cell 
Lung Cancer
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines describe 
PD-L1 testing by [CONTACT_33442] ( NCCN Guidelines 2016 ).  Additionally, NCCN recommends upfront testing for 
EGFR and ALK to determine appropriate first -line therapy in patient subset s.  Of note, in 
patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the observed incidence of EGFR m utations is 
2.7%. This frequency of EGFR mutations does not justify routine testing of all tumor 
specimens ( NCCN Guidelines 2017 ). Similarly, EGFR and KRAS mutations are 
mutually exclusive, with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_33383] 1% of patients with lung 
cancer ( Riely et al. 2006 ).  Therefore, patients with confirmed KRAS mutations do not 
require further EGFR testing for eligibility for the trial (see Section 4.1.2 ).  See Study 
Rationale and Benefit Risk Assessment section for additional details (Section 1.3).  
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMA B
Atezolizumab ( Tecent riq)is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light 
chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Atezolizuma b 
was engineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a single amino acid substitution at 
position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a non -glycosylated antibody that has 
minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -effector function at expected 
concentrations in humans.  Atezolizumab targets human PD -L1and inhibits its 
interaction with its receptors, PD -1and B7.1 (CD80, B7- 1).  Both of these interactions 
are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is approve d in the [LOCATION_002] for the tr eatment of locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer ( UC), in combination with paclitaxel for adult 
patients with locally advanced metastatic triple negative breast cancer whose tumors 
express PD -L1, in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy for first -line
NSCLC, first -line extensive -stage small cell lung cancer, and metastatic NSCLC that 
has progressed during or following treatment with a platinum -containing regimen .  
Atezolizumab is also being investigated as a potential therapy against solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies in humans.
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.
1.2.1 Summary  of Nonclinical Studies
The nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab program was to demonstrate in vitro and 
invivo activity, to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, to demonstrate an 
acceptable safety profile, and to identify a Phase I starting dose.  Comprehensive 
pharmacology, PK, and toxic ology evaluations were thus undertaken with atezolizumab.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
26/Protocol ML39237, Version 5The safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in 
mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and to aid in 
projecting the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of 
atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for understanding the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics o f atezolizumab. 
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the 
proposed Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicolo gy program were consistent 
with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of downmodulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_32829] 
and supported entry into clinical studies in patients.
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.
1.2.2 Clinical Experience with A tezolizumab
Atezolizumab clinical data are available from multiple Phase I, II, and III studies, both as 
monotherapy and in combination with several anti- cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see the

Study PCD4989g
Study PCD4989g is a Phase Ia dose escalation and expansion study in which 
atezolizumab is being used as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies . It provides significant data 
(with 629safety-evaluable patients across al l cancer types as of the data cutoff date of 
15December 2015 ) for the safety profile of atezolizumab as monotherapy.
Currently, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD), no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs), and no 
clear dose -related trends in the incidence of adver se events have been determined.
The safety profile of atezolizumab as a single agent is observed to be consistent across 
different indications, including small cell lung cancer , NSCLC, UC, renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), melanoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, breast 
cancer, and sarcoma.  
Of the 629patients across all cancer types in Study PCD4989g ,619patients ( 98.4%) 
experienced at least one adverse event, inclu ding 444patients ( 70.6%) who 
experienced one treatment -related adverse event.  Commonly reported events (reported 
in10% of all patients) included fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, 
constipation, dyspnea, pyrexia, and cough (see Table 1).
A total of 89 safety -evaluable patients with NSCLC received atezolizumab in Study 
PCD4989g.  A total of 88 patients (98.9%) experienced at least one adverse event, 
including 67 patients (75.3%) with treatment -related adverse events, 35 (39.3%) patients 
with Grade 3 4 adverse events, 36 patients (40.4%) with serious adverse events , 
5patients (5.6%) who discontinued study drug due to an advers e event, and 1 death 
(1.1%).
The safety profile of the NSCLC cohort was consistent with the overall safety profile of 
all safety- evaluable patients in Study PCD4989g, as well as with the safety -evaluable 
patients with NSCLC who received atezolizumab monoth erapy in other studies.

version 1.1 based responses, h ave been observed in patients with different tumor types 
(including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, gastric cancer, UC, colorectal cancer, head and 
neck cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma) treated with atezolizumab in Study 
PCD4989g.
Refer to the Atezolizumab Invest igator’s Brochure for details on clinical activity in all 
patients treated to date, regardless of tumor type.
Single- agent data from Studies PCD4989g and GO28754 (BIRCH) and data from the 
randomized Study GO28753 (POPLAR) in patients with advanced NSCLC ar e 
summarized below.
Single -Agent Clinical A ctivity in Patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study PCD4989g
As of the [ADDRESS_32833] dose of atezolizumab by 21 October 2013 were evaluable for 
efficacy.  The median age was 60.5 years; the group represented a heavily pretreated 
patient population.  RECIST responses (confirmed) were observed in 20 of 88 (22.7%) 
patients, inclusive of squamous and non -squamous histologies and across all treatment 
cohorts (treatment dose levels:  1 20mg/kg).  A total of [ADDRESS_32834] continued to respond at the time of the clinical data cutoff.
Single -Agent Clinical A ctivity in Patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study  GO28753 (POPLA R)
In Study GO28753 (POPLAR), demographic characteristics were comparable between 
the atezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  
The median age was 62 years in both treatment arms, and the majorit y of patients had 
one prior therapy (65% for atezolizumab and 67% for docetaxel), non -squamous 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
31/Protocol ML39237, Version 5histology (66% for atezolizumab and 66% for docetaxel), and an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 (68% for atezolizumab and 68% for 
docetaxel).  More female patient s were enrolled in the docetaxel arm (35% vs.47%).
At the time of primary analysis on 8 May 2015, there were 287 efficacy -evaluable 
patients (ITT pop ulation), 143 in the docetaxel arm and 144 in the atezolizumab arm.  
Median OS was 12.6 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.7 months for docetaxel 
(hazard ratio [ HR]0.73; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.99).  Increasing improvement in OS was 
associated with increasing PD -L1 expression.  Survival was similar to docetaxel in 
patients lacking PD -L1 expression and improved with atezolizumab in both responders 
and non- responders.  PFS and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the 
ITT population ( Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ).
Single -Agent Clinical A ctivity in Patients with NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study GO28754 (BIRCH)
In the BIRCH study, 659 PD-L1selected patients with advanced NSCLC were treated 
with atezolizumab; 139 patients were naive to prior chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and 
520patients had received at least one prior platinum -based chemotherapy regimen 
(Cohorts 2 and 3).  ORR was 19% in Cohort 1 and 17% in the other two cohorts.  The 
majority of responses were ongoing and duration of response and OS were not yet 
reached ( Besse et al. 2015 ). 
Single -Agent Clinical A ctivity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study  GO28915 (OA K)
In the OAK study, demographic characteristics were comparable between the 
atezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the ITT population.  The majority of 
patients had one prior ther apy (75% in both arms), non- squamous histology (74% in 
both arms), history of tobacco use (80% for atezolizumab and 83% for docetaxel), and 
ECOG Performance Status of 1 (64% for atezolizumab and 62% for docetaxel).  
At the primary analysis, there were 850 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT population):  425 
in the docetaxel arm and 425 in the atezolizumab arm. Median OS in the ITT 
population was 13.8 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.6 months 
fordocetaxel (HR of 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.87, p 0.0003).  OS benefit was seen 
regardless of PD -L1 expression (HR of 0.75 in 1% PD -L1 expression population; 0.41 
in 50% tumor cell or 10% immune cell expression population) and was consistent 
across subgroups, including histology (HR of 0.73 for bo th), in patients with 
asymptomatic central nervous system metastases (HR of 0.54) and never smokers (HR 
of 0.71). PFS and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the ITT 
population ( Rittmeyer et al. 2017 ).
1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Immunoge nicity
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0. 0320mg/kg), atezolizumab appeared 
to show linear pharmacokinetics at doses 1 mg/kg.  For the 1 -mg/kg and 20- mg/kg 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
32/Protocol ML39237, Version 5dose groups, the mean apparent clearance and the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state had a range of 3. 204.44 mL/kg and 48.1 65.7mL/kg, respectively, which 
is consistent with the expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.
Development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in all 
cohorts in Study PCD4989g and was associated with changes in PK (namely, a 
reduction of atezolizumab C minto below the PK assay lower limit of quantification), in 
some p atients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  The development of 
detectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 
to 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10 -, 15-, and 20 -mg/kg dose levels have maintained 
the e xpected target trough levels of drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_33384].  To date, no 
clear relationship between the detection of ATAs and adverse events, infusion reactions, 
or efficacy has been observed.
1.2.4 Rationale for A tezolizumab Dosage
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 
15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available clinical 
data from Study PCD4989g as described below.
The target exposure for atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue 
distribution data in tumor -bearing mice, target -receptor occupancy in the tumor, the 
observed atezolizumab interim pharmacokinetics in humans, and other factors.  The 
target trough concentration (C trough) was projected to be 6 mg/mL on t he basis of several 
assumptions, including the following: 1) 95% tumor receptor saturation is needed for 
efficacy ,and 2) the tumor interstitial concentration to-plasma ratio is 0.30 based on 
tissue distribution data in tumor -bearing mice.
The atezolizuma b dose is also informed by [CONTACT_33444], safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity data.  Anti- tumor activity has been observed 
across doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.  The MTD of atezolizumab was not reached, 
and no DLTs have been observe d at any dose in Study PCD4989g.  Currently available 
PK and anti-therapeutic antibody ( ATA)data suggest that the 15- mg/kg atezolizumab 
q21d regimen (or fixed -dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be 
sufficient to both maintain a Ctrough6 g/mL and further safeguard against both 
interpatient variability and the potential effect of ATAs that could lead to subtherapeutic 
levels of atezolizumab relative to the 10 -mg/kg atezolizumab q21d regimen (or fixed -
dose equivalent).  From inspection of available observed C troughdata, moving further to 
the 20 -mg/kg atezolizumab q21d regimen does not appear to be warranted to maintain 
targeted C troughlevels relative to the proposed 15 -mg/kg atezoliz umab q21d level.
Simulations ( Bai et al. 2012 ) do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in 
exposure following a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight.  Therefore, a fixed dose 
of 1200 mg has been selected (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
33/Protocol ML39237, Version 515mg/kg).  Selection of a q21d dosing interval is supported by [CONTACT_33445].
See the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding nonclinical and 
clinical pharmacology of atezolizumab.
1.3 STUDY RATIONA LE A ND BENEFI TRISK A SSESSMENT
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33385] T cell responses against cancer can 
result in a significant survival benefit in patients with Stage IV cancer ( Hodi etal.2010 ; 
Kantoff etal.2010 ; Chen etal.2012 ).
Clinical studies in NSCLC to date have focused on biomarker enrichment strategies 
through selection of patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1.  In our Phase II 
POPLAR study of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in the refractory 2L/3L setting ,PD-L1 
expression on both tumor cells and immune cells was found to be an independent 
predictor of improved survival (Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ).  However, response rates 
were also noted in patients not expressing PD -L1(8%inpatients with no PD -L1 
expression ), bringing to light the question of whether PD -L1 is the optimal predictive 
biomarker for agents such as atezolizumab . 
Continued r esearch is underway to further characterize the molecu lar and genomic 
determinants of response for patients treated with immunotherapy. Lawrence et al. 
(2013 ) suggest that tumors such as lung cancer have a higher rate of somatic mutations
and that mutations provide the potential for neoantigens that can be r ecognized as 
foreign by T cells . This hypothesis will be tested in this study by [CONTACT_33446]IVBNSCLC (based onthe International Association for the Study of Lung 
Cancer [IASLC ]Lung Cancer Staging Project proposed for the eighth edition of the 
Amer ican Joint Committee on Cancer [ AJCC ]NSCLC s taging syste m [Goldstraw et al. 
2015 ]; seeAppendix 3)with atezolizumab monotherapy and testing blood samples 
collected at baseline and at progression to determine relative changes in tumor 
mutational burden in blood (bTMB) as a predictive biomarker for efficacy .
Because the response rate of single -agent atezolizu mab in first -line treatment is 
unknown, we plan an interim futility analysis when 50% of enrolled patients have had at 
least 6 months of follow -up.  A t this interim analysis, the study will be stopped if ORR is 
likely to be 5% or less compared with an ORR of 15% or more .  This reference endpoint 
is derived from preliminary evidence with nivolumab as first -line monotherapy in NSCLC 
in which ORR ranged from 15 % to 26% depending on histology ( Gettinger et al . 2015 ).  
Additionally, historical response rates for standard -of-care platinum -doublet 
chemotherapy are roughly 15 % to 20% ( Schiller et al. 2002 ).
Study ML39237 will enroll patients who are naive to immunotherapy and for whom 
atezolizumab can represent a reasonable benefit risk option.  Patients whose tumors 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
34/Protocol ML39237, Version 5are known to harbor sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements should be 
treated with appropriate targeted agents such as an EGFR tyrosine kinase or ALK 
inhibitor, respectively (see specific exclusion criteria in Section 4.1.2 ), and should not be 
enrolled in the study.   Patients are eligible for study regardless of PD -L1 status, even if 
the status is u nknown (see specific inclusion criteria in Section 4.1.1 ).
In order to account for the possibility of pseudoprogression/tumor -immune infiltration 
(i.e., aradiographic increase in tumor volume caused by [CONTACT_33447]) 
(Hales etal.2010 ) and the potential for delayed anti -tumor activity, this study will allow 
patients treated with atezolizumab to receive treatment beyond the initial apparent 
radiographic progression (see Section 3.3.3 ) to evaluate clinical benefit.  A lthoug h the 
risk of pseudoprogression in NSCLC is deemed to be relatively low compared with 
melanoma (Chiou and Burotto 2015 ),it is not yet possible to reliably differentiate 
pseudoprogression/tumor -immune infiltration from true tumor progression by [CONTACT_33448] .  Therefore, the risk does exist that some patients 
who are not responding to treatment but arecontinuing to receive atezolizumab may 
experience further progression of NSCLC and may have a delay in treatment with 
subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33386].  Investigators should make every effort 
to fully inform patients of this risk.  Investigators should make a careful assessment of 
the potential benefit of continuing treatment with atezolizum ab, taking into consideration 
radiographic data and the clinical status of the patient.  If, after an integrated 
assessment of radiographic data and clinical status, the decision is made to continue 
treatment with atezolizumab following apparent radiograph ic progression, patients for 
whom alternative approved anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33387].
Atezolizumab has been generally well tolerated (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Adverse events 
with potentially immune- mediated causes consistent with an immunotherapeutic agent, 
including r ash, hypothyroidism, hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, and myasthenia gravis, 
have been observed in Study PCD4989g.  To date, these events have been 
manageable with treatment.
In summary, treatment with atezolizumab as first -line therapy offers the potenti al for 
clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC.  Because most atezolizumab -related toxicities 
observed to date have been mild and transient in nature and are different from the 
adverse events observed from chemotherapy, the benefit risk to patients is favo rable for 
atezolizumab, especially when compared with the benefit risk for conventional 
chemotherapy .  Because of the phenomenon of pseudoprogression, patients and 
investigators can elect to continue therapy beyond radiographic progression.   Patients 
should be fully informed of the risk of continuing study drug in spi[INVESTIGATOR_33388], and investigators should make a careful assessment of the 
potential benefit of doing so, taking into consideration radiographic data, biopsy result s
(if available) , and the clinical status of the patient.

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for A tezolizumab Dose and Schedule
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 
15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available clinical 
data from Study PCD4989g as described below.  This is the same dose and schedule 
being evaluated in the Phase II and Phase IIIprogram in NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma ,
and other solid tumors. 
The target exposure for atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue 
distribution data in tumor -bearing mice, target -receptor occupancy in the tumor, the 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
40/Protocol ML39237, Version 5observed atezolizumab interim pharmacokinetics in humans, and other factors.  The 
target C troughwas projected to be 6 g/mL on the basis of several assumptions, including
the following :  1) 95% tumor receptor saturation is needed for efficacy ,and 2) the tumor
interstitial concentration to-plasma ratio is 0.30 based on tissue distribution data in 
tumor -bearing mice.
The atezolizumab dose is also informed by [CONTACT_33444], safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity data.  Anti -tumor activity has been observed a cross doses from 1 mg/kg 
to 20 mg/kg.  The MTD of atezolizumab was not reached, and no DLTs have been 
observed at any dose in Study PCD4989g.  Available preliminary PK data 
(0.03 20mg/kg) from Study PCD4989g suggest that for doses 1mg/kg, overall 
atezo lizumab exhibits pharmacokinetics that are both linear and consistent with typi[INVESTIGATOR_33390]1 antibodies.  Detectable ATAs were observed in patients at all dose levels but were 
associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients in only the lower dose 
cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  It is unclear from currently available data in these lower 
dose cohorts whether the administration of higher doses to patients with both detectable 
ATAs and reduced exposure would necessarily restore exposure to expected lev els.  No 
clear relationship between the development of measurable ATAs and safety or efficacy 
has been observed.  Available data suggest that the development of detectable ATAs 
does not appear to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics for doses from 
10to 20 mg/kg in most patients.  Correspondingly, patients dosed at the 10 -, 15-, and 
20-mg/kg dose levels have maintained target trough levels of drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_33391].  Currently available PK and ATA data suggest that the 15 -mg/kg atez olizumab 
q21d regimen (or fixed -dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be 
sufficient to both maintain a Ctrough6 g/mL and further safeguard against both 
interpatient variability and the potential effect of ATAs that could lead to sub therapeutic 
levels of atezolizumab relative to the 10 -mg/kg atezolizumab q21d regimen (or fixed -
dose equivalent).  From inspection of available observed C troughdata, moving further to 
the 20 -mg/kg atezolizumab q21d regimen does not appear to be warranted to maintain 
targeted C trough levels relative to the proposed 15 -mg/kg atezolizumab q21d level.
Simulations do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in exposure following a 
fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight.  On the basis of this analysis , a fixed dose of 
1200 mg has been selected (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of

approximately 12.5 months ( Sandler etal.2006 ).  Platinum -based doublet 
chemotherapy is still the current standard of care, yet res ponse rates have not improved 
beyond 20% ( Schiller et al . 2002 ). These a pproved chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_33392] —Genentech, Inc.

alopecia) that negatively affect quality of life.  Therefore, there is a continuing ne ed 
formore efficacious, better -tolerated treatments.
Inhibition of PD -L1/PD -1 signaling has been shown to produce durable responses in a 
proportion of patients in several solid tumor types, including NSCLC 
(Topalian etal.2012). However, the majority of first -lineclinical data in NSCLC are from 
biomarker -selected populations , or limited to patients who have been treated in 
refractory second- line disease and beyond. Early data from nivolumab, a PD -[ADDRESS_32839] -line NSCLC with a median OS of 22.6 months (Gettinger et al. 
2015 )and provide a strong rationale for evaluating atezolizumab as a first -line therapy in 
patients with Stage IIIB IVBNSCLC.
3.3.3 Rationale for A llowing Patients to Continue A tezolizumab 
Treatment until Loss of Clinical Benefit
Conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of 
immunotherapeutic agents because PD(by[CONTACT_33450]) does not 
necessarily reflect therapeutic failure (see Section 1.3).  Because of the potential for 
pseudoprogression/tumor immune infiltration, this study will allow patients to continue to 
receiv e study drug after apparent radiographic progression, provided the benefit risk 
ratio is judged to be favorable by [CONTACT_33451] .  
Therapy may continue beyond radiographic PD as determined by [CONTACT_33452].  Loss of clinical benefit is 
defined as unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease 
progression as determined by [CONTACT_33453] .

evidence of radiographic disease progression or loss of clinical benefit in order to better 
understand the changes in bTMB and immune signature [CONTACT_33506]. Blood samples will be collected at 
screening, on Day 1 of Cycles 1,2,and 4(mandatory), and on Day 1 of Cycle 3
(optional) ,to evaluate additional exploratory biomarker changes that may be associated 
with the therapeutic effects of atezolizumab or the pathogenesis of NSCLC (see 
Appendix 2).  Methods for exploratory analysis include, but are not limited to, NGS, 
PCR, and proteomics -based approaches.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
42/Protocol ML39237, Version 53.3.5 Rationale for Collection of A rchiv al and/or Fresh Tumor 
Specimens
In this study , archival and/or fresh tumor specimens from each patient will not be 
mandated but will be strongly encouraged .  Tissue biopsies (tissue blocks preferred) 
may be submitted at any time during the study , with biopsies from diagnosis (archival or 
fresh) and a t progression preferred . For patients who provide tissue samples, NGS may 
be performed by [CONTACT_33430].  If performed by [CONTACT_33430], the 
investigator can obtain results from these analyses in the form of an NGS report, which 
is available upon request directly from Foundation Medicine.  The investigator may share 
and discuss the results with the patient, unless the patient chooses otherwise.  The 
Foundation Medicine NGS assay ,FoundationOne, has not been cleared or approved 
by [CONTACT_21652].  The NGS report is generated for research purposes and is not 
provided for the purpose of guiding future treatment decisions (see Section 4.5.7 ).  
Results may not be available for samples that do not meet testing criteria.
To assess mutational load in tissue (tissue tumor mutational burden [tTMB ]),a 
mutational load algorithm will be applied to NGS data. Analysis will be retrospective .
In addition to the assessment of tTMB, other exploratory markers , such as those with
potential predictive and prognostic value related to the clinical benefit of atezolizumab, 
tumor immunobiology, mechanisms of resistance, or tumor type, may also be analyz ed.  
DNA and/or RNA extraction may be performed to enable NGS and PCR to identify 
somatic mutations to increase understanding of disease pathobiology.
3.3.6 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_33393] -L1/PD -L1 inhibitors in NSCLC, PD -L1 
expression as determined by [CONTACT_33454].  Emerging evidence suggests that 
patients with a high burden of somatic mutations derive significant clinical benefit from 
antiPD-1/PD -L1 therapy; thus, further development of mutation load as a predictive 
biomarker for atezolizumab is warranted.
Blood samples ( mandatory ) will be collected at baseline, during therapy, andat first 
evidence of radiographic disease progression or loss of clinical benefit .  Tissue biopsies 
(tissue blocks preferred) may be submitted at any time during the study , with biopsies 
from diagnosis (archival or fresh) and at progression preferred. DNA and RNA 
extraction to enable analysis via NGS , expression, and/or PCR to identify somatic 
mutations that are predictive of response to study drug can increase the knowledge and 
understanding of disease biology .  NGStechniques such as targeted sequencing may 
offer a unique o pportunity to identify biomarkers of response .  NGS may be performed 
by a clinical cancer genomic profiling laboratory (e.g., Foundation Medicine).
Genomics is increasingly informing researchers ’understanding of disease pathobiology.  
Targeted NGS provides a multiplex characterization of the genome and, along with 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
43/Protocol ML39237, Version 5clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_33394].  Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also 
be explored in agg regate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of 
new targeted agents.
4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 PATIENTS

49/Protocol ML39237, Version 54.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling
Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) will be supplied by [CONTACT_21411] a single- use, 20 -mL 
USP/ European Pharmacopoeia Type 1 glass vial as a colorless to slightly yellow, sterile, 
preservative -free clear liquid solution intended for IV administration.  The vial is designed 
to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) atezolizumab solution but may contain more than the stated 
volume to enable delivery of the entire 20 mL volume.  For information on the 
formulation and handling of atezolizumab, see the Atezolizumab Pharmacy Manual and 
Investigator’s Brochure.
4.3.2 Dosage, A dministration, and Compliance
The dose level of atezolizumab proposed to be tested in this study is 1200 mg 
(equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 15 mg/kg) administered by [CONTACT_33458] 21 (3)days.
Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.
The initial dose of atezolizumab will be delivered via IV infusion over 60 ( 15) minutes.  
If the first infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events, the second 
infusion may be delivered over 30 ( 10) minutes.  If the 30 -minute infusion is well 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 ( 10) minutes.  For all 
infusions, vital signs will be assessed per the local standard of care (see Appendix 1).
Dose modifications to atezolizumab are not permitted.  
No premedication will be allowed for the first dose of atezolizumab.  Premedication may 
be administered for Cycles 2at the discretion of the treating physician.  The 
management of infusion -related reactions will be according to severity as follows:
In the event that a patient experiences a mild (NCI CTCAE Grade 1) infusion -related 
event, the infusion rate should be reduced to one-half the rate being given at the 
time of event onset.  Once the event has resolved, the investigator should continue 
to deliver the infusion at the reduced rate for 30 minutes.  If tolerated, the infusion 
rate may then be increased to the original rate.
In the event that a patient experiences a moderate infusion- related event 
(NCI CTCAE Grade 2) or flushing, fever, or throat pain, the patient should have his 
or her infusion immediately interrupted and should receive aggressive symptomatic 
treatment.  The infusion should be restarted only after the symptoms have 
adequately res olved to the baseline grade.  The infusion rate at restart should be 
one-half of the rate that was in progress at the time of the onset of the 
infusion- related event.
For severe or life -threatening infusion -related events (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), 
the infu sion should be stopped immediately, and aggressive resuscitation and 
supportive measures should be initiated.  Patients experiencing severe or 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
50/Protocol ML39237, Version 5life-threatening infusion -related events will not receive further infusion and will be 
further managed as clinically indicated until the event resolves.

4.4 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
drugs , vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional suppl ements) used by 
a patient from 7 days prior to screening until the study completion/discontinuation visit.  
All such medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
Concomitant Medications eCRF .
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Premedication with antihistamines may be administered for any atezolizumab infusions 
after Cycle 1.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
52/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Patients should continue use of maintenance therapy as follows:
Hormonal therapy with gonadotropin -releasing hormone agonists or antagonists for 
prostate cancer
Oral contraceptives
Hormone -replacement therapy
Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low-molecular -weight 
heparin or warfarin at a stable dose level)
Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases) ,provided it does 
not interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion being 
irradiated is not the only site of disease, because that would render the patient not 
evaluable for response by [CONTACT_33461] v1.1) 
–It is not a require ment to withhold atezolizumab during palliative radiotherapy
Inactive vaccinations , but not live, attenuated vaccinations ,are permitted during the 
course of the study (i.e., only inactivated forms of the Influenza vaccinations are 
permitted).  Live,atten uated vaccinations are prohibited (see Section 4.4.3 ).
Megestrol administered as an appetite stimulant 
Inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludroco rtisone) 
Low-dose corticosteroids for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33399].  Patients who experience infusion -associated 
symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, 
diphenhydramine, and/or famotidine or another H2-receptor antagonist per standard 
practice .  Serious infusion- associated events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardi a, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_33400] 
(e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists )see Appendix 5.
All medications must be recorded on the appropriate Concomitant Medications eCRF.
4.4.2 Cautionary  Therapy for A tezolizumab -Treated Patients
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may atte nuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  Therefore, in situations in which 
systemic corticosteroids or TNF -inhibitors would be routinely administered, alternatives, 
including antihistamines, should be considered fir st by [CONTACT_1963].  If the 
alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may be 
administered at the discretion of the treating physician except in the case of patients for 
whom CT scans with contrast are contraindi cated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or 
impaired renal clearance) (see also Section 4.4.1 ).
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
53/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Systemic corticosteroids are recomm ended, with caution at the discretion of the treating 
physician, for the treatment of specific adverse events when associated with 
atezolizumab therapy.  Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated adverse 
events are described in the Investigator’s Br ochure .
The concomitant use of herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33401], safety profiles, and potential drug- drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  Their use for patients on this study is allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator ,however the herbal therapy must have no known interactions with any study 
treatment nor can it be used specifically for the treatment of cancer (see Section 4.4.3 ).
4.4.3 Prohibited Therapy
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health 
authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for various time periods prior to 
starting study drug, depending on the anti -cancer agent (see Section 4.1.2 ), and during 
study drug treatment until disease progression is documented and the patient has 
discontinued study drug.  This includes but is not limited to chemotherapy, hormonal 
therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational agents, or herbal therapy (unless 
otherwise noted).
The following medications are prohibited while in the study, unless otherwise noted:
Traditional herbal medicines intended for the treatment of cancer or those with 
known interactions with the study treatment ,because their use may result in 
unanticipated drug drug interactions that may cause or confound assessment of 
toxicity
Any live, attenuated vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within [ADDRESS_32852] dose of atezolizumab
Use of corticosteroids to premedicate patients for whom CT scans with contrast are 
contraindicated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance); in 
such patients, non- contrast CT scans of the chest and non -contrast CT scans or 
MRIs of the abdomen a nd pelvis should be performed.
4.[ADDRESS_32853] be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment .  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
54/Protocol ML39237, Version 5record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Medical History  and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history, 
and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, vaccines, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or 
homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days 
prior to the screening visit.
Demographic data wi ll include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should be performed at screening and should include 
an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, 
dermatological , musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  
Any abnormality should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited symptom -directed physica l 
examinations should be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded in patient notes.  New orworsened clinically significant abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.[ADDRESS_32854] dose of 
study dru g.  All subsequent vital sign assessments (i.e., during study drug cycles and 
treatment discontinuation visits) will be done per the local standard of care, as outlined in 
the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). Specific requirements for the monitoring of 
vital signs during atezolizumab infusions are provided in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_32855] their study physician if they develop such symptoms.
4.5.5 Tumor and Response Evaluation s
Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and then every 6 weeks (7 days)
thereafter ,regardless of dose delays, for the first 12 months following Cycle 1, Day 1 .  
After 12 months, tumor assessment swill be required every 9 weeks (7 days) until 
disease progression or treatment discontinuation.  Disease status ( complete response 
[CR], partial response [ PR], stable disease, or PD) will be assessed by [CONTACT_33462] v1.1 (see Appendix 4).  
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
55/Protocol ML39237, Version 5The same radiographic procedure used at screening should be used throughout the 
study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans) .  Assessments should be 
performed by [CONTACT_33463], if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.
Results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_33464].  In addition, 
all radiographic images will be sent to an independent review facility to standardize 
results and i nterpretation.  Further details on radiographic methods are described in the 
IRF charter .  
Bone scans (Technetium -99m) or sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (NaF -
PET) may be performed at screening if clinically indicated.  If bone metastases are
present at screening and cannot be seen on CT or MRI scans, Technetium -99m or NaF-
PET bone scans should be repeated at the discretion of the investigator when complete 
response is identified in the target disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
Patients who continue treatment beyond radiographic disease progression assessed per 
RECIST v1.1 should be monitored with a follow -up scan at the next scheduled tumor 
assessment when the scan frequency is every 6 weeks (7 days) .  If the scan frequency 
is every 9 weeks, the follow -up scan is recommended at 6 weeks (7 days) or earlier if 
clinically indicated ,or per local standard of care.
For patients who discontinue study drug for any reason other than radiographic PDper 
RECIST v1.1, tumor assessments should continue at the same frequency as would have 
been followed if the patient had remained on the study drug until radiographic disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit for patients who continued 
treatment after disease progression according to RECIST v1.1), withdrawal of consent, 
death, or study termination by [CONTACT_1034] , whichever occurs first .
At the investigator’s discretion, tumor assessments may be repeated at any time if PDis 
suspected.
4.5.6 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples
[IP_ADDRESS] Samples for Safety  Laboratory  Tests
Samples for the following safetylaboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local 
laboratory for analysis:

4.5.7 Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview  of the Research Biosample Repository
The RBR is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long -term storage of 
human biologic alspecimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, and peptides).  The collection, storage, and analysis of RBR 
specimens w ill facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the 
development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for 
patients in the future.
Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific con sent to 
participa te in this optional research.  RBR specimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression
To increase the knowledge and understanding of dise ase biology
To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition
To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays
[IP_ADDRESS] Approval by [CONTACT_33466]'s Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) 
and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted 
approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol ( Section 4.5.7 ) will not be 
applicable at that site.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Collection
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to atezolizumab or diseases:
Blood samples and/or plasma and/or PMBCs collected at screening ; on Day1 of 
Cycles 1,2, 3 and 4; and at first evidence of radiographic progression or loss of 
clinical benefit
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
59/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Tumor (e.g., primary tumor, metastatic site, or site of local recurrence or 
advancement ,if appropriate )samples collected at diagnosis or later
Leftover blood, serum, plasma, PBMC, and tumor tissue samples
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for DNA extraction to 
enable analysis of germline mu tations orsomatic mutations via whole genome 
sequencing ( WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), NGS,or other genomic analysis 
methods . 
Genomics is increasingly informing researchers’ understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome , 
respectively, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26630].  Data will be analyzed in the context of this 
study, but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.   The 
availability of a larger dataset will assist in the identification of important pathways, 
guiding the development of new targeted agents .
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instruc tions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality
Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification 
number.
Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], 
unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data deriv ed from RBR 
specimens will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless 
required by [CONTACT_2371].  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.
Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_33467], 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.

[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository
Patients who give consent to provide RBR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
specimens from the RBR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw 
consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical
Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject 
Withdrawal Form and, if the study is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the 
RBR Research Sample W ithdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be 
provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the study is closed.  A 
patient's withdrawal from Study ML39237 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of 
specimens from the RBR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RBR does not 
constitute withdrawal from Study ML39237 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and Oversight
RBR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system to ensure com pliance with data confidentiality ,as well as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
Atezolizumab is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic UC.   The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience 
with atezolizumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety 
risks are outlined below (see Section 5.1.1 ).  
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients during the study.  Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a 
monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate 
equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  After initiation of study 
drug, all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_32860].  Guidelines for managing anticipated adverse events, including criteria for 
dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below 
(see Section 5.1.2 ).  Refer to Section 5.2, Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.5, and 
Section 5.6for details on safety reporting during the study.
5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following:  infusion -related 
reactions and immune -related hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes 
mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, 
Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, 
meningoencephalitis , and myocarditis .
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of 
anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab .
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
64/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by [CONTACT_33471].  Given the mechanism of ac tion of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation 
is considered a potential risk when given in combination with other immunomodulating 
agents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for 
patients who, in the absence of a n alternative etiology, develop a sepsis -like syndrome 
after administration of atezolizumab .  
The initial evaluation should include the following:
CBC with peripheral smear
PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D -dimer
Ferritin
Triglycerides
AST, ALT, and total bilirubin
LDH
Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)
If systemic immune activation is still suspected after the initial evaluation, contact [CONTACT_33472].
5.1.2 Management of Patients Who Exp erience Specific A dverse 
Events
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab in this study.  
Study treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity that is
considered to be related to study drug .  If atezolizumab is withhel d for 105days, the 
patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab.  If the investigator believes the patient is 
likely to derive clinical benefit and the Medical Monitor is in agreement, atezolizumab 
treatment can be resumed after being withheld for 105days.  If a patient must be 
tapered off corticosteroids used to treat adverse events, study drug may be withheld for 
105days.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine the acceptable 
length of treatment interruption.
Dose interruptions fo r reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) may be 
allowed with Medical Monitor approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will 
determine the acceptable length of treatment interruption.
Guidelines for management of patients who expe rience specific adverse events 
associated with atezolizumab are provided in the A tezolizumab Investigator's Brochure
and in Appendix 8.  
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
65/Protocol ML39237, Version 55.[ADDRESS_32861], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Recurrence of an intermittent medical co ndition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study drug or concomitant 
therapy or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study drug (e.g., screening invasive procedures 
such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A seri ous adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immed iate risk of death)
–This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
66/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a sig nificant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to the NCI 
CTCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently asse ssed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_32862] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of speci al interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this 
study include the following:
Any of the following confirmed treatment -emergent autoimmune conditions:
–Pneumonitis
–Colitis
–Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, or adrenal insufficiency or 
hyperthyroidism
–Hepatitis

combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below: 
– Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term 
applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section  5.4, Section 5.5, and 
Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3), and causality (see Section  5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_32863].  All adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section  5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). 
After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_32864].  
For patients participating in the optional long term follow-up (as outlined in Section 4.5.9 ) who continue to receive atezolizumab, all AE’s will be reported until [ADDRESS_32865] dose of atezolizumab. 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.

investigator if they become pregnant during the optional long -term follow -up period or 
within [ADDRESS_32866] dose of atezolizumab.   
Pregnancies are to be reported to the Sponsor, as applicable, according to the same 
guidelines as outlined in S ection [IP_ADDRESS].
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last 
here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for NCI CTCAE v 4.0 will be used for assessing 
adverse event severity.  Table 5 will be used for assessing severity for adverse events 
that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"or "no"
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also
Table 6 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications kno wn to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event

Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the stud y drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose o f study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_32868] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., 
"infusion- related reaction" or"anaphylactic reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If 
possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and 
symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  If a 
patient experiences both a local a nd systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, 
each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs 
and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptom s
For adverse events ,a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previou sly 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
71/Protocol ML39237, Version 5reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events .  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
report ed separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, bet ween 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event become s 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Secti on5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient eva luation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
72/Protocol ML39237, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of 
the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study drug (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, 
or treatment dis continuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
–Note:  For oncology studies , certain abnormal values may not qual ify as 
adverse events.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a cl inically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinica lly significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above o r below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevat ed potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassiu m level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the 
following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study drug (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
73/Protocol ML39237, Version 5It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury
(as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s law) .  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin)
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol -
specified adverse event repor ting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by [CONTACT_33474]/Study Discontinuation eCRF.  All other on -study deaths, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
74/Protocol ML39237, Version 5used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening o fNSCLC
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v1.1 criteria.  In rare cases, the determination of 
clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort 
should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is 
any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be 
reported as an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26663] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678]
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for study drug administration 
or to perform an efficacy measurement for the study)
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
–The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33403]
–The patient has not experienced an adverse event
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33404] —Genentech, Inc.
75/Protocol ML39237, Version 5An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33405] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682]
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose be ing studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug is not itself an 
adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with 
an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the A dverse 
Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria , the event 
should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
No safety data related to overdosing of atezolizumab are available.
5.[ADDRESS_32869] report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than [ADDRESS_32870] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

[IP_ADDRESS] Events That Occur prior to Study  Drug Initiation
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interes t Reporting Form provided 
to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_33475] e- mailing the form by [CONTACT_33476] e -mail address provided 
to investigators.
[IP_ADDRESS] Events That Occur after Study  Drug Initiation
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until [ADDRESS_32873] all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 
24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report 
via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A report will be g enerated and sent to 
Safety Risk Management by [CONTACT_27950].
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_33477] e -mailing the form by 
[CONTACT_33476] e -mail address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system 
is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.  

Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
77/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur [ADDRESS_32874] dose 
of study drug are provided in Section 5.6.
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_32875] 
dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be complete d and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_33477] e -mailing the form by 
[CONTACT_33476] e -mail address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study 
drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible 
effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclu sion of the 
pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in 
the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In 
addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when 
updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects and A bortions
Any congenital anomaly/birt h defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  Any abortion should be reported in the same 
fashion ( because the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significa nt).
5.4.4 Reporting Requirements for Cases of A tezolizumab A ccidental 
Overdose or Medication Error
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental ad ministration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to 
administration of the drug.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
78/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  All special situations associated with atezolizumab, regardless of whether they 
result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported 
to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event).  
Special situations should be recorded as described below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "M edication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, exp ired drug 
administered) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the additional case details.
Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, 
the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours 
after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  Adverse events associated with special 
situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overd ose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidenta l overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the 
completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose 
and one to report the headache.  The "Accidenta l overdose" and "Medication error" 
boxes would need to be checked on both eCRF pages.

follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related 
proce dures until a final outcome can be reported.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
79/Protocol ML39237, Version 5During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.
All pregnancies repor ted during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.
5.5.[ADDRESS_32877], and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitor ing visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from

an independent medical assessment of the reported case.
5.[ADDRESS_32878] that occurs after the end of the ad verse event 
reporting period (defined as [ADDRESS_32879] ), if the 
event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment .  All such events should be 
reported until the end of study (defined as the date after which all enrolled patients who 
remain alive have been followed for at least 18 months from the start of study drug .)
The investigator should report these events directly to [COMPANY_002] or its designee, either by 
[CONTACT_33477] e -mailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Form with use of the fax number or e -mail address provided 
to investigators.

communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determi ne reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events with the use of the following reference 
document:
Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
80/Protocol ML39237, Version 5The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event an d the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance f or upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN
There will be approximately [ADDRESS_32881] baseline 
biomarker assessment.  The primary efficacy analysis measured by [CONTACT_33478] 6 months of 
follow- up(i.e., 6 months after the final patient ha sbeen enrolled).   The final 
analysis will be performed at the end of the study, [ADDRESS_32882] been 
enrolled . The overall survival analysis will be updated once the long -term follow -up 
data is available, and will be summarized in a separate report. Safety reporting for 
patients who remain on study drug will also be included .
In addition, OS data collected through the external deat h registry data after study 
completion during the optional long -term follow -up will be updated periodically (e.g .,
every 12 years) based on data availability.
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The sample size for this study is based on the primary efficacy objective and primary 
biomarker objective.
Based on 150 patients, the maximum half width of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the estimated 
ORR will be within 8%.
Additionally , based on 120 biomarker -evaluable patients (80% of the study population) , 
with a minimum follow -up of6 months during the primary an alysis , and with 28 patients 
in the smaller biomarker positive or negative group (19% of the study population), the 
study primary biomarker analysis will have 89% and 79% power to detect PFS difference 
if the HRs of PFS between the biomarker positive vs. n egative group is 0.[ADDRESS_32883] OF STUDY
The number of patients who enroll in, discontinue, or complete the study will be 
summarized.  Reasons for premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized.  
Enrollment and major protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential 
effects on the interpretation of study results.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
81/Protocol ML39237, Version 56.3 SUMMA RIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BA SELINE 
CHA RACTERISTICS
Demographic and baseline characteristics ( e.g., age, sex ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_33479], SDs, medians, and ranges for continuous variables ,and proportions for 
categorical variables, as appropriate.  
6.[ADDRESS_32884] -baseline response assess ment, will be considered non -
responders. An estimate of the ORR from all patients who received study drug and the 
95% CI will be calculated by [CONTACT_33434]. 
6.4.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary efficacy endpoints include OSand investigator (INV)-assessed duration 
of response ( DOR) and PFS per RECIST v1.1.
DOR will be analyzed for the subset of patients who achieved an objective response .  
DOR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of documented CR or PR until 
documented disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_093] ,or death, whichever 
occurs first .  Median and range will be presented for a descriptive summary.
PFS is defin ed as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of disease 
progression or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurs first .  Patients 
who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be 
censored a t the time of the last tumor assessment .  Patients with no post -baseline tumor 
assessment will be censored at the time of first dose. 
OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of death from any 
cause during the study .  Patients who are still alive at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the time of their last study assessment (for active patients) or at the last 
date known alive (for patients in follow -up). 
PFS and OS of patients in this study will be summarized graphical ly and with descriptive 
statistics such as median and landmark PFS by [CONTACT_33480] -Meier (K-M) 
methodology .  The Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 95% 
CI for the median PFS and OS ( Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ).  K-M methods w ill also 
be used to estimate landmark PFS, along with the corresponding 95% CI , by[CONTACT_33481]’s formula.

7. DATA COLLECTION A ND M ANAG EMENT
7.[ADDRESS_32889] research 
organization (CRO) will be responsible for data management of this study, including 
quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through 
the use of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the ED C system.  In the 
event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the 
sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system.
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
84/Protocol ML39237, Version 5The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data.  Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the CRO with the 
use of the CRO’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of 
these data.
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, inclu ding 
approval of the CRO’s data management plans and specifications.  Data will be 
periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s 
standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of thes e 
data.  
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures. 
7.[ADDRESS_32890] disc is required.
7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source d ata verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_26831], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
85/Protocol ML39237, Version 5entered direct ly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow 
inspe ction by [CONTACT_25756].
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_33508], and date of the change.
7.[ADDRESS_32891] to local regulations.  
No records may be dispo sed of without the written approval of the Sponsor .  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.

explanatory text as needed for clarity.2
MEA SURA BILITY OF TUM OR AT BASELINE
DEFINITIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
nonmeasurable as follows:
Measurable Tumor Lesions
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5mm)
10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable)
[ADDRESS_32908] be [ADDRESS_32909] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on “Baseline 
Documentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions” for information on lymph node 
measurement.
Nonmeasurable Tumor Lesions
Nonmeasurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (lon gest diameter 10 mm 
orpathological lymph nodes with 10 to 15 mm short axis), as well as truly 
nonmeasurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breas t 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_33486].

104/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measur ability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.
Bone lesions:
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging tech niques to measure bone lesions.  However, these 
techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
When a bone scan is the sole indicator of progression, progression in bone will be 
defined as when at least two or more new le sions are seen on bone scan compared 
with screening.  In situations where the scan findings are suggestive of a flare 
reaction, or apparent new lesion(s) which may represent trauma, these results must 
be confirmed with other imaging modalities such as MRI or fine -cut CT to constitute 
progression.  Only a single new bone lesion on bone scan is required for 
progression if the lesion can be correlated on CT, MRI or plain film.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.
Cystic lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic meta stases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.

105/Protocol ML39237, Version 5TARGET LESIONS:  SPE CIFICA TIONS BY [CONTACT_33487], with use of calipers if clinically 
assessed.  Al l baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characteri ze each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and 10 mm in diameter a s assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  
Forthe case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested.
Chest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when p rogression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
CT, MRI.   CT is t he best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_32910] scans 
withintravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to 
whether a noncontrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the 
patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by [CONTACT_33488].  For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to 
whether noncontrast CT or MRI (enhanced or nonenhanced) will be performed should 
also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease and should be 
optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be 
discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point 
forward.   Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality

106/Protocol ML39237, Version 5and interpretation of nontarget disease or new lesions since the same lesion may appear 
to have a different size with use of a new modality.
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in the assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.
Endoscopy , Laparoscopy , Tumor Markers, Cy tology , Histology .  The utilization of 
these techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.
TUMOR RESPONSE EVA LUATION
ASSESSMENT OF OVERA LL TUMOR BURDEN A ND M EASURA BLE 
DISEA SE
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_33489], as d etailed above.
BASELINE DOCUMENTA TION OF TA RGET A ND NON TARGET LESIONS
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved org ans should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means in instances where patients have only one or two 
organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), 
respectively, wil l be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be 
recorded as nonmeasurable lesions (even if the size is 10mm by [CONTACT_3610]).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but additionally, should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements .  It may be the case that, 
onoccasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, 
inwhich circumstance the nex t largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by [CONTACT_33490].  As noted above, pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of [ADDRESS_32911] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan, this 
Appendix 4
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): 
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
107/Protocol ML39237, Version 5is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial , sagittal, 
or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded 
as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm 
but 15mm) should be considered nontarget lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis 
10mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Asum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added 
into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
identified as nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare 
cases “unequivocal progression.”
In addition, it is possible t o record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as 
a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
RESPONSE CRITERIA
Evaluation of Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.
Complete response (CR) :  disappearance of all target lesions
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in 
short axis to 10mm.
Partial response (PR) :  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Progressive disease (PD) :  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
anabsolute increase of at least 5 mm.
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.

Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
108/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Stable disease (SD) :  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study
Special Notes on the A ssessment of Target Lesions
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to 10 mm on study.  This means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero 
even if CR criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis 
10 mm.
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   While on study, all lesions 
(nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on the CT scan that the radiologist may not feel c omfortable assigning 
an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this 
occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows:
If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
themeasurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and below measurable limit (BML) should 
be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rulewill be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by 
[CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should 
beassigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked.) 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_32912] diameter for the coalesced lesion.

109/Protocol ML39237, Version 5Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of nontarget lesions.  While some nontarget lesions may actually be
measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.
CR:  disappearance of all nontarget lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor 
marker level)
All lymph nodes mus t be non -pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non- PD:  persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or (if applicable) 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
PD:  unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
Special Notes on A ssessment of Progression of Nontarget Disease
When the Patient A lso Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting, to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsening in nontarget disease in a magnitude that, even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall t umor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or 
more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status.  The designation of overall progression sol ely on the basis of change in nontarget 
disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
When the Patient Has Only Nonmeasurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in 
some Phase III trials when it is not a criterion of st udy entry to have measurable disease.  
The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance, there 
is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
nonmeasurable disease burden.  Because wors ening in nontarget disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all lesions are truly nonmeasurable), a useful test that 
can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if 
theincrease in overall disease burden based on the change in nonmeasurable disease 
is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for 
measurable disease, that is, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” 
to“large” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may 
bedescribed in protocols as “sufficient to requi re a change in therapy.”  If unequivocal 
progression is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that 
Appendix 4
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): 
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
110/Protocol ML39237, Version 5point.  W hile it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to nonmeasurable 
disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the 
increase must be substantial.
When the patient has bone lesions at baseline.   When a bone scan is the sole 
indicator of progression, progression in bone will be defined as when at least two or 
more new lesions are s een on bone scan compared with screening.  In situations where 
the scan findings are suggestive of a flare reaction, or apparent new lesion(s) which may 
represent trauma, these results must be confirmed with other imaging modalities such as 
MRI or fine -cutCT to constitute progression.  Only a single new bone lesion on bone 
scan is required for progression if the lesion can be correlated on CT, MRI or plain film.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, som e
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning techn ique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is co nsidered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.
New osteoblastic bone lesions identified on plain films, CT, or MRI will not be considered 
progression in an otherwise stable or responding subject, if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33413], the osteoblastic lesion appears to be healing or a response to therapy.

a“Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for nontarget disease since stable 
disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy  in some trials; 
thus, assigning “stable disease” when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
Missing A ssessments and Not -Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion m easurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) 
would not change the assigned timepoint response.   This would be most likely to happen 
Appendix 4
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): 
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
112/Protocol ML39237, Version 5in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_32914] achieved PDstatus, regardless of the contribution 
of the missing lesion. 
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done 
or the scan could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the 
response for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more nontarget lesions are not assessed, the response for 
nontarget lesions should be “unable to assess” except where there is clear progression.  
Overall response would be “unable to assess” if either the target response or the 
nontarget response is “unable to assess,” except where this is clear evidence of 
progression as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that timepoint.

aIf a CR is truly met at the first timepoint, any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint , 
even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, qualifies as PD at that point 
(since disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether 
the minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes CR may  be claimed when 
subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had 
PR, not CR, at the first timepoint.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR and the best response is PR.
Special Notes on Response Assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size ( 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order no t to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuati on of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective 
Appendix 4
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): 
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
Atezolizumab —Genentech, Inc.
114/Protocol ML39237, Version 5progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deteriora tion is not a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_33491] 1, Table 2 , and Table 3 .
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.
In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e., primary disease still 
or part ially present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or nontarget 
lesion, as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of complete response if 
the primary tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or nontarget lesio n.

Immune -related myocarditis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -related myocarditis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, 
dyspnea, ches t pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  
Immune -related myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from 
infection (commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of GI illness), 
ischem ic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, 
or progression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by [CONTACT_33500], an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.
Patients with sig ns and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 6.

atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics 
(e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in 
treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.
Guidelines for medical management o f IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 7 .  For 
subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.

Event Management
IRR, Grade 1 Reduce infusion rate to half the rate being given at the time of 
event onset.
After the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30 
minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.
If the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for [ADDRESS_32927] resolved, the infusion rate may be increased to 
the original rate.
IRR, Grade 2 Interrupt atezolizumab infusion.
Administer aggressive sy mptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, anti -pyretic medication, glucocorticoids, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, oxygen).
After sy mptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half 
the rate being given at the time of event onset.
For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral 
premedication with antihist amines, anti -pyretics, and/or analgesics 
and monitor closely for IRRs.
IRR, Grade 3 or 4 Stop infusion.
Administer aggressive sy mptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],

IMMUNE -RELA TED MENIN GOENCEPHA LITIS
Immune -related meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the 
administration of atezolizumab.  Immune -related meningoencephalitis should be 
suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or 
encephalitis, including, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor 
or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness.  
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.

135/Protocol ML39237, Version 5All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or 
edema.  If deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], a lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an 
identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 11 .

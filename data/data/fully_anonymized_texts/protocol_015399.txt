5.23. Protocol Deviations and Violations  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol except for an emergency  in which the 
protection, safety, and well- being of the subject requires immediate intervention, based on the 
judgment of the investigator or a responsible, ap propriately trained and credentialed 
professional(s) designated by [CONTACT_093]. In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident or mistake, the investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_258833] /CRO contacts  at the earliest possible time.

 5.25. Reasons for Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
The reasons for withdrawal from this study may include  but are not limited to :  
 
1. The subject withdraws his or her consent for any reason. 
2. In the  opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the IOP is not adequately controlled for a subject’s 
current ocular condition  or the subject’s condition has worsened to the degree that the 
investigator feels it is unsafe for the subject to continue in the study or requir es an 
alternative therapy .  
3. Adverse event  
4. Study treatment is unmasked  by [CONTACT_403032]  
  
5. The subject is lost to follow- up.  The investigator will document efforts to attempt to 
reach the subject (at least twice by [CONTACT_403033] ) before considering 
that subject lost to follow -up.  
6. The subject becomes pregnant during  the study. 
7. Investigator discretion (e.g. non -compliant to study protocol requirements  or subject is 
deceptive with information provided.)  
8. Subject did not meet or no longer meets the entry criteria

subject treatment may be identified by [CONTACT_403034], which is attached to the study medication log; however, every effort should be made to maintain the blind.  The investigator must not scratch off the 

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508152]  retain 
(reserve) samples .  The investigator will maintain  randomly selected block s of study 
medication for each shipment  of study medication received.  As per the Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 21, Section 320.38(e), “Each reserve sample shall be stored under conditions consistent with product labeling and in an area segregated from the area where testing is 
conducted and with access limited to authorized personnel  even after the study has concluded. 
Each reserve sample shall be retained for a period of at least [ADDRESS_508153] 5 years following the date of completion of the bioavailability study in which the sample from which the reserve sample was obtained was 
used.” The investigator will store the retain sample study medication until such time as 
notification is received from Perrigo that the samples are no longer required.  
 
6.6. Storage and Test Article Accountability 
The investigator should ensure that the  study medication is stored under adequate security  
and regularly monitored and recorded  and at temperature  of 4°-30oC (39o-86oF).   
 The investigator will not supply study medication to any person not enrolled in this study, or to 
any physician or scientist except th ose named as sub -investigators.  
 The third party  dispenser and study monitor (CRA) will perform drug  accountability and 
reconciliation tasks. A running inventory of dispensed study  medication will be kept that will 
include kit number,  the date each  bottle  of study medication  was dispensed,  and date returned.  
A study medication accountability form will be provided to the in vestigator to d ocument all 
medication bottles received  and used by [CONTACT_6992].   
 At the conclusion of the study all returned unused, partially used, and empty bottles will be 
inventoried by [CONTACT_12104]/ or third party  dispenser and returned to  Perrigo’s designee for 
destruction.

7. ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The potential adverse reactions of brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 1% are anticipated to 
be like those observed for AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%. In clinical studies of AZOPT (b rinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%, the most frequently reported adverse 
reactions reported in 5 to 10% of patients were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Adverse reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of patients were blepharitis, dermatitis, d ry eye, 
foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis. The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence below 1%: allergic reactions, alopecia, che st pain, conjunctivitis, 
diarrhea, diplopia, dizziness, dry mouth dyspnea, dyspepsia, eye fatigue hypertonia, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, kidney pain, lid margin crusting or sticky sensation, nausea, pharyngitis  and tearing potential adverse reactio ns of brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 
1% are anticipated to be like  those observed for AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic s uspension) 
1%. Adverse reactions related to treatment with AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic 
suspension) 1%,  include blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste blepharitis, 
dermatitis, dry eye, foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis.  
 
7.1. Departure From  the Protocol For Individual S ubjects 
When an emergency occurs requiring a subject departure from the protocol, departure will 
be only for that subject. In such circumstances, the investigator or other physicians in 
attendance will contact [CONTACT_403035] -up with a 
written description as soon as possible. The overseeing IRB should also be notified  in 
accordance with the IRB ’s guidelines.   
 
7.2. Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered 
a me dicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally assoc iated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is an adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
o death 
o life-threatening event (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
o requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908]  
o a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
o congenital anomaly/birth defect  

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508154] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
 
Immediately Reportable Adverse Events (IRAE):  Any serious AE or any AE that necessitates 
discontinuation of study medication, including pregnancy.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event:  An unexpected event  is any adverse drug experience, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current approved product labeling (package insert) for the study medication, the Investigator’s Bro chure, or as described in the 
clinical protocol and consent materials.    
 Intensity of Adverse Events:  
  The maximum intensity of an AE during a day should be recorded on the CRF. If the intensity 
of an AE changes over a number of days, then separate entr ies should be made having 
distinct onset dates for the changes in severity.  
 
Mild  - AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with subject’s daily activities.  
 
Moderate  - AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconven ience or concern to the 
subject and may interfere with daily activities but  are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884].  
 
Severe - AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and traditionally require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment.  
 Causal Relationship to  Study Medication   
 The following criteria should be used in assessing the apparent causal relationship of an AE to study medication.   
Definitely - The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication 
administration  abates upon discontinuation of the study medi cation (dechallenge)  
is confirmed by [CONTACT_258840]  - The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication 
administration  abates upon discontinuation of the study medication (dechallenge) 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s state.  
 
Possible  - The AE  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication 
administration  but that could readily be produced by a number of other factors.  

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508155]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_403036].  
 
Not related - The AE does not have a reasonable temporal association with the 
administration of study medication has some other obvious explanation for the event.  
 
7.3. Eliciting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events.  
 
 
All adverse events (as defined in Section 7.2 ), either 
obse rved by [CONTACT_403037]/her medical collaborators, or reported by [CONTACT_403038], or in response to direct questioning, will be reported and documented in the source document and the study reporting forms. When reporting an 
adverse event, the investigator must assign a severity grade to each event and declare an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_403019]. Serious or 
unexpected adverse events must be reported  within [ADDRESS_508156] assessment visit (or the early termination v isit) must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted.  
 Adverse event reporting begins from the signing of informed consent. Adverse events should 
be followed until resolved or [ADDRESS_508157] be followed by [CONTACT_403039] (stabilized for at least 30 days). All events that are ongoing at this time 
will be recorded as ongoing on the eCRF.  
 
7.4. Expedited Reporting Responsibilities of the Study Center  
For any serious or unexpected adverse event,  must be notified within [ADDRESS_508158] report for submission to Perrigo. The 
adverse event term on the AE eCRF and the SAE report should agree exactly. Special attention 
should be given to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_258814].    Subjects with unresolved adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s) should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], events determined to be chronic, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, 
or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse 

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508159] 
learns of the occurrence of the event.    When reporting an SAE , the investigator (or designated study staff) will promptly report any 
serious adverse event or pregnancy by [CONTACT_403040]. An SAE 
form should be completed and sent by [CONTACT_6791], email, or overnight courier  within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_779]. In many cases, only preliminary information will 
be available. Appropriate follow -up information should be sought (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123444], operative reports, etc.) and a follow -up SAE report form submitted. A designation 
of cau sality from the study medication should always be included with a follow- up report. 
Assess and report the causality of the event.  
 
7.5. Submitting an Expedited Safety Report to the IRB  
 supporting documentation for the reported event, the Medical 
Monitor, in conj
unction with Perrigo, will determine if the safety report is eligible for expedited 
review.  the initial event and will notify the sponsor that an event has been 
reported within 1 business day after initial receipt.   the review of the 
event. This form, as well as other supporting documentation, will be forwarded  
 for review.  finalize the report and distribute it to the sponsor 
within 1 day (one) after initial  receipt. When expedited safety reporting to regulatory 
authorities is indeed required, the investigator should review and update any newly available materials at once. Follow -up queries may be sent to the study center to further clarify the 
event.  
 Each e xpedited safety report will routinely include a brief cover memorandum, the completed 
report, and any additional pertinent information recommended by [CONTACT_258833], or the study Medical Monitor. Once the report is assembled, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403020]. Follow- up 
reports should be submitted when requested or when pertinent information becomes 
available.  
 
When a Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403021], it must be promptly submitted to the study center’s IRB. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119072] a copy of such reports as submitted to his/her IRB  in the site’s study Regulatory Binder.

 7.6. SAE & AEs Requiring Discontinuation of Study Drug, including Pregnancies  
ANY SAE THAT OCCURS AFTER A SUBJECT HAS ENTERED THE STUDY, WHETHER OR NOT 
RELATED TO STUDY MEDICATION, MUST BE REPORTED  IMMEDIATELY (WITHIN 24 HOURS) VIA TELEPHONE OR FACSIMILE. IF INITIALLY REPORTED VIA TELEPHONE, THIS MUST BE FOLLOWED -UP BY A FACSIMILE OF THE WRITTEN SAE REPORT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE 
CALL  
 Non -serious events that require discontinuation of study medication (including laboratory 
abnormalities) should be reported  immediately and within [ADDRESS_508160] who experiences a severe adverse event related to study drug will be discontinued from t he study.  
 
The notification about any serious adverse event should be directed to :

7.7. Pregnancy  
At the time some Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403022] a study 
participant became pregnant following study participation, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403023] t he pregnancy immediately by [CONTACT_17084]/or by [CONTACT_29658] a completed 
Pregnancy Report to CRO within one working day  of being notified of the pregnancy report.  
 The report  will include the following elements:  
• Participant (mother’s) coded study identifier;  
• Date of participant’s last menstrual period;  
• Total accumulated dose of study treatment administered to date;  
• Date of study medication administration.  
 The investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than [ADDRESS_508161] a 
follow -up Pregnancy Report with any relevant information on the present condition of the fetus 
 including:  
• Mother’s coded study identifier(s);  
• Gestational age at delivery, miscarriage or abortion;  
• Birth weight, gender, length and head circumference, if available;  
• Apgar scores recorded after birth, if available;  
• Any abnormalities.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE  (e.g., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE report form to CRO within one 
working day of being notified of the pregnancy repor t. 
 If the study  is completed before the outcome of the pregnancy is known, CRO will assume the 
responsibility for following up on the pregnancy.   CRO will contact [CONTACT_403041] -up on the 
outcome of pregnancy and will also check on the status of the infant [ADDRESS_508162] -delivery.  
Upon awareness of the pregnancy outcome  and known status of the infant following 8 weeks  
  

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508163] assessment visit (or the early termination visit) 
must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted. These adverse events must be followed by [CONTACT_1374], events determined to be chroni c 
or the subject is lost to follow -up. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline 
state of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last assessment visit (or the early termination visit) must be recorded on the AE eCRF page and reported to Perrigo according to the procedures outlined above. Subjects with unresolved previously reported serious adverse events, o r any new serious adverse events identified on the last assessment visit, should be 
followed by [CONTACT_1374], or the subject is lost to follow- up. 
Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health o r the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse event. The investigator should continue to report any significant follow- up information to Perrigo up to the point that 
the event has resolved. Any serious adverse event reported by [CONTACT_403042], should be reported to Perrigo.  
 
8. Statistical Analysis    
8.1. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared separately from this protocol to describe the 
statistical methods, models, hypotheses and subject populations to be analyzed.  The SAP will 
be completed and approved before lockin g the database and unmasking the study.  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a significance level alpha =0.05.  Data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for discrete variables.  Subject listings of all data from t he eCRFs as well as any 
derived variables will be presented.  
 
8.2. Analysis Populations  
The following populations are defined for analyses:  
 
• The Safety Population  
 The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive study product. 
 

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-001      
                                                                        Page 47 of 60 
  
 • Per Protocol ( PP) Population : 
 
The accepted PP population used for BE evaluation includes all randomized subjects  
who : 
• meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria,  
• received and used study medication  
•  
  
 
• complete IOP evaluations for both eyes at Visit 3/Day 14 (week 2) and Visit 
4/Day 42 (week 6) within the designated visit window (i.e. +/- 4 days for each 
visit),  
• have no significant protocol violations that c ould have interfered with the 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment 
efficacy.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.3. Planned Analysis 
The safety analysis will be performed for the safety subjects while t he efficacy analysis will be  
conducted on the PP population.  
8.4. Sample Size  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_508164] and Reference 
treatments will be evaluated by [CONTACT_403043].  Safety comparisons will be performed on the safety population.  
 
9. CONSENT/AS SENT CONSIDERATIONS AND PROCEDURES  
It will be  made clear to the subject that, for the purposes of the study, they are consenting only 
for ophthalmic application of  the test or reference product.  Investigators may discuss the 
availability of the study and the possibility for entry with a potential subject without first obtaining consent/assent. However, informed consent/assent must be obtained and documented prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for research, including withdrawal fro m current medication(s).  When 
this is done in anticipation of, or in preparation for, the research, it is considered to be part of the research.  
 The study must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_258853].  A copy of the Letter of Approval from the IRB, which also contains specific identification of the documents approv ed, must be received by [CONTACT_403044].  
 Periodic status reports must be submitted to the IRB at least annually as required by [CONTACT_779]’s 
IRB, as well as notification of completion of the study . A copy of all reports submitted to the 
IRB by [CONTACT_403045].  
 
The investigator(s) has both ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in this study is given a full explanation of the protocol.  This shall be delivered in the form of a written informed consent/assent fo rm, which shall be approved by 
[CONTACT_123253] (IRB) responsible for approval of this protocol. Each informed consent/assent form shall include the elements required by [CONTACT_235794] 21 CFR Part 50.  The investigator agrees to obtain approval from Perrigo of any written informed consent/assent form used in the study, preferably prior to submission to the IRB.  
 Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subject and fully explained by [CONTACT_473] (or a qualified delegated designee)  the subject  has had the 
opportunity to have all questions answered, and it is felt that the subject understands the implications of participating, the IRB -approved written informed consent/assent form shall be 
signed by [CONTACT_281694] (or their parent/legally authorized representative) and the person 

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-001      
                                                                        Page 50 of 60 
  
 obtaining consent/assent (investigator or designee).  The subject shall be given a copy of the 
signed informed consent/assent form and the investigator shall keep the original on file . 
 If the subject fails to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the conclusion of the screening phase, the subject will be withdrawn from study participation .  In the event that the subject is 
re-screened for study participation  30 days or more beyond the initial screening , a new 
informed consent/assent form must be signed.  
 
9.1. Subject Confidentiality  
All participants are concerned for the individual subject’s privacy and, therefore, all subject data will be identified only by a subject identification numb er and subject initials. However, in 
compliance with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring  of clinical studies and in 
fulfillment of his/her obligations to Perrigo, it is required that the investigator permit the study monitor, any Perrigo authorized  representative, and/or FDA representative s to review that 
portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the study.  This shall include all study relevant documentation including but not limited to subject medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test result s to verify transcription accuracy, admission/discharge 
summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68561].  
 As part of the required content of informed consent, the subject must be informed that his/her medical chart may be reviewed by [CONTACT_258855], or a representative of the FDA.  Should access to the medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is the investigator’s responsibility to obtain such permission from the subject 
in writing  
 To preserve the subject's confidentiality, the data collected will be available only to the investigators of the study, their support staff, Perrig o or their authorized representative and 
possibly the FDA.  
 All reports and communications relating to the subject in the study will identify each subject only by [CONTACT_423]’s initials and by [CONTACT_941] S ubject Number. The investigator agrees to furnish 
Perrigo with complete subject identification.  
 
10. CONDUCT OF STUDY  
The investigational site is to maintain complete documentation of all subject procedures  and 
when they  occur.  
 
10.1. Completion of Study  
The investigational site will complete the study and complete all documentation required in satisfactory compliance with the protocol . 
It is agreed that, the investigator  or Perrigo may terminate this study before completion and 
shall provide written notice of such termination.   

Protocol No: PRG -NY-19-001      
                                                                        Page 51 of 60 
  
  
10.2. Protocol Amendments  
The Inv estigator will not make any changes to this protocol nor intenti onally deviate from this 
protocol without prior written consent from Perrigo and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201].  Any 
permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a cha nge for specific study 
center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment . 
 
When in the judgment of the reviewing IRB, the investigators and/or Perrigo, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk  to the 
subject, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification.  In such cases, additional informed  consent will be obtained from subjects 
enrolled in the study before expecting continued participation.  
 
11. RECORDS MANAGEMENT  
11.1. Data Collection  
Database set- up will be performed  using an appropriate fully validated, 21 CFR 
Part 11 compliant Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. eCRFs will be provided to each site via a secured web link. All applicable st udy data collected on each subject will be recorded by 
[CONTACT_258859].  Only authorized site personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data to the eCRF.  
 Approved staff at the CRO  will verify  all data entered into eCRFs for comp leteness and accuracy 
with reference to the source documents and records and will issue data queries to correct missing data or discrepancies found against the source within the EDC system.  
 Data validation will consist of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly into EDC. Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by [CONTACT_258205]. Study metrics will be reported from the EDC system.  
After all data have been verified by [CONTACT_200521] , an Investigator or Sub -
Investigator (listed on Form FDA 1572) is required to review and approve all eCRFs prior to database lock and breaking of the blind.  
Quality assurance verification via a 10% database audit of eCRF data will be conducted before the treatment assignment code is broken.  
 During each subject’s visit to the clinic, a designee participating in the study will record progress notes to document all significant observations.  At a minimum, these notes will contain  the 
following information about the following procedure at the visits they occur : 
 
a) Documentation of the informed consent process  (when obtained)  
b) The date of the visit and the corresponding Visit or Week in the study schedule;  
c) General subject status remarks, including any significant medical findings.  The severity, frequency, and duration of any adverse events and the investigator's assessment of relationship to study medication must also be recorded.

 d) Any changes in concomitant medications or dosages;  
e) A ge neral reference to the procedures completed; and  
f) The signature (or initials) and date of all clinicians who made an entry in the progress 
notes.  
 In addition, any contact [CONTACT_403046].  
 
Any changes to information in the study progress notes and other source documents, will be entered in black or blue ink , initialed  and dated by [CONTACT_403047]/addition.  Changes will be made by [CONTACT_2724] a single line through erroneous data, and 
clearly entering the correct data.  (e.g., wrong data  right data).  Entries may not be erased or 
masked with white -out fluid.  If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation 
for the change will be written adjacent to the change by [CONTACT_15370].  
 For transmission to Perrigo, information from the study progress notes and other source documents will be entered into the database.  The database also c ontains a complete audit trail  
to capture all regulatory components of data corrections (e.g. initial entry, new value, initials and date of the change).  
 
11.2. Source Documents  
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activities of a clinical investigation.  Source documents will include, but are not limited to, progress notes and screening logs.  All source documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_403048].

Page 11PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale :
Until 2005, interferon -alpha (IFN -) and high dose interleukin (IL) -2cytokine -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_522150] 
(RCC), but efficacy  was modest .  Since then, multiple vascular endothelial growth f actor 
(VEGF) inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamy cin (mTOR) inhibitors have supplanted 
cytokines as the cornerstone of therapy .  VEGF inhibitors include VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) axitinib, sunitinib, pazopi[INVESTIGATOR_522151], and sorafe nib, and the 
monoclonal anti- VEGF antibody  bevacizumab. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_522152] -angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_522153], a fraction of patients are refractory  to VEGF inhibitor s, and the majority  of patients 
will eventu ally develop evasive resistance and exhibit disease progression while on therapy .  
Nonclinical models suggest that at progression, the resistant tumor is aggressive both locally  
and at distant metastatic sites.  Several mechanisms have been proposed to exp
lain these 
phenomena.  Recent data support a significant role for the membrane receptor ty rosine kinase 
mesench ymal-epi[INVESTIGATOR_43920] (c -MET) and its ligand hepatocy te growth factor 
(HGF ) (or scatter factor) in tumor resistance to VEGF inhibitor s. 
It is therefore proposed that combining a c -MET inhibitor with a VEGF inhibitor will provide 
clinical benefit compared to treatment with a VEGF pathway  directed therapy  alone .  This 
supports the testing of crizotinib, as c -
MET inhibitor, in combination with the VEGFR 
inhibitor axitinib.  Since this will be the first study of axitinib given in combination with 
crizotinib, the primary  objective of the study  will be the assessment of the safet y and 
tolerability  of the combination regimen.  However, once the tolerability  of the combination 
has been confirmed, its antitumor activity  will be preliminarly  assessed in advanced RCC 
expansion cohorts in both the first line setting, and second/third line setting following disease 
progression on a VEGF pathway  inhib itor.  This 
will explore the activity  of the combination 
in both preempting the development of resistance to VEGF pathway  inhibitor and in treating 
tumors alread y resistant to VEGF pathway inhibitor. 
Objectives and Primary Endpoint :
Primary Objective
To assess the safet y and tolerability of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in 
patients with solid tumors and advanced RCC in order to estimate the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD )(or Maximum Feasible Dose [MFD] ) and select the 
recommended Phase 2dose ( RP2D ).

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 12Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the overall safet y profile .
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of axitinib and crizotinib when 
administered in combination and to assess the effect of crizotinib on the PKof 
axitinib (Dose Escalation Phase and atleast 8PK- evaluable subjects in Expansion 
Phase Cohort 1 only).
To characterize the effects of axitinib in combination with crizotinib on QTc.
To document the anti -tumor activity  of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in 
advanced RCC patients.
To ex plore the pharmacody namic effect of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in 
blood .
To characterize the alterations and/or expression profiles of genes, proteins, and 
RNA s relevant to angiogenesis (eg, Ang-2), drug targets (eg, c- MET) and sensitivity  
and/or resistance (eg, PBRM1) to axitinib in combination with crizotinib in tumor 
and/or blood.
The primary  endpoint of the study  is first- cycle dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). 
Study Design :
This is a Phase 1b, open- label, multi -center, multiple -dose, safet y, PKand pharmacod ynamic 
study  of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.   
This clinical study  will be composed of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion 
Phase.  The Dose Escalation Phase will estimate t he MTD in dose escalation cohorts in 
patients with advanced solid tumors, using the modified toxicity  probability  interval (mTPI) 
method.
The Dose Escalation Phase will lead to the identification of an Expansion Test Dose for 
axitinib in combination with c rizotinib in patients with solid tumors.  The Expansion Test 
Dose will be either the MTD or the MFD, ie ,the 
highest tested dose that is declared safe and 
tolerable b y the Investigator s and Sponsor.  Once the Expansion Test Dose is identified, the 
Dose Exp
ansion Phase will be opened and axitinib in combination with crizotinib will be 
tested in patients with advanced RCC.
The Dose Expansion Phase is comprised of two patient populations, both with histologically 
or cy tologically  confirmed advanced RCC with a component of clear cell subty peand:
Cohort 1: No prior sy stemic therapy  directed at advanced RCC. 
Cohort 2: At least one but no more than two prior sy stemic treatment regimens 
directed at advanced RCC, with at least one prior therap y being a regimen cont aining 
an approved VEGF -pathway  inhibitor ,and resistance to 
the most recently  received 
approved VEGF -pathway  inhibitor .  Resistance is defined as disease progression as 
per RECI ST version 1.1while on treatment with a VEGF -pathway  inhibitor .

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677391] 8 evaluable patients; in this cohort , the PK 
profile 
for axitinib single agent during the [ADDRESS_677392] safety  tests, 
ophthalmology  examination s will be carried out to assess any vision changes. Based on the 
safet y profile of axitinib, b lood pressure will be monitored throughout the treatment period, 
as well as t hyroid function .
Electrocardiogram ( ECG )measurements will be taken throughout the treatment period in all 
patients and in conjunction w ith PK sampling in patients from the 
Dose Escalation Phase and 
the Dose Expansion Phase Cohort 1.  Archived tumor tissues will be collected for all 
patients.  De novo tumor biopsy  will be collected for the patients in the Dose Expansion 
Phase 
Cohort 2.  Fo r all patients a second biops y might be provided on a voluntary  basis at 
the time of disease progression.
  Biomarker studies on tumor tissue and blood will be carried 
out to help understand the mechanism of action of the axitinib plus crizotinib combinatio n, as 
well as potential mechanisms of resistance.   Such results may  help in the future development 
of this combination.  These anal yses may  also result in the identification of potential 
biomarkers of response to the axitinib plus crizotinib combination, u ltimately  leading to 
development of a patient selection strategy
 for further clinical investigation.   As such 
collection and anal ysis of the archival tumor tissue as well as de novo tumor biopsies at 
baseline and at time of progression will be paramount to generate such knowledge.
Up to 65 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study . 
Study Treatment :
Crizotinib and axitinib will be given orally  (PO) twice dail y (BID) 
on a continuous dosing 
schedule in [ADDRESS_677393] to follow up, or unacceptable toxicity  occurs, or the 
study  is terminated b y the Sponsor.
  Patients with unacceptable toxicity attributed to one of 
the two drugs may be eligible for continued treatment with the other drug (after discussion 
between the Investigator and the S ponsor).  Patients with disease progression but who are 
still experiencing clinical benefit will be eligible for continued treatment with single agent 
axitinib or axitinib c ombined with crizotinib provided that the treating ph ysician has 
determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable.

Page 14Statistical Method s:
Up-and-Down Matrix Design with the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522154]/de- escalation rules will follow the modified tox icity probability  interval 
(mTPI ) method38(seeSection 9.2 and Appendix 5).  Briefl y, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_128574] a 
statistical probability  algorithm, calculated using all patients treated in prior and current 
cohorts at the same dose level) to determine where future cohorts should involve dose 
escalation, no change in dose, or dose de -escalation.
Rules f or dose -
finding, using the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_12183], include the following:
The target enrollment cohort size is [ADDRESS_677394] 2 days apart to allow for the 
initial evaluatio n of toxicities and tolerability .  If there are no safet y concerns, any 
additional patients enrolled to this dose cohort will not be required to initiate dosing 
sequentially .
The next cohort can be enrolled when all patients at the current dose cohort have been 
evaluated for 28 days (ie,the first treatment cy cle), or experience a dose limiting 
toxicity  (DLT ),whichever comes first .
If a patient withdraws from the study  before receiving at least 75% of the planned 
first-cycle dose of both axitinib and crizo tinib for reasons other than study 
drug-related toxicity , another patient will be enrolled to replace that patient at the 
current dose 
level .
The dose -finding component of the trial is completed when at least [ADDRESS_677395] dose associated with a DLT rate <0.33.  I t is 
estimated that approximately  25DLT evaluable patients will need to be enrolled to 
reach 10 DLT
-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.
The proposed doses ,schedule and PK timepoints may  be reconsidere d and amended 
during the stud y based on the emerging safet y and PKdata.
The RP2D will be confirmed in the D ose Expansion Phase, taking into account the 
MTD /MFD determination from the 
DoseEscalation Phase, and other factors related 
to safet y, efficacy , and PK/PD involving all available data from tests cohorts.
Sample Size Determination
Due to the d ynamic nature of the cohort allocation procedure used in this study, the sample 
size of the Up -and-Down matrix design using the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522155] d in 
advance.  It is estimated that [ADDRESS_677396] a reliable and accurate estimate of the MTD.  The two 
expansion cohorts will enroll up to 20 response evaluable patients each at th e estimated MTD
or MFD.

on tw o occasions prior to starting study treatment : once at the start of screening (all patients), and once at Lead -in Day 1(patients in Lead -in) immediately 
before axitinib administration, or at the baseline visit (all other patients) immediately before the administration of axitinib in combination with crizotinib .  
Follow ing a negative pregnancy test at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced andanother negative pregnancy tes t result will then be 
required at the baseline visit before the patient may receive the investigational product.  Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every treatment 
cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study treatment and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or w hen potential 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.   Additional p regnancy tests may also be undertaken as per request of IRB/IECs or if required by [CONTACT_427] (see 
Section 7.1.1 ).
18.Contraceptive Check :  Male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential w ill need to affirm that they 
meet the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need 
to use 2 highly effective contraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation in the patient’s ch art.  In addition, the 
investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if one or both selected contraception methods are discontinued, or if 
pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient’s partner.
19.Tumor Assessments: Tum or asses sments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI 
scans; brain CT or MRI scan for patients with suspected brain metastases.  The CT scans should be performed w ith contrast age nts unless contr aindicated 
for medical reasons.  The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following 
tumor assessments.  Antitumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, and then every 8 weeks from 
Cycle1Day 1of combination treatment, whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of 
Treatment/W ithdrawal (if not done in the previous 8weeks).   For patients with known or suspected bone metastases a bone scan (bone scintigraphy) or 
18F
-FDG -PET/CT is required at screening.   Repeat bone imaging is required every [ADDRESS_677401] version 1.1.
20.Adverse Events: Adverse events sho uld be documented and recorded at each visit using NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  The AE reporting period begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_677402] administration .  SAEs 
experienced by a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a 
minimum, all SAEs that the Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
Sponsor.   AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the C ase Report Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of study 
treatment through last patient visit (Day [ADDRESS_677403] dose ).  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non serious AEs ends 
at the time the new treatment is started .
21.Concom itant Medications/Treatm ents: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from [ADDRESS_677404] dose of study treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF including supportive care drugs 
(eg,anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs us ed to treat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non drug supportive interventions 
(eg,transfusions).
22.Registration: Patient number and dose level allocation operated by [CONTACT_3954].   Required information: site and patient identifiers and demographic 
information.   Study treatment (either single agent axitinib for patients in Lead -in or axitinib in combination with crizotinib for all other patients) should 
begin within 7 days of registration.   
Study Treatment: Axitinib and crizotinib will be given twice 
daily PO on a continuous schedule.   Axitinib in combination with crizotinib will be given

Page 231.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Indication
Axitinib in combination with crizotinib is indicated for the treatment of advanced solid 
tumors (Dose Escalation Phase) and de novo or VEGF inhibitor pretreated advanced renal 
cell cancer ( RCC) patients (Dose Expansion Phase) .
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Tumor Angiogenesis and VEGF -Pathway Inhibition
Tumor angiogenesis is a complex dy namic process necessary  for the continued growth of 
solid tumors.  VEGF is one of the most important angiogenic factors secreted by  [CONTACT_522189].  I ts production is enhanced b y several stimuli, including hy poxia.   VEGF and 
VEGF receptors ( VEGF R
s)are critical components of the processes leading to the 
branching, extension, and survival of endothelial cells which form new blood vessels during 
angiogenesis, and which is an absolute necessity  for tumor growth bey ond microscopic size.  
Inhibitors of angiogenesis are now widely  used in the treatment of cancer and most of these 
agents inhibit the V EGF pathway .  VEGF inhibitors include the VEGFR TKI s axitinib, 
sunitinib, pazop anib, and sorafenib, and the monoclonal anti
-VEGF antibody  bevacizumab.  
VEGF inhibitors have been approved in a number of indications, including the treatment of 
RCC.1,2
1.2.2. Renal Cell Cancer
An estimated 65,150 new cases of kidney  cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United 
States of America (US) in 2013.  This includes 93% RCC, 6% renal pelvis cancer and 
1% Wilms tumor.  An estimated 13,680 patients will die from kidney  cancer in 2013.3
RCC arises from the renal epi[INVESTIGATOR_241117] 5 major subtypes are currently  recognized.  
Approximately  70-80% o f these are clear cell RCC tumors while other less common cell 
types include papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]  (Type I and II), chromophobe, collecting duct and unclassified RCC.[ADDRESS_677407] been identified –MET protooncogene, von 
Hippel -Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL ), fumarate h ydratase tumor suppressor gene 
(FH),and Birt -Hogg -Dubé tumor suppressor gene ( BHD ).
Patients with von Hippel- Lindau disease have a >70% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_128572].  
This hereditary  form of RCC is caused by  [CONTACT_128627] 3p.  More than 90% of sporadic clear cell RCC involves somatic VHL
gene mutations or meth ylation.   VHL gene mutations lead to loss of function of the VHL 
prote in, accumulation of hy poxia -induc ible transcription factors (eg, HIF -
1alpha and 
HIF-2 alpha) which translocate to the nucleus and increase transcription of angiogenesis 
factors (such as VEGF and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)) which induce 
tumorgene sis.  Clear cell RCC is a highly  vascular tumor with high expression of VEGF, 
VEGFRs and PDGF receptor.[ADDRESS_677408] of patients with clear cell RCC present with Stage IV disease.  Systemic 
therap y is give n to patients with advanced disease (relapsed or Stage IV) that is not amenable 
to complete resection.  However, i t is recommended that these patients undergo a 
cytoreductive nephrectomy  where possible, prior to beginning s ystemic therapy , as per 
treatment guidelines.6
There are 7 targeted agents approved in the US as sy stemic therapy  for advanced RCC that is 
predominantly  clear cell.  Firs t line sy stemic therapy  is usuall y one of the VEGFR TKIs 
(sunitinib, paz opanib, or sorafenib), or the monoclonal anti -VEGF antibod y bevacizumab 
(given in combination with 0 ) or the mTOR inhibitor ,temsirolimus.  The same targeted 
agents or the VEGFR TKI axitinib, or the mTOR inhibitor everolimus are used individually  
in subsequent lines of therap y for advanced clear cell RCC.6,7,8,9
1.2.3. Rationale
[IP_ADDRESS].
c-MET a nd Resistance to Antiangiogenic Therapy
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_522157] y in multiple treatment settings including RCC, a 
fraction of patients are refractory  to VEGF inhibitor treatment and the majority  of patients 
will eventually  develop resistance and exhibit disease progression while on therapeutic 
regimen.10,11Nonclinical studies suggest that anti -angiogenic therap y ma y have induced the 
tumor to be more aggressive.12,13,14Models show VEGF inhibitor -resistant tumors to be 
more locall y invasive and exhibit enhanced dist ant metastases.  Several mechanisms have 
been proposed to explain resistance and this increase in tumor aggressiveness .  These include
activation of pathway s that favor epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchy mal transition (EMT) such as c -MET; a 
switch to vasculogenesis; co-option of normal organ vasculature; blood flow alterations due 
to tumor vessel pruning and normalization; 
and changes in the dominant VEGF isoform . 
Another proposed tumor resistance mechanism involves a switch from VEGF to alternative 
proangiogenic mediato rssuch as HGF and PDGF.   According to this hy pothesis ,
antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_522158].  Hy poxia and the overexpression of HIF -1leads not only  to the accumulation of 
VEGF and PDGF, but also i ncreases HGF expression in tumor and surrounding normal 
interstitial cells and increases c -MET receptor expression in endothelial and tumor cells.   The 
HGF/ c
-MET pathway  and VEGFR pathway can act sy nergistically  to promote tumor 
survival.  Additionally , HG Fhas its own role asan independent angiogenic factor and so 
may substitute, at least in part, for VEGF.  Up- regulation of HGF/c -MET signaling increases 
tumor invasiveness and distant metastasis.15,16,17
Nonclinical models support a role for HGF/c -MET in VEGF inhibitor resistance.17,18In 
several tumor models resistant to the VEGF TKI sunitinib, a combination of sunitinib plus 
the c -MET inhibitor PF-[ADDRESS_677409] and colorectal orthotopic tumor 
models resistant to sunitinib.  Histological anal ysis suggested that combination treatment 
mainly  targeted the vasculature in resistant tumors.   Moreover, exogenous HGF conferred 
resistance to sunitinib.20In a pancreatic neuroendocrine RIP -TAG -2model, sunitinib 

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068

Page 25increased h ypoxia, expression of HIF -1alpha, c -MET, and markers of EMT.  I mportantly ,
invasion and metastasis were prevented when sunitinib was accompanied by [CONTACT_522190] c-M ETinhibito rs PF -4217903 or crizotinib.21A simil ar benefit 
was found in orthotopic pancreatic carcinomas treated with cabozantinib (XL 184), a receptor 
TKI that blocks both c -MET and VEGFR2.  Cabozantinib prevented or reversed 
invasiveness, reduced the number and size of liver metastases, and prolonged s urvival.22
Recently , there has been a report of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in two RCC 
nonclinical models.  Human high cMET expressing 786 -O and low cMET expressing 
RP-01xenograft tumors were trea ted with vehicle, axitinib, crizotinib, or axitinib combined 
with crizotinib.  Significant sy nergistic effects were found with crizotinib combined with 
axitinib with tumor inhibition reported as 17% with axitinib alone compared to 76% with the 
combination (P<0.05).[ADDRESS_677410], ovarian, prostate 
and lung cancers, melanoma, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and RCC.24A 
Phase 2study  in 171 patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) reported that 
72% of evaluable patients had shrinkage of soft tissue lesions whereas 68% had an 
improvement on bone scan.   The objective response rate ( ORR )at 12 weeks was 5% and 
there was stable disease (SD) in 75% of patients.  The observed effects on bone scan are 
unprecedented and not seen with single agent VEGF
-pathway  targeted therapy ; this suggests 
that dual targeting of b oth VEGF and c -MET pathway s may  lead to improved outcome for 
patients with CRPC.25
Clinical activity  of cabozantinib in advanced pretreated RCC has been noted in a Phase I trial
and confirmed in the METEOR trial, a randomized Phase 3 trial of cabozantinib versus 
everolimus in patients with renal cell carcinoma that had progressed after VEGFR -targeted 
therap y.26, 42Progress ion-free survival (PFS) was longer with cabozantinib than with 
everolimus, with m edian PFS 7.4 months with cabozantinib and 3.8 months with everolimus. 
The risk of progression or death was 42% lower with cabozantinib than with everolimus 
(hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI ] 0.45 to 0.75; P<0.001). The ORR was 21% 
with cabozantinib and 5% with everolimus (P<0.001). A planned interim anal ysis showed 
that overall survival (OS) was longer with cabozantinib than with everolimus (hazard ratio 
for dea th, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P = 0.005) but did not cross the significance boundary  
for the interim anal ysis.[ADDRESS_677411]  inhibition and c -MET inhibition in several models
including axitinib in combination with crizotinib in RCC. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypothesis to be Tested 
The above clinical and nonclinical data support the hy pothesis that c -MET signaling 
contributes significantly  to VEGF inhibitor resistance such that combining a c -MET inhi bitor 
with a VEGF Rinhibitor will provide clinical benefit compared to treatment with a VEGF 
pathway  directed therapy alone .
This supports the testing of crizotinib, as c -MET inhibitor, in combination with the VEGFR 
inhibitor axitinib.
  Since this will be the first study  of axitinib given in combination with 
crizotinib, the primary  objective of the study  will be the assessment of the safet y and 
tolerability  of the combination regimen.  However, once the tolerability  of the combination 
has been confirmed, it
s antitumor activity  will be preliminarly  assessed in advanced RCC 
expansion cohorts in both the first line setting, and second/third line setting following disease 
progression on a VEGF pathway  inhibitor.  This will explore the activity  of the combination
in both preempting the development of resistance to VEGF pathway  inhibitor and in treating 
tumors alread y resistant to VEGF pathway inhibitor. 
1.2.4. Study Drugs
[IP_ADDRESS]. Crizotinib (XALKORI, PF-02341066) as a c -MET Inhibitor
Crizotinib (XALKORI, PF-02341066) is indic ated for the treatment of anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C)(actual 
indication varies according to region/country ).27
Although, crizotinib is a selective ATP-c ompetitive small-molecule, oral ALK/ROS1 TKI 
with proven clinical activity  in ALK -positive NSCLC patients, it is also an inhibitor of 
c-MET and its oncogenic variants (eg , c-MET/HGFR mutations).28,29Crizotinib 
demonstrated potent ( inhibition constant [K i] in nM range) concentration -dependent 
inhibition of c -MET phosphory lation in biochemical kinase assay s and cell -based assay s 
using tumor cell lines.29Crizotinib also demonstrated antitumor efficacy, including marked 
cytoreductive antitumor activity , in multiple tumor models implanted in athy mic mice that 
expressed activated crizotinib targets including c -MET/HGF.   In all assay s,crizotinib was 
found to be at least as potent, if not more potent, an inhibitor of c -MET compared to ALK.  
Since clinical studies have demonstrated that crizotinib has activity  against ALK, this implies 
that the level of drug attainable in human pl asma would be sufficient enough to also inhibit 
c-MET.
Clinical evidence for crizotinib inhibition of c- MET comes from the Phase 1clinical trial 
(A8081001).29Crizotinib has shown pharmacod ynamic modulation (increase) of soluble 
MET (sMET), which is a c- MET pathway -specific plasma biomarker.  The increase was 
time-dependent.  These observations are consistent with the effects reported for other c -MET 
inhibitors including foretinib (XL 880) and rilotumumab ( AMG10 2).30

Page 28Axitinib is a nadenosine tripho sphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor that binds to the 
unphosphory lated (non- activated) “DFG -out” conformation of the catal ytic domain of a 
receptor ty rosine kinase.  I n enzy matic assay s, axitinib was found to be highly  potent 
(Ki= 28 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36379]) against the kinase activity  of juxta -membrane (JM) domain containing 
human VEGFR 2recombinant protein.35In additional kinase assay s, axitinib showed potent 
and ATP -competitive inhibition of the VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3 and PD GFR -, but not other 
closely -related famil y kinases.   Receptor binding studies and cell- based assay s, confirmed 
that axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3.
  Axitinib was shown 
to have antiangiogenic activity  in a number of mode ls including spontaneous pancreatic 
islet-cell tumors of RI P-TAG -2transgenic mice model and demonstrated antitumor efficacy  
including marked cy toreductive antitumor activity , in multiple tumor models implanted in 
athymic mice. 
The safet y and efficacy  of axitinib were evaluated in a randomized, open -label, multi- center 
Phase 3study .  Patients with advanced RCC (99% clear cell) whose disease had progressed 
on or after treatment with 1 prior sy stemic therapy ,including sunitinib -, bevacizumab
-, 
temsirolimus- , or cy tokine -containing regimens were randomized to receive axitinib (N=361) 
or sorafenib (N=362).   There was a statisticall y significant advantage for axitinib over 
sorafenib for the 
primary PFS endpoint , 6.7 (95% CI : 6.3, 8.6) vs 4.7 (95% CI : 4.6, 5.6)
months respectivel y (p <0.0001).   There was no statistically  significant difference between 
the treatment arms in the secondary overall survival ( OS)endpoint , 20.1 (95% CI : 16.7, 23.4) 
vs 19.2 (95% CI : 17.5, 22.3).
  The objective response rate ( ORR )was 19.4% (95% CI: 15.4, 
23.9) for axitinib and 9.4% (95% CI: 6.6, 12.9) for sorafenib.  The most common ( 20%) 
adverse reactions observed in this study  following treatment with axitinib were diarrhea

1.2.5. Rationale for Starting Doses of Axitinib and Crizotinib
Nonclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data for crizotinib are reported in the 
crizotinib I nvestigator’s Brochure.29In nonclinical st udies pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacod ynamic (PK/PD) anal yses for inhibition of c -MET/HGFR activity  established a 
targeted efficacious concentration (C eff)range of 40 to 62 ng/m L(8.1to 12.8 nM, free drug).  
In clinical studies, repeated oral administration of crizotinib at 250 mg BID for 15 days or 
longer resulted in a median trough plasma concentration of 274 ng/mL (57 nM, free drug).  

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 29The RP2D and approved dose in ALK- positive patients is 250 mg BID.29,34Based on 
simulations, 250mgevery day  (QD), 200 mg BID and 250 mg BID doses of crizotinib are 
expected to y ield trough plasma concentrations exceeding crizotinib’s Ceff for c -MET. In 
consideration of safet y, the axitinib plus crizot inib combination will be first tested using a 
crizotinib starting dose of 200 mg BID (RP2D -
1).  The target crizotinib dose in the 
combination will be the currentl y approved dose of 250 mg BID.   Dose de -escalation to 
crizotinib 250 mg QD will be allowed in the event of toxicity .  Dose escalation and 
de
-escalation will be based on DLTs.
The currently  approved starting dose for axitinib is 5 mg PO BID.35Clinical PK data for 
crizotinib indicate that crizotinib is a moderate time -dependent cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 
3A4/5 inhibitor.29Axitinib is primarily  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 as evidenced b y a 2-fold 
increase in axitinib plasma exposures noted in the presence of the strong
CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, ketoconazole.35Hence, there is a potential for increased axitinib 
exposure (by  [CONTACT_3450]  50%) in the presence of crizotinib.  Considering this potential 
drug-drug interaction and the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_522160] (such as 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and fatigue), the starting dose of axitinib has been decreased to 
3mg PO BID for this study .  Based on PK simulations, 3 mg PO BID axitinib in combination
with crizotinib is predicted to provide similar plasma exposure to axitinib 5 mg PO BID 
alone ( Figure 1).   During the Dose Escalation Phase, the starting dose of axitinib may  be 
increased to [ADDRESS_677417] 
crizotinib exposure.

3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1.Study Overview
This is a Phase 1b, open- label, multi -center, multiple -dose, safet y, PKand pharmacod ynamic 
study  of axitinib in combination with crizotinib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. 
This clinical study  will be composed of two phases: 
Dose Escalation Phase: T
his phase will estimate the MTD in dose escalation cohorts 
in patients with advanced solid tumors .  The modified toxicity  probabilit y interval 
(mTPI ) metho d will be applied in the Dose Escalation. 
Dose Expansion Phase: 
This phase will confirm the safet y and tolerability  and 
explore the antitumor activity  ofaxitinib in combination with crizotinib in two 
cohorts of 
patients with advanced RCC .
All patients wi ll receive axitinib in combination with crizotinib in [ADDRESS_677418] crizotinib exposure so there will be no PK study  with a lead- in period of 
single -agent crizotinib.  The Dose Expansion Phase Cohort 1 will be use d to further stud y 
crizotinib and axitinib pharmacokinetic interactions; in this cohort , the PK profile for axitinib 
single agent during the 7 -day lead -in period will be compared to that 
of axitinib in 
combination with crizotinib during C ycle 1 (Figure 2).  Patients participating in serial PK 
sampling (all patients in the Dose Escalation P hase and at least 8 evaluable patients in 
Cohort 1 of the Dose Expansion P hase) need to receive at least 3 consecutive day s of ax itinib 
treatment prior to axitinib PK sample collection (on L ead-in Day 7and C ycle 1Day 15).  If, 
for an y reason, this is not feasible, the patient will be replaced.  No lead -in period will be 
included in the Dose Expansion Cohort 2 ( Figure 3).

(after discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor).  Patients 
with disease progression but who are still experiencing clinical benefit will be eligible for 
continued treatment with single agent axitinib or axitinib combined with crizotinib provided 
that the treating ph ysician has determin
ed that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable. 
Anti- tumor activity  will be evaluated every  [ADDRESS_677420] safety  tests, 
ophthalmology  examinations will be carried out to assess an y vision changes.  Based on the 
safet y profile of axitinib, blood pressure will be monitored throughout the treatment period, 
as well as th yroid function.
ECG measurements will be taken throughout the treatment period in all patients and in 
conjunction with PK sampling in patients from the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose 
Expansion 
Phase Cohort 1.  Archived tumor tissues will be collected for all patients.  
Denovo tumor biopsy  will be collected for the patients in the Dos e Expansion Phase 
Cohort 2.  For all patients a second biops y might be provided on a voluntary basis at the time 
of disease progression.  Biomarker studies on tumor tissue and blood will be carried out to 
help understand the mechanism of action of the axit inib plus crizotinib combination, as well 
as potential mechanisms of resistance.  Such results may  help in the future development of 
this combination.  These anal yses may  also result in the identification of potential biomarkers 
of response to the axitinib plus crizotinib combination, ultimately  leading to development of 
a patient selection strategy for further clinical investigation.  As such collection and anal ysis 
of the archival tumor tissue as well as de novo tumor biopsies at baseline and at time of 
progression will be paramount to generate such knowledge.
Up to 65 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study .
3.1.1. Dose Escalation Phase
[IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose s for Axitinib and C rizotinib (Dose Level 1)
The rationale for the starting doses is given in Section 1.2.5 .  The starting doses (Dose 
Level 1) are axitinib 3 mg BID in combination with crizotinib 200 mg BID in 28 -day cy cles. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. DLT Observation Period
Patients will be monitored for the occurrence of DLTs.  For dose escalation purposes, t he 
DLT observation period is Cy cle1(28days) (Figure 2). 
Patients who discontinue treatment before completing the DLT observation period and who 
do not take at least 7 5% of the planned doses of both axitinib and crizotinib for reasons other 
than treatment related toxicity  (for example, missed appointments, misplaced study  drug 
supplies, development of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_522161]) will be replaced.

A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Dose Escalat ion
Dose escalation and de -escalation will follow a matrix, “Up- and-Down” design, using doses 
of crizotinib and axitinib as shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Dose Levels in Dose Escalation Phase
Dose Level Crizot inib Axitinib
-1B 250mg QD 3mg BID
-1A 200mg BID 2mg BID
1(Starting Dose Level) 200mg BID 3mg BID
2A 250mg BID 3mg BID
2B 200mg BID 5mg BID
3 250mg BID 5mg BID
BID: tw ice daily ; QD: once daily
The proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK tim epoints may  be reconsidered and amended 
during the stud y based on the emerging safet y and pharmacokinetic data.
In this dosing algorithm there are up to 6 potential dose levels: ( -1B) crizotinib 250 mgQD + 
axitinib 3 mgBID; (- 1A) crizotinib 200 mg BID + axitinib 2 mg BID; (1) crizotinib 
200mgBID + axitinib 3 mg BID; (2A) crizotinib 250 mg BID + axitinib 3 mg BID;
(2B) crizotinib 200 mg BID + axitinib 5 mg BID and (3) crizotinib 250 mg BID + axitinib 
5mgBID.
The matrix approach allows for parallel dose cohorts exploration as escalations and 
de-escalations are called for based upon toxicity  results.  Possible dose 
escalation/de -escalation scenarios based on the starting (1) dose level tolerability  are 
illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Possible Scenarios for Dose Escalation/De-escalation Based on Dose Level 
Tolerability 
The arrows represent either dose de -escalation (red arrow) or dose escalation (green arrows). 

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677421] (crizotinib or axitinib, but not 
both) can be dose escalated or de -escalated in the next cohort.
There are several potential dosing sequences for escalation or de -escalation of crizotinib + 
axitinib.  The specific se quence to be followed depends upon the number of patients enrolled 
in the study  and the number of DLTs observed at each specific dose combination.  The 
sequences are mutuall y exclusive, meaning only one of the sequences will be followed 
through the course of the study .  Some possible sequences are listed below in Table 2.
Table 2. Possible Dose -Finding Sequences

cohortDose 1 meets de -escalation crit eria in the

Dosing will begin at Dose Level 1 and escalated or de -escalated according to Table 1.  The 
escalation/de -escalation rules will follow the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_12183]38(see Section 9.2 and 
Appendix 5).  Briefl y, the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_128574] a statistical probability  algorithm, 
calculated using all patients treated in pr ior and current cohorts at the same dose level to 
determine where future cohorts should involve dose escalation, no change in dose, or dose 
de-escalation.  As an example, if the total number of patients (cumulative in the study  from 
prior and current cohor ts) treated at the current dose combination is 3 the following dosing 
rules are applied:
0DLT escalate;
1DLTs  remain at the same dose;
2DLTs  de - escalate;
3DLTs de-escalate and consider current dose as intolerable.
Rules for dose -finding, using the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_12183], include the following:
The target enrollment cohort size is [ADDRESS_677422] 2 days apart to allow for the 
initial evaluation of toxicities and tolerability .  If there are no safet y concerns, any 
additional patients enrolled to this dose cohort will not be required to initiate dosing 
sequentially .
The next cohort can be enrolled when all patients at the current dose cohort have been 
evaluated for [ADDRESS_677423] treatment cy cle, or experience a dose limiting 
toxicity  (DLT), whichever comes first .

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 37If a patient withdraws from the study  before receiving at least 75% of the planned 
first-cycle dose of both axitinib and crizotinib 
for reasons other th an study  
drug-related toxicity , another patient will be enrolled to replace that patient at the 
current dose level .
The dose -finding component of the trial is completed when at least [ADDRESS_677424] dose associated wi th DLT rate <0.33.  I t is 
estimated that approximately  25DLT evaluable patients will need to be enrolled to 
reach 10 DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.
The proposed doses ,schedule , and PK timepoint s may  be reconsidered and amended 
during the st udy based on the emerging safet y and pharmacokinetic data .
The RP2D will be confirmed in the D ose Expansion Phase, taking into account the 
MTD /MFD determination from the Dose Escalation Phase , and other factors related 
to safet y, efficacy , and PK/PD involv ing all available data from tests cohorts.
No intra -
patient dose escalation will be permitted in the Dose Escalation Phase.
Once an MTD/MFD has been identified at the end of the Dose Escalation Phase, that dose 
level may  be expanded with up to additional 10 patients patients to allow the collection of 
additional PKand/or safety data.
3.1.2. DLT Definition
Severity  of adverse events will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 
4.03 (See Appendix 3).  For the purpose of Dose Escalation, any  of the following adverse 
events occurring during the DLT observation period (Cy cle1)
, that are attributable to one , 
the other ,or both 
agents in the combination will be classified as DLTs:
Hematologic:
Grade 4 neutropenia .
Febrile neutropenia , defined as absolute neutrophil count ( ANC )<1000/mm3with 
a single temperature of >38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained 
temperature of 38degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than one hour
.
Grade3neutropenic infection .
Grade3thrombocy topenia with bleeding .
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia .

Page 38Non-hematologic:
Grade 3toxicities (except asy mptomatic hy pophosphatemia, hy peruricemia 
without signs and s ymptoms of gout, and tumor ly sis sy ndrome). 
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea must persist at Gra de3or 4despi[INVESTIGATOR_522162] y. 
Grade 3hypertension will be considered a DLT if the event is persistent despi[INVESTIGATOR_522163] -hypertensive medications. 
In an as ymptomatic patient, Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc  501msec) will first 
require imme diate repeat testing, re -evaluation by  a qualified person, and correction 
of reversible causes such as electrol yte abnormalities or hy poxia for confirmation.  If, 
after correction of an y reversible causes, the Grade 3QTc prolongation persists, then 
the event should be considered a DLT.
Failure to deliver at least 75% of dose of each investigational product due to toxicities 
attributable to one or both investigational products .
3.1.3. Maximum Tolerated Dose Definition
The MTD estimate is the highest dose of axitin ib and crizotinib associated with the 
occurrence of DLTs in <33% of DLT- evaluable patients (see Section 9.1) .
3.1.4. Dose Expansion Phase Test Dose
The Expansion Test Dose will be either the MTD or theMFD, ie ,the highest tested dose that 
is declared safe and tolerable b y the Investigator s and Sponsor.
3.1.5. Dose Expansion Phase
The Dose Expansion Phase will test axitinib in combination with crizotinib in patients with 
advanced RCC who are at their first diagnosis (Cohort 1) or have recurred during or after a 
VEGF -pathway  inhibitor containing regimen (Cohort 2).
All patients in the Dose Expansion Phase may  be enrolled simultaneously.  A total of up to 
[ADDRESS_677425] Dose in one or both populations.  Only  doses declared safe in the Dose 
Escalation Phase will be considered.
For axitinib, intra -patient dose escalation to higher doses may bepermitted in Cy cle2and 
beyond (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

Page 393.2.Recommended Phase 2 Dose 
The RP2D is the dose of axitinib and crizotinib in combination chosen for further study
based on Phase 1study results.  I f the MTD/MFD proves to be clinicall y feasible for long 
term administration in a reasonable number of patients, then this dose usually  becomes the 
RP2D.  Further experience with the MTD /MFD may result in a RP2D dose lower than the 
MTD /MFD .

4.4.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately  qualified medical personnel for the 
trial is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_74071]’s manual.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study  number, 
contact [CONTACT_36535] a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site sta ff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients 
participation in the study .  The help desk number can also be used by  [CONTACT_522195], however it should only  be used in 
the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and 
the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not repl ace the 
established communication pathway s between the investigational site and study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.  The help desk 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly and if a patient c alls that number they  
will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an a ctive ingredient 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapprove
d indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33) .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Dose level allocation will be performed b y the Sponsor after patients have given their written 
informed consent and have completed the neces sary baseline assessments.
The site staff will fax or e -mail a complete Registration Form to the designated Sponsor 
study  team member(s) requesting approval for patient enrollment.
After review of patient’s eligibility and concomitant medications, the Spon sor will approve 
patient’s enrollment, if appropriate, and assign a patient identification number, which will be 
used on all Case Report Form (CRF) pages and other trial- related documentation or 
correspondence referencing that patient.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677439] until the Investigator or designee has 
received the following information in writing from the Sponsor:
Confir mation of the patient’s enrollment.
Specification of the dose level for that patient .
Permission to proceed with dosing the patient.
The Sponsor or designee will notify  the other sites of the inclusion of a new patient, and will 
inform study  sites about th
e next possible enrollment date .
5.2.Investigational Product Supplies 
Axitinib (AG -013736) and c rizotinib (PF -02341066) will be supplied for the study  by [CONTACT_522196] , Worldwide Research and Developement.   Drug supplies will be 
shipped to the st udy sites with a Drug Shipment & Proof of Receipt form.  This form should 
be completed, filed, and the shipment confirmed as directed on the bottom of the Drug 
Shipment & Proof of Receipt form.
5.2.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib
Axitinib will be suppli ed for oral administration as 1 mg and 5 mg film -coated tablets in
High Density  Polyethylene(HDPE) bottles with desiccant.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Crizotinib
Crizotinib will be supplied for oral administration as capsules containing [ADDRESS_677440] the compounds from light.   
Axitinib is a hazardous drug (due to possible reproductive toxicity ), and should be handled 
according to the recommended procedures described in the current edition of the American 
Society  of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128579] (ASHP), Technical Assistance Bulletin on Handling 
Cytotoxic and Hazardous Drugs, American Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522164] (AHFS) Drug 
Information (1999) and its references.   Procedures described in each institution’s pharmacy  
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_453133].

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 47Axitinib and crizotinib will be dispensed at the beginning of each treatment cy cle (or as 
otherwise indicated).  Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in the bottles 
provided and not transfer it to any  other container.  I n the event of dose modification, a 
request should be made of the patient to return all previously  dispensed medication to the 
clinic.
5.3.Administration
Axitinib and crizotinib will be each administered orally BID at approximately the same time 
in the morning and evening on a continuous daily
 dosing schedule, i e, without a break in 
dosing in the absence of drug -related toxicity  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  The two drugs can be 
taken together and the evening dose of each drug should be taken approximately  12hours 
after the morning dose.  Both drugs may  be administered without regard to meals.  Cy cles ar e 
defined in [ADDRESS_677441] not “make it up” with an extra dose, but instead resume subsequent doses as prescribed.  
Any missed dose may  be taken late up to [ADDRESS_677442] all doses 
(and missed or vomited doses) in a dosing diary  supplied by  [CONTACT_39722].  If dose s are missed or 
vomited, this must be indicated in the source documents and CRFs.
If a patient inadvertentl y takes 1 extra dose during a day , the patient should not take the next 
dose.
5.3.1. Food Requirements
Both axitinib and crizotinib can be taken with or wit hout food.  Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice which may  increase plasma concentrations of axitinib and crizotinib.
5.3.2. Recommended Dose Modifications
Axitinib and crizotinib dose levels for intra -patient dose modification are li sted in 
Table 3and Table 4, respectivel y.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Intra- Patient Dose Escalation
Patients enrolled to either Dose Expansion Phase Cohort, who are in C ycle 2or beyond, and
who tolerate axitinib with no drug-
related grade 3adverse events for [ADDRESS_677443] their axitinib dose increased by  [CONTACT_522197] 3, up toa maximum dose of 10 mg BID (unless the patient’s BP is 
>150/90 mmHg or the patient is receiving antih ypertensive medication).   Since crizotinib 
may cause inhibition of axitinib metabolism, particular attention should be provided to a 
patient’s overall safet y profile p rior to implementing intra-patient dose escalation 
for axitinib.   
The Sponsor must be notified of the decision to increase the dose of axitinib. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modifications in Case of Drug- Related Toxicity
Every  effort should be made to administer investigational product on the planned dose and 
schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity  dosing may  be delay ed and/or reduced as described below.  
In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity  
observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify  Investigator s at the first occurrence of any  
adverse s ymptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in two ways:
Within a cy cle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cy cle.
In the next cy cle: dose reduction may  be required in a subsequent cy cle based on 
toxicity experienced in the previous cy cle.
Investigators are encouraged to employ  best supportive care according to local institutional 
clinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.
Patients will be monitored closely  for toxicity , and axitinib and/or crizotinib treatment may  
be adjusted b y dosing interruption with or without dose reduction as indicated below.  Dose 
modification can occur independentl y for the 2 drugs.  Dosing interruption and/or intrapatient 
dose reduction b y 1, and if needed, [ADDRESS_677444] 
toxicity  observed.  Toxicities should initially  be attributed to either axitinib or crizotinib and 
managed accordingl y. 
Dosing CRFs should be util
ized to document each time study  medication is modified, started 
and stopped. 
Recommended dose modifications in case of drug -related toxicity  are shown in Table 5.

Patients will be issued BPcuffs (provided b y the Sponsor) for home monitoring and 
instructed to measure their BP twice dail y, prior to taking each dose.  All BPmeasurements 
will be recorded in a diary and brought to the nurse or study  coordinator at each clinic visit.  
Patients should contact [CONTACT_522198] 150 mm Hg, 
diastolic BPrises above 100 mm Hg, or if they  develop sy mptoms perceived to be related to 
elevated BP (eg, headache , visual disturbance).
To treat an increase in BP, standard antihy pertensives can be used (for example, thiazide or 
thiazide -like diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting -enzyme 
inhibitors, and dihy dropyridine (DHP) calcium chan nel blockers) although brady cardic 
agents (such as beta adrenergic blockers with or without alpha- blocking properties, and 
non-DHP calcium channel blockers, clonidine, digoxin) should be avoided to the extent 
possible .37
5.3.3. Crizotinib -Related Adverse Events Safety Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pneumonitis
Investigators must evaluate thoroughl ypatients who demonstrate potential signs/sy mptoms 
of pneumonitis.  I f a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or drug -related lung 
injury , then the following evaluations/procedures should be considered to confirm or exclude 
the diagnosis of pneumonitis during this period in the absence of disease progression, other 
pulmonary  disease, infection, or radiation effects: 
Sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) for bacterial, viral, fungal, 
protozoal, and my cobacterial pathogens
.
Blood culture should be performed in febrile patients.   Consider appropriate 
serologies (m ycoplasma, legionella, cytomegalovirus
, other viruses, e tc.).
Thoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (culture, microbiology , cytology ).
Bronchoscop y with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) if appropriate - the BAL fluid 
should be sent for culture, microbiology , and cy tology .
Lung biops y (eg, open or thorascopic pr eferable, bronchoscop y with transbronchial 
biopsy ) if appropriate .
Plasma sample for BNP (B -type Natriuretic Peptide) to evaluate for evidence of
congestive heart failure ( CHF ).
If clinicall y appropriate, high- dose corticosteroid treatment should be initia ted.  Should the 
event be fatal, an autops y is highly recommended to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.  See
Table 5for appropriate dose modifications.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Renal Cyst
The development of complex renal cy sts has been reported in some p atients with NSCL C 
treated with crizotinib.   These cysts may be s ymptomatic or as ymptomatic, and have usuall y 
developed 
from 2 to6 months after starting crizotinib.   The precise nature and significance of 
these cy sts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy  has been found based on 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_522165], complex renal cy sts may  be 
associated with renal malignancy , and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate 
medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_198379].
Activ
e surveillance with appropriate imaging (contrast -enhanced CT scanning or magnetic 
resonance imaging) should be performed at the time of the renal cy sts diagnosis and as 
scheduled per protocol.  Investigators should also review retrospectivel y all CT/MRIs for an y 
prior occurrence of complex renal cy sts.
5.3.4. Overdose Instructions
In the event of an overdose, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_522199] a clinical management plan.  
No information regarding overdose of crizotinib in humans is available. In Phase 3 study  
with axitinib for the treatment of patients with RCC, 1 patient inadvertently received a dose 
of 20 mg twice dail y for 4 days and experienced dizziness (Grade 1).  In a clinical dose 
finding stud y with axitin ib, subjects who received starting doses of [ADDRESS_677451] (I P) manual will be provided to the sites and will contain 
information about the drug supplies.   A patient diary  will be provided to the patients to aid in 
drug compliance.   The diary  will be maintained b y the patient to include missed or changed 
doses.
Patients will be required to return all bottles of study  medication at the beginning of each 
cycle.  The number of tablets or capsules remaining will be documented and recorded at each 
clinic visit.  The patient diary  may  also be used to support this part of the drug accountabilit y 
process.
The site is to follow up (for example, via a telephone call) with each patient at Cy cle 1 Day 
3(+ 3 days) to confirm that the patient understands and is in compliance with dosing 
instructions.
  The follow -up for dosing compliance by  [CONTACT_522200] r ecommended also 
whenever there is a dose change.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677452] Storage and Accountability 
The Investigator , or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area, under specified storage conditions and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Crizotinib and axitinib should be stored at controlled room temperature (between 
15-30C) in provided packaging. 
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochu re) will be superseded b y the 
label storage. 
All study  drug supplies must be kept in a locked, limited access room.  The study  drug must 
not be used outside the context of this protocol.  Under no circumstances should the 
Investigator or other site person
nel suppl y study drug to other Investigator s, patients, or 
clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed b y this protocol without prior 
authorization from the Sponsor.  The Investigator and or site staff must report any 
unacceptable condition o f the investigational product to the site monitor. 
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures dail y (ie, manually or b y 
using alarm sy stems to alert of any  excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working 
correctly  as required for proper storage of investigational products.  These include 
thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage.  An y temperature 
excursions should be reported to the sponsor.
The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  
Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.
The Investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the investigational product.  [COMPANY_007] may  suppl
y drug accountability  forms that 
must be used or may  approve use of standard institution forms.  I n either case, the forms 
must identify  the investigational product, including batch or code numbers, and account for 
its disposition on a patient- by-patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. 
The prescribe d dose should be recorded in the patient’s medical records.  Drug dispensing 
needs to be verified and documented b y a second individual and the forms must be signed b y 
both the individual who dispensed the drug and the second individual who verified the 
dispensing.   Copi[INVESTIGATOR_407540]. 
All bottles of study  drug must be returned to the Investigator by [CONTACT_102].   At the end of the 
trial, or at appropriate points during the trial, [COMPANY_007] will provide instructions as to disposition 
of an y unu sed investigational product.  If [COMPANY_007] authorizes destruction at the trial site, the 
Investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions prov
ided b y

Page 625.5. Concomitant Medication(s)
Concomitant medications and treatments, including herbal supplements, wi ll be recorded 
from [ADDRESS_677453] dose of study  
treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF including supportive 
care drugs (eg, antiemetic treatment and prophy laxis) , and the drugs used to treat adverse 
events or chronic diseases, and non drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).
Concurrent anticancer therap y with agents other than axitinib and crizotinib is not allowed.  
Medications intended solely  for suppor tive care (ie, antiemetics, analgesics, megestrol 
acetate for anorexia) are allowed.   Investigators are encouraged to emplo y best supportive 
care according to local institutional clinical practices and according to the guidance of 
selected adverse event pr ovided in this protocol.
5.5.1. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP Enzymes
The metabolism of crizotinib is predominantly  mediated by  [CONTACT_2750]3A4/5 isozy mes in 
human liver microsomes and hepatocy tes.  Similarly , in vitro studies with human liver 
microsomes and recombi nant CYP enzy mes indicate that axitinib metabolism is primarily  
mediated b y the drug -metabolizing enzy me CYP3A4/5, and to a lesser extent by  [CONTACT_097]1A2, 
CYP2C19 and UGT1A1.  Co -administration with drugs that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors 
and inducers may  chan ge the plasma concentrations of crizotinib and axitinib.
The concurrent use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, including but not limited to atazanavir, 
clarithrom ycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telith romy cin, troleandomy cin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, 
are not allowed in the study .  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_198288] (if applicable), such as 
2%ketoconazole cream, may  be allowed.
The concurrent use of strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_677454]. John’s wort, are not 
allowed in this study .
Crizotinib showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 isozy mes in human liver 
microsomes.  In cancer patients, a mean 3.6- fold (90% CI : 2.7-4.9- fold) increase in the oral 
midazolam AUC was observed following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mgBID, 
suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  Caution must be exercised 
in patients re ceiving crizotinib in combination with drugs that are predominantly  metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5, such as alfentanil, cy closporine, fentany l, quinidine, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus.   In particular, co -administration of crizotinib with CYP3A4/5 substrates with 
narrow therapeutic indices including, but not limited to dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], astemizole*, cisapride*, and terfenadine* (*withdrawn from U.S. market) must be 
avoided from the time of the first dose of crizotinib until treatment discontinua tion.  
Crizotinib has minimal potential to inhibit other human CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.  In vitro studies indicated that axitinib does 
not inhibit CYP3A4/5, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or UGT1A1 at 
therapeutic plasma concentrations.

Page 63Additionally , the concurrent use of non -prescription drugs, complementary medicines 
(excluding vitamins) or herbal supplements is not recommended.
5.5.2. Hematopoietic Growth Factors
Primary  prophy lactic use of granulocy te-colon y stimulating factors is not permitted during 
the first cy cle of treatment but they  may  be used to treat treatment emergent neutropenia as 
indicated b y the current American Societ y of Clinical Oncolog y (ASCO) guidelines .41
In subsequent cy cles, t he use of hematopoietic growth factors is at the discretion of the 
treating ph ysician in line with local guidelines.  Patients who enter the study  on stable doses 
of ery thropoietin or darbepoietin may  continue this treatment , and patients may  start either 
drug during the study  at the discretion of the treating phy sician.
5.5.3. Anti Diarrhea, Anti Emetic Therapy
Patients may  receive prophy laxis of treatment-induced diarrhea.  Sy mptomatic care such as 
loperamide (Imodium®) is recomme nded ([ADDRESS_677455] onset, then 2 mg every  2
-4hours until 
symptom -free for 12 hours, for diarrhea Grade 2).  Other anti -diarrheal medications can be 
used per local standard ofcare.
  
Standard anti -emetics may  be used for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting . Taking the 
medication with food may  reduce nausea.  The use of anti -emetics for profilaxis may  be 
considered.
5.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications
Palliative and supportive care for disease -related sy mptoms, including pain 
medications, will be allowed to all patients on this trial.
Patients with fever or infection requiring treatment should be treated with 
antimicrobials that are not prohibited due to their action on CYP enzy mes as noted 
above. 
Packed red blood cell and platelet transfusions should be administered as clinically  
indicated. 
Anti- inflammatory  or narcotic analgesics may  be offered as needed.  Acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol to a MAXIMUM total daily  dose of 2 g is permitted.  Daily  intake over 
2g is prohibited.
Patients who need to be on anti coagulant therap y during treatment should be treated 
with low molecular weight heparin.   If low molecular weight heparin cannot be 
administered, the administration of coumadin ,other coumarin derivatives ,or other 
anticoagulants may be allowed; appropriate monitoring of prothrombin 
time/I nternational normalized ratio (P T/INR)should be performed.
Patients on this trial may  be supported with appropriate hormone replacement therapy  
as clinically  indicated.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 64Bisphosphonate therap y for metastatic bone disease is permitted.  Bisphosphonate 
therap y should be given as per local medical practice.
The concurrent use of crizotinib with other brad ycardic agents (eg, beta -blockers, 
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, 
clonidine, d igoxin) should be avoided to the extent possible due to the increased risk 
of sy mptomatic brady cardia.   It is important to counsel patients about the risk of 
bradycardia and inform them of what s ymptoms and signs to be aware of and actions 
to take.
Crizotinib should be used with caution when administered concomitantly
 with 
medicinal products that are known to prolong QT interval and/or antiarrh ythmics ,or 
when it is administered to patients who have a history  of or predisposition for QTc 
prolongation. Whe n using crizotinib in these patients, periodic monitoring with 
electrocardiograms and electroly tes should be considered.
5.5.5. Concomitant Surgery
No formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound healing have been conducted , however 
caution is advised based on the mechanism of action .  If a major surgery or an interventional 
procedure (eg, endoscopy) is required, treatment with axitinib must be interrupted at least 
24 hours before the procedure and the patient BPshould be monitored closely  for 
hypotension. Patients may  resume axitinib seven day s after minor surgery  and 2 -3weeks 
after major surgery , assuming wound has completely  healed and there are no wound healing 
complications (eg, delayed healing, wound infection or fistula) .
The effect of crizotinib on wound healing is not known and has not been investigated; 
therefore, caution is advised on theoretical grounds (potential antiangiogenic effect).  In the 
event elective surgery  is necessary  during study  participation, crizotinib dosing should be 
stopped 48 hours before surgery  and resumed no sooner than 48 hours after surgery .
5.5.6. Concomitant Radiotherapy
Palliative radiotherap y to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically 
necessary  by [CONTACT_74079].  All attempts should be made t o rule out disease 
progression in the event of increased localized pain.  Crizotinib treatment should be 
interrupted during palliative radiotherap y –stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 1 day before and resuming treatment 
1day after.
If palliative radiotherap y is needed to control bone pain the sites of bone disease should be 
present at baseline.

verification of concurrent medications.
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy  test, with 
sensit ivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study  
treatment ,once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediatel y before 
investigational product administration.  Following a negative pregnancy  test result at 
screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and another negative pregnancy  
test 
result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient may  receive the 
investigational product.   Pregnancy  tests will also be routinely  repeated at every  treatment 
cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study treatment and additionally  
whenever one menstrual cy cle is missed or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspected.  
In the case of a positive hCG test, the patient wi

A 12 -lead (with a 10- second rhy thm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs.  Triplicate ECG 
measurements will be obtained at all time points except for a single ECG measurement at 
screening.  For triplicate measures, three consecutive [ADDRESS_677462] intervals automaticall y.  ECG measurements will include PR interval, 
QT interval, 
RRinterval, and QRS complex.  Additional ECGs will be performed as 
clinically  indica ted.  If the QTc is prolonged ( 501msec), then the ECG should be read b y a 
cardiologist at the site for confirmation.  An y manual overread done at site must be entered 
into the CRF as an unplanned ECG result.  In case of a QTc interval measurement 501msec 
(Grade3) dosing should be interrupted, and permanently  discontinued for a Grade 4QTc 
prolongation.  For Grade 3or 4QTc prolongations continuous ECG monitoring will be done 
under ph ysician supervision until the QTc recovers to Grade 1.  Triplicate ECG surveillance 
will again be performed when crizotinib is restarted on a reduced dose due to Grade 3QTc 
prolongation
.  The timing of the triplicate assessment of ECGs should be prior to (0 hour)

patients are seated comfortably  and that they  do not move their head forward or backward 
during testing.  Patients will be told that the chart contains only  letters. 
The line read with 2 or fewer errors will be recorded.  If 3 of the 5 letters on a line are read 
correctly , then the patient will be given credit for that line.  For example, if the patient reads 
20/25 +3, then 20/[ADDRESS_677464] -corrected visual acuity  of 3 lines or more from the Screening visit should 
be reported as an adverse event.  An adverse event of visual acuit y will be counted from the

20/125, 20/150, and 20/200.  If the acuity  at screening is better than 20/20, then the decrease 
will be calculated from 20/20.

and the administration of any  pupil -dilating agent for ophthalmoscopy .
Ateach scheduled visit, any  abnormalities of the lids, conjunctivae, cornea, anterior 
chamber, iris, or lens will be recorded at screening and an y change from screening will be 
graded as mild, moderate, or severe.  Aphakia or intraocular lens (anterior cham ber 
intraocular lens, posterior chamber intraocular lens, or iris clip) and status of the posterior 
lens capsule (intact, open, or absent) should be specified.  Cells and flare in the anterior 
chamber should be noted during the slit- lamp examination.

Page 717.2.1. Blood Sample Collection for P harmacokinetic Analysis 
Where noted in the Schedule of Activiti es (SOA ), blood samples will be collected at 
approximately  the same time as other assessments wherever possible.  Pharmacokinetic 
samples will be collected from all patients in the Dose Escalation Phase.   In the Dose 
Expansion Phase, pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from at least [ADDRESS_677465] 3 days prior to each of the axitinib pharmacokinetic 
sample collection visits.   For all collections, the time of dosing, as well as actual times of 
pharmacokinetic collections will be recorded in the source documents and CRF. 
The pharmacokinetics of steady
 state axitinib alone will be evaluated on Lead -inDay 7.  
Pharmacokinetics of axitinib and crizotinib will be evaluated on C ycle 1Day 15.  The 
pharmacokinetics of crizotinib alone will be evaluated on Day 1of Cy cle2, Cy cle3, 
Cycle4and Cy cle5.
Serial pharmacokinetic samples for axitinib will be collected on Lead -in Day 7and 
Cycle1Day 15.  Serial pharmacokinetic samples for crizotinib will be collected on 
Cycle1Day 15.  On both day s of serial pharmacokinetic sampling ( Lead -in Day 7and 
Cycle1Day 15), blood samples will be obtained at the following time points: predose, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing.  Ad ditionally , predose samples for crizotinib will be 
collected on Day 1of Cycle 2, Cy cle3, Cycle 4and Cy cle5.
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, an additional blood sample should be 
collected from patients experiencing unexpected an d/or SAE’s and the date and time 
documented in the CRF.
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for an y 
reason, the missed sample time may  be re scheduled with agreement of clinical Investigator s, 
patient and Sponsor.
PK samples will be assayed for axitinib, crizotinib and related metabolites using validated 
analytical methods in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating proce dures.  Additional 
details regarding the collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_522167].
7.2.2. Collection of Crizotinib PK Samples
At each time point for crizotinib, a 3 mL whole blood sample will be collec ted into an 
appropriatel y labeled K 2EDTA tubes to provide a minimum of 1 mL plasma for 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis.

At each time point for axitinib, a 3 mL whole blood sample will be collected into an 
appropriatel y labeled K 3EDTA tubes to provide a minimum of 1 mL plasma for 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis.
7.2.4. Processing, Storage and Shipment of Crizotinib and Axitinib PK Samples
The following special precautions should be taken to minimize the rapid degradation of 
axitinib and crizotinib in plasma when exposed to visible light:
Following collection of blood samples, samples should be processed as soon as 
possible.  Preferably, harvested plasma should be frozen within 1 hour of collection.
The blood collection tube should be gently  inver ted (8 -
10times) to thoroughl y mix 
the blood with the anti- coagulant. 
Vacutainer tubes should be protected from light (covered completely  in aluminum 
foil or in black protection tubes) and placed in an ice
-bath while samples are waiting 
to be centrifuged to harvest plasma .
Following centrifugation (for at least 10 minutes at 1700 g at 4C or lower), plasma 
should be transferred rapi[INVESTIGATOR_522168] 
-20C or lower .
All samples should be transferred to an opaque box to protect fr om light exposure 
during storage and shipment.  If a sample is inadvertently
 exposed to light (for 
5minutes or more), the sponsor should be notified so that the sample can be flagged 
for possibly  spurious results.
Once frozen, samples should not be allowed to thaw, including during shipment.
Samples will be shipped with the completed sample inventory  form and sufficient dry  ice to 
last for at least two day s.  Detailed instructions on sample collection, preparation, storage, 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_522169].
Axitinib and crizotinib pharmacokinetic samples will be anal yzed using separate validated 
analytical method s for each drug in compliance with [COMPANY_007] Standard Operating Procedures to 
determine plasma concentrations for axitinib, criz otinib and their metabolites.  As part of the 
understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may  be used for potential 
qualitative and/or quantitative metabolite anal yses and/or evaluation of the bioanaly tical 
methods for axitinib, crizot inib and their metabolites.   The results of such analy ses may  be 
included in the clinical report.
7.3.Pharmacodynamic Assessments
A key  objective of the biomarker anal yses that will be performed in this study  is to 
investigate candidate biomarkers that may  have predictive value in identifying those patients 
who may  benefit from treatment with crizotinib when used in combination with a VEGF 

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 73inhibitor.  I n addition, analy ses of sequentiall y obtained tissue and blood biomarkers will 
provide an opportunit y to inves tigate potential mechanisms of resistance as well as 
pharmacod ynamic markers that may  further the understanding of the mechanistic effects of 
the drug combination being studied.
7.3.1. Archived Tumor Tissue and De Novo Tumor Biopsies
Tumor tissue from archived tissue samples and/or a de novo biops y (see Section 6.1.1 and 
6.1.2) will be used to analy ze candidate DNA , RNA or protein markers for their ability  to 
predict or identify  those patients who are most likely  to benefit from treatment with the study  
drugs.  Markers that may be anal yzed include, but may  not be limited to, cMET gene 
mutation and gene amplification, PTEN mutation or deletion; c -MET, HGF, PBRM1 protein 
expression assessed b y immunohistochemistry  (IHC).  Comparisons between de novo 
biopsies from RCC patients treated with one prior line of sy stemic therapy  and archived 
tumor tissue obtained prior to the one line of s ystemic treatment will be made to investigate 
whether potential predictive markers represent intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of 
resistance. 
7.3.2. Peripheral Blood
Blood samples for plasma and serum preparations will be obtained from all enrolled patients 
(in the Dose E scalation Phase and in the Dose Expansion Phase Cohort 1and 2) to measure 
DNA, RNA or protein markers known or suspected to be of relevance to the mechanism of 
action, the development of resistance, or the identification of those patients who might 
benefi t from treatment with axitinib and crizotinib combination.  Markers that may  be 
analyzed include, but may  not be limited to, the soluble c -MET ectodomain, HGF, Ang 2, 
and miRNA signature.  Samples should be obtained pre -dose and at the same time as PK 
samples whenever possible (see Schedule of Activities ).
7.4.Banked Biospecimens
7.4.1. Markers of Drug Response
Study ing the v ariation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may  help to explain some of 
the variability  in response seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred 
to as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research.  Comparing the DNA, RNA, protein, and 
metabolite variation patterns of patients who respond well and those who respond poorly  to 
treatment may  help to better define the most appropriate group of patients in which to target a 
given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for exploratory  pharmacogenomic/biomarker 
analyses and retaining them in the [COMPANY_007] BioBank makes it possible to better understand the 
drug’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, 
exposure, efficacy , tolerability , or safet y not anticipated prior to the beginning of the stud y.  
Providing these biospecimens is a required stud y activity  for study  sites and patients, unless 
prohibited as such b y local regulations or ethics committee decision. 
To protect patients’ confidentiality , the banked biospecimens and data generated from them 
will be coded with the patient’s study  identification ( ID)number.  Samples will be kep t in a 
facility  accessible only  by [CONTACT_167185][INVESTIGATOR_007] a badge .  Data will be stored on password- protected

Page 74computer s ystems.  The key  between the code and the patient’s personal identifiers will be 
held at the study  site; the researchers using the biospecimens and dat a generated from them 
will not have access to the key  or an y personally  identify ing information.  Biospecimens will 
be used only for the purposes described here and in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet; an y other uses require addition al ethical approval.  Unless a time 
limitation is required by  [CONTACT_240846], biospecimens will be 
stored indefinitely  to allow for future research on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_498446], including 
research conducted during the lengthy  drug development process and also post -marketing 
research.  Patients can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at an y time 
by [CONTACT_7328] a request to the Investigator , in which event any remaining biospecimen will be 
destroy ed; data already  generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect 
the integrity of existing analyses.  It is very  unlikely  that results generated from the 
biospecimens will have any  clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual 
study participants.  Patients are notified in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet that their results will not be given to them, unless required by [CONTACT_147655], in which case results will be returned via the Investigator .  Resu lts will not be 
provided to family  members or other ph ysicians; nor will they  be recorded in the patient’s 
medical record.  There is no intention to contact [CONTACT_522202].
A 4mL blood biospecimen Prep D1 (K2EDTA whole bl ood collection optimized for 
DNA analysis) will be collected at the Baseline visit to be retained for potential 
pharmacogenomic/biomarker anal yses related to drug response, unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168039].  For example, putative safet y biomarkers, drug 
metabolizing enzy me genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to 
the mechanism of drug action may  be examined.
7.4.2. Additional Research
Unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_522203] n, patients will be asked to 
indicate on the consent form whether they
 will allow the Banked Biospecimens to also be 
used for the following research:
Investigations of the disease under stud y in the clinical trial, and related conditions .
Biospecimens may  be used as controls.  This includes use in case -control studies of 
diseases for which [COMPANY_007] is researching drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; use in characterizing the 
natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, proteins, and metabolites; and use in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_522170]/biomarkers. 
Patients need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimen specified in Markers of Drug Response Section will be used.  Patients may  still 
participate in the clinical trial if they  elect not to allow their Banked Biospecimens to be used 
for the additional purposes described in this section.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677466] or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )scans; brain CT or MRI  
scan for patients with suspected brain metastases.  The CT scans should be performed with 
contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.
The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline will be emplo yed in the following tumor assessments.
Antitumor activity  will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at 
baseline, and the n every  8weeks of combination treatment as specified in the Schedule of 
Activitie s (SOA ), and whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, s ymptomatic 
deterioration), and at the time of withdrawal from the treatment (if not done in the previous 
8weeks).
For patients with known or suspected bone metastases a bone scan (bone scintigraph y) or 
18F
-FDG -PET/CT is required at screening.  Repeat bone imaging is required every  16weeks 
only if bone metastases are present at baseline.  O therwise bone imaging is required onl y if 
new bone metastases are suspected.  Bone imaging is also required at the time of 
confirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases. 
Measurable or evaluable lesions that have been previously  irradiated will not be considered 
target lesions unless increase in size has been observed following completion of radiation 
therap y.
Assessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).
All patients ’ files and radiologic images must be available for source verification and for 
potential peer review.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigatio nal product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the Investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE.  The Investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -
upby [CONTACT_522204] a level acceptable to the 
Investigator , and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677467] in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the Investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the ev ent in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participa tion in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_677468].  Serious adverse events occurring to a pat ient 
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the 
Investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the 
Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product are to be reported to the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has 
taken at least one dose of investigational product through thepatient’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the 
SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y 
intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.   Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 77Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure;
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  unde r study  should be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by  
[CONTACT_265360].
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product, b y the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength  
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF , which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including :
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accom panied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AEs are captured on an AE CRF page.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677469] finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result lead s to a change in study  dosing outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the Investigator or Sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward m edical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial dis ruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect ;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and s ymptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal withi n the 
safet y reporting period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185569] s ymptoms of disease 
progression should not be reported as an SAE.  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome 
during the stud y or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to deat h 
must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTC AEGrade 5 (see theSection on 
Severity  Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 79Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dep endency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_522205], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see Section 8.14.1 on SAE Reporting Requirements). 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be con sidered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.   Patients who 
present with the following laborator y abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory
 values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T 3times the upper limit of normal 
(XULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2X ULN with no evidence of hemoly sis 
and an alkaline phosphatase 2X ULN or not available .
For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of norma l, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For patients with pre -
existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT value 2times the baseline values and [ADDRESS_677470], or 
[ADDRESS_677471] (whichever is smal ler).
Concurrent with
For patients with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased from baseline by [CONTACT_4689] 3times the upper limit of n ormal 
(whichever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and ph ysical assessment and for oncology  studies, 
the possibility  of hepatic neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.  In addition 

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677472] bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l transferase, 
prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement 
consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepat itis A, B, or 
C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All cases confirmed on 
repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for LFT 
abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522171] a ny initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute an 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assess ed 
for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e g, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE o r with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -
up of persistent pre- treatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination );

protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatmen ts or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reportin g period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the 
Vers ion 4.0 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances).
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinctio n between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
thepatient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The Investigator ’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements 
if applicable.  An Investigator ’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the Investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product

Page 82caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investiga tional product” for 
reporting purposes, as defined by  [CONTACT_1034] (see Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If 
the Investigator 's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational 
product", this s hould be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the Investigator determines thatan SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the Investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report su ch an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products
and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant women (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Unit on a Serious Adverse Event Form and an EDP
Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addit ion, the 
Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product 
in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is 
pregnant and has been exposed to a 
cytotoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP Suppleme ntalForm.  This must be 
done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see 
below for information related to termination of pregn ancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The Investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial EDP Supplemental Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of 
the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) 
for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 83If the outcome of the pregna ncy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion .
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_677473].
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_3786] .  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the Investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.   The investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner .
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when ,during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898] , which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE . Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also theSection on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AE s should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a patient wit hdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The Investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient .  In addition, each study  patient will be questioned about AEs.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677474] be 
made immediatel y, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy , exposure v ia 
breastfeeding
, and occupational cases. 
In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
Investigator is to report the eve nt within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an Investigator
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a desc ription of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be use d on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpec ted serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.

DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Stat istical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_4618].  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment .

Page 859.1.Anal ysis sets 
The following patient sets will be assessed.
Safety  anal ysis set.
The safet y analysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of axitinib 
or crizotinib.
Per protocol anal ysis set (evaluable for DLT).
All enrolled patients who are eligible, receive at least one dose of axitinib and crizotinib ,and 
who either experience DLT during the first cycle, or complete the [ADDRESS_677475] 7 5% of the planned 
first- cycle dose due to reasons unrelated to treatment related adverse events are not evaluable 
for DLT.
Response evaluable analy sisset. 
All patients who start Cycle [ADDRESS_677476] 1.1 criteria.   Patients who are treated and removed from study  prior to 
on-study  tumor assessment because of disease progression will be considered evaluable for 
efficacy  and counted as failures.
PK analy sis set.
The PK concentration population is defined as all treated patients who have at least 
1concentration of an y of the study drugs. 
The PK parameter anal ysis population is defined as all treated patients who have at least [ADDRESS_677477] of an y of the study drugs. 
Biomarker anal ysis set
.
The biomarker anal ysis set is defined as all treated patients who have at least one screening 
biomarker assessment, and have received at least one dose of an y stud y drug.  Anal ysis sets 
will be defined separately for blood -based and tumor tissue -based biomarkers.
If mutational profiling is performed on samples derived from the biomarker anal ysis set, the 
analysis may  be limited to screening samples onl y.
9.2.Statistical Methods and Properties
9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Dose Escalation/De-Escalation: mTPI
[INVESTIGATOR_522172] 3+3 design for Phase 1dose 
escalation trials that improve accuracy , efficiency  and statistical validity . 

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 86The modified toxic ity probability  interval (mTPI) design38uses a Bay esian statistics 
framework and a beta/binomial hierarchical model to compute the posterior probability  of 
three dosing intervals that reflect the relative diffe rence between the toxicity rate of each 
dose level to the target rate (pT = 0.30).  If the toxicity  rate of the currentl y used dose level is 
far smaller than pT, the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_134922]; if it is close to pT, 
the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522173]; if it is far greater than pT, the mTPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_128598] -escalating the dose level.  These rules are conceptuall y similar to those 
used by  [CONTACT_941] 3+[ADDRESS_677478] table (Appendix 5).  Thus, compared to other 
advanced model -based designs published in the li terature, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_522174].  Recently , a Phase I trial based on the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522175].39
Decision rules are based on calculating unit probabil ity mass (UPM) of three dosing intervals 
corresponding to under, proper, and over dosing in terms of toxicity .  Specifically , the 
underdosing interval is defined as (0; pT -
e1), the over -dosing interval (pT+e 2), and the 
proper -dosing interval (pT - e1, pT+ e 2), where e 1and e 2are small fractions.  Based on the 
safet y profile of axitinib and crizotinib , e1is selected as 0.05, and e 2is selected as 0.00.  
Therefore, the target dosing interval for the DLT rate is (0.25, 0.30).
The three dosing intervals are as sociated with three different dose -escalation decisions.  The 
under -
dosing interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), over- dosing corresponds to a dose 
de-escalation (D), and proper -dosing corresponds to remaining at the current dose ( S).  Given 
a dosi ng interval and a probability distribution, the unit probability mass (UPM) of that 
dosing interval is defined as the probability  of a subject belonging to that dosing interval 
divided by  [CONTACT_274217].  The mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522176] U PMs for the 
three dosing intervals, and the one with the largest UPM informs the corresponding 
dose-finding decision, which is the dose level to be used for future patients.  For example, if 
the under -dosing interval has the largest UPM, the decision will be to escalate, and the next 
cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  Ji and collaborators38have 
demonstrated that the decision based on UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a posterior
expected loss (ie, minimizes the chance of making a wrong dosing decision). 
The dose -finding component of the trial is terminated when either approximately  25DLT 
evaluable patients have been enrolled or when at least [ADDRESS_677479] dose with DL T rate <0.33, whichever comes first.
9.2.2. Statistical Method for Estimating the MTD
As described in Section 3.1.3, the estimated MTD will be the highest tested dose l evel with a 
DLT rate <0.[ADDRESS_677480] 10 DLT evaluable patients.  We assume that higher doses of either 
axitinib or crizotinib result in higher toxicity  rates.  But, due to the relatively  low number of 
patients that may  be potentially  allocated to an y dos e combination, this assumption may  be 
violated.

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 87For example, at the end of the study , the dose combination (crizotinib 250 mg BID,  axitinib 
3mgBID) may have a higher proportion of observed toxicities than, say , (crizotinib 
250mgBID,  axitinib 5 mgBID), and this variability  may  be simply  related to small cohort 
size alone.  To overcome this potential problem, we use a bivariate isotonic regression to 
smooth the resulting toxicity  surface to a monotonically  increasing one.  The determination 
of the MTD contour is accomplished using the Dykstra -Roberston algorithm.40Once a 
monotonically  increasing toxicity  surface is obtained (either observed or smoothed according 
to the bivariate isotonic regression algorith m), the MTD combinations closest to the targeted 
DLT rate of 0.3 but still <0.[ADDRESS_677481] combinations to the Expansion Phase cohort(s), in case no clear choice exists 
between more than [ADDRESS_677482] a reliable and accurate estimate of the MTD.  In addit ion, there will be Dose 
Expansion Phase cohorts to characterize safety , biomarkers, and efficacy  in terms of 
probability  (p) of achieving an event of interest including, but not limited to, objective 
response (OR).  The goal will be to estimate proportions of such patients with the standard 
error ( SE) of not greater than 0.12, ie , by [CONTACT_108],

Therefore, a sample of twenty  patients ( n=20 ) per Dose Expansion Phase cohort will allow 
estimation of the probability  of achieving an event of interest with the standard error <0.12 .
9.4.Efficacy Analysis 
In this stud y anti -tumor activity  is a secondary  objective.  Efficacy  anal yses will be presented 
in the form of statistical summaries and data listing for the Dose Expansion Phase cohorts.  
For the Dose Escalation c ohorts only  data listings will be presented.

Page 889.4.1. Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints (Dose Expansion Phase Cohorts)
Objective response rate ( ORR )is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response ( PR)according to RECI ST 
version 1.1definitions, relative to the response evaluable population as well as the safet y 
population .  Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat tumor assessments for at 
least 4 weeks after initial documentation or response. Otherwise, the patient will be counted 
as a non- responder in the assessment of ORR.
Duration of Response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently  confirmed to the first documentation of 
objective tumor progression or to death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first. 
Progression Free Survival (P FS) is defined as the time from the first dose to the first 
progression of disease (PD) or death for an y reason in the absence of document ed PD.  PFS 
will be summarized in the safet y analysis set.  PFS data will be censored on the date of the 
last tumor assessment on study  for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and 
who do not die while on study .  Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after 
enrollment will have their PFS time censored on the date of first dose with a duration of 
1day.  Patients who are treated and removed from study  prior to on -study  tumor assessment 
because of disease progression will be consider ed evaluable for efficacy  and counted as an 
event at the time of progression.  
Additionally , patients who start a new anti -cancer therap y 
prior to documented PD will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the 
start of the new therap y.
Summaries will include: ORR, DR and 6- month PFS probabilities.  Time -to event endpoints 
(PFS and DR) will be analy sed with Kaplan
-Meier method.  Point estimates will be presented 
with their 95% confidence intervals.   In addition, progression date, death date, date of first 
response and last tumor assessment date will be listed, together with best overall response 
(BOR), DR and PFS.
9.5.Analysis of Other Endpoints
9.5.1. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Crizotinib and Axitinib
All patients who complete at least one day  of PK blood sampling will be included in the PK 
analyses.  Standard plasma PK parameters for axitinib and crizotinib (and metabolite) will be 
estimated using non -compartmental anal ysis.  For crizotinib, standard PK parameters wil l 
include the maximum plasma concentration (C max), minimum plasma concentration (C min), 
time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), area under the plasma concentration versus 
time curve to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC [ADDRESS_677483]),  area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve to 12 hours (AUC 0-12), and oral plasma clearance (CL /F).  
For axitinib, standard PK parameters will include Cmax, Tmax, AUC [ADDRESS_677484], AUC 0-12, CL/F, 
apparent volume of distribution ( Vz/F)and plasma elimination half life (t½).  Descriptive 
statistics for the PK parameters for each drug will be provided b y day of assessment in 
tabular form.

minimum, maximum, geometric mean, its a ssociated CV, and 95% confidence interval) by  
[CONTACT_2715], cy cle, day  and nominal time.  I ndividual patient and median profiles of the 
concentration -time data will be plotted by  [CONTACT_2715], cy cle and day  (single dose and steady -state) 
using nominal times.  Median profiles will be presented on both linear -linear and log -linear 
scales.
Trough concentrations for crizotinib will be plotted for each dose using a box -whisker plot 
by [CONTACT_522206] -state.
In addition, Non- linear Mixed Effects Modeling (NONMEM) approaches will be explored to 
further describe the pharmacokinetic profile and assess potential drug interaction.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effect of Crizotinib on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics 
The effect of repeated crizotinib dosing on axitin ib PK will be evaluated using AUC 0-12of 
axitinib on L ead-in Day 7and Cy cle1Day 15, respectively, as the primary  pharmacokinetic 
parameter.  Ninet y-percent confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of 
AUC 0-12(axitinib in presence of crizotin ib/axitinib alone) will be computed to assess the 
magnitude of the effect.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK/PD Modeling
Mechanism -based or semi -mechanistic sequential pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic 
models may  be developed using NONMEMto explor e any  relationships between plasma 
drug concentrations and selected safet y, biomarker, and efficacy  endpoints.
The results of these anal yses, if performed, will be reported separatel y.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints
Biomarkers will be assessed separatel y for blood and tumor tissue samples.  I n each case, 
summaries of baseline levels and changes from baseline will be reported.  Summary statistics 
may include the mean and standard deviation, median, and minimum/maximum levels of 
biomarker measure s or frequency  statistics, as appropriate. 
Data from biomarker assay s will be anal yzed using graphical methods and descriptive 
statistics such as linear regression, t- test, and anal ysis of variance (ANOVA).  The statistical 
approach may  examine correlatio ns of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters 
and measures of anti- tumor efficacy .
Due to the exploratory  nature of the proposed biomarkers, the data analysis will be conducted 
with the goal of identify ing biomarkers with the strongest concordanc e to clinical outcome, 
encompassing both safety and efficacy.  Candidate biomarkers will be validated in 
subsequent trials.

10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
Investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/a uditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, t he study  site may  be patient to review 
by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to 
quality  assurance audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of 
[COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_522208].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection an d will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the inves tigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the Investigator (s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data recor d or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the Investigator or by [CONTACT_522209].  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obs cure the

these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve a s source documents.  I n these 
cases, a document should be available at the Investigator ’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the Investigator
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  T he records should be 
retained b y the Investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is 
longer.
If the Investigator becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
Investigator , another institution , or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_677487] obtain P fizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to have prospective approval o f the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with 
the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/ IEC approvals should 
be forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the Investi gator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677488] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the Inte rnational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996 & 2008). 
In ad dition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I CH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not i nclude patient names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws. 
Patient names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by  a numerical 
code consisting of a numbering s ystem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  the trial 
patient.  I n case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and 
protection of patient personal data.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed b y the sponsor, approved b y the IRB/IEC before use, and available for inspection.
The Investigator must ensur e that each study  patient is fully  informed about the nature and 
objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation. 
The Investigator , or a person designated by  [CONTACT_737] , will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient before an y study -specific activity
 is performed.  The Investigator
will retain the original of each patient's signed consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment

regulatory  application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Particip ating Countries
End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as Last Subject Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100] /IEC, orinvestigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of 
axitinib or crizotinib at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will pro mptly  notify  the

[ADDRESS_677499] criteria as described below.
Measurable:
Tumor lesion : Must be accurately  measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10mm by  [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5mm);
10mm caliper measurement by  [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accuratel y 
measured with cal ipers should be recorded as non -measurable).
Malignant l ymph nodes : To be considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable, a l ymph 
node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by  [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis 
will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable:   All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological ly mph nodes with 
10mm to <15 mmshort axis) as well as truly  
non-meas urable lesions.  Lesions considered trul y non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, ly mphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by
[CONTACT_522214] b y reproducible imaging techniques. 
NOTE: If measurable disease is restricted to a solitary  lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed b y cytology /histology .
Recording Tumor Measurements
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2lesions per organ and 5lesions in total 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and 
recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability  for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either b y imaging techniques or clinically). 
The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the lon gest 
diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum longest 
diameter to be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the 
measurable dimension of the disease during treatment.  All measure ments should be 
performed using a caliper or ruler and should be recorded in metric notation in centimeters.

AG-013736, PF -02341066
A4061068
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 27 January 2016 
Page 103All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not r equired and these lesions should be 
followed as “present” or “absent.”
Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at screening and duri ng follow -up.  I maging -based evaluation 
is preferred to evaluation by  [CONTACT_2085] (phy sical) examination when both methods have been 
used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.
Definitions of Tumor Response
Target Lesions
Complete response (CR) is def ined as the disappearance of all target lesions.  Any
pathological ly mph nodes (whether target or
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to
<10mm.
Partial response (PR) is defined as a  30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of 
the targe t lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a  20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions 
of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions 
recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.   In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.
Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify  for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions 
since the treatment started. 
Non-Target Lesions
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions.  A ll
lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) .
Non-CR/Non -PDis defined as a persistence of 1 non- target lesions.
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions, or the appearance of 1new lesion.
The cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory  to differentiate between response or stable di sease and progressive disease.
Confirmation of Tumor Response

AG-013736, PF -[ADDRESS_677500] be confirmed b y repeat studies that should be performed 4weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met.  In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after stud y entry  at a minimum interval of 8weeks.

3Measurable or non -measurable lesions .
Determination of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  For CR and PR, t he patient’s best 
respons e assignment will depend on the achievement of bot h measurement and confirmation 
criteria.  In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after stud y entr y at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.
NOTE:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring disco ntinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every  effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  I t should also be noted that a tumor 
marker increase does not constitute adequate objective evidence of tumor progression.  
However, such a tumor marker increase should prompt a repeat radiographic evaluation to 
document whether or not objective tumor progression h as occurred. 
In some circumstances, it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by  [CONTACT_522216] e aspi[INVESTIGATOR_522180].

Escalation/De -escalation algorithms for total number of patients treated at the current 
dose level (current and previous cohorts)
With 3 patients treated at current dose level
0DLT escalate
1DLT rema in at the same dose
2DLTs  de - escalate 
3DLTs de-escalate and consider current dose as intolerable
With 4 patients treated at current dose level
0DLT escalate
1DLTs remain at the same dose

formulation of this study. Include any relevant past or current research by [CONTACT_1268]. For drug and device studies summarize the previous results 
(i.e., Phase I/II or III studies).  
Chronic kidney disease, an inpairment  in kidney func tion beyond age -expected decline , is 
commonly attributed to kidney damage from diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension.  While the 
direct me chanism(s) of kidney injury resulting from these comorbidities has yet to be defined, it 
has been hypothesized that the vasculature is involved in kidney function .  This hypothesis is 
supported by [CONTACT_74987] t he one proven therapy for chronic kidney  disease, namely 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 
improve s vascular function.   
 In our study of patients with resistant hypertension, we have shown that vascular function 
improves with the use of sp ironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74955].  
Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that spi[INVESTIGATOR_74956].  Currently spi[INVESTIGATOR_74957].  If spi[INVESTIGATOR_74958] , as it has been shown to do in patients with resistant 
hypertension , then defining this  mechanism would open new therapeutic avenues for patients with 
chronic kidney disease.

Note.  If data from prior studies indicate differences between the genders or among 
racial/ethnic groups in the proposed research or if there are no data to support or to 
negate such differences, Phase 3 clinical trials will be required to include sufficient 
and appropriate entry of gender and racial/ethnic subgroups so that trends detected 
in the affected subgroups can be analyzed. If ethnic, racial, and gender estimates are  
not included in the protocol, a clear rationale must be provided for exclusion of this 
information. If prior evidence indicates that the results will not show gender or racial 
differences, researchers are not required to use gender or race/ethnicity as se lection 
criteria for study participants. They are, however, encouraged to include these 
groups. See Section II. Policy of the NIH POLICY AND GUIDELINES ON THE 
INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES AS SUBJECTS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH – 
Amended, October, 2001 ) for further details.  
 
c. From what population(s) will the participants be derived?  
Participants will be primarily recruited from a database of former and active pa tients of the UAB 
Hypertension Clinic totaling over [ADDRESS_81537] eGFRs < 60 
mL/min/1.73m2.  Additional recruitment will come from a database of patients seen in the CKD 
clinic at the Kirklin clinic and the  PI’s renal clinics both a t the Kirklin Clinic and at Cooper 
Green.     
 
Describe your ability to obtain access to the proposed population that will allow 
recruitment of the necessary number of participants:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_74959] a database of hypertension patients while working in  [CONTACT_75020]’s 
Hypertension Clinic at the Kirklin Clinic.  A letter signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Calhoun and [CONTACT_75021] will be mailed to potential participants identified in this database .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_74960], where he is an attending in the 
renal clinic.   A letter signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Eric Judd and Dana Rizk, the director of the CKD clinic at the 
Kirklin Clinic, will be mailed to potential participants identified in the CKD database.   
 
 
Describ e the inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
Table 1. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria  
Inclusion 
Criteria   Adults (19 -65 years of age)  
 CKD (eGFR 25-60 mL/min/1.73m2) with urine ACR > 30 mg/gCKD (eGFR > 60 
mL/min/1.73m2) with u rine ACR ≥ 30 0 mg/g  
Exclusion 
Criteria   Severe HTN (office BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg)  
 Hypotension (office BP < 110/70 mm Hg)  
 Serum potassium > 5 mEq/L  
 History of arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation

ACR = albumin -to-creatinine ratio, HTN = hypertension, BP = blood pressure, DM = diabetes 
mellitus, MR = mineralocorticoid rec eptor  
Patients with severe hypertension (office BP > 160/100 mm Hg) are excluded due to 1) the 
possibility of requiring blood pressure medication changes during the study period, 2) direct 
effects of blood pressure on vascular function testing, and 3) inc reased cardiovascular risk  leading 
to potential serious adverse event s.  Patients with hypotension (office BP < 110/70 mm Hg) were 
excluded due to an expected drop in blood pressure with administration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_74963]/or 
amiloride.  
 
d. If participant s will comprise more than one group or stratification, describe each 
group (e.g., treatment/intervention, placebo, controls, sham treatment) and

If none, enter "None": None  
 
g. Describe the process  (e.g., recruitment, chart review) that will be used to seek 
potential participants (e.g., individuals, re cords, specimens). Research recruitment 
by [CONTACT_105] -treating physicians/staff may require completion of Partial Waiver of 
HSP  
Vascular Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74941] 3 21 2017   Page 15 of 21 Authorization for Recruitment/Screening. (See 
http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=6 1981.) 
For patients identified as potential participants through the hypertension and CKD 
database s, study personnel will revie w the medical history including the medical record in order 
to identify exclusion criteria.  Eligible  participants who meet incl usion and exclusion criteria after 
this screening process will be mailed a letter co -signed by [CONTACT_6283]. Judd and Calhoun for the HTN 
database and Drs. Judd and Rizk ([CONTACT_75022] is the Director of the CKD clinic at the Kirklin 
Clinic) for the CKD database.  Potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_74988] a 
screening visit where an investigator will review the risks and benefits  of participation in a formal 
consenting process.    
 Patients recruited from the PI’s Kirklin Clinic or Cooper Green clini c will have the study 
and its associated risks and benefits introduced by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_74964] a regularly scheduled follow -up 
visit.  Patients interested in participating will have a screening visit scheduled whe re informed 
consent will occur.  
 Patients who are scheduled to see a  nephrologist at the Kirklin clinic will be prescreened 
using chart review in Impact to assess eligibility.  With approval from the patient’s nephrologist, 
patients who are eligible will be contact[CONTACT_74989] .  If 
interested, potential participants will be scheduled for a screening visit where the informed 
consent process takes place.  As part of the consenting process participants are  presented with a 
copy of the informed consent and are  allowed a n unlimited  amount of time before deciding  to 
proceed with  the study.   
 In order to meet recruitment goals, the electronic health record system for University of 
Alabama Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74965] i2b2 in order to generate a list o f 
potential study candidates.  Once this list has been truncated further by [CONTACT_14716], the primary 
care doctor and/or primary nephrologist at UAB will be contact[CONTACT_74990] 
a letter in the mail.  The recruitment letter is attached.  
 
h. If you will use recruitment materials (e.g., advertisements, flyers, letters) to reach 
potential participants, attach a copy of each item. If not, identify the source (e.g., 
databases) from which you will recruit participants.  Eligible participants i dentified in 
the hypertension  and CKD  database s will receive a letter alerting them to future contact [CONTACT_74991].   Other participants will be recruited directly from the PI ([CONTACT_75023]’s) Kirklin 
Clinic and Cooper Green clinic.   Flyers will be posted in designated areas at Cooper Green, UAB 
campus, and the Kirklin Clinic.     
 
i. Describe the procedures for screening potential participants.  
The m edical history will be reviewed with the potential participant in a standard of care clinic 
visit.  If the patien t agrees to participate, an investigator will review the consent form in person 
with the volunteer  during a screening visit .  For potential participants identified in the database s, 
their medical records will be obtained through Horizon  or Impa ct in order to identify exclusion 
criteria .  Review of medical records will be limited to study personnel (either the PI, sub -
investigator, or study coordinator).   
 
16. Protocol Procedures, Methods, and Duration of the Study —in nontechnical 
language  
a.  Describe the study methodology that will affect the participants —particularly in 
regard to any inconvenience, danger, or discomfort.  
Study participants with proteinuric, CKD will be randomly assigned in a double -masked fashion 
to spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] 25mg daily o r amiloride 5 mg daily for 6 weeks and then crossed over to the 
alternate study medication after a 1 mon th wash -out period (See Figure 1 ).  Vascular function will be 
assessed at baseline and the end of each 6 week treatment period by: 1) ultrasound guided flow-
mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, 2) impedence cardiography,  3) pulse -wave velocity, 4)

Vascular Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74941] 3 21 2017   Page 16 of 21 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and 5 ) serum and urine biomarkers .  Participants 
will undergo a total of 7 visits over 16 -18 weeks; [ADDRESS_81538] velocity is measured non -invasively with placement of a small sensor (tonometry 
probe) over the carotid and femoral arter y.  This procedure poses no discomfort and is usually done 
in about [ADDRESS_81539] lie flat for 30 minutes.  Hand and arm 
discomfort from cuff inflation is common yet resolves immediately after cuff deflation.  Collection of 
urine for 24 hours and wearing a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours can be disruptive to normal 
daily/nightly activities; however poses no danger or long-term  inconvenience.  
A study visit where vascular function testing is to be performed will begin at [ADDRESS_81540] his/her blood and urine collected for laboratory testing.  Laboratory testing will 
include ~[ADDRESS_81541] a 24 hour ambulatory monitor placed .  This entire visit is expected to take 2 hours.   
Study visits where vascular function testing will not be performed  (e.g., screening visit, visit 2, visit 
4, and visit 5; see Table 2) should last 30 minutes and involve a medication assessment, vital sign 
check, and blood collection for serum potassium (~4 mL).  
All study med ication will be prepared by [CONTACT_74992] P harmacy in matching capsules.  .  
The order of medication dispensing will follow simple randomization using an a priori  randomization 
list prepared by [CONTACT_56636] .

Vascular Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74941] [ADDRESS_81543] benefits may include discovering that spi[INVESTIGATOR_74966] s albuminuria and/or blood pressure.  In addition, participants who experience an 
improvement in endothelial function with spi[INVESTIGATOR_74967] a lower 
cardiovascular risk with continued use.  We feel the risks involved with participating in this study 
are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.  
 
18. Risks  
a. List the known risks —physical, psychological, social, economic, a nd/or legal —that 
participants may encounter as a result of procedures required in this protocol. Do 
not list risks resulting from standard -of-care procedures. Note.  Risks included in 
this protocol document should be included in the written consent document .  
No undue hazards (physical, psychological, financial, legal, or other) are anticipated with vascular 
function testing  or blood and urine sampling. Participants may be exposed to several potential 
risks as itemized below:  
1. Hyperkalemia: Administration of both spi[INVESTIGATOR_74968] 0.4 mEq/L.  Serum levels of potassium will 
be monitored at each study visit.  Kayexalate and a low potassium diet will be administered 
for levels of serum p otassium > 5.5 meq/L followed by a repeat potassium level in 3 days.  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study with serum potassium levels > 6.0 meq/L.  In 
addition, participants will not be allowed to participate in the second treatment period with 
a serum potassium > 5.0 meq/L when checked at week 10.   
2. Fetal toxicity: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74969].  Pregnant women, as 
determined by a screening urine sample, are excluded from study participation.  Women of 
child bearing potential w ill be advised of the risk of fetal toxicity, and if a pregnancy occurs 
during the study the participant will be withdrawn and study medication stopped.  
3. Gynecomastia: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_74970].  This association 
occurs more fre quently with the long -term use of doses exceeding 50mg/day.  
4. Discomfort and risks (hematoma/skin infection) ass ociated venous blood collection  
5. Measurement of pulse wave velocity  and performing impedence cardiography  is non -
invasive and entails no risk. Howe ver, measurement of FMD requires that the subject be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 30 minutes, and i nflation of the blood pressure cuff for 5 minutes may cause 
discomfort.  
 
b. Estimate the frequency, severity, and reversibility of each risk listed.  
1. Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L, is expected to 
occur in less than 5% of study participants.  Serum potassium levels will be monitored  
within [ADDRESS_81544] collection techniques involving sterile 
materials and alcohol preparation will be employed.

occur in less than 25% of study participants.  Lumbar support pi[INVESTIGATOR_74971].  Hand and arm discomfort from blood pressure cuff inflation for 5 minutes 
commonly occurs with FMD measu rement, yet completely resolves with cuff deflation .  
 
c. Is this a therapeutic study or intervention?  Yes No 
 If Yes , complete the following items:  
i. Describe the standard of care in the setting where the research will be 
conducted:  The standard of care for non -diabetic patients with moderate (stage III) CKD is

inflammatory  and illicit  drugs ).  Patients with severely, uncontrolled bloo d pressure (e.g., 
>160/100 mm Hg) will be excluded from participation.   
 
ii. Describe any other alternative treatments or interventions:  An angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is 
recommended for p atients who have CKD and moderate levels of albuminuria a nd/or 
uncontrolled hypertension.  Participation in this clinical trial will not interfere with this 
therapy.   
 
iii. Describe any withholding of, delay in, or washout period for standard of care or 
alternativ e treatment that participants may be currently using:  Patients taking 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], amiloride, or triamterene at baseline will be offered to hold this medication for 
1 month prior to starting the study.  All participants will undergo a 1 month washout be tween 
the 2 intervention periods.  
 
 
d. Do you foresee that participants might need additional medical or psychological 
resources as a result of the research procedures/interventions?  Yes No 
If Yes , describe the provisions  that have been made to make these resources 
available.

      Intervention to Change Attributions that are Negative (ICAN): a New Approach to Reducing Anger and Aggression after Brain Injury  Study Protocol and Statistical Analyses Plan  Clinicaltrials.gov #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Unique Protocol ID: [PHONE_16208]    Secondary IDs: 1R21HD094232-[ADDRESS_1069980] controlled trial of the ICAN intervention to examine feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1); effect size estimates on perspective taking and hostile attributions (Aim 2); and anger and aggression (Aim 3) in participants with TBI.       Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  Inclusion Criteria  • History of complicated mild to severe TBI (injury due to an external physical force), with injury severity being defined either by1 Glasgow Coma Score at time of injury (≤12), or post-traumatic amnesia (≥1 day), or loss of consciousness (≥30 minutes), or positive head CT scan consistent with TBI.  • At least 18 years of age or older;  • ≥[ADDRESS_1069981]-injury;  • Have adequate vision, hearing, and speech/ language skills to participate in assessments and group therapy (determined based on interaction with the participant at screening) • Have adequate reading comprehension (due to the primary assessment involving written scenarios)  • Have abnormal scores on one or more of the below measures of negative attributions or perspective taking (determined at T0 screening): o Epps Intent: >4.8, or o Epps Hostility: >4.2, or o Epps composite score: >-0.2, or o AIHQ Intent: >3.3, or o IRI Perspective Taking: < 14.5 for men and < 15.5 for women   • Have above average aggression (>49 at telephone prescreening; >55 at T0 screening) on one of the Buss Perry Subscales. • No anticipated medication changes for emotions/ behavior during length of study participation; medica-tions for emotions/ behavior must be stable within last 30 days prior to consent at T0 (Screening)  • Have reliable mode of transportation  Exclusion criteria:  • Pre-morbid neurological disorders that could affect mood and cognition (e.g. stroke); does not in-clude controlled seizures  • Progressive central nervous system disorders (e.g. dementia, Parkinson’s)  • Developmental disability (e.g., autism, developmental delay); • Major psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, Borderline Personality Disorder);  • Severe Depression and/or perceived risk to self or others (mental health resources will be provided and if suicide risk, approved suicide protocol will be utilized);  • Currently receiving active behavioral therapy for anger.   • On drug research study for irritability, anger, aggression   Note: Participants will not be excluded if they do not have caregiver.   Sample Size Calculation. Forty participants (20 per group) will be enrolled to allow for 20% dropout. Thirty-two participants (16 per group) are expected to finish the study. For Aim 1, feasibility and satisfaction percent-ages of 80%, a sample size of 30 will allow these proportions to be estimated to within 13% using one-sided 95% confidence intervals. For between group effect sizes for Aims [ADDRESS_1069982] deviations with 80% power using a two-sided t-test at a .05 level of signifi-cance. An ANCOVA model with pre/post correlation of 0.5 can reduce the sample size needed by 25% or to [ADDRESS_1069983] sizes for Aims 2 and 3, 16 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a differ-ence in means of .[ADDRESS_1069984] at the .05 level of significance.   Recruitment. The Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308911] (RHI), an affiliate of Indiana University (where the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I’s have offices), will be a primary source of recruitment (see Hammond LOS). IU/RHI is one of 16 nation-ally recognized Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) sites in the [LOCATION_002], making it a strong site for recruitment of this population. On average, RHI admits around 120 individuals with TBI annually; >1,000 
individuals with TBI are seen in the RHI outpatient clinics. We will use 1) past RHI inpatients, 2) RHI Outpatient Clinic, 3) RHI Research Registry (n=295), and 4) IU/RHI TBIMS Database (>230 enrolled to date). We will re-cruit through letters sent by [CONTACT_778708], pre-clinic chart screening, clinician discussions with patients, flyers posted in RHI, recruitment videos shown around the facility, researchmatch.com and through The Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308911]'s Facebook page. Flyers will be distributed at TBI support groups and the Brain Injury Association of Indiana.  RHI patient letters will be followed with a phone call to confirm receipt of the letter and inquire about interest in the study.  See Pre-screen below.        Outcome Measures. Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI),2,[ADDRESS_1069985] relia-bility and internal reliability.2,3 It was used in the PI’s previous studies on attributions. To determine the subjects’ global sense of change in his/ her perspective taking and empathy, the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) regarding these outcomes will be administered. To determine global be-havioral changes in perspective taking and empathy as per-ceived by [CONTACT_2312], the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CaGIC)4,5 will be administered to participant caregivers. Us-ing a 7-point Likert scale, caregivers will be asked to rate the degree of change (1=no change; 7=a great deal better) in the participant’s perspective taking and empathy. The PGIC and CaGIC for perspective taking and empathy are considered secondary outcome measures for the study.    Attributions of hostility, intent, blame and anger responses to hypothetical scenarios.  Epps Scenarios are [ADDRESS_1069986] rate how angry they would be if the sce-nario happened to them, then how hostile, how intentional, and how much to blame they think the character’s behavior was. They will then be asked, “what would you do about it?”.  Participants’ responses will be audio recorded to assure we accurately capture their responses.  Participants will be alerted before the audio record-ing begins.   Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire:    This questionnaire consists of 15 written vignettes describing actions/ situations that were intentional (5), ambiguous (5) and accidental (5).   After participants read each vignette and imagine the scenario happening to her or him, they are asked five questions: 1) why the other per-son (or persons) acted that way toward you (open-ended response later rated by [CONTACT_203956]; score indicates ‘‘hostility  bias’’); 2) Whether the other person (or persons) performed the action on purpose (1 ‘‘defi-nitely no’’ to 6 ‘‘definitely yes’’) using a Likert Scale (Intent score); 3)  how angry it would make them feel (1 ‘‘not at all angry’’ to 5 ‘‘very angry’’) using a Likert scale (anger score); 4) how much they would blame the other person (or persons) (1 ‘‘not at all’’ to 5 ‘‘very much’’) using a Likert scale (blame score); and 5) how she or he would respond to the situation, (open-ended response).   General Anger and Aggression:  Changes in anger and aggression will be evaluated with several different measures.  General anger will be measured with the Anger-Affect Scale from the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery (also known as the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; PROMIS) Anger Short Form), and will be a secondary outcome measure.[ADDRESS_1069987] scores, and can be used to classify anger severity. Devel-oped as part of NIH’s initiatives for better outcomes measurement, this tool has good validity and reliability.8 Aggression will be measured with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) and the AQ will be the pri-mary outcome measure.9 The AQ is a standardized measure comprised of 34 statements to assess anger, hostile thoughts, and physical and verbal aggression. Participants rate statements using a 5-point scale.  Raw Table 1                            Outcome Measure Aim IRI Perspective Taking  2 **PGIC and CaGIC perspective taking & empathy 2 Intent and Hostile attributions to scenarios   2 Anger Ratings to scenarios   3 **PROMIS Anger-SF  3 *Aggression Questionnaire 3 **PGIC and CaGIC aggression 3 CSQ-8   1 *Primary Outcome; **Secondary Outcome  
and scaled scores (adjusted by [CONTACT_65634]) are provided for aggression subcomponents and total aggres-sion. Total aggression will be used for our analyses. The AQ is a widely used and accepted aggression meas-ure, including for TBI studies.10-[ADDRESS_1069988] reliability (.72-.80), and good internal consistency (.76-.94).9  To determine the subjects’ global sense of change in anger and aggression, the Patient Global Im-pression of Change (PGIC) regarding these outcomes will be administered. To determine global behavioral changes in anger and aggression as perceived by [CONTACT_2312], the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CaGIC)4,5 will be administered to participant caregivers. Using a 7-point Likert scale, caregivers will be asked to rate the degree of change (1=no change; 7=a great deal better) in the participant’s anger and aggression. The PGIC and CaGIC are considered secondary outcome measures.   Emotion Regulation: The Difficulty with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)61 is a 5-point Likert scale that partici-pants use to rate the frequency they utilize self-regulation behaviors in response to general emotional distress. There are 6 subscales: Lack of Emotional Awareness, Lack of Emotional Clarity, Difficulties Controlling Impul-sive Behaviors When Distressed, Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior When Distressed, Non-ac-ceptance of Negative Emotional Responses, and Limited Access to Effective Emotion Regulation Strategies. Items are summed to provide a Total Emotion Dysregulation score. The DERS has high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and good construct validity.61 Importantly, because this measure assesses difficulties reg-ulating all types of emotions, it captures different information than that provided by [CONTACT_778709]-ety, anger, or depression which can miss more general, yet common, self-regulation problems.   Social Inference/Theory of Mind: The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT)15 uses short one minute video vignettes to assess emotion and social inferences.  There are three subtests that comprise the TASIT: Emotional Evaluation Test (EET); the Social Inference-Minimal (SI-M); and Social Inference-Enriched (SI-E). In the EET subtest, actors portray six different emotions with dynamic facial movements, tone of voice, postures and gestures through short vignettes.  These emotions include happy, sad, angry, disgust, fearful, surprised and neutral.  In the SI-M test, actors depi[INVESTIGATOR_778704] (text and context are con-sistent) or sarcastic (text and context are inconsistent).  In the SI-E test, the actors perform social skits that de-pi[INVESTIGATOR_778705].  Participants must make inferences about what the characters are thinking or believ-ing and their intentions. We will use data from the EET, SI-M, and SI-E subtests for our analyses (3 variables). The TASIT was tested for construct validity and was determined to be able to distinguish the social perceptual abilities of persons with and without brain injury on overall performance.15  Depression: Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9):64 This self-report depression assessment uses a 3-point Likert scale (maximum score 27), with established validity and reliability, including in the TBI population.64,[ADDRESS_1069989] 2 weeks.   Anxiety: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)16 is a self-report 7-item questionnaire that as-sesses frequency of seven anxiety symptoms linked to the DSM-IV criteria for GAD.  Alexithymia: The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) [ADDRESS_1069990] widely used self-report questionnaire to measure alexithymia (52-60=moderate alexithymia; ≥61=high alexithymia), and has good test-retest reliabil-ity.21 The TAS-20 is comprised of 3 factors: 1) ability to identify emotions (e.g., I am often confused about what emotion I am feeling); 2) ability to describe emotions (e.g., It is difficult for me to find the right words for my feelings); and 3) externally-oriented thinking (e.g., I prefer to just let things happen rather than understand why they turned out that way).   Satisfaction: We will use the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)17 which is an 8 item instrument with a 4-point Likert scale that participants use to answer questions about perceived satisfaction with the program (e.g., To what extent has our program met your needs?; Have the services you received helped you to deal  more effectively with your problems?  In an overall, general sense, how satisfied are you with the service you have received?). Scores are summed (8-32) with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Normed scores based on [ADDRESS_1069991]-Treatment Qualitative Interview: After participants receive the ICAN treatment (Time 2 for ICAN Subjects and Time 3 for WLC subjects), the unblinded RA will Interview the subjects with the following questions. A) Have you noticed any changes in yourself since going through the group therapy? (yes/no); B) What changes 
have you noticed (if any)?; and c) What parts of the therapy do you think were the most helpful?  Subsidiary Measures Discourse Comprehension Test (DCT): Test of reading comprehension for explicit and implicit main idea and details of short passages.  There are two versions of the test.  One version examines reading comprehension for information the participants read themselves (self-read).  The other version tests auditory comprehension.  Participants must demonstrate sufficient comprehension in one version or the other (6/[ADDRESS_1069992] or 75% correct).  For the auditory version, subjects will listen to the story once, and then answer the 8 yes or no questions.  For the self-read version, participants will read the story on his/ her own and this will be followed by [CONTACT_778710]/no questions, based on the stated (4) and implied (4) information within the story. When the subjects are answering the questions, they may refer back to the text for information, so that the test will truly assess comprehension and not memory skills.  Responses are recorded in terms of number of items correct for stated versus implied main ideas and details.  Participants will need to achieve 75% accuracy in either the self-read or auditory version.    Cognition/ Executive Functioning:  We will assess executive functioning skills for attention, dis-inhibition and verbal fluency. The following tests were chosen based on findings from our preliminary study. Color-word inter-ference (Stroop): Attention and dis-inhibition will be assessed with a commonly used color-word interference test that assesses skills such as basic color naming; word reading; and names of colors written in different color ink (participants must name [CONTACT_778715], not read the words).  Verbal Fluency: assesses word as-sociation fluency; we will examine letter fluency and category fluency. This test measures a person's ability to make verbal associations to letters and categories.  Responses for verbal fluency will be audio recorded for data integrity.   Neurobehavioral Functioning: We will evaluate how participants’ caregivers perceive the neurobehavioral func-tioning of our participants with TBI with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe).18,19 It is a 46-item subjec-tive questionnaire that measures apathy, dis-inhibition, and executive dysfunction with a 5-point Likert scale. The FrSBe has good reliability and validity18,19 and has been used in variety of clinical populations, including brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease.20    Table 1a.

In a group therapy format (approxi-mately 5 subjects per group), ICAN will train perspective taking through role-playing and perspective-position-ing exercises.  Each of the 6 sessions will include the core exercises outlined in Table 2. See publication for more detail.21      A) Role Play Video Scenario Participants will watch video scenarios depi[INVESTIGATOR_778707] a character’s motives are ambiguous (e.g., some-one bumped into you). After watching the scenario, participants will be asked to generate possible mo-tives. In other words, produce as many potential explanations for the behavior22 After generating possible mo-tives, they will be asked to role-play the scenario assuming a positive interpretation of the motive for the ob-served behavior.  After the role-play, participants will be asked questions to process the experience and how the role play changed how they felt about the person’s actions.   B) Perspective-Positioning Personal Experiences Participants will be asked to produce personal examples of situations in which someone’s behaviors led to an unpleasant outcome for the participant, and possibly perceived by [CONTACT_778711].  After introduc-ing this scenario to the group, the participant will take part in a Perspective-positioning exercise in which partic-ipants will sit in one chair representing self-perspective (Chair A) to explore his/ her own thoughts and feelings surrounding the situation, and then move to a different Chair (Chair B) to experience the other person’s per-spective, eliciting their thoughts and feelings. After the Perspective-positioning activity, participants will be asked questions to help them process the experience and how it felt to “be” the other person and what they learned about the other person’s feelings and motives for their actions, and how that in turn changed how they felt about the situation and the person’s actions.   Procedures. This is a randomized waitlist controlled trial. We will recruit waves of approximately 6-[ADDRESS_1069993] is (N=40). For each wave, par-ticipants will be screened for eligibility. Once approximately 6-[ADDRESS_1069994] been identified, they will be invited to come back for baseline testing (Time 1). Once they complete Time 1 testing, they will be ran-domized to the ICAN group (n=3-5 / wave) or the WLC group (n=3-5/ wave).  See Figure [ADDRESS_1069995] groups occur within an approximately 2-3 week time period (and within approximately 1-2 weeks of ICAN subjects completing treatment). Time [ADDRESS_1069996]-ing/data collection. Video will not be recorded when this happens.   Prescreening (telephone script). Some people with TBI (RHI patients/ or former patients) will receive a patient recruitment letter.  These letters will be followed by a phone call (see Telephone script) to confirm receipt of the letter and inquire about their interest in the study.  Others may call us after receiving one of our recruitment materials.  We will use the telephone script to provide them with more detail about the study. The Telephone script will also serve as a Pre-screener to determine if subjects meet initial inclusion criteria in order to reduce any unnecessary burden of coming in to RHI if we can determine early on, that they will not meet inclusion cri-teria. One of those criteria is “above average aggression” based on a standardized test.  If after hearing the description of the study, participants are still interested, they will be administered an aggression questionnaire over the phone along with some inclusion / exclusion questions.  Screening/ enrollment (T0). Participants who indicate an interest in the study and provide informed consent will be screened for meeting inclusion criteria (described above). Screening may be discontinued at any point in the visit if ineli-gibility is determined before the visit is over. Order of assess-ments may vary depending on in-person versus remote ad-ministration (e.g., over the phone, video conference call) as well as eligibility criteria met at any given point throughout screening. • Injury criteria will be determined with a demographic and injury interview (later verified via medical report), which also includes a Substance abuse survey.  • Reading comprehension (inclusion): Following procedures from our past two studies23,24, we will use the Discourse Comprehension Test (DCT)25 to determine adequate comprehension. If this criterion is not met, screening will discontinue.  • Aggression (inclusion): Participants will also have to score higher than average on one of the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire subscales.  If this criterion is not met, screening will discontinue. • Depression (inclusion): Severe Depression and/or perceived risk to self or others will be evaluated. If the participant is severely depressed or a perceived risk to self or others, the participant will be pro-vided with Mental health resources, and if suicide risk, approved suicide protocol will be utilized. Addi-tionally, this person will be excluded, and screening will discontinue.     • Negative attribution and perspective taking (inclusion): Participants will be presented with two different attribution measures (Epps scenarios or AIHQ) and a perspective taking measure (IRI respective tak-ing). Since the intervention trains perspective taking for negative attribution styles, participants must have abnormal attribution or perspective taking scores on one of these measures.  • Other measures administered at the screening visit (not inclusion criteria), are indicated in Table 1 a (Screen T0) and include COWAT and Stroop Color word interference.    **Past screen failures and re-screening: Several new inclusion criteria have been added since the study start, and it is possible the changes may have altered the eligibility of earlier screened subjects. Subjects who initially failed screening will be allowed to be re-screened.  Formerly excluded subjects will be contact[CONTACT_778712].   If they are interested in being screened again, they will be re-consented (explaining they have previously been screened and failed and are now being re-tested) and re-ad-ministered all assessments as outlined in the protocol with the exception of subjects who have screen failed within 8 weeks from the new inclusion criteria. 
Fig 2.  Study Design R=Randomization; T=Time; WLC = Waitlist Control  
  Assessment Visits T1, T2, and T3.  Assessments as outlined in Tables 1 a and b (except for the CSQ8 and the Post-Treatment Qualitative Interview; see below) will be conducted by [CONTACT_753128]. For T2, the RA will be blinded to group assignment. Because T3 is only WLCs, the RA will no longer be blinded to group assignment at that point. At the end of T2, the blinded RA will complete a survey on their belief regarding group allocation.  Randomization and Stratification. Participants will be randomized to group after T1 testing by [CONTACT_778713]-cian using a random number generator. Randomization will be blocked and stratified by [CONTACT_778714]-pected gender differences in hostility bias. For each treatment wave, ~6-10 participants will be randomly as-signed to ICAN or WLC.  Once ~6-[ADDRESS_1069997] been randomized to ICAN and 20 to WLC (n=40).    Intervention Procedures and Treatment Fidelity.  Participants randomized to ICAN will start treatment after Time1. For WLC participants, their treatment will be delayed until after Time 2 data collection. ICAN will be de-livered over six sessions each lasting approximately 2 hours, once a week in a group setting (n=~5 partici-pants/ group), for [ADDRESS_1069998] (NIH Behavior Change Consortium working group on treatment fidelity;26) will be used to ensure fidelity of Theory, Provider Training, Treatment Implementation, Treatment receipt, and Treatment Enactment. Specific to Training: Facilitators will have a minimum of [ADDRESS_1069999]. Winegardner (ICAN creator; see LOS), which will involve reviewing a treatment manual and role-play of the ICAN exercises. The treatment manual will consist of a power point presentation outlining treatment procedures and activities, which will also be used to guide the treatment sessions with the subjects. Delivery. For all sessions, the power point presentation outlining treatment procedures and activities will be followed and an implementation checklist will be completed.   Satisfaction Survey (CSQ8): To encourage honest feedback and ensure blinding of RA’s, an unblinded RA will be responsible for collecting data on the CSQ-8 within approximately 1-2 weeks of completing the intervention (proximal to Time 2 for ICAN subjects and Time 3 for WLC subjects). In the case of withdrawal from treatment, the CSQ-8 may be conducted upon withdraw from treatment, if the participant is agreeable. If participants with-draw, reasons for withdraw will attempt to be collected. At the end of the CSQ-8, the participant is presented with an optional comments section regarding their feedback and thoughts about what they liked/ did not like about the program.  Post-Treatment Qualitative Interview:  To encourage honest feedback and ensure blinding of RA’s, an un-blinded RA will be responsible for administering the post-treatment Interview with the participant over the phone, via mail, email or in person within 1-2 weeks of completing treatment (proximal to Time 2 for ICAN sub-jects and Time 3 for WLC subjects).        Statistical Analysis Plan.   Primary Analyses. For Aim 1, the proportion of participants who complete at least [ADDRESS_1070000] and T1 outcomes (except CaGIC which will not have T1 data since it is only collected at T2). Effect sizes (ω2) will be calculated.  Secondary Analyses. WLC control outcomes at T2 will be compared to T1 for the ICAN and WLC group. If there are no significant differences, secondary analyses combining the data from the two treatment groups (as-sessments before and after intervention) will include ANCOVA, paired t-tests, and estimating effect sizes.   Missing Data. We will compare all baseline variables between subjects who drop out of the study to those who don’t using two-sample t tests, chi-square tests or their non-parametric equivalents as appropriate. Also, we will collect as much information regarding reasons for missing data as possible. If we find that the missing data appear to be not at random, this important information will be used in designing the larger trial. Because of the small sample size, we will not attempt to model the missing data mechanism in this study.

(Benjamin 2019 ).  A retrospective cohort study of 78,085 Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 66 years of 
age found that 20.6% of patient s with MI had at least one re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48285] 10 years 
after their index MI ( Levitan 2016 ).   
According to Patel and colleagues, a diverse array of therapeutic options is available to 
clinicians ( Patel 2018 ) and they propose that what is needed now is effective precision medicine 
strategies to enable clinicians to target patients with high residual risk with more powerful 
therapy ( Patel 2018 ).  Th e current  study is designed  to use translational research to develop 
biomarkers that may effectively guide individualized  therapy  based on the hypothesis  that 
platelet expression of FcγRIIa will identify patients at high and low risk of subsequent MI, stroke, 
and death.  Validation of platelet expression of FcγRIIa as a biomarker of residual 
cardiovascular risk will support subsequent studies designed to use platelet expression of 
FcγRIIa as a precision medicine t ool. 
Strategies to Reduce Recurrent Ischemic Events /Bleeding  
Strategies designed to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events and bleeding are predicated 
on the following assumptions:  1) The benefit -risk of a treatment should be assessed by 
[CONTACT_773189] s. 2) A treatment’s 
benefit is generally consistent across population on a relative scale.  For this reason, on an 
absolute scale, benefit is generally greater in high -risk populations. 3) A treatment’s harm is 
generally consistent across populations on an  absolute scale.  For this reason, benefit -risk is 
generally greater in a high -risk population. 4) Accordingly, a marker that identifies a high -risk 
population can enable a treatment to be used in a way that increases its benefit -risk profile.   
One strategy designed to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events is the continuation of dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT ).  Two  large multicenter randomized  trials have demonstrated that 
long-term DAPT reduces the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.  Treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(ASA) plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_773168] 5.9% with ASA monotherapy to  4.3% (p<0.001) with ASA plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] ( Mauri 
2014 ). Continued DAPT increased the risk of moderate or severe bleeding (2.5% vs. 1.6%, 
p=0.001). Treatment with ASA plus ticagrelor (60 mg twice daily) reduced the risk of 
cardiovascular events to 7.8% comp ared with 9.0% with ASA alone ( Bonaca 2015 ).  The risk of 
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI) major bleeding was higher with ticagrelor (2.3% 
with 60 mg twice daily) compared with ASA alone (1.1%).  Accordingly, the benefits of long -term 
treatment with DAPT are at least partially offset by [CONTACT_773190].  Because of this 
trade -off, the u se of DAPT long -term is limited. The promise of precision medicine is to reduce 
the overall incidence of bleeding by [CONTACT_773191], targeting pa tients with high residual 
cardiovascular risk for long -term DAPT.  
Assessment of Individual Risk of Cardiovascular Events by [CONTACT_773187] 4.1 
PRL-0001, Amendment 3.1 21 December  2022  
Confidential   13 The “Ticagrelor with or without Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_436963] -Risk Patients after PCI (TWILIGHT)” study tested 
a strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_773169] a 
reduced risk of bleeding events without an increase in ischemic e vents with ticagrelor 
monotherapy ( Mehran 2019 ).  While this strategy reduce d bleeding, it d id not provide guidance 
on which patients will derive the greatest benefit from long term treatment with more powerful 
antiplatelet therapy.  Further, because  treatment with more powerful anti -thrombotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773170] a greater incidence of bleeding, it is likely that 
monotherapy with  ticagrelor will be associated with  greater bleeding than ASA monotherapy . 
A strategy designed to limit the risk of bleeding events is the early transition from DAPT to ASA 
monotherapy.  The 6 -month versus 12 -month or longer dual antiplatelet therapy after 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (SMART -
DATE) randomized patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to either [ADDRESS_1061645] 12 months of DAPT ( Hahn 2018 ).  MI (1.8% vs 0.8%; p=0.02) and stent thrombosis 
(1.1% vs 0.7%, p=0.09) were more common in the 6 -month DAPT group.  Bleeding Academic 
Research Consortium (BARC) type 2 –5 bleeding occurred in 2.7% of the 6 -month DAPT group 
and 3.9% of the 12 -month or longer DAPT group (p=0.09). In the “Evaluation of short -term dual 
antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with a new -generation 
stent (REDUCE)” trial a composite (ischemia and bleeding) endpoint was non -inferior in 3 
months compared with 12 months of DAPT among patients with ACS ( De Luca 2019 ).  Once 
again, a tradeoff was apparent between the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis  with 
numerically fewer bleeding events (3.3% vs 4.0%, p=0.46) associated with a numerically higher 
incidence of cardiac mortality (1.8% vs 1.1%, p=0.28) and stent thrombosis (1.6% vs 0.8%, 
p=0.16) with shortened DAPT.  
The critical gap facing clinicians is demonstrated by [CONTACT_135764] 1) trials demonstrating 
that prolonged treatment with DAPT can reduce the incidence of ischemic/thrombotic events at 
the cost of bleeding; and 2) trials demonstrating that shortened D APT can reduce the incidence 
of bleeding at the cost of a greater risk of ischemic events.  Consensus guidelines recommend 
treatment with DAPT after MI and coronary stenting, however, specific guidance on the duration 
of DAPT is not possible based on avail able evidence ( Bittl 2016 ).  The guideline committee 
recommended a minimum duration with DAPT of [ADDRESS_1061646] ischemic and bleeding risk ( Yeh 
2016 ).  Registry data from Sweden (2006 to 2014) that followed 41,101 patients demonstrated 
that the score had a discrimination of 0.54 for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and 
Assessment of Individual Risk of Cardiovascular Events by [CONTACT_773187] 4.1 
PRL-0001, Amendment 3.1 21 December  2022  
Confidential   14 0.49 for fatal or major bleeding ( Ueda 2018 ).  Thus, the DAPT score supports individualization 
of therapy, however, the predictive accuracy is not sufficient to effectively guide therapy.  
Schneider et.al. applied the DAPT score to patients enrolled in a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
(Schneider 2020 ).  Patients with DAPT score ≥ 2 had  a predicted event rate of 7.6% and an 
observed event (MI, stroke, death) rate of 10.1%.  High platelet FcγRIIa expression was evident 
in 55% of patients with DAPT ≥ 2.  The combination of DAPT ≥ 2 plus high platelet FcγRIIa 
expression was associated with an event rate of 15.4% whereas the combination of DAPT ≥ 2 
plus low platelet FcγRIIa expression was associated wi th an event rate of 3.7% (p<0.05).  The 
broad distribution of platelet FcγRIIa expression in patients with both high and low clinical risk 
scores and these  study  results  suggest that platelet FcγRIIa  expression can be used to 
discriminate higher and lower risk among patients categorized as high risk by [CONTACT_773192] . 
Platelet Function Testing  
Because increased platelet reactivity has consistently identified patients at greater risk of 
subsequent cardiovascular events ( Breet 2010, Wisman 2014, Reny 2016) , large clinical trials 
were designed to determine whether platelet function testing could effectively guide antiplatelet 
therapy.   Two trials failed to demonstrate that currently available tests of platelet function can be 
used to guide treatment ( Price 2011, Collet 2012) .  Specifically, the GRAVITAS trial (Gauging 
Responsiveness with A VerifyNow  assay -Impact on Thrombosis And Safety) randomized 
patients with high platelet reactivity to standard compared with high dose clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] ( Price 
2011 ).  One proposed reason for the lack of efficacy in this study was that effective suppression 
of high platelet reactivity with high dose clopi[INVESTIGATOR_773171].  The ARCTIC trial 
(Assessment by a Double Randomization of a Conventional Antiplatelet Strategy versus a 
Monitoring -guided Strategy for Drug -Eluting Stent Implantation and of Treatment Interrupti on 
versus Continuation One Year after Stenting) addressed this concern by [CONTACT_18120] a treatment 
strategy in which platelet function testing was used to confirm suppression of high platelet 
reactivity by [CONTACT_773193] ( Collet 2012 ).  The failure of ARCTIC suggests inadequate suppression of high 
platelet reactivity was not the mechanism responsible for failure.  Thus, currently available 
platelet function tests are not capable of gui ding individualized care .  Intra -individual variability in 
platelet function over time is substantial and may be a major contributor to the failure ( Frelinger 
2013, Hochholzer 2014, Nührenberg 2015 ) as evidenced in  the ELEVATE -TIMI 56  study  where  
more than 40% of patients exhibited a greater than 20% change in platelet function over the 
course of 2 weeks ( Hochholzer 2014 ). 
Summary  
Cardiovascular disease is prevalent and recurrent cardiovascular events are a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality.  An expanding armamentarium of therapeutic options that reduce 
cardiovascular risk underscores the promise of precision medicine that effec tively tailors therapy 
to subsequent risk.  Clinical risk tools and currently available tests of platelet function are not 
sufficient to effectively guide therapy.  
 
Assessment of Individual Risk of Cardiovascular Events by [CONTACT_773187] 4.1 
PRL-0001, Amendment 3.1 21 December  2022  
Confidential   15 2.2 STUDY HYPOTHESIS  
Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is  hypothesized to be  a novel biomarker  that, when quantified, 
can be used to identify patients at high and low risk of cardiovascular events.  This hypothesis is 
based on the premise that currently available platelet function  tests are analogous to a random 
glucose measurement and that platelet expression of FcγRIIa is analogous to an HbA1C, 
reflecting platelet reactivity over a longer interval of time.  Because FcγRIIa amplifies platelet 
activation ( Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ) increased platelet expression of FcγRIIa will identify 
patients with consistently high platelet reactivity ( Serrano 2007 ).  Accordingly, high platelet 
expression of FcγRIIa leverages the clinical risk of increased platelet reactivity demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_726] 100 studies and over 22,000 patients ( Breet 2010, Wisman 2014, Reny 2016 ).  
Moreover, quantification of platelet FcγRIIa expression eliminates factors that cause variability 
with platelet function test s including the preparation of blood and the in vitro  activation of 
platelets.  The measurement of platelet expression of FcγRIIa does not require activation of 
platelets and platelet FcγRIIa does not exhibit the magnitude of intra -individual variability seen 
with platelet function tests . 
Specifically, the study hypotheses are:  
1. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa  is associated with risk of MI, stroke , and death.  
2. Incorporating platelet expression of FcγRIIa into existing risk scores improves 
identification of patients at high risk of MI, stroke, and death.  
3. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is not associated with risk of major bleeding.  
 
2.3 EVIDENCE FOR  USE  OF FCƔRIIA AS A TOOL  
FcγRIIa, a member of the Fc family, is expressed on the surface of platelets and amplifies 
platelet activation ( Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ). Because FcγRIIa  amplifies platelet activation 
(Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ), greater expression increases platelet reactivity ( Serrano 2007 ).  In a 
single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], Schneider et.al.  found that high platelet expression of FcγRIIa (≥ 
11,000/platelet) was associated with a greater risk (odds ratio > 4) of MI, stroke, and death 
(Schneider 2018 ).  Platelet expression of FcγRIIa does not require activation of platelets, is not 
affected by [CONTACT_773194],  and does not exhibit the magnitude of intra -
individual variability seen with platelet function tests ( McMahon 2019 ).  Further, c linical risk 
scores have demonstrated overlap between the risk of thrombotic/ischemic events and the risk 
of bleeding events ( Hsieh 2017 ).  Increased platelet expression of FcγRIIa was not associated 
with a greater risk of bleeding ( Schneider 2018 ) and may distinguish thrombotic risk from 
bleeding risk.    
Evidence in support of platelet expression of FcγRIIa as an effective precision tool:  
1. Platelet function tests demonstrate substantial intra -individual variability ( Frelinger 2013, 
Hochholzer 2014, Nührenberg 2015 ), with more than 40% of patients exhibiting a > 20% 
change in platelet function over the course of 2 weeks ( Hochholzer 2014 ).  Platelet FcγRIIa  
expression exhibits substantially less intra -individual variability ( McMahon 2019 ).  Platelet 
expression of FcγRIIa is determined by [CONTACT_773195] 4.1 
PRL-0001, Amendment 3.1 21 December  2022  
Confidential   16 be increased by [CONTACT_14234] γ ( Schneider 2009 ).  Thus, expression of FcγRIIa should be 
consistent throughout the life of the platelet.  Less intra -individual variability would be 
expected and has been observed (Figure 1).  Consistent with these results, Calverley and 
colleagues found an average change in platelet FcγRIIa expression of less than 10% in 248 
patients with cardiovascular disease when repeat determination s were  performed 6 -52 
weeks later ( Calverley 2002 ). 
2. Greater platelet expression of FcγRIIa  is associated with increased platelet reactivity 
because FcγRIIa amplifies platelet activation ( Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ). Unlike currently 
available tests of platelet function that measure platelet reactivity in response to a select 
agonist or group of agonists, platelet expression of FcγRIIa predicts increased platelet 
reactivity in response to a variety of agonists (Figu re 2).  
3. Because determination of platelet FcγRIIa expression entails quantification of a surface 
marker, it is less sensitive to perturbations related to assay conditions (Table 1) ( McMahon 
2019 ). Neither anticoagulants nor a P2Y [ADDRESS_1061647] alter platelet expression of FcγRIIa 
(McMahon 2019 , Table 1).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1:   Intra-individual variability in platelet expression of FcγRIIa over the course of 1 month in healthy subjects 
(n=10).  Because platelet function is known to exhibit diurnal variation, platelet expression of FcγRIIa was assessed 
in the morning and afternoon as well as after 1 week and 1 month ( McMahon 2019 ).

Patients with end stage renal disease (n=33) were stratified into [ADDRESS_1061648] and in 
response to the collagen mimetic convulxin (1 ng/ml), platelet activating factor (PAF, 1 nM), adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP 0.2 µM), or thrombin (1 nM) is shown.  High platelet expression  of FcγRIIa was associated with greater 
activation of platelets in response to each agonist ( Serrano 2007 ).

with citrate.  Duplicate  determination of platelet FcγRIIa expression in each condition  (McMahon 2019 ). 
In summary, platelet expression of FcγRIIa  is a novel biomarker that appears to identify patients 
at high and low risk of subsequent cardiovascular events ( Schneider 2018 ).  Because FcγRIIa 
amplifies the activation of platelets ( Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ) it is a marker of consistently 
increased platelet reactivity.  Thus, platelet expression of FcγRIIa leverages results from 
multiple studies demonstrating that greater platelet reactivity is associated with a greater risk of 
cardiovascular events ( Breet 2010, Wisman 2014, Reny 2016 ) with an assay not affected by 
[CONTACT_773197].  
FcγRIIa as a novel biomarker  
FcγRIIa was identified as the low ‐affinity receptor for the fragment constant (Fc) portion of 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G ( Karas 1982 ).  Binding to FcγRIIa  activates platelets. For example, 
platelets can coat an Ig ‐bound (opsonized) entity such as a bacterium via FcγRIIa and this

Confidential   18 binding triggers platelet activation and release of secondary mediators that amplify the platelet 
response to a wide range of bacteria ( Cox 2011, Arman 2014 ). In addition, platelet FcγRIIa is 
involved in heparin -induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, and the principal cellular target 
for anti -platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies is the platelet FcγRIIa receptor ( Kelton 1988, Reilly 
2001 ). FcγRIIa and glycoprotein VI are linked on human platelets, and ligands acting at either 
receptor activate dual proteol ytic regulatory pathways ( Gardiner 2008 ).  FcγRIIa markedly 
enhances thrombus formation when platelets are perfused over a collagen -coated flow chamber 
under conditions of arterial and venous shear ( Zhi 2013 ).  More recently, an additional important 
function of platelet FcγRIIa has been defined.  Phosphorylation of FcγRIIa amplifies the 
activation of platelets ( Boylan 2008, Lova 2002 ). These observations le d to assess ing platelet 
reactivity in patients with end stage renal disease because these patients wer e known to exhibit 
increased platelet expression of FcγRIIa ( El-Shahawy 2007 ).  The reactivity of platelets with 
higher and lower platelet expression of FcγRIIa was compared and found that platelets with 
more FcγRIIa exhibited greater activation in response to sub -maximal concentrations of multiple 
agonists (Figure 2, Serrano 2007 ).  Taken together, these results led to the hypothesis  that high 
platelet expression of FcγRIIa is a novel biomarker of increased platelet reactivity.  
Platelets from healthy young people carry 1, 000-4,000 molecules of FcγRIIa ( Karas 1982 ).  
Calverley and colleagues found that platelet expression of FcγRIIa was increased in patients 
with an acute coronary or cerebrovascular events as well as in patients with diabetes and 
individuals without cardiovascular events who had with two or more ca rdiac risk factors 
(Calverley 2002 ).  In addition, they found limited intra -individual variability when repeat 
determination was performed after 6 -52 (average 20) weeks ( Calverley 2002 ).  These results 
suggest that, unlike measures of platelet function that exhibit marked intra -individual variability 
(Frelinger 2013, Hochholzer 2014, Nührenberg 2015 ), platelet expression of FcγRIIa is a 
consistent marker of increased platelet reactivity.  
Flow cytometry is a powerful tool capable of assessing expression of FcγRIIa on the platelet 
surface.  Platelets are identified by [CONTACT_773198] a surface marker.  Without a 
standardized measure of fluorescence intensity, results of analyses can be  described only in 
relative terms of fluorescence intensity.  The interpretation of fluorescence intensity 
measurements can be complicated by [CONTACT_773199], 
differences in hardware (laser power, filter sets), as well  as the density of fluorochrome labeling 
of antibodies.  A goal  is to develop a clinically validated tool that can be used broadly in the care 
of patien ts, therefore  external standards  will be employed  in the current study  to enable the 
standardization of fluorescence intensity units ( Kay 2006, Quadrini 2016 ).  Accordingly, platelet 
expression of FcγRIIa  will be quantified with the use of external standards to quantify the 
number of molecules on the platelet surface rather than relative platelet expression of FcγRIIa.  
Prior study to evaluate FcγRIIa  
Schneider et.al. completed a single center prospective trial designed to determine whether 
platelet expression of FcγRIIa would discriminate cardiovascular risk ( Schneider 2018 ).  
Patients (n=197) were enrolled shortly before discharge from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164136] (both ST 
elevation and non -ST elevation were included).  Although inclusion criteria allowed patients who

Confidential   19 had been treated with PCI, coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806], or medically, all patients enrolled 
were treated with PCI.  The primary endpoint, a composite of MI, stroke, death, and coronary 
revascularization, was lower in patients with platelet expression o f FcγRIIa <11,000 (Figure 3).  
All patients were treated with ASA (81 mg) and treatment with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (~64%) and ticagrelor 
(~36%) was balanced in patients with high and low platelet expression of FcγRIIa ( Serrano 
2007 ).   
 
Figure 3:  Summary of prospective single center study  (Schneider 2018 ) 
CVA=cerebrovascular accident , MI=myocardial infarction, Revasc=revascularization  
Clinical characteristics of patients with high and low platelet expression of FcγRIIa were well 
balanced with the exception of older age, diabetes, and prior revascularization being more 
prominent in the high expression group.  Cox multivariate analysis for the combination of MI, 
stroke , revascularization, and death demonstrated a hazard ratio of 3.0 (p=0.02) for platelet 
expression of FcγRIIa >11,000 when age, diabetes, and prior revascularization were included 
as covariates.  
The incidence of revascularization was similar in patients with high and low platelet expression 
of FcγRIIa (low platelet FcγRIIa n=3, 3.2%; high platelet FcγRIIa n=4, 3.8%, p=0.815).  Patients 
with platelet expression of FcγRIIa ≥11,000 had a greater risk  of MI, stroke, and death that 
became apparent after 6 months ( Figure 4).    
Cox regression analysis was performed and platelet expression of FcγRIIa was the sole 
covariate (hazard ratio 3.9, p=0.035) associated with freedom from MI, stroke, and death.

duration of follow -up was 20 months (range 6 -29 months).  
MI=myocardial infarction  
The predictive capacity of platelet expression of FcγRIIa  was evalu ated.  The sensitivity of high 
expression to identify patients with cardiovascular events was 0.82 (95% CI 0.57 - 0.92) and the 
specificity was 0.51 (95% CI 0.43 - 0.58).  MI, stroke, and death were uncommon (8% of all 
patients) in patients who had had an MI.  The negative predictive value of low platelet 
expression of FcγRIIa was 0.97 (95% CI 0.89 - 0.98) and the positive predictive value of high 
platelet expression of FcγRII a was 0.14 (95% CI 0.10 - 0.46).  While identification of patients at 
high risk has gr eat value, the identification of patients at low risk is important to reassure 
clinicians that they can safely withhold therapy that is associated with a risk of complications.  
As is often the case for low prevalence events, the negative predictive value of platelet FcγRIIa 
expression (97% [95% CI 89% - 98%]) offers potentially important guidance to clinicians.  
A key objective of this study is to determine the optimal threshold of platelet FcγRIIa expression 
that classifies patients as high and low risk that will, in turn, be incorporated into an 
individualized score designed to predict patient risk. Assessment o f platelet FcγRIIa expression 
as a continuous variable is expected to be more predictive than as a dichotomous variable.  If 
assessment of platelet FcγRIIa expression as a dichotomous variable is nearly as predictive as 
a continuous variable , then the simp licity associated with the definition of a threshold for high 
and low risk could be preferred .   
Clinical criteria that identify patients at increased risk of thrombosis also identify an increased 
risk of bleeding ( Lindholm 2019 ).  A key feature predisposing to both thrombosis and bleeding is 
older age.  Not surprisingly, patients identified as having an increased risk of ischemic events 
also exhibit a higher risk of bleeding events ( Hsieh 2017, Lindholm 2019 ).  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
increased platelet expression of FcγRIIa was not associated with a greater risk of bleeding

Confidential   21 (Schneider 2018 ).  Further, a meta -analysis of platelet function tests demonstrated that patients 
with high platelet reactivity were at lower risk of bleeding events compared with those who 
exhibit low platelet reactivity ( Aradi 2015 ).  
In summary, preliminary results  demonstrate:  
• Increased platelet FcγRIIa  expression is associated with consistently increased platelet 
reactivity  
• With appropriate calibration platelet expression of FcγRIIa can be quantified to enable 
comparison between centers and to assess changes over time  
• Unlike platelet function tests, measurement of platelet expression of FcγRIIa is not 
substantially affected by [CONTACT_773200] , antiplatelet therapy nor anticoagulant 
therapy  
• Platelet expression of FcγRIIa ≥ 11,000/platelet identifies patients with ~4-fold greater risk of 
MI, stroke , and death  
Current Study  
Confirmation of results seen in the single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_773172] a larger multicenter 
trial to validate the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_773173]γRIIa can be used to guide individualized precision therapy and improve outcomes.  Results 
from the current study will determine the prognostic implications of platelet FcγRIIa expression 
as well as the optimal manner in which to use  platelet FcγRIIa  expression.  The analysis plan 
will include assessment of platelet FcγRIIa expression as a continuous variable as well as a 
sensitivity analysis designed to determine whether FcγRIIa ≥ 11,000/platelet is the optimal 
threshold for discrimination of risk.   In addition, it will it provide key preliminary evidence 
regarding prognostic implications of platelet FcγRIIa expression associated with anti -thrombotic 
regimens and support plans for a subsequent clinical trial designed to use platelet FcγRIIa 
expression  as a precision tool.  
To identify subjects at greater risk of events , subjects will be enrolled who have an increased 
risk of cardiovascular events based on results from the SWEDEHEART registry that analyzed 
100,879 patients ( Lindholm 2019 ).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773174] ≥ 2 of the following risk 
factors; age ≥ 65, prior MI, diabetes mellitus, multivessel coronary artery disease (two or more 
vessels or left main with a stenosis ≥50% at coronary angiography) and chronic kidney disease 
(an estimated glomerular filtration rate bel ow 60 m l/min/1.73 m2) will be enrolled in the current 
study . In the SWEDEHEART registry, patients with ≥ 2 risk factors comprised 47% of patients 
and their risk of death, MI and stroke was 9.7/100 patient years.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 55% of 
subjects with increased risk based on clinical risk scores exhibit ed platelet expression of 
FcγRIIa ≥11, 000 ( Schneider 2020 ).  In the current study. enrollment of s ubjects receiving 
treatment with anticoagulant therapy ( i.e., for treatment of atrial fibrillation , venous 
thromboembolism ) will be limited to approximately 100 subjects.  Subjects  with non -
cardiovascular conditions expected to limit survival to less than 2 years  will be excluded  in the 
current study . 
Because high platelet expression of FcγRIIa increases platelet reactivity ( Boylan 2008, Lova 
2002 ), it is anticipate d that despi[INVESTIGATOR_773175]γRIIa

laboratory.   At clinical sites, citrate anticoagulated blood will be add ed to fixative tubes.  These

4.3 SUBSTUDY  
 
Platelet function tests exhibit substantial intra -individual variability when measures are repeated 
2 to 6 weeks after initial testing (Frelinger 2013, Hochholzer 2014, Nührenberg 2015 ).  Results 
from a study in healthy subjects suggest that Fc ɣRIIa will vary by <10% over the course of 2  to 
6 weeks (McMahon 2019).   
 
The objective of the substudy is to demonstrate that the FcγRIIa  assay provides a consistent 
measure of platelet expression of FcγRIIa  by [CONTACT_35755] a second blood sample after study 
enrollment and the first/baseline blood sample is taken.   The substudy endpoint is the

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
This is an observational non -interventional study, therefore there is no evaluation of efficacy  or 
safety .  Blood will be taken prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773179]  (see 
separate Laboratory Sample Manual for details on sample collection, storage , and shipment to a 
core lab oratory)  and will used to quantify FcγRIIa .  Blood can be taken  up to [ADDRESS_1061663] of care.  Subjects will be followed throughout the duration of the study to 
assess for study endpoints including MI, stroke, death , and bleeding events (BARC type 2-5).   
Subjects who experience an endpoint event will continue to be followed throughout the entire 
study and any subsequent events will also be confirmed  and recorded . 
  
8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Because this in a non -interventional study and only phlebotomy, a commonly performed  
procedure , will be performed , an a dverse event  for this study  is defined as  any untoward 
Assessment of Individual Risk of Cardiovascular Events by [CONTACT_773187] 4.1 
PRL-0001, Amendment 3.1 21 December  2022  
Confidential   27 medical occurrence associated wit h venipuncture.  Given the routine nature of phlebotomy, only 
those  AEs that meet the criteria for serious will be required to be reported and  followed to 
resolution or until considered stable.    
For this study, stroke, MI, death , and bleeding events will be reported as endpoint  events  and 
will not be considered or reported as adverse events.  
 
8.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An AE is considered "serious" if  it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869], a 
persistent or significant incapacity or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967] , based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
For this study, only SAEs related to phlebotomy  will be reported.  
 
8.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
The following definitions  will be used to describe severity  of an SAE :  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s 
daily activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern. Moderate events 
may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject’ s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y PROCEDURE  
 
All SAEs  related to phlebotomy must have their relationship to this procedure  assessed by [CONTACT_773205].  
 
• Related  – The event  is known to occur with the study procedure , there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study procedure  caused the SAE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study procedure and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study procedure  and the SAE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study  procedure  caused the 
event, there is no temporal relationship between the study procedure  and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established.

All SAEs will be captured  in the  CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, 
investigator’s  assessment of severity, relationship to study pro cedure,  and 
resolution/stabilization date. All SAEs will be followed to resolution or until considered stable . 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1061664] experiences  a Suspected  Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) due to venipuncture, the sponsor must notify  the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA) and all participating investigators of this safety report , as soon as possible, 
but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1061665] also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal 
or life -threatening suspected adverse reacti on as soon as possible but in no case later tha n 7 
calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  
8.2.6  DATA SAFETY MONITORING  
Because of the limited risk of this non -interventional trial, data safety and monitoring will be 
managed without a formal data safety and monitoring committee.  Investigators at each site will 
report SAEs  related to study p rocedures (only phlebotomy) to the sponsor.   The sponsor will 
bring SAEs to the  attention of the co-principal investigators, [CONTACT_234088] and [CONTACT_682386]  
(see Section 10.5) .  Drs. Schneider and Harrington will be primarily responsible for the oversight 
of data and safety.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Specifically, the study hypotheses are : 
1. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is associated with risk of MI, stroke, and death.  
2. Incorporating p latelet expression of FcγRIIa into existing risk scores improves 
identification of patients at high risk of MI, stroke, and death.  
3. Platelet expression of FcγRIIa is not associated with risk of major bleeding . 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1061666]  occur red. Under the guideline from Steyerberg of 10 events required per 
predictor  (Steyerberg 2019 ), this  sample size will allow a model with FcγRIIa and up to seven 
additional predictors  to be built .   Preliminary results (Schneider 2018 ) suggest that a [ADDRESS_1061667] 95% power to detect a 2 -fold greater incidence of 
cardiovascular endpoints (MI, stroke, and death) with a two -sided α<0.01 assuming 8% of 
subjects experience the endpoint.  With the planned sample size of [ADDRESS_1061668] ratio  (HR)  of 
1.9 with a p=0.04 (lower bound of the 95% CI of 1.2)  can be detected . For the secondary 
endpoint , there will be  95% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_1061669] s with high compared with low FcγRIIa expression when assuming a two -sided α=0.05 
and 5% of subjects experience bleeding in the  low FcγRIIa expression group.  
9.3 POPULATION FOR ANALYSES  
All enrolled subjects who are eligible based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in 
the population for analysis.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
The planned statistical analyses will be  included  in a study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1061670]  demographics and medi cal history collected at baseline. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041] , it was 
observed that older age, diabetes mellitus, and prior revascularization were associated with 
higher platelet FcγRIIa expression.  
A set of sensitivity analyses will evaluate FcγRIIa as a binary endpoint, which each analysis 
using a different threshold for classifying FcγRIIa as high or low. In particular, these analyses 
will explore whether a binary or a continuous measure of FcγRIIa  provides greater predictive 
value, and whether or not a threshold of ≥ 11,000/platelet is optimal.   
9.4.[ADDRESS_1061671] Secondary Objective :  Negative predictive value, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and 
specificity will be calculated. Prediction will be performed using a Cox regression model with the 
following predictors: platelet expression of FcγRIIa, sex, age, MVD, CKD, DM, and prior MI. 
Evaluation of the model’s error rates will be based on a leave -one-out cross -validation 
approach. Additional models will evaluate the performance of the predictive model using a 
continuous measure of FcγRIIa with the performance of predictive mode ls using various binary 
measures of FcγRIIa . 
Second  Secondary Objective :  The adjusted Cox proportional hazards model described for the 
primary objective  analysis  will be used to compare the bleeding risk  as a function of FcγRIIa  
expression, both as a continuous and as a binary variable . 
Assessment of Individual Risk of Cardiovascular Events by [CONTACT_773187] 4.[ADDRESS_1061672] the IRB’s 
written approval for the protocol and the written informed consent form(s) and any other written 
information to be provided to the subjects.  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the  subject’s  agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the subject’s  study participation. The subject  will be asked to 
read and review the informed consent document. The investigator will explain the study to the 
subject  and answer any questions .  The subject  should have the opportunity to discuss the 
study with their family or surrogates or think  about it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject 
will sign the informed consent documen t prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study. Subjects must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from 
the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given 
to the subject . The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source 
document (including the date), and the form signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -
specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the subjects  will be protected by [CONTACT_638134].  
10.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended  or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_773206] s, study subjects  and regulatory 
authorities.   The study may  resume if the cause of the temporary suspension has been 
sufficiently addressed to  satisfy the sponsor, IRB and/or regulatory authorities .

their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their representatives . This confidentiality is extended to cover 
testing of blood samples in addition to the subject’s clinical information.  Therefore, the study 
protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
The sponsor , other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records 
required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records 
(office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). The clinical study site will permit access to such records  upon 
request . 
The subject’s  contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional po licies, or sponsor 
requirements.  
Study subject  research data will be used for statistical analysis and scientific reporting, however 
this will not include the subject’s  contact [CONTACT_773207]. Individual subjects  
and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number.  
After informed consent is obtained, each subject  will be assigned a unique identifier.  Clinical 
characteristics and biochemical results will be associated with the unique identifier. The 
association between the subject  identity and the unique identifier will be kept in a secure file.  
Access to that information will be restricted to study personnel obtaining the information from 
the subject and key study personnel.  Blood and derived specimen s will be labeled with the 
unique identifier only.   
Additionally, all study sites operate in full compliance with  Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act  (HIPAA ) regulations.  
10.4  USE OF BLOOD  SAMPLES  
Blood samples taken for this study will be prepared, labeled,  and shipped to the central 
laboratory for testing  (see separate Laboratory Sample Manual f or details).  Blood, derived 
specimens,  and biochemical results will be labeled  and associated with the unique identifier 
only.  Blood and derived specimens will be consumed during the assay process and any 
remaining samples will be appropriately destroyed at the end of the study. Samples will be 
assayed a t a core laboratory and only study personnel will have access to the samples.  After all 
assays have been completed and results confirmed, any remaining sample will be destroyed in 
accordance with the institutional biohazard disposal process. Samples  will not be stored for use 
or testing beyond that described for this study.  During the conduct of the study, an individual 
subject can choose to withdraw consent to have their blood sample tested, however, withdra wal 
of consent may not be possible after the sample has been tested.

12 APPENDIX  1 – STUDY ENDPOINT  EVENT DEFINITIONS  
Definition for  Acute Myocardial Infarction (types 1, 2 and 3 MI) [Thygesen 2018]  
The term acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical 
evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least 
[ADDRESS_1061692] 1 of the following:  
• Symptoms of myocardial ischemia;  
• New ischemic ECG changes;  
• Development of pathological Q waves;  
• Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a 
pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology;  
• Identification of a coronary thrombus by [CONTACT_381465] (not for types 2 or 3 MIs).  
Postmortem demonstration of acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted 
myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI. Evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply 
and demand unrelated to acute atherothrombosis meets criteria for ty pe 2 MI. Cardiac death in patients 
with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes before cTn 
values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI.  
 
Definition  for Stroke  [Sacco 2013]  
The term stroke should be used when there is f ocal ischemia within the perfusion territory of an artery 
that is stenosed or occluded, and cell death is localized to this region. In focal cerebral ischemia, cell 
death is maximal in the ischemic focus and may extend to the penumbra, with all cellular el ements 
including both neurons and supportive cells affected. Clinical evidence of stroke includes both of  the 
following:  
• Symptoms of focal  ischemia  (e.g., unilateral weakness of an arm or leg) and   
• Imaging evidence (CT or MRI) of CNS infarction

Confidential   39 Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC)  Definition for Bleeding  [Mehran 2011]  
Type 0 : no bleeding  
Type 1 : bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled 
performance of studies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or treatment by a healthcare professional; may include 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_15664] -discontinuation of medical therapy by [CONTACT_15743] a 
healthcare professional  
Type 2 : any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (eg, more bleeding than would be expected for 
a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) that does not fit the criteria for 
type 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_1061693] one of the following crit eria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, 
medical intervention by a healthcare professional, (2) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389044], or (3) prompting evaluation  
Type 3 : 
Type 3a : 
Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to <5 g/dL * (provided hemoglobin drop is 
related to bleed)  
Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
Type 3b : 
Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥5 g/dL * (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
Cardiac tamponade  
Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding 
dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
Type 3 c: 
Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic transformation, 
does include intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304])  
Subcategories confirmed by [CONTACT_773210] 4: CABG -related bleeding  
Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h  
Reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling bleeding    
Transfusion of ≥5 U whole blood or packed red blood cells within a 48 -h period † 
Chest tube output ≥2L within a 24 -h period

Confidential   40 Type 5: fatal bleeding  
Type 5a: 
Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation but clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_195751] 5b: 
Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging confirmation  
 
Note:  CABG indicates coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]. Platelet transfusions should be recorded and reported but are 
not included in these definitions until further information is obtained about the relationship to outcomes. If a 
CABG -related bleed is not adjudicated as at least a type 3 severity event, it will be classified as not a bleeding 
event. If a bleeding event occurs with a clear temporal relationship to CABG (ie, within a 48 -h time frame) but does 
not meet type 4 severity  criteria, it will be classified as not a bleeding event.  
*Corrected for transfusion (1 U packed red blood cells or 1 U whole blood=1 g/dL hemoglobin).  
†Cell saver products are not counted.

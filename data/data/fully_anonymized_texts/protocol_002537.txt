TP258 Ver . 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_157473] system causing restriction in normal airflow into 
the nasal cavity.  This nasal condition can be caused by a diversity of mucosal and structural 
disorders  in the nasal cavity.  Nasal diseases such as acute  and/or chronic  rhinosinusitis  can cause 
nasal polyps, turbinate hypertrophy and other soft tissue responses.  S tructural anomalies such as 
severe septal deviation, nasal valve angle changes or nasal valve collapse are among the 
dysfunction s that are common cause s of nasal obstruction  (Udaka, Suzuki et al. 2006, Wittkopf, 
Wittkopf et al. 2008, Chandra, Patadia et al. 2009, Fras er and Kelly 2009) .  
 
Chronic nasal obstruction can elicit  many  symptoms, including congestion, stuffiness, headache, 
fatigue, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], snoring  and a decline in health -related quality of life 
(QOL)  (Rhee, Book et al. 2003) .  In recent years, there has been gro wing awareness that nasal 
obstruction may impair various daily and social activities  (Udaka, Suzuki et al. 2006)  and result in a 
degradation of the patient’s overall quality of life  (Rhee, Weaver et al. 2010) .  
 
2.2 Nasal Anatomy  
The nose is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_138500] a prominent airflow regulatory role.  Air enters the nasal 
cavity, where it is  warmed to a temperature of ap proximately 31 °C to 34 °C, regardless of outside 
temperature.  The nose  also humidifies the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138501]  a relative humid ity of 90% to 95%  
(Behrbohm 2004) .  These func tions prevent drying  of the distal airways, which allows optimal gas 
exchange, and helps maintain healthy body temperature.  
 
The nasal anatomy is illustrated in Figure 1.  The nasal valve area (V) represents the narrowest 
segment of the nasal airway.   It is defined as the area bounded by [CONTACT_138527] r lateral 
cartilage (ULC), cartilagi nous nasal  septum  (S) and head of the inferior turbinate  (T) (Cole 2003, 
Wexler and Davidson 2004, Weaver 2012) .  The nasal valve, which is a por tion of the nasal valve 
area, is the area of highest airway resistance  in the nasal passage .  A decrease in the cross -section 
of this area leads to restriction of airflow and can cause nasal obstruction symptoms.

TP258 Ver . 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_157474] shown that this angle classically ranges between 10° and 15° in the nose 
of Caucasian  individuals.  One of the most common causes of nasal obstruction is internal nasal 
valve dysfunction wher ein the upper lateral cartilage moves towards the septum, increasing airway 
resistance  upon inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (Cole 2003, Wexler and Davidson 2004) .  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_157475] -line treatment 
may be o ver-the-counter remedies such as  nasal dilator sprays, humidifiers and/or external nasal 
dilator strips  (e.g., “Breathe Right” nasal strips)  which temporarily expand the sidewalls of the nose 
at the level of the nasal valve.  As these temporary solutions f ail to resolve chronic nasal airway 
obstruction , patients may then seek  professional diagnosis from an otorhinolaryngology ( ENT) 
specialist.  
   
The physician will typi[INVESTIGATOR_138502] a  history of nasal obstruction symptoms and assessment of nasal 
pathology t o rule  out concomitant causes of nasal obstruction and to understand prior 
otorhinolaryngologic  treatment and surgical history.  Common causes of chronic decreased airway 
flow can be a response from  year-round allergic and non -allergic triggers , chronic sinusitis and /or 
abnormal nasal pathology  such as severe deviated septum, enlarged inferio r turbinates, nasal 
polyps, etc.  As each of these factors is ruled out  and the nasal valve angle is determined to be the 
likely cause of nasal obstruction symptoms , conservative measures are discussed prior to surgical 
treatment  (Jessen and Malm 1997) .

obstruction .  This maneuver temporarily enlarges the radius of the nasal valve area increas ing nasal 
airflow as the  nasal valve area  is manually widened.  A positive response can be an indicator that 
patients will respond well to a nasal valve angle increase  (Kern and Wang 1993) . 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_157477] the potential benefit of surgical nasal valve correction  
(Constantinides, Adamson et al. 1996) .  The procedure is performed both before and after 
decongestion to determine the effect of mucosal swelling in sympto mato logy. 
 
3.3 Subjective Assessment  
A validated disease -specific health status instrument may be used by [CONTACT_138528].  One well -known and recognized tool is th e Nasal 
Obstruction S ymptom  Evaluation (NOSE ) Scale, which  is a validated 5 -item instrument using a 5 -
point Likert Scale  (Stewart, Witsell et al. 2004) .  This outcome assessment has been used to measure 
improvements in quality of life ( QOL ) following  septoplasty, functional septorhinoplasty and nasal 
valve surgery  (Dolan 2010, Chambers, Horstkotte et al. 2015, Yeung, Hassouneh et al. 2015, 
Camacho, Zaghi et al. 2016) .   
 
3.4 Current Treatments  
Nasal Valve Dilators  
Multiple devices available on the market are designe d to increase the size of the nasal passage at 
the nasal valve area.  These products target people with poor nasal breathing, snoring difficulties or 
increased nasal breathing demands (e.g., athletes ).  Adhesive external nasal dilator strips are applied 
to the skin of t he nose by [CONTACT_138529].  Flexible poly ester springs within the strip recoil outward  from the bent position.  
Because the strip is firmly adhere d to the skin, the recoil gen erates a force on the external nasal 
valve causing it to open.  These devices have been  found to dilate the nasal airway significantly 
there by [CONTACT_138530] , and stiffen ed the lateral nasal wall preventing inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138503]  
(Kirkness, Wheatley et al. 2000, Peltonen, Vento et al. 2004) .  
 
Roith mann and Chapnik  (Roithmann, Chapnik et al. 1998)  found that [ADDRESS_157478], exert ing a lateral force on the internal nasal valve, thereby [CONTACT_138531]. 
Although it is not as well tolerated, increased nas al patency and decreased resis tance similar to (and 
occasionally better than) the external adhesive strips have been found  (Ellegard 2006) .  While 
effective, nasal valve dilating devices require significant patient compliance.  
 
Surgical Therapy  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_138504], spreader grafts, and splay grafts, all involving 
implantation of a cartilage graft (typi[INVESTIGATOR_138505]) or a biocompatible 
material (Khosh, Jen et al. 2004, Fischer and Gubisch 2006, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_23061], White et al. 2009) .  Suturing 
techniques (suspension sutures, flaring sutures) are also used alone or in conjunction with grafts.  
Surgical procedure s are efficacious, but can be associated with long recovery periods and

 complications such as intranasal adhesions, scarring, infection, and graft migration, resorption or 
extrusion (Rhee, Arganbright et al. 2008, Sufyan, Ziebarth et al. 2012, Cheng, Atfeh et al. 2014) .   
 
 
4.0 CURRENT USE OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY IN THE NOSE   
Radiofrequency energy has been used for decades in the fields of otorhino laryngology , neurosurgery , 
cardiology, urology and general surgery.  
 
ENT surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy daily in numerous nasal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Radiofrequency 
turbinate reduction (RFTR) , for instance,  is a minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue 
volume in a precise, targeted manner.  This technique uses radiofrequency energy to create heat within the 
submucosal tissue of the turbinate, reducing tissue volume with minimal  impa ct on surrounding tissues  
(Coste, Yona et al. 2001) .  Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differs fundamentally from traditional surgical 
methods by [CONTACT_138532] -power radiofrequency energy to provid e a relatively quick and painless procedure 
for tissue coagulation  and/or ablation .  
 
There have been multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of using radiofrequency energy in the 
RFTR  procedure .  In 2009, Hytonen,  et al. (Hytonen, Back et al. 20 09) completed a systematic literature 
revie w of the RFTR technique and concluded that the technique is well tolerated and effective.  
 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency tissue therapy in the nasal passage can be safe 
and effective in improving nasal obstruction and in preserving  nasal function  (Sapci, Sahin et al. 2003) .  
Kezirian  (Kezirian, Powell et al. 2005)  reported 1 minor complication of crusting in 89  adult patients treated 
with radiofrequency ablation  of the turbinates.  The same  authors also reported no moderate or major 
complications after RF turbinate reduction based on  a review of  published literature results .  
 
 
5.0 STUDY RATIONALE  
Aerin Medical has identified a patient population whose nasal obstruction is primarily due to internal nasal 
valve dysfunction, rather than hypertrophied turbinates.  A weakened upper lateral cartilage (ULC) can 
collapse or protrude into the nasal airway, causing restriction of airflow through the nasal valve area.  Figure 
[ADDRESS_157479].  
 
 
Figure 3.  Internal Nasal Valve Dysfunction  
(from Stupak 2011, Figure 3A)  
It is known that a small change in nasal airway diameter can result in significant changes in airflow; this has 
been well -described by [CONTACT_138533]’s law (Bloching 2007) .  Thus, even a slight

 narrowing or collapse of the ULC (as illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4) can result in symptoms of nasal 
obstruction.  Since c urrent non-surgical treatments, such as adhesive external nasal dilator strips and nasal 
alar dilators, provide relief only while the dev ice is being used , and surgical treatments are not likely to be 
considered by [CONTACT_138534]/or they desire cosmetic revision as well (Dolan 
2010) , there is an unmet need for a non -surgical method of strengthening, shapi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or supporting an 
incomp etent ULC.   
 
Several researchers have shown through in vitro  testing that radiofrequency heating can be used to reshape 
cartilage (Keefe, Rasouli et al. 2003, Manuel, Foulad et al. 2010, Zemek, Protsenko et al. 2012) .  Targeted 
radiofrequency heating of the lateral cartilaginous nasal wall, with the intent of causing tissue retraction and 
volume reduction, has also been used in patients  with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138506] (Seren 2009) .   
 
Aerin Medical believes the Vivaer  Stylus can be used to apply lateral pressure to a weakened ULC, 
repositioning the tissue while heating it and thereby [CONTACT_138535] (see Figure 5).  Contraction 
of the treated area during the healing process would serve to curve the treated portion of the ULC, creating 
a wider nasal airway and a stiffer nasal valve wall ( Figure 6).

6.0 SUMMARY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The Aerin Medical Vivaer ™ System is an investigational device intended to improve nasal breathing by 
[CONTACT_138536] .  The System is comprised of the Vivaer  Stylus (Figure 7) which 
is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue , and a 
radiofrequency generator, Smith and Nephew  ORA -50 S,  a FDA cleared generator (K9904 74) with 
temperature control capable of delivering very low doses of energy  (Figure 8).  The O RA-50 S generator's 
technical specifications comply with those required by [CONTACT_138537]'s Product Specification PS010.  
 
The Vivaer  Stylus consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip.  An array of bipolar electrodes is positioned 
on a non -conductive tip which is attached to a handle via a non -conductive shaft.  A temperature sensor is 
located on the tip to monitor tissue temperature .  The Stylus is attached to a temperature -controlled 
radiofrequency generator  via a flexible cable.   The Vivaer ™ Stylus modifies the soft tissues of the nasal 
airway through the use of low doses of radiofrequency energy.  The low -power radiofrequency gene rates

 heat within the submucosal tissue, creating a coagulation lesion.  As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts 
and stiffens.  This decreases the nasal airflow resistance thereby [CONTACT_138538].  
 
The Vivaer  Stylus tip is temporarily inserted into the nose to access the treated area.  The procedure 
requires local anesthesia only.   The stylus  is manufactured and supplied by [CONTACT_138539].

 7.0 CLINICAL STUDY DESIGN  AND ENROLLMENT  
7.1 Study Design  and Objectives  
This study is a prospective, multi -center, non -randomized, single arm, non-significant risk device 
evaluation of the Aerin Medical Vivaer  Stylus.  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the Vivaer System for treating  the nasal valve area to improve symptoms in 
those diagnose d with nasal airway obstruction, to support the following proposed indication for use:  
The Vivaer Stylus is indicated for the treatment of nasal obstruction by [CONTACT_138540] . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_157480] Population  
The population being targeted for this therapy consists of patients who exhibit significant symptoms 
of nasal obstruction attributed to internal nasal valve dysfunction.  To evaluat e the significance of a 
patient’s nasal obstruction  both before and after the investigational procedure , this study will use a 
subjective measure, the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale.  No objective 
measures will be used , as the published literature reports poor correlation between objective 
measures of nasal patency (e.g., nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138507], acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry, 
CT scans, physician assessment of anatomy) and subjective measures (Stewa rt and Smith 2005, 
Lam, James et al. 2006, Andre, Vuyk et al. 2009, Dadgarnia, Baradaranfar et al. 2013, Andrews, 
Choudhury et al. 2015) .  Since patient symptoms and perception of condition  are the factors leading 
an individual to seek treatment , patient -reported subjecti ve measures are cited as the most important 
determinates of treatment outcome  (Stewart and Smith 2005, Lam, James et al. 2006, Rhee, Weaver 
et al. 2010) .   
 
Aerin Medical has chosen a baseline NOSE  score inclusion criterion of  [ADDRESS_157481] 
(Lipan and Most 2013)  which classifies a NOSE score of  [ADDRESS_157482] 
obstruction (Rhee, Sullivan et al. 2014) .   
 
It is anticipated  that many patients will have already undergone rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior 
turbinate reduction or other surgical procedures prior to being approached for participation in this 
study.   Therefore, a history of those types of procedures does not exclu de a patient from enrolling in 
this trial.  However, to ensure that changes in NOSE score over the course of follow -up are the result 
of the investigational procedure, prior surgical procedures must have been performed at least [ADDRESS_157483]’s eligibility for enrollment must be discussed with the 
Sponsor prior to scheduling the subject for the investiga tional procedure.  
 
An estimated 45 treated subjects who complete the 26 -week follow -up will be necessary to fulfill the 
primary endpoint data analysis.  To allow for up to 10% attrition over the course of the study, a total 
of [ADDRESS_157484] meet all  of the following 
criteria:  
1. Age 2 2 to 75 years (inclusively)  
2. Willing and able to provide informed consent  
3. Willing and able to comply with the subject -specific requirements outlined in the study 
protocol  
4. Seeking treatment for nasal obstruction and willing to undergo an office -based procedure  
5. NOSE score of ≥ [ADDRESS_157485]'s nasal  obstruction as 
determined by [CONTACT_1704] (based on clinical presentation, physical examination, 
nasal endoscopy, etc.) and the subject has a positive response to any of the following 
temporary measures (based on patient history or office exam):  
 Use of external nasal dilator strips (e.g., Breathe Right Strips ) 
 Q-Tip test (manual intranasal lateralization)  
 Use of nasal stents  
 Cottle Maneuver (manual lateral retraction of the cheek)  
7.4 Exclusion Criteria  
A patient who meets any  of the following criter ia is not eligible  to participate in the study:  
1. Prior surgical treatment of the nasal valve  
2. Rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical nasal procedures 
within the past twelve (12) months  
3. Severe and/or c hronic sinusitis, recurrent sinusitis, or allergies leading to nasal obstruction  
and currently requiring oral corticosteroid  therapy  
4. Severe case of any of the following; septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps, or ptotic 
nose tip believed to be  the primary contributor to the subject’s nasal  obstruction  symptoms 
and warranting surgical intervention  
5. Known or suspected allergies or contraindications to the  anesthetic agents and/or antibiotic 
medications  to be used  during the study procedure session  
6. Known or sus pected to be pregnant, or is lactating

 8.0 STUDY PHASES  
The study will be conducted in four  phases  as subjects are consented, evaluated for eligibility, treated and 
followed until study exit :  
 
Phase 1 - Pre-Screen / Informed Consent  Process  
Phase 2 - Screening  / Baseline E valuation  
Phase 3 - Enrollment / Study Procedure  
Phase 4 - Follow -up / Study Exit 
 
 
 
 
 
The different study phases are described in Sections  8.1 through 8.4.  Section 8.5 provides a table of 
required study visits, the visit windows, and the assessments to be done at each visit , as well as a 
description of each assessment type .   
 
8.1 Phase  1:  Pre-Screen  and Informed  Consent  Process  
Patients presenting with symptoms associated with nasal airway obstruction will be approached with 
the study and asked if they are willing to volunteer participation.  Patients will initially be asked about 
duration of symptoms and conservative measures us ed for their condition.  Any known concomitant 
nasal conditions and past nasal surgeries will be discussed to understand if they are potential 
candidates for the study.   
Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guidance (ICH, April 1996).  
 
A research study member at the approved stud y site will speak with the  study candidate about the 
purpose of the study and investigational research.  Explanation of the study background,  study 
procedure , follow up visit schedule, study procedure risks and benefits will be reviewed in detail with 
the patient.  Patients will be given the time they need to read through the study information and 
informed consent document and ask as many quest ions as necessary to make them comfortable with 
the study and the requirements.  For those potential candidates  who agree to participate in the study 
by [CONTACT_138541] (ICF) , a baseline evaluation will be conducted.   
 
8.2 Phase  2:  Screening and Baseline  Evaluation  
During the screening/baseline visit in the study clinic , the Investigator  or designated research staff  
will perform a  formal  evaluation of the study candidate  for study eligibility , which will include a  history 
and ph ysical examination of the nasal area, review of overall medical history, understanding of 
general health and discussion of any conservative measures used for nasal airway obstruction .

 The following data will be collected:  
 Patient demographics  
 Medical history including prior tests and treatments for nasal airway obstruction  
 Physical exam and vital signs  
 NOSE questionnaire  (completed by [CONTACT_423])  
 Investigator visual assessment (using an endoscope) of nasal valve area  to be treated  
 
Subjects who agree to participate and meet the enrollment criteria must be scheduled to undergo the 
study  procedure  within 30 days  of the baseline visit.   
8.3 Phase  3:  Enrollment and Study Procedure  
Study subjects will be considered enrolled once they arrive at the study clinic to undergo the 
investigational procedure .  At this time a study subject identification number will assigned along with 
the study subject binder.  The investigational procedure will be performed  in the study clinic.  Subjects 
will have both  nasal valves treated in a single study procedure  session.  Each nostril will be treated 
at up to 3 non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_138509].   
 
       Treatment settings to be used are: 
Temperature  ...............  60C 
Power  ......................  4 Watts  
Treatment Time  ...... 18 secs  
Cooling Time  ...........  12 secs  
 
No repeat ("touch -up") procedures will be permitted dur ing the 26-week  follow -up period.  Follow -up 
visit dates will be calculated from the study  procedure date .  Follow -up visits should be scheduled 
within the specified visit windows described in  Table 1. 
 
Immediate Post -Procedure Care (prior to leaving the clinic)  
Subjects will be asked to mark a vertical line on a 10 cm VAS scale to represent the pain level 
experienced on the Left Side and a separate VAS for pain experienced on the Right Side during the 
study procedure session.  The score will include the overall pain experience from anesthesia delivery 
to procedure  completion .  
 
At the discretion of the physician, the following care may be provided : 
 Apply compression to the treatment area with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], internally for 5 
minutes.  
 Apply petroleum jelly to the treatment area  as needed .  
 The patient  should be instructed not to manipulate the treatment site for 24 hours with the 
exception of any necessary hemostasis .     
 
Study subjects will be reminded of their next follow -up visit and will be scheduled within the study 
window.

8.5 Types of Assessments  
Table 1 outlines the assess ments to be performed at each required visit, and specifies  the required 
visit windows.   
 
The following assessments will be obtained from the study subjects at the specified  study follow -up 
visits:  
 
Visual A ssessment of Treatment Area  – The target nasal valve area within each nostril will be 
visually assessed at  baseline and following the treatment procedure at the time points  describ ed 
in Table 1.  The use of an endoscope for visual assessment is required.  For consistency in 
reporting across sites, a study CRF will outline specific observations to be assessed.  In addition, 
represent ative still photographs of each nostril will be captured at each visit.  
 
Nasal Obstruction Severity Evaluation  (NOSE) Scale  – The NOSE Scale is a validated disease -
specific health status instrument to measure the outcome of subjects treated for nasal 
obstruction.  This outcome assessment has been used to measure improvements in QOL in 
septoplasty, functional septorhinoplasty and nasal valve surgery  (Rhee, Weaver et al. 2010) . The 
NOSE Scale  will be utilized to evaluate the severity of the subject’s nasal obstruction at baseline 
and follow -up time  points.   
 
Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) for Pain Intensity  – The Pain VAS will be used to rate pain associated 
with the treatment  (Hawker, Mian et al. 2011) .  Subjects will be asked to mark the ir pain level on 
a 10 cm line anchored by [CONTACT_61522] : 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable.  The 
study staff will measure with a metric ruler from the 0, the beginning of the line , to the vertical 
mark made by [CONTACT_423].  The result, expressed in millimeters,  will represent the subject ’s VAS 
Pain Score .    
 
Adverse Event Evaluation  – Subjects will be asked about possible side effects or adverse 
experiences  related to the study procedure . All events will be documented on the proper Adverse 
Event Log and Adverse Event Case Report Form.  Anticipated observations related to the study 
procedure will be tabulated, but will not be categorized as adverse events unless they require

anticipated.   Refer to Table 2 for a listing of anticipated observations as well as anticipated 
frequency, severity and duration.  
 
Medications  – Updates to current medications or any new or changed medications will be 
requested at each follow -up visit.  The medication log will be updated to reflect any changes .  In 
addition , any medications required as a result of intervention related to the study procedure will 
be documented and will correlate with the Adverse Event Case Report Form.

Subjects may be reimbursed for their time and travel and any expenses associated with each study visit , 
as allowed by [CONTACT_138546] .  Subjects will not be reimbursed for those scheduled study visits that they 
do not attend.   
 
 
10.0 STUDY WITHDRAWAL  
Subjects may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 Voluntary withdrawal – meaning that the subject voluntarily chooses not to further participate in the 
study  
 *Lost to follow -up – meaning that the subject is more than one month late  (beyond the late visit 
window)  to a study visit and [ADDRESS_157488] to 
follow -up. 
 *In the physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue study participation.  
 Subject death .   
 
*Where possible, subjects will be followed for safety to study completion.  Safety follow -up will include a 
review of adverse events (AEs).  A safety follow -up assessment may be performed either via a phone or 
email contact [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a physician visit.   
 
Any stu dy subject who does not attend a scheduled follow -up visit should be contact[CONTACT_138547](s).  The reason for the missed visit should be 
determined and documented in the subject’s study records.  Al l subjects enrolled (including those withdrawn 
or lost to follow -up) shall be accounted for with appropriate  document ation . 
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow -up phase.  Adverse events 
occurring after the baseline assessment but before the treatment procedure will be documented in the 
subject’s medical record but will not count as related to the investigational device or procedure.   
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corresponding subject ’s CRF.  Each adverse event will be 
judged by [CONTACT_138548]/or 
investigational procedure.  In addition, the Investigator will identify the date of onset, severity and dura tion 
of the AE .  All adverse events will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained.  If a subject

12.0 RISK – BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
12.1 Potential Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer ™ System do not differ from those of the 
commonly used devices and procedures to treat nasal obstruction and sn oring discussed  previously , 
but due to the non-surgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low -power  delivery and lack 
of need for general anesthesia,  the overall risk to the patient may be  less than from other procedures 
such as RF turbinoplasty , septoplasty and/or functional rhinoplasty .   
 
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer  System and/or the associated local anesthetic s 
are outlined below.  Subjects will be monitored closely as part of this study to allow for detection of 
symptoms, should they be present.  This, in turn, should allow for early treatment  or intervention,  if 
necessary.  
 
While there were no reports of these ev ents in the previous feasibility study of this system, the 
following are adverse events or side effects that may occur  as a result of the treatment :  
 Infection  
 Bleeding (other than intra-treatment  at treatment sites  and greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_1275] ) 
 Mucosal changes   
 Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
 Sensory changes at treatment site  
 
Table [ADDRESS_157491] of anticipated observations that are expected in and around the treatment 
area.  For reference, t he incidence (reported as percentage of treated nostrils) observed in the 
previous feasibility study is also provided.  These observations will be assessed and recorded at 
study visits if they occur  but, being anticipated as a result of the procedure, will not be considered 
adverse events unless they require mitigation by  [CONTACT_138545] , 
duration  or degree of incidence than anticipated .  If one of these types of observations is deemed to  
be an adverse event , it should  be recorded on the study Adverse Event CRF.

12.2 Potential Benefit  
Potential benefit, associated with the use of the Vivaer System , is to offer a safe, minimally invasive 
treatment method to improve nasal breathing.  Improved nasal breathing may have a positive effect 
on quality of life and health.   
 
12.3 Minimization of Anticipated Risk s 
Risks associated with the Vivaer  System are minimized by [CONTACT_8345].  In addition, risks will be minimized 
through  the use of an Investigator with a high degree of experience in nasal surgical and minimally 
invasive procedures .  The Investigator will receive sponsor -led training  in proper use of the device, 
prior to study initiation and as warranted throughout the study .  The sponsor will monitor the study for 
any trends that would indicate a safety issue.   Aerin Medical technical and/or clinical representatives 
will attend all procedures to ensure the device performs as intended.  
12.4 Potential Risks to Patient  Confide ntiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study -
related activities beyond those of routine clinical care.  This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_138550] C ase Report Forms (CRFs) or other study -related 
documentation to be provided to the study sponsor.   
 
 
13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
13.1 Sample Size Determination  
Prior study data was used to estimate the expected mean change ( 28.5) and standard deviation 
(30.3) for the change in NOSE score from baseline to 6 months (26 weeks) .  N= 45 subjects would 
provide 90% power to test the study hypothesis at the one -sided alpha level of 0.05.  To allow for up 
to 10% attrition, a total of 50 subjects will be enrolled.

13.2 Hypothesis Testing  
The objective is to show that the mean improvement in NOSE score from baseline to  26 weeks  
exceeds 15 points.  The null and alternative hypotheses are given by:  
 
 [CONTACT_138551]: µd ≤ 15.0 
 
Ha: µd > 15, where µd represents the mean improvement in NOSE score from baseline to 26 
weeks .  The hypothesis is tested at the one -sided alpha 0.05 level.  
 
13.3 Definition of Populations  
Enrolled Subjects  – all subjects enrolled in the study  
 
Evaluable Subjects  – all subjects that are enrolled in the study  and have received the study  
procedure .   
 
All enrolled subjects will be accounted for.  If a subject is enrolled in the study and does not undergo 
the study procedure , a description of the reason will be provided.  Analysis of study endpoints will be 
performed on all evaluable subjects.  
 
13.4 Primary Endpoint – Efficacy Analysis  
The study hypothesis will be tested by [CONTACT_138552] 26 
weeks  (baseline – 26 weeks ).  The lower limit of the one -sided 95% confidence interval will be 
calculated using the t -distribution.  Should the lower limit exceed 15.0, then the null hypothesis will 
be rejected in favor of the alternative.  
 
13.5  Secondary Endpoint – NOSE Responder Rate  
The sec ondary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects that are considered a responder , where 
responder is defined as achieving  a 15 point or greater improvement in the NOSE score from baseline 
to 26 weeks.  Success for this endpoint is defined as  a responder  rate of 55 % or greater.   
 
13.6 Secondary Endpoint – Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_138553], throughout the follow -up period .  The number of events as well as the 
percent of subjects experiencing each event type will be calculated.

be performed.  Otherwise, a multiple imputation approach will be used.  The propensity method 
will be used including the baseline , 4 week and 12 week  NOSE scores if they  are available .  
Fifteen imputed datasets will be generated and the study hypothesis will be repeated on the 
imputed dataset to determine if the study hypothesis is upheld.  
  
13.8.3  Multicenter Study  
Data from up t o 10 investigation al sites will be pooled for this study.  The justification for pooling 
is made on a clinical basis (Meinert and Tonascia 1986) .  This s tudy will be conducted such 
that: 1) the same protocol will be used at each site; 2) site investigators and personnel will 
receive uniform training; and 3) central data management and monitoring will be consistent and 
applied with equal rigor at all sites.  The diversity of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138510].  
 
An analysis of the consistency of the “treatment effect” across sites cannot be made directly in 
this study since it is a single arm study.  Observed differences across sites could be due to 
difference s in patient populations or in the performance of the device. The primary endpoint 
results will be stratified by [CONTACT_138554].  If any sites have fewer than 5 subjects in the analysis 
group, they will be pooled together (if there are more than one), or w ith the next smallest site if 
there is only one.  The mean changes in NOSE score will be compared statistically using 
analysis of variance.  The p -value for statistically significant differences across sites will be set 
at the 0.15 level.    
 
Demographics a nd baseline characteristics will also be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  Should the 
comparison in mean change for the primary endpoint result in a significant difference across 
sites, then the demographics and baseline characteristics will also be compared statistica lly 
across sites.  Fisher’s Exact test will be used for categorical outcomes, and analysis of variance 
for continuous outcomes.  Any characteristics found to be statistically significant at the 0.15 
level will be included in the model comparing the primary  endpoint outcome across sites.  A 
generalized linear model will be used with change in NOSE score playing the role of the

Population: The study population will consist of patients with non -allergic irritant rhinitis 
(NAIR) as defined by [CONTACT_969] (symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching or 
sneezing upon exposure to na sal irritants) and positive optical rhinometer (Rhinolux™, Rhios 
GmbH, and [LOCATION_013]) response with intranasal challenge with capsaicin. Participants will be 
sought from those presenting to the outpatient Otolaryngology clinic at the University of [LOCATION_007] 
Medi cal School at Houston. Patients included in the study will be between the ages of 18 and 70 
with no history of sinonasal surgery, intranasal steroid use for more than 4 weeks, intranasal or 
systemic antihistamine for 3 days, intranasal or systemic deconges tants for 3 days, chronic 
rhinosinusitis, inflammatory or granulomatous diseases, asthma, allergic rhinitis, 
immunocompromised state or radiation to the head and neck.  
 
Sample size: 11 participants will need to be recruited to each group (experimental and control) 
to detect a significant post -treatment change. In order to reach our target enrollment of [ADDRESS_1118412] to screen 60 subjects.  
 
Number of sites: single site 
Study duration: [ADDRESS_1118413] duration: 13 weeks  
General Information: The p roposed study seeks to investigate the effect of intranasal capsaicin 
treatment in patient with Non -allergic irritant rhinitis (NAIR), as well as evaluate optical 
rhinometry (ORM) as a means to quantify symptomatic improvement in NAIR patients during 
and a fter treatment.  
 
Background Information:  
Rhinitis is defined as inflammation of the membranes lining the nose, characterized by 
[CONTACT_808875], rhinorrhea, and/or nasal congestion. It is a common clinical illness 
throughout the world and is con sistently ranked among the most frequent of chronic illnesses, 
significantly affecting the quality of life of patients and their families. Non -allergic rhinitis is 
defined as rhinitis symptoms in the absence of an identifiable allergy, structural abnormali ty, or 
sinus disease. Non -allergic irritant rhinitis (NAIR) affects as many as 17 million Americans, and 
approximately 22 million suffer a combination of allergic rhinitis (AR) and NAIR (1).  
The pathophysiology of NAIR is largely unknown. It is described a s a non -specific nasal 
hyper -reactivity that occurs on exposure to non -immunologic stimuli including changes in 
temperature, strong odors, and airborne irritants. Nasal mucosa is innervated by [CONTACT_808876]: HSC -MS-14-0173 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/18/2019   sensory neurons. Such stimulation of sensory fibers (C and A δ) can lead to the irritative effects 
including sne ezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and pain (2). Such effects are believed to be mediated by 
[CONTACT_808877].  
The trigeminal nerve fibers in the nasal cavity respond to a wide variety of chemical 
stimuli. One known receptor is the TRPV -1 vanilloid receptor.  Capsaicin is one such ligand of 
the TRPV -1 receptor; however, the receptor is also activated by [CONTACT_808878] (3). Stjarne et al showed that although capsaicin acts as an irritant in controls 
and rhinitic patients, those wi th NAIR reported increased rhinorrhea and nasal congestion (4). In 
animal studies, capsaicin has been shown to stimulate sensory C -fibers releasing substance P and 
calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), both potent vasodilators (5). However, repeated 
stimulation showed desensitization and degeneration of C -fibers (6), which is the basis for 
capsaicin usage in pain treatment.  
Currently, intranasal steroids are the only FDA approved agents used in NAIR. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_808871] -herpetic 
neuralgia, post mastectomy pain, and hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract (7 -9). 
LaCroix et al has shown that repeated administration of intranasal capsaicin decreased nasal 
symptoms in NAIR  patients (10). Although multiple studies using intranasal capsaicin have been 
shown to improve nasal symptoms of NAIR patients (11 -13); there have been no studies in 
which NAIR patients were objectively identified and symptom improvement was objectively 
monitored.  
Optical rhinometry (ORM) has been proposed to be a useful instrument in the assessment 
of nasal blood flow, as an indirect measurement of nasal congestion (14). A positive correlation 
has been made between optical rhinometry and symptom scores fo r nasal congestion in nasal 
provocation testing (15). ORM has also been shown to correlate with changes in nasal cavity 
cross sectional area measured via acoustic rhinometry (16). In addition, our group recently 
reported that ORM following 0.05 mM capsaici n challenge can be utilized to identify NAIR 
patients (17).  
A study by [CONTACT_808879]. al. (2012) was able to objectively identify patients with NAIR by 
[CONTACT_808880] (17). Studies have 
shown that  capsaicin therapy can improve symptoms of patients historically identified with 
NAIR via visual analog scale (VAS) rating of symptoms and symptom surveys; however, there 
has been no study evaluating the capsaicin therapy on patients objectively identified  as NAIR 
patients.  
Multiple studies have demonstrated that intranasal capsaicin can improve nasal symptoms 
of NAIR patients (11 -13). Regarding the usage of capsaicin, there is a product on the market: 
Sinus Buster which has capsaicin as the active ingredie nt. Numerous research papers have 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of Sinus Buster for the treatment of congestion in non -allergic 
rhinitis patients (5, 12). However, the diagnosis of NAIR in these previous studies was based 
primarily on history. In addit ion, the primary outcome in these studies was symptomatic without 
any objective evaluation. The goal of this study will be two -fold: with patients objectively 
identified as NAIR patients via the optical rhinometer, we will re -evaluate the therapeutic actio n 
of intranasal capsaicin on the management of rhinitic symptoms. We expect that the patients will 
show significant improvement in their symptoms. We will then use optical rhinometry as a 
means to objectively monitor changes in symptoms in NAIR patients. W e expect that post 
treatment, patients will no longer have the positive response previously seen on intranasal 
capsaicin challenge before receiving treatment. We hope to be able to establish  optical

with the subjective patient surveys.  
 
Objectives:  
1. To establish optical rhinometry as an objective means of evaluating changes of  NAIR 
symptoms after  treatment.  
2. To re -evaluate the therapeutic action of intranasal capsaicin on the management of rhinitic 
symptoms in objectively defined NAIR  patients.  
 
Study Design:  
The study will consist of patients with non -allergic irritant rhinitis (NAIR) as defined by 
[CONTACT_969] ( symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching or sneezing upon exposure to 
nasal irritants) and positive optical rhinometer (Rhinolux™, Rhios GmbH, and [LOCATION_013]) 
response with intranasal challenge with capsaicin (17). Participants will be sought f rom 
volunteers and those presenting to the outpatient Otolaryngology clinic at the University of 
[LOCATION_007] Medical School at Houston. Patients included in the study will be between the ages of [ADDRESS_1118414] (Multi -Test II Lincoln Diagnostics, Decatur, IL [LOCATION_003]) to [ADDRESS_1118415] to exclude allergic rhinitis. Those with confirmed negative skin prick 
testing will be eligible for the study.  
Capsaicin Challenge  and Optical Rhinometry  
The optical rhinometer apparatus is applied to either side of the nasal dorsum according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A one -minute baseline recording will be obtained and 
averaged. Capsaicin solution (Sigma Chemical, St. Loui s, MO [LOCATION_003]) will be diluted in 1% 
ethanol vv and 0.9% normal saline. 1% ethanol in 0.9% normal saline will serve as the vehicle 
solution. A mucosal atomizer device (MAdomizer, Wolfe Tory Medical, Inc Salt Lake City, UT 
[LOCATION_003] delivering a 100 μl solution will be used to deliver a dose of capsaicin totaling 1.5 μg of 
caspsaicin (0.05 mM) to the anterior face of the inferior turbinate of each nare. The maximum 
change in optical density (OD) will be recorded. Patients with a maximum change in OD of at 
least 0.2 wi ll be considered a positive response and included in the study.  
A composite symptom score will be recorded based a commonly used rhinitis rating 
system as recommended by [CONTACT_808881] 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/u  
cm071293.pdf ). Each of the following 4 symptoms: nasal itching/tingling, nasal congestion, 
sneezing and rhinorrhea, will be rated on a 0 -3 scale of severity (Appendix B) and a summed 
composite score will be recorded fo r each subject.  
 
Capsaicin Treatment Concentration  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-14-0173 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/18/2019   The capsaicin solution will be prepared by [CONTACT_808882]; (0.1mmol/l) diluted in ethanol and 0.9% normal saline (19). Using the MAD, 
0.8mL will be delivered to each nasal cavity for a total of 24.4 ug per nasal  cavity.  
 
Study Procedure:  
There will be a total of [ADDRESS_1118416] visit, patients will be consented and undergo 
skin prick testing, the capsaicin challenge and Optical Rhinometry. Prior to undergoing the 
capsaicin challenge, a composite symptom sc ore will be recorded. Patients with confirmed 
negative skin prick testing, and positive response on ORM will be eligible for the study and will 
be asked to return for treatment. Those who are not eligible will not be responsible for any costs 
associated wi th screening and will be compensated for parking as well as $25.[ADDRESS_1118417] been randomized and blinded into two 
groups: Group A will be treated with vehicle spray; and Group B will be treated with th e 
capsaicin spray. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_808872]. A member of the research team, which 
consists of Drs. Amber Luong, Martin Citardi, Samer Fakhri, and Faramarz Ashoori (research 
coordinator), will assist during the randomization and distribution of appropriate pre -made 
medications so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_808873].  
5 consecutive applications of capsaicin or placebo will be administered intranasally, with 
1 hour between each application. Fifteen minutes prior to each application of medicat ion, the 
nasal mucosa will be anesthetized with 100 ul of 1% lidocaine will be applied to each nasal 
cavity via MAD for all study participants. The lidocaine should not alter the nasal mucosa 
reaction to capsaicin; and is meant to anesthetize the area from  the mild stinging of capsaicin. In 
fact, because lidocaine has a very mild stinging sensation at times; it can serve to mask the 
stinging one may get with intranasal capsaicin. Using the MAD, 100 μL of 1% ethanol in 0.9% 
saline solution (Group A) or 0.8 m L solution with (0.1mmol/l) of capsaicin in 1% ethanol in 
0.9% saline (Group B) will be delivered to each nasal cavity. On this day, they will not need to 
undergo optical rhinometry. Patients will fill out composite symptoms scores before and five 
minutes after 1st and 5th treatments. Patients who complete this portion of the experiment will 
receive $50 dollars in compensation as well as parking.  
Patients will then follow up 4 and 12 weeks after initiating treatment. At the 4 week and 
12 week follow -up appo intments, subjects will undergo capsaicin challenge followed by [CONTACT_808883]. Patients who complete both 
follow up visits will receive $25 dollars in compensation as well as parking.  
 
 
Compensation:  

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-14-0173 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/18/2019   In summary, patients that undergo the screening process and complete the skin prick 
testing and intranasal capsaicin challenge and ORM will be compensated $25 as well as parking 
validation. Patients that undergo the treatment will be compensat ed $[ADDRESS_1118418] treatment, 
will be compensated $25 plus parking.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring:  
Previous studies have shown that the concentration of capsaicin that will be used is 
generally well tolerated.  
Regarding the lidocaine, it is administered routinely in our clinic prior to nasal endoscopy 
and flexible laryngoscopy exams. Side effects can include minor stinging and burning when 
applied to the nose. Because it is an intranasal spray, there is a risk t hat patients will swallow it 
and may have difficulty swallowing for up to [ADDRESS_1118419] oxygen available in 
the clinic.  
Patients will be educated to call the outpatient Otolaryngology clinic at the University of 
[LOCATION_007] Medical School at Houston if there are any adverse effects.  
 
Human Subjects:  
Participants will be sought from those presenting to the outpatient Otolaryngology clinic at the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Medical School at Houston. Patients included in the study will be between 
the ages of [ADDRESS_1118420] from the study because they do not speak or read English  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Justification of sample size:  
Using [CONTACT_808886]’s paper (17) : his article showed the average maximum optical den sity in 
NAIR patients was 0.2 (SD 0.051), seen when using the 0.05 mM concentration of capsaicin 
during the capsaicin challenge and ORM. Healthy control subjects had a mean maximal OD 
change of 0.174 (SD 0.034). This was significant to p=0.01. Based on thi s data, [ADDRESS_1118421] -treatment change.  
Student’s t -test will be used to compare the mean change in composite symptom scores 
pre and post -treatment in both groups. Student’s t -test will also be used to c ompare changes in 
maximal optical density in response to capsaicin challenge pre - and post -treatment in both

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/18/2019   groups. Statistical significance will result if p <0.05. The Spearman Rank Correlation will be 
used to analyze associations between com posite symptom scores and changes in OD.  
 
Ethics:  
IRB approval will be sought from CPHS  
 
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: In order to maintain confidentiality, a data sheet with 
patient’s names and data collected for the study (see data sheet) will be stored in a locked file 
cabinet within the department of Otorhinolaryngology. Access to data sheets in patient will be 
limited  to co -investigators and research coordinator. Only de -identified data or collective data 
will be shared.  
 
Quality control and assurance: In order to confirm that the diagnosis of non -allergic irritant 
rhinitis is accurate and made in an unbiased manner, a  history of rhinitic symptoms will be 
confirmed with objective skin testing.  
All datasheets will be recorded by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_808874] 3 co - 
investigators to ensure accuracy in the recording of clinical data.  
 
Publication Plan: This s tudy has been funded by [CONTACT_808884] (AAOA) Foundation Grant. Results from this study will be presented at a future AAOA 
national meeting and initial publication rights will be given to the International Forum of Allergy 
and Rhinology.  
All enrolled subjects will be notified of any publication resulting from this study, but these 
publications will present data on only the aggregate group.

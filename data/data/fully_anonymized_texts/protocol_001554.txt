1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable  [LOCATION_002]  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165) is an oral selective inhibitor of tyrosin kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the 
Janus kinase (JAK) family. Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165)  binds to the regulatory domain of TYK2  (also 
known as pseudokinase domain)  to stabilize an inhibitory interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic 
6 
 domains of the enzyme. This results in allosteric inhibition of receptor -mediated activation of TYK2 and its 
downstream activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). JAK kinases, 
including TYK2, function as pairs of homo - or heterodimers in the JAK -STAT pathways. TYK2 activates 
STAT -dependent gene expression and functional responses of interleukin (IL) -12, IL -23, and type I interferon 
(IFN) receptors. IL-12 promotes Th1 differentiation in T -cells and enhances the production of IF N gamma  1. 
IL-23 is an inflammatory cytokine that stimulates development and differentiation of T h17 cells via activation 
on STAT3. Subsequently, Th17 cells secrete inflammatory mediators, including IL -17 and TNF -alpha  2. IL-23 
also exerts its effects on dendritic cells and macrophages to stimulate production of IL -1, IL -6, and TNF -alpha.  
 
Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) represents a therapeutically attractive drug by [CONTACT_876042]. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) 6 mg twice daily  
(Cohort A)  in subjects with Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_22785]  (LPP) . Our preliminary results of Deucravacitinib (BMS -
986165) 6mg BID (Cohort A) improved disease activity by [CONTACT_876043] 12 and 16. In 
addition, clinical signs and symptoms were improved at 3 -4 months and was well tolerated.  
 
Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_22785] (LPP) is a form of lymphocyte -mediated scarring alopecia . It presents as discrete patches 
with characteristic perifollicular erythema and scale involving the scalp. LPP is histopathologically 
characterized by [CONTACT_876044]. Cell -mediated cytotoxicity 
is the main pathogenetic mechanism in lichenoid tissue reactions and the maintenance and progression of 
chronic cytotoxic inflammation requires  IFN gamma signaling.  Disease progression results in permanent 
alopecia and is associated with negative quality of life im pacts including depression and anxiety. There are no 
on-label or effective remittive treatments . Conventional topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (e.g. corticosteroids) and systemic 
immunosuppressives (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil) used in the treatment of LPP directly inhibit lymphocytes 
but generally cannot induce clinical remission  3. Therefore, there remains a critical unmet need for alternative 
therapeutic options  to treat LPP.  
 
 Cutaneous LP is characterized by [CONTACT_39764] I and Type II IFN driven cell mediated cytotoxic immune response 
that is highly responsive to JAK1, 2 inhibitions  4-6. However, unlike LP, LPP  is a chronic , scarring  condition. 
The etiology of LPP as well as the scarring is poorly understood; however, Th17 cells are thought to play a 
critical role in this process. In line with the role of  Type I  & II IFN s and Th17 cells in LPP, more moderate 
responses are seen with to JAK 1, 2 inhibition  7 8,9. Taken together, we believe that TYK2 inhibition has the 
potential to treat the inflammation of LPP as well as the scarring generated by [CONTACT_78443]17 stimulated fibroblasts.  
 
We additionally propose a multi -center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design study using 
Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165 , systemic  TYK2 inhibitor  for the treatment of LPP with 6 mg orally QD 
(Cohort B)  to assess safety and efficacy . 
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
Deucravaticinib  (BMS -986165)  is an oral agent that selectively inhibits TYK2 via allosteric mechanism . 
TYK2 mediates the signaling of inflammatory cytokines of adaptive (IL -12, IL -23) and innate (type I IFN) 
immune responses. Inhibition of  TYK2 leads to the downregulation of the IL -23/Th17  pathway, IL-[ADDRESS_1223500] . Type I  & II IFN s and Th17 cytokines  play a key role in the pathogenesis of 
LPP.  
 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
 
All preclinical data below is referenced from the IB. Please refer to the IB for more details.  
 
 
8 
 There is an increased risk of infection with use of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165). . The most common serious 
infections associated with Deucravactinib  (BMS -986165) include pneumonia and COVID -19. These will be 
monitored for. Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent 
infections such as Tuberculosis, Valley Fever or viral infections such as herpes zoster (shingles) or herpes 
simplex (cold sore). Please seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of i nfection occur.  
 
Allergy:  
It is possible that some people could have an allergic reaction to Deucravacitinib ( BMS -986165 ). Allergic 
reaction to Deucravactinib  (BMS -986165)  is a contraindication for continued use.  
   
Venous thromboembolism:  
It is unknown whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of 
JAK inhibition. Higher rates of all -cause mortality, including overall thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and 
pulmonary embolism were observed in patients treated with a JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with 
TNF blockers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  is not approved for use in RA.  
While we do not expect such events to occur, patients should seek medical advice if they experience signs or 
symptoms of DVT/PE, such as significant shortness of breath, bloody cough, or lower leg swelling, redness, or 
pain.  
 
Rhabdomyolysis  and Elevated CPK  
Treatment with Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) has been associated with an increased incidence of 
asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis compared to treatment with 
placebo. Discontinue if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Patients  
should  promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by 
[CONTACT_21936] . 
Cancer Risk:  
Deucravacitinib ( BMS -986165)   may have the potential to affect the subject’s immune system; they may be at 
increased risk for infections . Cancers, including lymphomas, were observed in a few patients in the 
Deucravacitinib clinical studies; the role of Deucravacitinib in these cancers is uncertain. Long term safety 
evaluations are ongoing.   
 
Vaccines:  
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165).  
 
Pregnancy Risk : 
The effect of the study drug on a fetus (developi[INVESTIGATOR_191278]), or on a breastfeeding infant,  is 
unknown . Because  of these risks, women cannot take part in this study if they are pregnant . 
 
Lactation Risk:  
There are no data on the presence of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) in human milk, the effects on the 
breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Deucravacitinib is present in rat  
milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in  
human milk. Because of the risks, women cannot take part in this study if they are breastfeeding.  
 
Skin biopsy:  
A skin biopsy is generally a safe procedure, but some potential risks may include local pain, mild local 
bruising, bleeding, scarring, and an infection at the site where the skin biopsy was performed.  If a topi[INVESTIGATOR_876030], then there  is a small risk of an allergic reaction.  
 
 
Blood draw:  
9 
 The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and/or fainting, or rarely, infection at the 
site of the needle stick.   
 
Other:  
As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we take 
precautions to minimize this risk.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective : 
To determine the efficacy of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) as measured by [CONTACT_876045][INVESTIGATOR_331961] (LPPAI) score for overall response  (Complete and partial responders)  at week  24. Percent reduction of 
baseline LPPAI score after 24 weeks of treatment is defined as follows:  
• Complete response: LPPAI reduction greater than 85% from baseline score.  
• Partial response: LPPAI reduction between 25 -85% from baseline score.  
• Non-response: LPPAI reduction of less than 25% from baseline score.  
 
The Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_178370] (LPPAI) is a standardized validated quantitative measure of disease 
activity [12].  LPPAI score (0 ‐10) is calculated as follows: (pruritus + pain + burning)/3 + (scalp erythema + 
perifollicular erythema + perifollicular scale)/3 + 2.5 (pull test) + 1.5 (spreading/2). Symptoms and signs are 
graded on a 4 ‐point scale with 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 =severe. Clinical progression and a 
positive hair pull test are graded 1=yes; 0=no.  
 
Secondary Objective : 
To determine the efficacy of Deucravactinib (BMS 9 [ZIP_CODE]) ) as measured by [CONTACT_134404] s in PGA  of scalp , 
DQLI score , VAS, VRS, NRS, and Skindex -16.(weeks 0 to 4, weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 0 to 8, weeks 8 to 12, 
weeks 0 to 12, weeks 12 to 16, weeks 0 to 16, weeks 16 to 20 , weeks 20 to 24, and weeks 0 to 2 4). 
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
To predict responses and examine the pharmacodynamics of treatment through the identification of unique 
biomarkers and transcriptomic changes of LPP at week 0 and utilizing single -cell RNA sequencing on responsive 
and non -responsive tissue at week 4 to correlate these  biomarkers with measures of global response:  
 
3 Study Design  
 
3.1 General Description  
 
This is a single center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design study of 22 patients.   Adult  patients with 
biopsy proven LPP with active disease w ill be treated Deucravacitinib ( BMS -986165 ) for [ADDRESS_1223501] been conducted with Deucravacitinib ( BMS -986165 ) (see Safety) and a dose of 6 mg BID 
(Cohort A) and dose of 6mg QD (Cohort B)  is deemed safe. (Investigator’s Brochure)  
 
Individuals over the age of [ADDRESS_1223502] active disease at 
baseline . Patients with end -stage scarring hair loss but without significant active disease will be excluded.  
Prior treatment will be allowed; however, a washout period of 2 weeks for topi[INVESTIGATOR_199] 4  weeks or longer (see 
Table 1) for systemic agents is required. At the washout period, individuals will undergo evaluation with 
LPPAI,  PGA , DQLI,  VAS, VRS, NRS, and Skindex -16. The scalp lesions will be photographed .  
 
10 
 Individuals will then initiate treatment with Deucravacitinib ( BMS -986165 ) 6 mg  twice daily (Cohort A) and 
dose of 6mg QD (Cohort B)  will be evaluated every 4 weeks  and assessed by [CONTACT_876046], PGA  between weeks 0 -
24 (see Appendix). Week 24 will be the primary endpoint. Therapy will be stopped and the individuals will be 
evaluated at week 28 after an observation period of 4 weeks  and assessed by [CONTACT_876047] . Laboratory and safety monitoring will occur at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 , 16, 20, 24, and 28 . 3D Photographs 
will be taken at weeks 0 , 2, 4, 8, 12 , 16, 20, 24, and 28. Up close photos will be taken of the disease .  
 
A 4 mm punch biops y of the  scalp  will be collected  for all subjects. Blood collection will include the isolation 
at week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Blood will be drawn into  5mL vials and subsequently  separated. The 
serum and cell pellet will be stored for future analysis.  
 
Normal patient controls will be obtained from archival tissue collected from normal scalp biopsies  at the 
University of Michigan  (Cohort A only) . Tissue  (up to a 4 mm biopsy sample) will be obtained  for analysis  
from the  University of Michigan biobank  (Cohort A only) .The University of Michigan Biobank has IRB 
approval for  the collection, processing,  and storage of samples.  All tissue  analys es will be conducted at the 
University of Michigan.  Only deidentified data  for the control samples  will be shared with Mayo Clinic.  
 
Single cell RNA sequencing  will be performed at week 0 and week 4 (Cohort A only) . A total of up to 30  ([ADDRESS_1223503] treatment , 4 controls ) skin samples will be completed  for single cell sequencing  (Cohort 
A only) . Bulk RNA sequencing will be completed  on up to  30 tissue samples ([ADDRESS_1223504] 
treatment, 4 healthy controls)  (Cohort A only) . Spatial RNA sequencing will be completed  on 28 tissue 
samples ([ADDRESS_1223505] treatment)  (Cohort A only) .  
 
Bulk, s ingle -cell and spatial RNA Transcriptome Sequencing: Samples will be prepped and analyzed per bulk, 
spatial, and single -cell RNA sequencing standard operating procedures of the University of Michigan 
genomics lab  (Cohort A only) . Processing and o perating protocols are as follows:  
 
Bulk, Single Cell and Spacial RNA Sequencing   
 
Biopsy Processing for bulk and spatial sequencing:  
Biopsies will be collected following standard Mayo BAP procedures. Immediately following collection, tissue 
biopsies will be submerged in formalin . Formalin  samples will be shipped to the University of Michigan.  
 
Biopsy Processing for single cell sequencing:  
 
Biopsies will be collected following standard Mayo BAP procedures. Immediately  following collection, tissue 
biopsies will be submerged and frozen in Cryostor CS10 media at a rate of -1°C/minute and stored at -80C. 
Frozen samples will be shipped within 2 weeks of collection to the University of Michigan. Upon receipt, 
samples will be  stored at -80C until time of processing for single cell sequencing.  
 
Single Cell Sequencing:  
Cells will be isolated from cutaneous punch biopsies using collagenase or trypsin containing DNase. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_876031]. Cell quality and 
quantity will be assessed using Trypan Blue exclusi on. Samples with >75% viability will be sequenced 
without additional cleanup steps. Samples with <75% viability will be further processed to increase 
concentration of viable cells prior to sequencing.  
 
Primary and Secondary Measures:  
 
All efficacy assessments will be performed prior to the administration of study treatment at each visit. The 
recommended order and the overall outline of measurements for the efficacy assessments are described below.  
 
11 
 Primary Outcome measures:  The primary outcome measure will be  LLPAI score for overall response  between 
week 0 and week 24.  Change in LLPAI will also be assessed week 0 to week 2, weeks 0 to 4, weeks 4 to 8 ,

indicated, based on medical history and/or sym ptoms, additional exams will be performed at the discretion of 
the investigator. If possible, the same member of the study site staff throughout the study will perform 
assessments for an individual subject. Information for all physical examinations will be  included in the source 
documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the subject signing informed 
consent will be included in the Medical History. Significant findings made after the signing of the informed 
consent, which  meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded as an AE. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, 
height, weight) will be assessed at each physical examination as indicated in Table -2 (see Supplemental 2 for 
details on how to acquire vital signs). Whether acti on needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be 
decided by [CONTACT_093], considering the overall status of the subject. Laboratory studies will be drawn as 
indicated in Table -2. Whether action needs to be taken to address notable laboratory  values will be decided by 
[CONTACT_093], considering the overall status of the subject. Hematology assessments will be measured at all 
scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. Serum chemistry will be a comprehensive metabolic  and lipid  
panel s that  will be measured at all scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. 
 
If the prohibited treatment is being used during the study for any indication, the subject must discontinue use of 
the prohibited treatment if he/she wishes to continue in the study.  In case of undue safety risk for the subject, 
the subject should discont inue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator/qualified site staff. If the 
subject received a live virus vaccination during the study, the subject must discontinue study treatment.

O N O N HN N H N N N N H  
 
Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165)  Structural  Formula   
 
 
18 
  
Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  is a white to yellow powder. The solubility of deucravacitinib is pH 
dependent.  
 
Solubility decreases with increasing pH. Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165)  tablets are supplied in 6 mg strength 
for oral administration. Each tablet contains Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  as the active ingredient and the 
following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate succinate, 
magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and silicon dioxide. In addition, the film coating Opadry® II 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] c ontains the following inactive ingredients: iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, polyethylene glycol, 
polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide.  
 
Pharmacodynamics:  
  
In patients with psoriasis, Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  reduced psoriasis -associated gene expression in 
psoriatic skin in a dose dependent manner, including reductions in IL -23-pathway and type I IFN pathway 
regulated genes. Deucravacitinib reduced IL -17A, IL -19 and beta -defensin by 47 to 50%, 72%, and 81 to 8 4% 
respectively following 16 weeks of once daily treatment. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic 
markers and the mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_876051] (BMS -986165)  exerts its clinical effects is unknown.  
 
Pharmacokinetics:  
 
Following oral administration, Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  plasma Cmax and AUC increased 
proportionally over a dose range from 3 mg to 36 mg (0.5 to 6 times the approved recommended dosage) in 
healthy subjects. The accumulation of Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165)  was <1.4 -fold following once daily 
dosing in healthy subjects. The PK of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  and its active metabolite, BMT -153261, 
were comparable between healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis. The steady state Cmax and AUC24 of 
deucravacitinib following administration of 6 mg once daily were 45 ng/mL and 473 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. 
The s teady state Cmax and AUC24 of the active Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  metabolite, BMT -153261, 
following administration of 6 mg once daily were 5 ng/mL and  95 ng∙hr/mL, respectively.  
 
Absorption  
The absolute oral bioavailability of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  was 99% and the median Tmax ranged 
from [ADDRESS_1223515]  No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  
were observed following administration of a high -fat, high -calorie meal (951 kcal in total, with approximate 
distribution of 52% fat, 33% carbohydrate and 15% protein). Cmax and AUC of deucravacitinib when 
administered with food were decreased by [CONTACT_79938] 24% and 11%, respectively, and Tmax was 
prolonged by 1 hour. Cmax and AUC of BMT -153261 when administered with food were decreased by 
[CONTACT_147823] 23% and 10%, respectively, and Tmax was prolonged by 2 hours.  
 
Distribution   

19 
 The volume of distribution of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  at steady state is 140 L. Protein binding of 
Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  was 82 to 90% and the blood -to-plasma concentration ratio was 1.26.  
 
Elimination   
The terminal half -life of Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  was 10 hours. The renal clearance of Deucravacitinib 
ranged from 27 to 54 mL/minute.  
 
Metabolism   
Deucravacitinib  (BMS -986165)  is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P -450 (CYP) 1A2 to form major metabolite 
BMT -153261. Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  is also metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6, CYP2D6, carboxylesterase 
(CES) 2, and uridine glucuronyl transferase (UGT) 1A9. The active Deucravacitinib metabolite, BMT -153261, 
has comparable potency to the parent drug, but the circulating exposure of BMT -153261 accounts for 
approximately 20% of the systemic exposure of the total drug -related components.  
 
Excretion   
After a single dose of radiolabeled Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165) , approximately 13% and 26% of the dose 
was recovered as unchanged in urine and feces, respectively. Approximately 6% and 12% of the dose was 
detected as BMT -153261 in urine and feces, respectively.  
 
Specific Populations

with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2); no change in Cmax was observe d in patients with 
severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 ) renal impairment, and ESRD (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2 ) on dialysis. 
Deucravacitinib AUCinf  was unchanged in patients with mild renal impairment but higher by 39%, 28% and 
34% in patients with moderate, sev ere and ESRD on dialysis, respectively, compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. BMT -153261 Cmax was 11% lower, 8% lower, 28% higher and 9% higher in patients with 
mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and ESRD on dialysis, respectively, compared  to subjects with 
normal renal function. BMT -153261 AUCinf was 2% lower, 24% higher, 81% higher and 27% higher in 
patients with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and ESRD on dialysis, respectively, compared to 
subjects with normal renal function. Dia lysis did not substantially clear Deucravacitinib (BMS -986165)  from 
systemic circulation (5.4% of dose cleared per dialysis).  
 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Class A), moderate (Child -Pugh Class B), and severe (Child -Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Deucravacitinib AUCinf was hi gher by 10%, 40% and 
43% in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. BMT -153261 Cmax was lower by 25%, 59% and 79% in patients with mild, 
moder ate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
BMT -153261 AUCinf was lower by 3%, 20% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic 
impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with norm al hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
 Data analysis: Due to the costs associated with a study, we propose a single armed study of [ADDRESS_1223519].  
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
Sample Size Computation and Power Analysis : 
The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_191289] 22 subjects for logistical and financial reasons. This is similar in size 
to other exploratory studies and will provide adequate data for estimation purposes for planning future studies.  
With 22 subjects, the study is intended to be for estimation purposes only.    
 
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Data Analysis - The statistical analysis will provide descriptive summary statistics for categorical and 
continuous outcomes.  Categorical variables will be described by [CONTACT_876052], normally distributed variab les will be described by [CONTACT_191333]; and 
continuous, non -normally distributed variables will be described by [CONTACT_191308]. The paired or 
unpaired Wilcoxon tests will be used to quantify differences in numerical outcomes whi le the McNemar’s or 
Bowker’s tests will be used to quantify changes in categorical variables. Complete response rate and 
complete/partial response rate and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated and 
estimated using exact binomial method. Spaghetti plots will be used to visualize trend of the LPPAI score , 
PGA score, and Dermatology -QLI score at each time points for each individual ..Effect sizes will be estimated 
for the appropriate statistical tests that will be used for group comparisons in future studies. This will enable 
more accurate power and sample size estimates moving forward.  
 
Bioinformatic Analysis :  
Bulk, Spatial, and Single -cell  RNA Seq analysis : will be performed according to standard operating procedures 
of Mayo Clinic and University of Michigan genomics lab and bioinformatics. We will perform bulk, single cell 
and spatial sequencing pre and post therapeutically on tissue. Using these genomic techniques, we can determine 
differences within samples as well as between diseases in as few as [ADDRESS_1223520] Population(s) for Analysis  
• All-completed population :  All subjects that receive at least one dose will be considered for analysis.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including 
individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) death; (2) life threatening adverse 
experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or 
significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or 
new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or 
others, or substantially compromise the resear ch data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an 
underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" whe n it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an 
increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, 
biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. Serious problems/events can be well defined and 
include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant  disability or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator  may have adversely 
affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_1223521] administration of 
study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
29 
 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the 
study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end 
of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event 
must also be recorded and docum ented as an adverse event.   
 
A thorough baseline screening will be followed for all subjects  and is outlined in Table -2. A detailed list of the 
methods in which baseline screening will be performed is outlined in Supplemental [ADDRESS_1223522] be performed prior  to study treatment administration. Appropriate safety assessments 
(e.g., evaluation of AEs and SAEs) should be repeated after dosing with study treatment. A physical 
examination, including general appearance and vital signs, will be performed as indicated  in Table -2. If 
indicated, based on medical history and/or symptoms, additional exams will be performed at the discretion of 
the investigator. If possible, the same member of the study site staff throughout the study will perform 
assessments for an individual subject. Information for all physical examinations will be included in the source 
documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the subject signing informed 
consent will be included in the Medical History. Significant findings made  after the signing of the informed 
consent, which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded as an AE. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, 
height, weight) will be assessed at each physical examination as indicated in Table -2 (see Supplemental 2  for 
details on how to acquire vital signs). Whether action needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be 
decided by [CONTACT_093], considering the overall status of the subject.  
 
Temporary Interruption  of Investigational Product: In some circumstances, patients may need to temporarily 
interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnormal laboratory values that may have an unclear relationship to 
investigational product. For the abnormal laboratory findings  and clinical events (regardless of relatedness), 
specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatment may be restarted.  Retest 
frequency and timing of follow up laboratory tests to monitor the abno rmal finding is at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Investigational product that was temporarily interrupted because of an AE or abnormal laboratory 
value may be restarted at the discretion of the investigator.  
• Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): Treatment should be interrupted if ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L and may 
be restarted once ANC return above this value  
• Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC): Treatment should be interrupted if ALC < 0.5 x 109 cells/L and 
may be restarted once ALC return above this value  
• Hemoglobin (Hb): Treatment should be interrupted if Hb < 8 g/dL and may be restarted once Hb return 
above this value  
• Hepatic transaminases: Treatment should be temporarily interrupted if drug -induced liver injury is 
suspected  
 
Permanent Discontinuation  from Investigational Product:  Investigational product must be permanently 
discontinued if the patient or the patient’s designee requests to discontinue investigational product. 
Discontinuation of the investigational product for abnormal liver tests should be considered by [CONTACT_876053] a patient meets 1 of the following conditions:  
• ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1223523]  
• ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1223524]  
• ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1223525] and total bilirubin level (TBL) >[ADDRESS_1223526] or international normalized ratio 
(INR) >1.5  
• ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1223527] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
30 
 • ALP >[ADDRESS_1223528] that is deemed to be of liver origin and drug -related  
• ALP >2.[ADDRESS_1223529] and TBL >[ADDRESS_1223530]  
• ALP >2.[ADDRESS_1223531] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper -quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
• Investigational product should be permanently discontinued if any of the following laboratory 
abnormalities are observed:  
• White blood cell count <1000 cells/
 L (1.00 x 103/
 L or 1.00 billion/L)  
• ANC <500 cells/
 L (0.50 x 103/
 L or 0.50 billion/L)  
• Lymphocyte count <200 cells/
 L (0.20 x 103/
 L or 0.20 billion/L)  
• Hemoglobin <6.5 g/dL (<65.0 g/L)  
 
 
Hepatitis B virus  DNA testing will be performed in enrolled patients who tested positive for HBcAb at 
screening.  Patients who are HBcAb -positive and HBV DNA -negative (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require HBV 
DNA monitoring every 3 months and at the patient’s last visit, regardless of their hepatitis B surface antibody 
(HBsAb) status.  The following actions should be taken in response to HBV DNA test results:  
• If a single result is obtained with a value “below limit of quantitation,” the test should be repeated 
within approximately 2 weeks.  
• If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” monitoring may resume according to the study 
schedule.  
• If the patient has [ADDRESS_1223532] results with a value “below limit of quantitation” during the study, 
HBV DNA testing should be performed approximately once per month for the remainder of the study 
and referral to a hepatologist is recommended.  
• If a result is obtained with a value above limit of quantitation at any time during the study, the patient 
will be permanently discontinued from investigational product and should be referred to a hepatology 
specialist immediately  
 
 
Supplemental 1: Appropriateness of Measures  
 
Skin Scoring:  
LPPAI  
Disease activity in LPP can be measured with the well validated Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_178370], first 
developed in 2010. LLPAI quantifies LPP activity using the following variables: itch, pain, burn, scalp  
erythema, perifollicular  erythema,  perifollicular scaling, pull test, and spreading.  
 
PGA  
The use of PGA is well validated in other inflammatory skin conditions  and is frequently used as a primary or 
secondary endpoint assessment tool . The assessment measures the overall response to treatment as assessed by 
[CONTACT_099].  
 
Itch Scoring:  
 
The VAS, VRS,  NRS and Skindex -[ADDRESS_1223533] upon quality of life.  
 
Supplemental 2: Safety Measures  
 
Baseline Screening:  
 
[ADDRESS_1223534] be definitively 
discontinued.  
 
Blood Pressure and Pulse:  
Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored at all patient visits. Blood pressure will be measured by [CONTACT_876054]. Heart 
rate will be measured with pulse oximeter.  
 
Height and Weight:  
Height and body weight will be measured in indoor clothing, but without shoes. If possible, body weight 
assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_782748].  
 
Blood Draws:  
Subjects should avoid smoking within the hour preceding the blood draws. All laboratory studies will be 
conducted within the Mayo Clinic Health Systems (Mayo Clinic Arizona and Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012] . Details on 
the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results will follow Mayo Clinic’s current protocols. For 
the identification of notable values, the Mayo Clinic reference laboratory should be consulted.  
 
Supplemental 3: Safety Monitoring  
 
Infection monitoring:  
Study subjects will be evaluated at each visit for signs or symptoms of infection.  
• Vitals signs as well as constitutional symptoms will be assessed.  
• Assessment for common infections such as cellulitis as well as oral, vaginal, and cutaneous candidiasis 
will be performed  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
sponsor -investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the sponsor -investigator, any subsequent event(s) 
that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in 
this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if   
 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  
• they require therapy.  
 
Laboratory studies will be drawn as indicated in Table -2. Whether action needs to be taken to address notable 
laboratory values will be decided by [CONTACT_093], considering the overall status of the subject. Hematology 
assessments will be measured at all scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. Serum chemistry will be a 
comprehensive metabolic panel will be measured at all scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706]  
32 
 Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214166] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be document ed as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event 
in the following circumstances:   
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
8.[ADDRESS_1223535] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section  of the case report form 
(CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic , laboratory or  procedure results should 
recorded in the source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the  probable  cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period must be followed up , to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs 
during the Adverse Event Reporting Period  and is considered to be at lea st possibly related to the study 
treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1223536] the 
study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The sponsor -investigator 
will evaluate the event and determine t he necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
 
Relationship of adverse events to study drug  
For all AEs, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the study drug and the AE using his/her 
clinical expertise and judgment according to the following algorithm that best fits the circumstances of the AE . 
The investigator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibility of being related 
to study treatment, study device, or a study procedure, taking into account the disease, concomitant treatment or 
pathologies. A “reasonable pos sibility” means that there is  a cause and effect relationship between the 
investigational product, study device and/or study procedure and the AE. The investigator answers yes/no when 
making this assessment.  
Planned surgeries and nonsurgical interventions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical 
condition has worsened during the course of the study.  
 
8.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB  
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258] -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_137136].  
 
Action taken regarding treatment  
33 
  
AE Action:  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following:  
• No action taken (i.e. further observation only)  
• [study/investigational] treatment  dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted  
• [study/investigational] treatment permanently discontinued due to this adverse event  
• concomitant medication given  
• non-drug therapy given  
• patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]/patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191292]:  
• All AE outcomes should be recorded (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown)  
 
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable sign(s), 
symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria (Life -threatening in the 
context of a SAE refers to a reaction i n which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does 
not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.):  
• Is fatal or life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in 
condition (specify what this includes)  
o Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a 
SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
o Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition  
• Is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or 
surgical intervention.  
 
SAE Reporting:  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the patient has provided informed 
consent and until [ADDRESS_1223537] be reported to BMS 
within 24 hours \ [ADDRESS_1223538] be recorded on either CIOMS, 
MedWatch, or approved study specifi/institutional SAE form . Any SAEs experienced after the [ADDRESS_1223539] 
be submitted as soon as possible but no later than 5 days from the investigator receiving the follow -up 
information. SAE should be fo llowed up until resolution or until it is judged to be permanent. An SAE that is 
considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
 
BMS Reporting:  
SAE Email Address:   
SAE Facsimile Number:   

34 
 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports 
should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, 
a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours \ 1 Business Day to BMS using the same procedure used 
for transmitting the initial SAE r eport.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
Information collected on the adverse event worksheet ( and entered in the research database) :  
• Subject’s name:  
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention*):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1 -5**) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment)

AE Reporting:  
Its relationship to the:   
• Study treatment (no/yes), or  
• Investigational treatment (no/yes), or  
• The other study treatment (non-investigational) (no/yes), or  
• Both or indistinguishable  
The relationship will be categorized as follows:  
• Unrelated - Clearly due only to extraneous causes and does not meet criteria listed under possible or 
probable.  
• Unlikely - Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. May have been produced 
by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Possible - Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration but may have been also produced 
by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Probable - Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement on cessation of 
investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known 
pattern of response to the investigational medicinal product.  
Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved should be 
reported.  
Whether it constitutes a serious adverse event  (SAE)  
 
Adverse Events (AE):  
The severity grade/Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) AE Version 5.0 grade  
• Mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• Severe: prevents normal activities  
 
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, use  
1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life -threatening, CTCAE Grade 5 (death) is not used, but is collected in other 
CRFs (Study Completion, Death/Survival).

 8.3.2 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA   
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the FDA all unexpected, serious suspected adverse reactions according 
to the required IND Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements . 
 
Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected 
adverse reaction.  This will be reported  to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after 
the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  
This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -
investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those listed in the 
protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the 
FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the 
information about the event.  
 
Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug 
will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after 
the sponsor -investigators initial rece ipt of the information about the event.  
 
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor

pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including during at least [ADDRESS_1223540] will be permanently discontinued in an 
appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant).  
The Sponsor -Investigator must immediately notify of this event and complete one 
of the following forms within [ADDRESS_1223541] sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.  
ADVERSE EVENT RECONCILIATION PROCESS  
The Sponsor -Investigator (or designee) will reconcile the clinical database AE cases (case level only) transmitted 
to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance .  
⦁ The Sponsor -Investigator will request the SAE reconciliation report (and include the BMS protocol 
number) from BMS GPV&E ) every 3 months and prior to data base lock or 
final data summary  
⦁ GPV&E will send the Sponsor -Investigator the report to verify and confirm all AE and SAEs have been 
transmitted to BMS GPV&E.  
⦁ The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for case identification

Procedure for Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor ([COMPANY_016] ) 
 
Data on fetal outcome are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Follow -up should be 
conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, c ongenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications.  
 
8.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_191299]. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_876037]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357684] (1) the study re -opening to ac crual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in 
consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under 
investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adve rse event profiles 
that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered at least 
possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible”, “probable”, or 
“definite”) that satisfy the followin g: 
 
• If [ADDRESS_1223542] 6 treated patients (or 30% after the first [ADDRESS_1223543] been accrued) 
experience a grade 3 or higher non -hematologic adverse event.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to 
verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment -related adverse 
event.  

37 
 8.5 Medical Monitoring  
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well 
as the construction and i mplementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 “Study 
Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number 
and type of serious adverse events.  
 
The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the patient at each visit during 
the study. Adverse events also may be detected when the patient volunteers them during or between visits or 
through physical examination, labor atory test, or other assessments. Please see Supplemental [ADDRESS_1223544] results will be 
identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes 
from baseline or the p revious visit, or values which are non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_191301]. 
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual patient and identifying adverse 
events. Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities are in cluded determined by [CONTACT_541139]. Adverse events will be recorded in the Adverse Events Case Report Form 
(CRF) under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, and severity. All adverse events will be 
treated appropriately. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspecte d relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the 
outcome (see Supplemental 3 ). Information about common side effects already known about the 
investigational drug can be found in the package insert. This information will be included in the patient 
informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.  The investigator will 
also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the 
patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to study treatment. This 
information shou ld be recorded in the investigator’s source documents, however, if the AE meets the criteria 
of an SAE. To ensure patient safety, every SAE (see Supplemental 3  for definition), regardless of suspected 
causality, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and after the patient begins taking study 
drug and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study participation will be recorded and reported to Incyte. 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 -day period should only be reported to Incyte if the investigator suspects a 
causal relationship to the study drug. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically 
significant” if other seri ousness criteria are not met. Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in 
deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that 
might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876038]. Any suspected transmission via a 
medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All AEs  (serious and 
non-serious) are captured and recorded, SAEs also require individual reporting (see Supplemental 3 ). To 
ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment must be reported to the 
sponsor -investigator within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to 
determine outcome, including sp ontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy 
follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship 
to the study treatment.  Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be 
reported on a SAE form.   
 
[ADDRESS_1223545] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI . (This information is contained 
within the Mayo IRB Informed Consent Template Section ). Study data will be securely stored on a password 
protected computer that only the research study team will have access to.  Any study related paper documents 
will be stored in a locked cabinet that only the research study team will have access to.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization t o collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at 
least vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these or iginal documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_876039], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject 
files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in 
the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because 
the procedure was not done or the q uestion was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been 
made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through th e incorrect entry and enter the correct data 
above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.  For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial an d date it.  If 
the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the details to justify the 
correction.  
 
 
Data Security and Confidentiality  
 
All study data will be collected by [CONTACT_5051], reviewed by [CONTACT_978], and stored in secure, locked files 
and/or databases in order to protect it from inadvertent loss or improper access. All laboratory specimens, 
evaluation forms, reports, and other r ecords will be identified by [CONTACT_876056]. Information gained from this study that can be linked to the subject's identity will not be 
released to anyone other than the investigators, the subject and the subject's p hysician. All the information 
obtained in connection with these studies will remain confidential as far as possible within state and federal 
[ADDRESS_1223546] subjects’ 
confidentiality. Case Report Forms will be coded. There will be no subject names or other directly i dentifiable 
information will not appear on any reports, publications, or other disclosures of clinical study outcomes.  
 
The sponsor -investigator will retain the specified records and reports for;  
1. Up to 2 years after the marketing application is approved for the drug; or, if a marketing application is 
not submitted or approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and delivery of the drug for 
investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been so notified. OR

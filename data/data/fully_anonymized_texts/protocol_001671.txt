PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
Background and Rationale:  
The results of both the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY- EXT trials show that api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a safe 
and efficacious alternative to current standards of care without the need for parenteral 
administration  or monitoring. Currently  there are three main  classes  of anticoagulants used 
for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which are well established and approved in adults, but are not approved for use in children: Vitamin  K Antagonists (VKA) 
(eg, warfarin),  unfractionated heparin  (UFH), and  low molecular  weight heparin  (LMWH), 
with the exception of one LMWH, FRAGMIN
® (dalteparin sodium) injection.31 Through 
extrapolation of the adult data, physicians are using these anticoagulants in children. The 
recommended therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) ranges  for VKA in children 
are directly extrapolated from recommendations for adult patients because there are no clinical trials that have assessed the optimal INR range for children.  Thus, for most 
indications, the therapeutic target INR is 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0). The unfractionated heparin (UFH) dose is selected based on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic ranges universally determined using plasma: aPTT by [CONTACT_293054] 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL  or an anti-Factor  Xa (FXa)  level  of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL.  Therapeutic ranges 
for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are extrapolated from adults and based on anti-factor Xa (anti -FXa) levels.  The guideline for therapeutic LMWHs being given 
subcutaneously twice  daily  is an anti-FXa level  of 0.50 to 1.0 units/mL  in a sample  taken  4 to 
6 hours following a subcutaneous injection. Using the same concept of extrapolation, this study will extrapolate efficacy  based  on achievement  of exposure in  children  ≥[ADDRESS_357155] 7 days and then 
5 mg twice daily thereafter in adults.  For the study’s pharmacokinetic (PK) neonate cohort, 
subjects ≤ [ADDRESS_357156] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] 5 to 
14 days prior to randomization, the dose will be targeted to achieve an exposure similar to 5 mg twice daily in adults.  For the study’s post-PK neonate cohort (ie, those neonates 
recruited  after the PK sub- analysis  is completed),  which  may be treated  with standard  of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292860] [ADDRESS_357157] week, and 5 mg twice daily thereafter.  
Study  Objectives:  
• Primary:  To assess the safety  and descriptive efficacy  of api[INVESTIGATOR_292861] a VTE; 
• S econdary: To evaluate api[INVESTIGATOR_292862] (PK) and anti-FXa activity  in 
pediatric subjects requiring anticoagulation for the treatment of a VTE.

symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrent VTE defined as either contiguous 
progression or non-contiguous new thrombus and including, but not limited  to, DVT, 
PE and paradoxical embolism and (ii) VTE- related mortality.  
Study Design:  
Treatment  assignment will not be blinded. Up to [ADDRESS_357158] of care (SOC), respectively. A goal of 30 or more  subjects  will be randomized into each of the following 3 age groups to be used for 
analysis: (1) 12 to <18 years; (2) 2 to <12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years; For age group 4, neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days), the sample size may be adjusted based on a PK sub- analysis  
that will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an api[INVESTIGATOR_292863] a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on 
api[INVESTIGATOR_292864] [ADDRESS_357159]-dose blood samples  for peak  and trough api[INVESTIGATOR_292865] 
(PK) and anti- FXa activity levels (Pharmacodynamic, PD) will be obtained.  
Radiologic imaging  will be performed,  and adjudicated,  to confirm  the index event  
(ie, primary  diagnosis of thromboembolic event  which  will be treated  with api[INVESTIGATOR_292866]). For subjects 2 years of age or older, in addition to the radiologic images obtained to confirm the index event, new radiologic images of the clot will be obtained at approximately the mid -point and end of treatment (EOT) visits. For subjects 28 days to 
<2 years  of age and neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days of age) imaging  should be performed  at the 
EOT.  All of the aforementioned images will be adjudicated.  Additional imaging 
assessments can be performed at any time during the study, at the discretion of the investigator. In addition, when medically appropriate, new radiologic images will be obtained if recurrent VTE is suspected. 
The palatability  of the api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  0.5 mg tablet  and 0.1 mg sprinkle capsule will also be 
assessed.

 approved amended  protocol  will be implemented  prior  to enrollment of each subsequent  age 
group and the dose rationale will be described in an appendix.  
The modeling and simulation results, described in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4, support the 
current dosing recommendation of fixed- dose body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric 
subjects aged 28 days to <18 years (Age Groups 1, 2, 3 in Table 1 ). As of May 2019, 
enrollment to Age Groups [ADDRESS_357162]

remain  as Age Group 1: 12 to <18 years;  Age Group  2: 2 to <12 years;  Age Group 3: 28 days 
to <2 years; Age Group 4: neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days). Appendix [ADDRESS_357163] an initial dose for neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days).  
Appendix 5 complements  Appendix 3 and Appendix 4. 
The enrollment  of neonates  and the dosing of  neonates,  will proceed  as follows: 
After being treated with standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292867] [ADDRESS_357164]’s daily api[INVESTIGATOR_9612] (AUCs) at steady- state.  If the subject’s predicted AUCss 
is outside the interval of 1293 to 4807 ng*hr/mL (90% prediction interval from adults with 5 mg twice  daily), api[INVESTIGATOR_292868].  Further 
details are included in Appendix 5. 
A PK sub -analysis will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an api[INVESTIGATOR_292869] a separate analysis  plan. Neonates  who continue 
to be recruited,  while  this PK sub-analysis  is ongoing, will still require  PK measurements  and 
potential dose adjustments, until the results of the sub- analysis and final dose determination 
have been completed.  
If the PK sub-analysis  confirms  that the 0.1 mg twice  a day (BID)  api[INVESTIGATOR_292870] -PK neonates the ongoing recruitment of neonates will continue, with a 
dose of 0.2 mg BID api[INVESTIGATOR_292871] 1 to 7, followed by 0.1 mg BID, thereafter. Should 
the PK sub-analysis  determine  that a different  dosing paradigm  is appropriate, a  subsequent 
protocol amendment will be required.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Venous  Thromboembolism  (VTE)  is rare in the pediatric  population in comparison to the 
adult population. In 1994, the Canadian Registry of VTE in children older than [ADDRESS_357187] led to an increasing awareness of the occurrence and sequelae of VTE in the pediatric population. A recent multicenter study demonstrated a 
dramatic  increase in the diagnosis  of VTE  at children’s  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292882]  2001 to  2007. During 
that 7 -year period, 11,337 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292883] 70% from  34 to 58 cases  per 10,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103978]  [Raffini  et 
al, 2009].

Children and adults are thought to share a common basic pathophysiology of venous 
thrombosis  based  on Virchow’s  triad.  Venous  stasis,  vascular  injury, and hypercoagulability 
all predispose  to thrombosis. In adults, several  risk factors  are known to  invoke  one or more 
of the Virchow conditions. These include prolonged immobilization, the presence of a 
central venous line, surgery, trauma, malignancy, pregnancy and puerperium, treatment with 
oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, 
and inherited disorders of coagulation. The pathophysiology of VTE in children is similar, 
but the contribution of each factor differs among age groups [Albisetti et al, 2012].3 
Differences between adult and pediatric coagulation factor values are variable: some factors are present  at adult  levels  or higher  from  birth, while  others  are extremely  low, rising  to adult 
values only in adolescence.  The mean values for fibrinogen, factor (F) V, FVIII, von 
Willebrand  factor,  and FXIII  are >70%  of adult  values  at birth. However,  for both premature 
and healthy full -term infants, the mean values for the contact [CONTACT_293058]  
K-dependent  factors  are <70%  of adult  values;  and while  increasing  throughout  childhood, 
they remain low, compared to adult levels, even into adolescence. The coagulation 
inhibitors, antithrombin  (AT),  heparin  cofactor  II (HCII),  protein C, and protein  S, are also 
decreased at birth.  AT and HCII reach adult levels around [ADDRESS_357188] 
be understood that there are differences  in the causes  of VTE,  when  comparing older  children 
to younger children and neonates. As described in the 2018 American Society of 
Hematology 2018 Guidelines for management of VTE:

Thromboembolism is a well- recognized complication of cancer in children. There are 
several  factors  which  contribute, including the presence  of a central  venous  catheter  (CVC), 
the underlying malignancy, dehydration, and infection [Macartney et al, 2011].18 
Primary  and secondary  antiphospholipid syndrome  results  in an increased  risk of deep  vein 
thrombosis (DVT), acute coronary syndrome, and transient ischemic attack.  In children, 
there is a long -term risk of recurrence following thrombosis, without long- term 
anticoagulation [Macartney et al, 2011].18 
Though inherited thrombophilia can play a role in VTE events in children, it is not as well understood as in the adult  population, partly  due to lack of studies;  therefore,  the significance 
is not clear [Macartney et al, 2011].
18 
Once a VTE  occurs, the progression of the disease and the aim of antithrombotic  therapy  are 
the same for both adults and children. They are to: 1) reduce the risk of death due to 
thrombus extension or embolization; 2) reduce the incidence of recurrent thrombosis;  
3) reduce  the incidence  of post thrombotic  syndrome  by [CONTACT_293059]; and  
4) maintain  vessel patency  and vascular access [Chalmers et al, 2011].[ADDRESS_357190] an underlying 
acquired risk factor for VTE (a CVC or underlying medical condition), recurrence is uncommon if the underlying cause is removed. In a study involving 153 consecutive 
neonates and children with VTE, 91 percent had an underlying medical condition and 77 percent had a CVC [Revel -Vilk et al, 2003].
26 The risk of VTE recurrence in this study 
was 10.5 percent;  in all children, the same acquired  risk factor  was present  in the first and the 
recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_292885].  In this population, the presence of a prothrombotic state or an 
elevated level of factor VIII was not associated with recurrence [Albisetti et al, 2012].3 
In children, particularly neonates, approximately two- thirds of VTEs are associated with the 
use of CVCs or access devices, which can impair vascular access and require intervention or lead to embolization [Andrew et al, 1994; van Ommen et al, 2001; Kuhle et al, 2004].
4,29,14 
CVCs  are extremely  important  for the long-  and short -term management  of pediatric  patients 
with a variety of severe diseases (eg, total parenteral nutrition; intensive fluid management; administration of blood products, antibiotics, and chemotherapy). Most CVC -associated 
VTEs occur in the upper venous system, in association with CVCs inserted percutaneously through a jugular  or subclavian  vein [Massicotte  et al, 1998].
19 Femoral  venous  catheters  are 
used less commonly but also can be associated with VTE [Worly et al, 2004].30 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

equipoise after completing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for their index event. The 
published results [Agnelli, G et al, 2013]
1 are as follows:  
• A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization, of whom 2482 were included in 
the intention -to-treat analyses.  Symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or 
death from venous thromboembolism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo, as compared with 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (a difference of 7.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 9.3) and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (a difference of 7.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.9 to 9.1) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the placebo group, 
0.2%  in the 2.5-mg api[INVESTIGATOR_292893], and 0.1%  in the 5-mg api[INVESTIGATOR_292893].  The rates

Currently  there are three  main  classes  of anticoagulants  used for the treatment of VTE,  which 
are well established and approved in adults, but are adapted yet not approved for use in children: VKA (eg, warfarin), UFH, and LMWH, with the exception of one LMWH, FRAGMIN
® (dalteparin sodium) injection.31 Through extrapolation of the adult data, 
physicians are using these anticoagulants in children. The recommended therapeutic INR  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

[Monagle  et al, 2012].
22 The UFH  dose  is selected  based  on activated  partial  thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) therapeutic ranges universally determined using plasma: aPTT by [CONTACT_293061] 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL or an anti -FXa level of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL [Monagle et al, 
2012].22 Therapeutic ranges for LMWH are extrapolated from adults and based on anti -FXa 
levels.  The guideline  for therapeutic LMWHs  being  given subcutaneously twice daily  (BID) 
is an anti -FXa level of 0.50 to 1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4 to 6 hours following a 
subcutaneous injection [Monagle et al, 2012].[ADDRESS_357195] 7 days and then 5 mg

This current pediatric VTE trial will enroll subjects who require anticoagulation for a newly 
diagnosed VTE. Subjects will be randomized to receive either api[INVESTIGATOR_292897].  The 
primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and descriptive efficacy of api[INVESTIGATOR_292898] a VTE with 12 weeks of therapy in subjects ≥  2 years of age or 6 to 12 weeks of therapy in subjects <2 years of age.

• Interim analysis 1 used PK data from 16 subjects (5, 7, and 4 subjects within the  
12 to <18, 6 to <12, and 2 to <6 years of age groups, respectively). The results 
showed that mean single -dose AUC (INF)  in children across all age groups was 
generally  similar  to the median  steady -state AUC (TAU)  in adult  patients  treated  with 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg BID for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. A linear 
relationship between api[INVESTIGATOR_292905] -FXa activity was observed,  
which  is consistent  with that observed in adult  subjects.  The results  of this analysis 
were used to support the dose selection rationale for Age Group 1, as described in 
Appendix 1, which is superseded by [CONTACT_76798] 3.

12 to <18 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years, and 9 months to <2 years of age 
groups, respectively). The results showed that the oral clearance increased with 
increasing  age and reached  values  similar  to those  of adults  in pediatric  subjects  older 
than 12 years. A linear relationship between api[INVESTIGATOR_292905] -FXa 
activity was observed, which is consistent with that observed in adult subjects. The 
results of this analysis were used to support the updated dose selection rationale for Age Group 1 and the new dose selection rationale for Age Group 2, as described in Appendix 2, which is superseded by [CONTACT_76798] 3.  
• Interim Analysis  3 used  PK data from  34 subjects  (8, 8, 8, 6 and  4 subjects  within  the 
12 to <18 years,  6 to <12 years,  2 to <6 years,  9 months  to <2 years  and 28 days  to 
<9 months of age groups, respectively). The results showed that the oral clearance 
increased with increasing age and reached values similar to those of adults in pediatric subjects older than 12 years. In addition, that oral clearance, when 
normalized  to body weight,  was constant  across  the pediatric  age range of 3 months 
to 18 years. The results of this analysis were used to support the dose selection 
rationale for pediatric subjects with aged 3 months to <18 years, as described in Appendix 3.

1.2.2. Pediatric Formulation  Development  
In April  2017, the Sponsor  suspended use of the api[INVESTIGATOR_292906]  <5 years 
of age in pediatric studies, including B0661037, because the daily intake of  
one of the key solubilizing  agents  in the api[INVESTIGATOR_292907],  would exceed 
the threshold specified in a 2014 draft European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline for 
children <5 years of age.10 The official EMA guidance was published in October 2017.11 
In order to resume enrollment of pediatric subjects <5 years of age in ongoing studies, the Sponsor  developed a 0.5 mg strength tablet  of the currently  approved  adult  formulation  for 
use in subjects  ≥3 months  of age (and a  minimum of 6  kg weight). The tablet  is relatively  
with approximately   weight. The composition 
(drug excipi[INVESTIGATOR_292908]) and manufacturing process (up to compression) for the 0.5- mg tablet 
is These 0.5- mg tablets also use  
the and final blend as the  . 
Therefore,  the 0.5-mg tablets  have  the same  pharmaceutical  characteristics  as the api[INVESTIGATOR_292909] a lower strength for the  
pediatric  use. 
In addition to 0.5 mg strength tablets,  the 0.1 mg sprinkle  capsules  will be available  for use in 
pediatric subjects.  
1.2.3. Dose  Selection  Age Groups 1,  2, and 3 
With  the introduction of 0.5 mg tablets,  the dosing  paradigm  of api[INVESTIGATOR_292910]/kg dosing to fixed- dose, body weight -tiered regimen, as outlined in Table 2  and 
supported by [CONTACT_76798] 3  and Appendix 4.  
The modeling and simulation results, described in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4, support the 
current dosing recommendation of fixed- dose body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric 
subjects  aged  28 days  to <18 years  (Age  Groups  1, 2,3 in 
Table 2). The age groups  used for 
analysis will remain as Age Group 1: 12 to <18 years; Age Group 2: 2 to <12 years;  
Age Group 3: 28 days to <2 years;  Age  Group 4: neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days).

 1.3. Benefit  & Risks  of Api[INVESTIGATOR_292917]. 
1.3.1. Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
As demonstrated  in a number  of clinical  studies, api[INVESTIGATOR_292918], predictable and lasting 
anticoagulant activity and a predictable PK profile.  Distinct features of api[INVESTIGATOR_292919], a pediatric oral 
dosing formulation with consistent absorption and no food effect, limited potential for clinically significant drug -drug interaction with other medications, no need for therapeutic 
monitoring, and a low risk of bleeding. These features may make it superior to currently 
available antithrombotic agents for thromboprophylaxis in children with a venous thromboembolism, thus addressing an unmet clinical need. All patients are expected to 
receive some benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when participating in study procedures, which  includes  multiple  clinic  visits,  physical  and laboratory examinations 
over the course of the study. 
1.3.2. Potential  Risks  to Subjects  
The primary safety risk for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], as well as any anticoagulant, is undesired bleeding. 
Based on safety data obtained in the adult clinical program from over 70,[ADDRESS_357208] -marketing experience 
from over 29 million adult patients worldwide, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]’s risk of bleeding is expected to be low, and comparable to that of subcutaneous LMWH. While api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]’s risk of bleeding has 
been  demonstrated  to be lower  than warfarin  (ARISTOTLE),
20 it is interesting  to learn  that in 
patients undergoing invasive procedures while taking api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], the rates (treatment 
interrupted, treatment  not interrupted)  of post-procedural  major  bleeding (1.65%, 1.59%)  and 
death (1.0%, 1.4 %) were low  whether api[INVESTIGATOR_292920]; whereas in 
patients taking warfarin, the rates of post -procedural major bleeding (1.26%, 3.04%) and 
death (0.5%, 2.0%) were at least 2- fold higher among those who continued warfarin versus 
those who interrupted treatment.2 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Protection  Against  Risks  
To minimize  the risk of bleeding, subjects  with active bleeding or high risk of bleeding 
(eg, central nervous system tumors) as well as intracranial bleed including recent  
intraventricular hemorrhage will be excluded from the study. Study subjects will be closely 
monitored for any bleeding and thromboembolic events and for overall safety. Study 
treatment will be held for clinically significant bleeding.  All bleeding events will be 
adjudicated  by [CONTACT_293063]  (EAC),  and the conduct  of the 
trial will be supervised by [CONTACT_293064] (EDMC) 
which also review the data from the other pediatric api[INVESTIGATOR_292921] a complete safety signal. The EDMC will have the responsibility to review the incidence of bleeding and 
thromboembolic events and will be provided with reports of SAEs on a regular basis. The 
EDMC may recommend modification or suspension of the trial for safety reasons.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

All female subjects  who, in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are biologically  capable of having 
children and are sexually active and at risk for pregnancy, must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 33 days (5 half -lives plus 30 days) after the last dose of 
investigational product, which includes SOC. The investigator, or his/her designee, in 
consultation with the subject, will select or confirm that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  
Subjects  need  to affirm  that they meet  at least one of the selected  methods  of contraception.

 effective contraception consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities  
(SOA)  and document  such conversation in the subject’s  chart.  In addition, the investigator  or 
his/her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception 
method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure  rate of less than 1% per year  when  used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect  use) and 
include the following:  
1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception are allowed provided the subject remains on the same treatment throughout  the entire  study and has been  using that hormonal  contraceptive for an 
adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.  
2. Correctly  placed copper  containing intrauterine  device (IUD).  
3. Male condom  or female condom  used WITH  a spermicide  (ie, foam,  gel, film,  cream, 
suppository). For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly effective contraception, this option is not appropriate.  
4. Bilateral  tubal  ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_292932] 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).  
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completely and persistently refraining from all heterosexual  intercourse  (including during the entire  period of risk associated  with the study 
treatments) may obviate the need for contraception.

The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended  storage  conditions  and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
Investigational  product  should be stored  in its original  container  and in accordance with the 
drug label.  
Storage  conditions  stated  in the Single  Reference Safety  Document  (SRSD)  will be 
superseded by [CONTACT_4671].  
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable,  including frozen, refrigerated  and/or  room  temperature  products). This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study. Even for 
continuous  monitoring systems,  a log or  site procedure  which  ensures  active  daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be available. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage  unit (for example,  refrigerator),  as applicable, should be regularly  inspected  to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor 
or Sponsor’s  delegate upon discovery. The site should actively  pursue  options  for returning 
the product to labeled storage conditions, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage 
requirements,  including any actions  taken,  must  be documented and reported  to the sponsor.  
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined in required temperature conditions  and not used until the sponsor  provides  documentation of permission 
to use the investigational product. Specific details regarding information the site should 
report for each excursion will be provided to the site. 
Site staff will instruct  subjects/legally  acceptable representatives  on the storage  requirements 
for take home medications including how to report temperature excursions. 
Drug  storage  for standard  of care treatments  will be based  on local  practice and  as indicated 
in the drug label.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

collected before such withdrawal of consent.  
6.8. Lost  to Follow -up 
All reasonable efforts  must  be made to  locate subjects  to determine  and report  their  ongoing 
status.  This includes  follow -up with persons  authorized  by [CONTACT_293073]. Lost 
to follow -up is defined by [CONTACT_199857] a minimum of three 
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by [CONTACT_180813].  All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. 
If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  
If investigator’ s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the 
study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a Sponsor -retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s

determined by [CONTACT_109415]’s medical records.  
7. ASSESSMENTS 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safety  and well-being  of the subject.  When  a protocol  required  test cannot  be performed,  the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.  
7.1. Physical Examination  
Physical exam, including vital signs (heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure) and physical  measurements (height/body length and  body weight) will be conducted at screening.  
Since dosing will be based  on body weight, minimal clothing should be worn  during the body 
weight measurement.  
Uncontrolled severe  hypertension at randomization is an exclusion  criterion  and is defined  as 
a systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 99

7.2. Blood Volume  Collection  
7.2.1. For Subjects  28 Days of Age or Older  
The current  total maximum potential blood sampling volume for individual subjects  
(ie, ≥ 28 days of age, and ≥4 kg weight) in this study is approximately 16.7 mL (this would 
include the optional 6-12 week extension visit for api[INVESTIGATOR_292971]) for subjects 
randomized to api[INVESTIGATOR_292972] 9.3 mL for subjects randomized to SOC. Maximum blood volumes will be based on the child’s weight and in accordance with local thresholds. The 
actual collection times of blood sampling may change. INR may need to be repeated as per 
local  site procedures for those subjects  on standard  of care (SOC).  Additional blood samples 
may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by [CONTACT_1034], provided the total volume taken  during the study does not exceed  1% of the total blood volume (eg,  0.8 mL/kg) 
at a single instance and up to 3% (2.4 mL/kg) over a four- week  period in accordance with the 
2008 version of the EU guidance titled, ‘Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products with the Paediatric Population.’

7.2.2. For Neonates  (≤27 days of age)  
Given the low body weight of neonates, and their low absolute circulating blood volume, 
special attention must be paid to the amount of blood drawn for neonates. For the neonates recruited  into the study, prior to the completion  of the neonate PK sub- analysis,  it is expected 
that the maximum blood volume for the 3 api[INVESTIGATOR_292973] ≤ [ADDRESS_357270] venous phlebotomy. Dried blood spot (DBS) analysis has been developed as a blood volume preservation option for neonates (approximately 45 microliters of blood per DBS sample). If DBS is the method of choice, a hematocrit result must have been drawn and available from a local laboratory within 48-[ADDRESS_357271] PK sample timepoint (Day [ADDRESS_357272] PK cohort). Further details of blood collection and processing will be provided to the site in a procedure manual. Additional blood samples  may be taken  for safety  assessments at 
times specified by [CONTACT_1034], provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 1% of the total blood volume (eg, 0.8 mL/kg) at a single instance and up to 3%

7.3. Laboratory Assessments 
The following laboratory  tests are required  to satisfy  the exclusion criteria  for this study and 
should be analyzed by [CONTACT_293075]: platelets, 
serum creatinine, eGFR, ALT, conjugated bilirubin, and pregnancy test when applicable.  
Only  the most  recent  laboratory  results,  obtained within  7 days prior  to randomization, may 
be used to satisfy this requirement. 
Blood samples for analysis by a central laboratory will be obtained during the Day 1 and 
Day 42 visits (and when applicable, Days 126 and 168) to establish baseline values  and to 
assess safety.  Note  for subjects  <[ADDRESS_357278] of central 
laboratory tests and noted in the appropriate CRF to provide the required laboratory parameters for evaluation.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

7.3.1. Platelet  Assessment  and Treatment  Guidelines  for Thrombocytopenia  
Platelet counts should be ≥ 50×109 per liter (L) prior to randomization.  There are no 
evidence -based guidelines for anticoagulation therapy in relation to platelet counts. Close 
monitoring of platelet  count  and careful  watching  for signs  of bleeding may be necessary  in 
children  with an anticipated  drop in platelet  count  due to comorbid conditions  and treatments.  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_292976], the following guidelines  are recommended during 
the course of the study period with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]:  
• Full-dose api[INVESTIGATOR_292977]  ≥50×109 per L; 
• Hold  api[INVESTIGATOR_292970]  <50×109 per L and restart  when  platelet  count  
≥50x109 per L or presumed  to be above  this threshold following a platelet  transfusion.  
Standard of Care  
SOC should be managed according to local practice.  
7.3.2. Estimated  Glomerular  Filtration  Rate  Assessment  
The enrollment  criterion  for eGFR  will be estimated  based  on the Schwartz  formula 
[Schwartz et al, 2009].27 
Inadequate renal  function is defined  as <30%  of [ADDRESS_357279]  deviation  (SD) below  normal 
GFR for age and size as determined by [CONTACT_47831] [eGFR  
(ml/min/1.73m2) = 0.413 * (height (cms)/serum creatinine (mg/dL) for ages up to 2 years. 
Beyond 2 years  of age, the qualifying GFR  for this study is ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2. If serum 
creatinine concentration is measured in SI units (umoles/L), divide this number by [CONTACT_293076] 88.4 to get the SI units (mg/dL) before inserting into the Schwartz 
formula to calculate eGFR].  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with 
sensitivity  of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, on Days 1, 14, 42, and at 
the end of treatment  visit.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done  whenever  one menstrual  cycle is

the exact  nominal  time  relative  to dosing.  In addition, the  date and  time  of administration  for 
the last 6 doses of api[INVESTIGATOR_292979] a pre -dose PK/PD sample on the day of the Day 14 visit 
will be recorded.  Anti-FXa activity will be measured as a PD assessment using an aliquot 
from the plasma of the PK/PD sample.  If DBS is the method of choice, a hematocrit result 
must have been drawn and available from a local laboratory  within 48- 72 hours prior to each 
PK sample timepoint (Day 1 for PK cohort, Day 14 and/or Day [ADDRESS_357283] PK cohort).  
If one or both samples  are not drawn  during the Day 14 visit,  then the procedure  should be 
repeated at the Day 42 visit to obtain the missing sample(s). If viable samples are not 
obtained on Day 14 or Day 42, the site monitor should be notified. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 7.7. Bleeding  Assessments  
All bleeding events  will be adjudicated  by a blinded, independent  adjudication committee  as 
major bleeding, clinically  relevant non -major bleeding, or minor bleeding.  These endpoints 
are consistent with those recommended by [CONTACT_293080] [Mitchell LG, 2011].21 
The adjudication committee will maintain the actual definitions used for adjudication.  
Bleeding  definitions  are based  on the  Perinatal  and Paediatric Haemostasis  Subcommittee  of 
the International Society  on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria, and are described 
as follows:  
Major  bleeding  is defined as bleeding that satisfies  one or more  of the following  criteria:  
a (i) fatal bleeding; (ii) clinically  overt bleeding associated with a decrease in Hgb of at least 
20 g/L (2 g/dL)  in a 24-h period;  (iii) bleeding that is retroperitoneal,  pulmonary, intracranial, 
or otherwise involves the central nervous system; and (iv) bleeding that requires surgical intervention in an operating suite (including interventional radiology).  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies one or both of 
the following:  (i) overt  bleeding for which  a blood product  is administered,  and which  is not 
directly attributable to the subject’s underlying medical condition and (ii) bleeding that 
requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating 
suite.  
Minor bleeding: is defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not 
fulfill the above  criteria  for either  major bleeding or clinically  relevant,  non- major  bleeding.  
Although menstrual bleeding may result in a medical consultation and/or intervention, this 
will be classified  as a minor  bleeding event  rather  than clinically  relevant  non-major  bleeding 
event.  
All bruising events  are reportable as  a bleeding event.  
All bleeding events  and their  supporting documentation MUST be  sent for adjudication.  
7.7.1. Treatment  Guidelines  for Bleeding/Suspected  Bleeding  
Subjects with bleeding or suspected bleeding should undergo confirmatory laboratory or other testing [eg, ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI)],  as indicated  clinically
. The date and  time of the onset  of the bleeding event 
will be recorded on the CRF.

The following  treatment  measures  may be considered:  
• Identify  the source  and institute  local  measures  to stop the bleeding;  
 
• Perform  laboratory  test monitoring (eg, hemoglobin,  INR,  aPTT,  platelet 
count, anti -Factor Xa activity); 
 
• Monitor api[INVESTIGATOR_292987] -Factor Xa assay rather than the more 
standard  coagulation tests (eg, INR,  aPTT) which  are less sensitive  to 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822];  
 
• If bleeding occurs  up to 6 hours  after api[INVESTIGATOR_292988],  administer  activated 
charcoal oral solution to reduce api[INVESTIGATOR_292989];  
 
• Institute  appropriate  symptomatic  treatment  (eg, mechanical  compression, 
surgical intervention, fluid replacement and hemodynamic support, blood 
product or component transfusion);  
 
• For bleeding that does not respond to local measures, administer fresh frozen 
plasma  (FFP)  as a supportive  measure,  recognizing  that FFP does not reverse the 
anticoagulant effects of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
Major  Bleeding  Api[INVESTIGATOR_292986].  
 
The following  treatment  measures  may be considered.

this agent in api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]- treated subjects.  Its effectiveness for counteracting 
the effects of api[INVESTIGATOR_292990].  
 
• Administer activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC, also referred to as factor IX 
concentrate), but considering the variety of formulations available and the 
complexity  of dosing,  the decision  to employ  aPCC or PCC should be made 
by [CONTACT_293081].

formulations available, which differ in their concentration of clotting factors (II, VII, IX  
and X). Dosing depends on body weight, the formulation of PCC employed, the degree of 
anticoagulation (INR),  the clinical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_292991].  
Thrombotic  events  have  been  reported  with PCC use. Given  the complexity  of the dosing 
and the risks involved, it is recommended that the decision to employ a PCC for warfarin 
associated  hemorrhage  be made by [CONTACT_293082]. There are no data regarding the use of PCC for treatment of api[INVESTIGATOR_292992].

charcoal may be useful in managing exposure to api[INVESTIGATOR_292995].  
7.8. Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the adjudicated composite of: (i) all image -confirmed and 
adjudicated symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrent VTE defined as either contiguous progression or non-contiguous  new thrombus  and including, but not limited  to, DVT,  PE and 
paradoxical embolism and (ii) VTE -related mortality.  This endpoint is consistent with that 
recommended by [CONTACT_293083] [Mitchell LG, 2011].
21 All components of the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.  
Subjects will be assessed for signs or symptoms of VTE (eg, swelling, localized pain, 
redness, heat, localized warmth, unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain that gets worse 
with a deep breath, coughing or chest movement or coughing up blood) throughout the 
course of the study (inclusive of treatment and follow -up periods). If signs and symptoms 
are present, then subjects will undergo a diagnostic examination to confirm recurrence of VTE.  Suspected  VTE  that occurs  at any time after enrollment  should also be reported  as an 
AE or a SAE.  All VTE will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_293084] a blinded manner.  
Materials  and detailed  instructions  for completing  and submitting  the required  documentation 
to the adjudication committee will be provided to the sites.  Investigators are encouraged to 
send the dossier  to the adjudication  committee  for assessment  within  2 weeks  of awareness  of 
the suspected outcome occurrence.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 7.8.1. Imaging Assessments 
• Children 2 years to <18 years: In addition to the radiologic images obtained to 
confirm the index event,  new radiologic images of the index clot site  will be obtained 
during the midpoint of the study (Day  42 ± 14 days), and at the end of treatment visit 
(Day 84 ± 7 days). If applicable, radiologic images may be obtained at Days 126 
(EOT) or Day 168 (EOT) (refer to the Extension Phase SOA ). At the midpoint and 
end of treatment visits, the investigator will reassess the index event and all areas around the index event  that were scanned  initially  based  on the clinical  assessment,  to 
account for the presence of any new asymptomatic clots. At the midpoint (Day 42) 
and end of treatment (Day 84) visits, radiologic images that require sedation or 
radiation are not required and may be omitted, if not medically necessary. In 
addition, when medically appropriate, new radiologic images will be obtained if recurrent VTE is suspected.  All assessments obtained in the evaluation of 
symptomatic or asymptomatic recurrent VTEs will be adjudicated.  
• Children < 2 years  of age: For neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days) and  children  28 days to  
<2 years  of age, if the treatment duration is <12 weeks,  a midpoint image  may be 
omitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• Additional imaging  assessments can be performed  at the discretion  of the Investigator 
at any time during the study. 
The study does not prohibit further monitoring via radiologic images  as part of standard 
practice for the care of the patient.  
7.8.2. Criteria  for Thrombus  Review  by [CONTACT_293085]:  
• “Resolution”: Complete  disappearance of the thrombus compared to  the index event.  
• “Regression”:  Unequivocal decrease (>50%) of the total volume/mass  of the 
thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Unchanged”:  No significant change in the extent  (defined  as <=50%  change in 
volume/mass) or location of the thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Recurrence-Contiguous”: Unequivocal increase (>50%) of the total volume/mass of 
the thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Recurrence -New”:  
• Thrombus resolution followed by [CONTACT_293086]; or 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

For subjects  receiving  api[INVESTIGATOR_3822],  palatability  will be assessed  at the Day [ADDRESS_357288] and/or legal guardian in the form of a questionnaire.  
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse  Event  (AE)  is defined  as any new untoward medical  occurrence  or worsening of 
a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study drug (investigational product) and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
 
GRADE  If required  on the AE page  of the CRF,  the investigator  will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING or DEATH to  
describe  the maximum intensity  of the AE. For purposes  of consistency, these 
intensity grades are defined as follows:  
1 MILD  Does  not interfere  with participant’s  usual  function.  
2 MODERATE  Interferes  to some  extent  with participant’s  usual 
function.  
3 SEVERE  Interferes  significantly  with participant’s  usual 
function.  
4 LIFE -THREATENING  Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention 
indicated.  
5 DEATH  Results  in death.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 The causal  relationship to study drug is determined  by a physician and should be used to 
assess all adverse events (AE).  The causal relationship can be one of the following:  
• Related:  There is a reasonable causal  relationship  between  study drug administration 
and the AE.  
• Not related:  There is not a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship"  means  there is evidence  to suggest  a causal 
relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or  evaluation  of a subject  (In order  to prevent  reporting bias,  subjects  should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs).  
8.1. Serious  Adverse Events  
A Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) is  any untoward medical occurrence that  at any  dose:  
• Results  in death;  
• Is life-threatening  (defined  as an event  in which  the subject  was at risk of death  at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292996] 
(see NOTE below);  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes  listed  in the definition  above). Examples  of such events  include,  but are not 
limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event.  (See Section 8.7 for the definition of potential DILI).  
Suspected  transmission  of an infectious  agent  (eg, pathogenic  or nonpathogenic)  via the 
study drug is an SAE. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer,  and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. (See 
Section  8.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).  
Any component of a study  endpoint that is considered related  to study therapy (eg, death  is 
an endpoint, if  death  occurred  due to  anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported)  should be 
reported as SAE (see Section 8.1.1 for reporting details). 
NOTE:  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292997]:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours, that does not 
result  in admission  (unless considered  an important medical  or life-threatening event);  
• Elective  surgery,  planned  prior to signing consent;  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure;  
• Routine health  assessment  requiring admission  for baseline/trending of health  status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy); 
• Medical/surgical  admission  other than to remedy  ill health  and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases; 
• Admission  encountered  for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing  on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason);  
• Admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy  in the absence of any  other  SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols). 
8.1.1. Serious  Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. Following the subject’s  written  consent to participate  in the study, all SAEs,  whether  related 
or not related  to study drug, must be collected,  including those thought to be associated  with 
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 
period and up to the follow-up visit (35 ± 5 days after the EOT visit). 
The investigator must also report  any SAE  that occurs after these time periods and that is 
believed to be related to study drug or protocol- specified procedure.  
An SAE  report must be completed  for any event  where doubt exists  regarding its  seriousness . 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Approved  v 11.80.0 930084727  10.0  
 If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related 
to the conditions  of the study (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy, or a complication  of a 
study procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, SAE updates with follow -up 
information  and pregnancies  must  be reported  to BMS  (or designee)  within  [ADDRESS_357289] be recorded on the SAE Report Form and submitted to BMS (or designee); pregnancies  must  be reported  on a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  (electronic  or paper 
forms) and submitted to BMS (or designee).  
SAEs must also be reported as Adverse Events in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  and the event  marked  as ‘serious’.  Recording  an Adverse  Event  and marking 
it ‘serious’ in the eCRF is not a substitute for reporting the SAE as described above.  
SAE  Email  Address:  Refer  to Contact  [CONTACT_143969]. 
SAE  Facsimile  Number:  Refer  to Contact  [CONTACT_143969]. 
In all cases, an SAE Reporting Form must be submitted as directed above.  For studies 
capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the required method for reporting. In the event  the electronic system  is unavailable  for transmission  paper 
forms must be used and submitted immediately.  When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.  
SAE  Telephone  Contact  (required  for SAE  and pregnancy  reporting):  Refer  to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].  
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required.  
(Note:  Follow -up SAE  reports  must  include  the same investigator  term(s) initially  reported).  
If an ongoing SAE  changes  in its intensity  or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
8.2. Nonserious  Adverse Events  
A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as  serious.  
8.2.1. Nonserious  Adverse Event  Collection  and Reporting  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in 
period or other  observational  period intended to establish  a baseline status  for the subjects.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Nonserious  AEs should be followed to resolution or  stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious  (see Section  8.1.1).  Follow -up is also required  for nonserious  AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study 
treatment as appropriate.  All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on 
the nonserious  AE page of  the CRF  (paper  or electronic).  Completion  of supplemental  CRFs 
may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during 
the course of the study. 
8.3. Laboratory Test Result  Abnormalities  
The following laboratory  test result  abnormalities  should be captured  on the nonserious  AE 
CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) and the AE CRF page as appropriate:  
• Any laboratory test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets  the definition  of an 
SAE.  
• Any laboratory test result  abnormality  that required the subject  to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted. 
• Any laboratory test result  abnormality  that required  the subject  to receive specific 
corrective therapy.  
It is expected  that wherever  possible, the clinical  rather  than laboratory  term would be used 
by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
8.4. Pregnancy  
If, following initiation  of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered  that a study subject  is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
[ADDRESS_357290] administration (3 days) plus [ADDRESS_357291] immediately notify the Medical Monitor/designee of this event and 
complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form within [ADDRESS_357292]  be reported  on the

 8.5. Medication  Error  
A medication  error is any: 
• Unintentional  error in the prescribing.  
• Dispensing or administration of a medicinal product that may cause or lead to 
inappropriate  medication  use or patient  harm  while  in the control  of the health  care 
professional, patient or consumer. 
The following are medication errors  for Api[INVESTIGATOR_292998]:  
• Missed  doses  due to misunderstanding of the dosing schedule  (ie, QD instead  of 
BID).  
• Four  or more  consecutive  missed  doses.  
• A consistent  dosing schedule  outside  of BID (ie, QD,  TID,  QID),  unless  otherwise 
directed.  
• A consistent  dose above  or below  that which  was prescribed  based  on IRT. 
• Extending the Week  [ADDRESS_357293]  be reported  as SAEs  (see Section  8.1.1 for reporting 
details).  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product  that is considered  both excessive and medically  important.  All occurrences  of 
overdose must be reported as an SAE (see Section 8.1.1 for reporting details).

Detailed methodology for summary  and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in an Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456]. This 
document  may modify the plans  outlined in the protocol;  however, any major  modifications 
of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.  
Efficacy  and safety  outcomes  will be presented  using descriptive  statistics  including but not 
limited to means and standard deviations for continuous variables along with counts and frequencies for discrete variables.  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
This is a descriptive  study, and there is no formal  pre-defined hypothesis  testing.  Therefore, 
there is no power calculation for the sample size determination. Throughout the trial, the 
study team, in conjunction with regulators (ie, Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), will evaluate exposure duration, imaging  results,  and other  aspects  of the trial to  determine if  the 
data from the subjects in the trial are sufficient to address the objectives of the trial.  It is 
expected that a sample size up to 250, increased from an original sample size of 150, is needed in order to provide a reasonable safety and pharmacokinetic database in pediatric subjects.  A target of 30 subjects will be randomized into each of the following three age 
groups: (1) 12 to <18 years; (2) 2 to <12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years. For age group 4, 
neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days), the sample size may be adjusted based on a PK sub- analysis 
that will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an api[INVESTIGATOR_292863] a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on 
api[INVESTIGATOR_292864] 20 subjects. 
9.2. Efficacy Analysis  
Appropriate  summary  statistics  as described  at the beginning of this section  will be presented 
for all efficacy endpoints. A summary of overall results along with summaries for each of 
the age group will be presented. The neonates who are enrolled under amendment 8 without 
2 to 1 randomization will be excluded in the overall population efficacy endpoints analyses. 
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
There is no planned hypothesis testing for primary endpoint. Primary endpoint will be 
summarized  by [CONTACT_2948]. The event  rates  and their corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented for each treatment group. 
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
There  is no planned  hypothesis  testing  for secondary endpoint. Secondary  endpoints  will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The event rates and their corresponding 95% confidence

It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits  and possible  audits  or inspections  and that sufficient  time is devoted to the 
process.  
11. DATA HANDLING  AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
11.1. Case  Report  Forms/Electronic Data  Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF  should be understood to refer to either  a paper  form  or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed 
original  CRFs  are the sole property of [COMPANY_007]  and should not be made available  in any form  to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].  
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety  and laboratory data entered  on the CRFs  and any other  data collection  forms  (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The 
CRFs  must  be signed by [CONTACT_293088].  Any corrections  to entries  made in  the CRFs  or source 
documents  must  be dated,  initialed  and explained  (if necessary)  and should not obscure  the 
original entry.  
In most  cases,  the source documents  are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s  or the physician's  subject  chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases,  a document  should  be available at the investigator’s  site as well as at [COMPANY_007]  and clearly 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

B0661037/CV185- [ADDRESS_357309]  Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence  (eg, letters,  meeting  minutes,  telephone  calls reports).  The records  should be 
retained by [CONTACT_4710] (ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.  
If the investigator  becomes  unable  for any reason  to continue  to retain  study records  for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectively notified. The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_357310]  obtain [COMPANY_007]'s  written  permission  before  disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
12. ETHICS  
12.1. Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)/  Ethics  Committee  (EC)  
It is the responsibility  of the  investigator  to have  prospective  approval  of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements,  if applicable,  from  the IRB/EC.  All correspondence  with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].  
The only circumstance in which  an amendment  may be initiated  prior  to IRB/EC  approval  is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately after the implementation.  
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal  and regulatory requirements,  as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).  
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

high standards of confidentiality and protection of subject personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.  
In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified  as beneficial  in the study. This information  should also be disclosed  to participants 
during the informed consent process. All study participants should be informed about the 
outcome of the study.  
The informed  consent/assent  documents  must  be in compliance  with ICH GCP,  local 
regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.  
The informed  consent/assent  documents  used during the informed  consent  process  must  be 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_456], approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC before  use, and available  for inspection.  
The investigator must ensure that each study subject, or his or her legally acceptable 
representative,  or parent(s)  or legal  guardian  if a minor, is fully  informed  about  the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally acceptable representative/parent(s) or legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. If the 
investigator determines that a subject’s decisional capacity is so limited, he/she cannot reasonably  be consulted, as permitted  by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent  with local  regulatory and 
legal requirements, then the subject’s assent may be waived with source documentation of  
the reason assent was not obtained. If the study subject does not provide his/her own 
consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide consent  
(eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent  was the subject’s  legally  acceptable representative,  the consent  signer’s 
relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse) and that the subject’s assent was 
obtained, or waived. If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source 
documents.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

enrollment of ‘emancipated minors’ is permitted by [CONTACT_293089], the IRB/EC, and local law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the permission of a parent or legal guardian.  
The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed consent  from  each subject  or the subject's  legally  acceptable representative,  parent(s)  or legal 
guardian and the subject’s assent, when applicable, before any study- specific activity is 
performed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by [CONTACT_2717]/EC. The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent document. 
12.4. Subject  Recruitment  
Advertisements  and recruitment materials  approved by [CONTACT_293090].  
12.5. Reporting  of Safety  Issues and  Serious  Breaches  of the Protocol  or ICH GCP  
In the event  of any prohibition or restriction  imposed (ie, clinical  hold)  by [CONTACT_293091],  or if the investigator  is aware  of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by [CONTACT_1205], and of any serious  breaches  of this protocol  or of ICH GCP  that the investigator  becomes  aware of. 
13. DEFINITION  OF END  OF TRIAL  
13.1. End of Trial  in a Member State  
End of Trial  in a Member  State  of the European Union is defined  as the time at which  it is 
deemed  that sufficient  number  of subjects  have  been  recruited  and completed  the study as 
stated in the regulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated 
number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State.  
13.2. End of Trial  in all other  Participating  Countries  
End of Trial  in all other  participating countries  is defined  as last  subject last  visit (LSLV).  
14. SPONSOR  DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination  of this study may occur  because of  a regulatory authority decision, 
change  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC,  drug safety  problems, or at the discretion  of [COMPANY_007].  In 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of api[INVESTIGATOR_293004]. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models were developed for the adult VTE treatment 
population based on data from the Phase 2 and 3 VTE treatment clinical trials and for the pediatric population based on data from the pediatric PK/PD studies (CV185079 and CV185118). Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using these 
models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric  PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population.

achieve an exposure (daily AUCss) equivalent to that associated with a safe and effective dose regimen in the adult VTE treatment population ( Table 8 ). A combined approach using 
fixed doses along with weight -based dosing was evaluated in the simulation, as shown 
below:  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 12 to <18 years  who are >40 kg will receive 10 mg 
twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter.  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 12 to <18 years  who  are ≤ 40 kg will receive a  dose of 
0.2 mg/kg twice  daily  for 7  days  followed by 0.1 mg/kg twice  daily  thereafter.

The horizontal  black  line and the black  number  within  the box represent  the median  of the simulated  data.  The 
dotted red line and the red number represent the target exposure identified in the VTE treatment adult 
population.  The height  of the box is equal  to the interquartile  distance  or IQD,  which  is the difference between 
the third and first quartiles of the data.  The whiskers (the lines extending from the top and bottom of the box) 
extend to the nearest value not beyond a standard span from the quartiles, which  is 1.5 times the IQD from the 
center of the data.  
 
The ongoing CV185118 study will also enroll  children  in 2 younger  age groups  (from  2 years 
to <6 years and neonates to <2 years) in a phased approach. As PK data are obtained for 
these additional age groups, the PPK model will be updated and simulations will be 
performed to select doses for the 3 younger age groups of neonates, 28 days to <2 years, and 2 years to <12 year in Study B0661037/CV185- 325.

A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model was developed for the adult VTE treatment 
population based on data from the Phase 2 and 3 VTE treatment clinical trials. For the 
pediatric population, a PPK model was  developed using the data from the ongoing Study 
CV185118. Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using these 
models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population.

evaluated for simplified and accurate dosing. In addition, the body weight cut -off was 
changed from 40 kg to 35 kg to ensure a smooth transition of doses between administration with oral solution and tablets. A combined approach using fixed doses along with 
weight -based  dosing was evaluated  in the simulation,  as shown below:  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 2 to <18 years  who are ≥35 kg will receive 10 mg twice

A total of 4000 subjects (2000 subjects for each Age Group) were randomly sampled from the age range of 2 years  to <[ADDRESS_357333]’s age and sex. The PK

12 <18 years  for, Age  Group 2: 2-<12 years,  and Age  Group 3: 28 days - <2 years])  were  
randomly sampled  from  the Centers  for Disease Control  and Prevention growth chart  based 
on each subject’s  age and sex. Simulated  subjects  whose  body weight  was less than 4 kg or 
age was less than 28 days were removed. Since the enrollment  of subjects  2 to <18 years  is 
closed as of May 10, 2019, simulation subjects ≥ 2 years were also removed.  
The final PK simulation  results  are summarized  as box-and-whisker  plots  for each weight  tier 
in Figure 4. The PK simulation had 286, 567, 2771, 4548, and 1559 simulated subjects for  
4 to <5 kg, 5 to <6 kg, 6 to <9 kg, 9 to <12 kg, and 12 to <18 kg tiers, respectively. No 
subjects  <[ADDRESS_357344]  body  weight  ≥18 kg based  on the growth chart.  The 
results show that this fixed -dose body weight tiered regimen in the newly proposed 4- <6 kg 
tiers is expected to achieve a median exposure that is similar to the median exposure in adults. While the simulation using the IA3C final model predicted ~30% increase in  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Appendix  5. B0661037/CV185- 325 Dose  Selection  Rationale  for Age Group  4 (≤27 Days 
of Age) in Amendment 7 - PK Cohort Neonates  
A population pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  model  was developed  for the adult  VTE treatment 
population based on data from the Phase 2 and 3 VTE treatment clinical trials. For the 
pediatric population, a PPK model was developed using the data from the ongoing 
Study CV185118. Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using 
these models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population. 
A PPK analysis, incorporating data from Phase 1, [ADDRESS_357345] -order elimination.2 
provides a summary of the predicted daily steady -state api[INVESTIGATOR_9612] (AUCss) for adult 
VTE treatment patients with the 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses based on the PPK model.

The estimated oral clearance of api[INVESTIGATOR_293034].  For pediatric 
subjects  older  than  12 years  of age,  oral clearance values  are similar  to those of  adults. Body 
weight  was an important  covariate  for oral clearance of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. In addition, oral clearance, 
when normalized to body weight, was generally constant across the pediatric age range of  
28 days to 18 years. The magnitude  of inter-individual  variability  in oral clearance is similar 
between adults and pediatric subjects (~30%).  
For the first 5 neonates ( ≤27 days of age) randomized to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], subjects will receive 
standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129528] [ADDRESS_357348]’s age and sex.  Simulated subjects had a body weight of 2.[ADDRESS_357349] 5 days of SOC treatment 
prior to api[INVESTIGATOR_292947]. 
The PK simulation  results  are summarized  as box-and-whisker  plot in Figure  5. 
The results show that the initial dose of 0.1 mg twice daily for neonates is expected to result 
in a slightly lower exposure (~30%) than that in adults with [ADDRESS_357350] of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] ≥ [ADDRESS_357351]’s daily api[INVESTIGATOR_9612] (AUCss) at steady- state.  If the

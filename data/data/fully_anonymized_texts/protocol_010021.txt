The principal features of the statistical analysis 
to be performed are described in this section. A 
more technical and detailed elaboration of the 
principal features will be presented in the SAP, 
which will be approved and singed prior to 
database lock. 
The primary study objective is to estimate the 
X842 dose for Phase 3 study with good 
precision, and hence comparison of different 
doses of X842 to the active comparator arm 
(lansoprazole 30 mg) will not involve any 
formal statistical testing. 
The primary analysis evaluating the dose-
response relationship based on different doses 
of X842, as well as secondary analyses will 
additionally assess the two subgroups, eGERD 
LA grade C or D and eGERD LA grade A or B 
(partial responders to PPI [CONTACT_3148]).  
All data measured on a continuous scale will 
be presented using summary statistics. 
Summary statistics is defined as number (N), 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum Q1, Q3 and maximum 
value. Where appropriate 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented.  
Categorical data will be presented as counts 
and percentages. When applicable, summary 
data will be presented by [CONTACT_3148], and by 
[CONTACT_81510]. Individual patient data will 
be listed by [CONTACT_56324], treatment, and, 
where applicable, by [CONTACT_81510]. Duplicated text

and sufficient notice is given in advance of the 
intended termination.  
The study may be placed on hold for 
evaluation of possible risk to patients, prior to 
decision as to whether to terminate the study if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
At least 3 patients experience a similar 
unexpected AE, which is assessed as severe 
and is probable/possible related to the IMP.  
The occurrence of an SAE, if considered 
probable/possible related to the IMP.  
A study termination will be initiated pending 
the outcome of any SAE investigation; 
termination will be based on the circumstances 
surrounding the event and findings with 
unblinding of the Sponsor medical monitor, if 
necessary.  
The study will be discontinued for any of the 
following reasons:  
If overall 5 (five) X842-treated patients 
develop the same type of AESI and the 
frequency is at least 2 × higher than in the 
comparator group.  
If 3 (three) X842-treated patients meet Hy’s 
Law criteria (≥ 3 × ULN for ALT or AST with 
total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN and no other 
explanation for these elevations).  
If one or more clinically significant, life-
threatening, or significantly 
disabling/incapacitating events that are likely 
related to X842 and that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_421280], 
may constitute sufficient reason to stop the 
study.

 1 Protocol Summary 
1.1 Synopsis 
Protocol Title: A randomized double-blind, double dummy, active comparator-controlled 
dose-finding study in patients with erosive esophagitis due to gastro-esophageal reflux disease 
(GERD) Los Angeles grade C or D, and patients with at least partial symptom response but 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_421271] [ADDRESS_531562] treatment healing course with 
proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), to investigate safety, tolerability, and healing rates after 4 weeks 
treatment of X842 or lansoprazole, and symptom pattern during subsequent 4 weeks treatment 
with lansoprazole  
Sponsor Study No.:  CX842A2201 
Phase:  Phase 2 
Sponsor: Cinclus Pharma AG  
Gartenstrasse 101 
CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland  
Study Rationale: 
This is a Phase 2, double-blind study in patients with erosive esophagitis due to GERD Los 
Angeles (LA) grades C or D, and in patients with at least partial symptom response but still 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_421281] (LA grades A or B) after [ADDRESS_531563] treatment healing 
course with PPI, designed to support dose selection for Phase 3. The pronounced acid control of 
X842 is assumed to provide high endoscopic healing rates already after 4 weeks treatment 
course. The four dose levels of X842 are selected based on data from the Phase 1 studies where 
the 50 mg twice daily (BID) dose displayed an acid control slightly stronger than observed for 
standard PPI. The dose selection for Phase 3 will be based on the proportion of endoscopic 
healing following each dose of X842, the respective safety data and the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile. Lansoprazole will serve as an active comparator.

 Overall Design: 
The study will be conducted in multiple centers in Europe and the US. This will be a 
randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study with a parallel group design 
including four arms with X842 and one arm with lansoprazole. Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood 
sampling pre-dose, before the first and the second dose administration will be performed at 
Day 7, Day [ADDRESS_531565] 200 evaluable patients.  
Randomization to one of the treatments with X842 twice daily (BID) 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 
100 mg, or lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (QD) will be based on a 1:1:1:1:1 scheme. One site 
cannot enroll more than 20% of the overall number of patients (48 patients). 
The duration of each patient’s participation in the study, including screening, blind treatment 
period and open-label treatment period will be approximately 60 days. The patients will be 
randomized for 4 weeks (28 days, -2/+5 days) double-blind treatment and will be provided with 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) for 35 days (including one additional blister pack 
dispensed at Visit 2/Day 0) to allow for treatment up to the visit window. All patients will have 
an endoscopic evaluation after [ADDRESS_531566] symptom pattern will be assessed during this period.

Final, version 3.0 32 of 99 25 Feb 2022 2 Introduction 
2.1 Background  
Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common chronic disorder with the prevalence 
highest in North America and Europe, where at least weekly reflux symptoms range from 10 to 
30%. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_421282] a lower prevalence in Asia [1], although 
prevalence is increasing in this region and other developed countries [1]. A universally accepted 
definition of treatment success in GERD is not available [1].  
A new class of molecules, potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs), presents a new mode 
of action, that, in principle, allows full acid control both day and night. Such acid inhibitory 
properties in humans are likely to allow for successful treatment of patients with erosive 
esophagitis due to GERD Grade C and D, the most acid-sensitive GERD sub-population. 
Linaprazan, the main metabolite of X842, has shown to provide effective acid control in humans 
[3, 4].  
The study drug, X842, shows a slower uptake after oral administration, compared to after oral 
administration of linaprazan. This results in a lower maximum concentration (C max) of linaprazan 
after administration of X842. This should translate into a lower load of linaprazan to the liver and 
to a prolonged control of intragastric acidity.  
The solubility of both linaprazan and X842 is pH dependent and increases exponentially at pH 
values below the pKa (6.1 for linaprazan and 5.5 for X842). Previous studies have shown a 
decrease in C max and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for linaprazan with repeated 
dosing [5].  
The first-in-human (FIH) study of X842 (CX842A2101) [6] was performed with a suspension 
formulation to allow dosing per kg. A tablet formulation is developed and the data from studies 
on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this formulation are used for dose 
selection for this Phase 2 study and to further develop the biomarker for intragastric pH control 
(CX842A2102, CX842A2103).

Final, version 3.0 34 of 99 25 Feb 2022 recovery period. Male and female Beagle dogs were administered single oral doses of X842 up 
to 120 mg/kg and repeated oral doses up to 48 mg/kg for [ADDRESS_531573] been noted following single oral administration of 
X842 at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg in SD rats. Some emesis has been seen at all dose levels 
investigated in dogs. However, this is a very common clinical sign in toxicity studies in dogs and 
is not regarded as having any toxicological relevance unless it is very pronounced and/or 
frequent. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) following a single dose of X842 was above the 
maximum given doses of 250 mg/kg in rats and 120 mg/kg in dogs. In the 28-day repeat-dose 
study in rats and a study of fertility and early embryonic development in rats, the no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 150 mg/kg in both genders. In the 28-day 
repeat-dose study in dogs the NOAEL is considered to be 48 mg/kg in both genders. In all 
instances, these were the highest doses given in each study.  
In vitro (the Ames test and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster lung [CHL] cells) and in 
vivo (micronucleus test in rats) genotoxicity studies showed that X842 did not show mutagenic 
activity either with or without metabolic activation. 
For detailed information, refer to the Investigator´s Brochure (IB) for X842. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical experience  
In the FIH study (single ascending dose [SAD] and multiple ascending dose [MAD]) the safety, 
tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of X842 were evaluated [6]. The study 
concluded that X842 was well tolerated in single doses up to 4.0 mg/kg and multiple doses up to 
2.0 mg/kg (the maximum dose administered in the MAD patients) and that the intragastric pH 
correlated with the plasma concentration of linaprazan during the time interval 0-24 hours after 
dose. 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) nor adverse events (AEs) that led to withdrawal occurred after 
IMP administration and the number of patients experiencing AEs assessed as related to the IMP 
did not increase with an increasing dose. There were no clinically relevant findings or dose 
dependent mean changes over time in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) or laboratory parameters. 
With regards to PK; PK parameters and dose linearity could not be calculated for X842 due to 
low plasma concentrations. For linaprazan, the relative bioavailability after fed and fasting 
conditions was determined from the AUC 0-24 hours (AUC 0-24) and C max. No indication of food 
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.[ADDRESS_531574] dose (4.0 mg/kg) was lower than expected 
and the variability among patients was high. Dose linearity was shown for linaprazan for SAD 
Cohort 1-5, but not for SAD Cohort 6-7. The exposure in MAD Cohorts 2 and 3, given multiple 
doses of 2.0 mg/kg X842, was lower than expected after the first dose as compared to SAD 
Cohort 5 (2.0 mg/kg) and MAD Cohort 1 (1.0 mg/kg). High variability was also seen among 
patients. The reason for the non-dose linearity in SAD 6-[ADDRESS_531575] likely the crystallization observed in the liquid formulation in the later cohorts. 
In a subsequent Phase 1, open-label, two-period cross-over, no control, PK study of X842 in 
healthy volunteers, X842 was administered as i) two doses of 50 mg X842, separated by 
24 hours and ii) two doses of [ADDRESS_531576] 1 week. Data on this new tablet formulation showed that X842 was safe and well 
tolerated. The linaprazan plasma concentrations after dose Day 1 was increased in proportion to 
dose, while the concentrations following the dose administration Day 2 was lower than Day 1.  
A Phase 1 PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) (intragastric pH over 48 hours) study on repeated BID 
dosing of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg X842 during day 1 and 2 and once daily on day 3, has 
recently concluded recruiting. X842 was safe and well tolerated and no SAE occurred. A clear 
dose response was observed. The 50 mg dose provided acid control (intragastric pH > 4) during 
68% of time while the corresponding figure for the 150 mg dose was above 90% of time. The PK 
value to predict the level of pH control was further explored. The pre-dose evening values 
showed low variability and were closely correlated to the level of pH control over time.

Final, version 3.0 36 of 99 25 Feb 2022 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The majority of patients in this study are likely to experience medical benefit from their 
participation based on the properties of X842 and the active comparator. However, the lowest 
dose of X842 is selected to be slightly less efficacious than the active comparator, but still 
efficacious. Patients’ safety and wellbeing is of utmost importance. Even though the toxicology 
studies and previous clinical studies have indicated a low toxicity with no major concerns at the 
dose levels studied, there is a clear need for attention to risk mitigation. 
The study involves administration of a tablet formulation of X842 for humans, with the aim of 
generating data supporting dose selection for Phase 3. The BID dosing of 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg 
corresponding to a daily dose of 0.7 - 2.9 mg/kg [based on 70 kg body weight] in this study was 
selected based on data from the Phase 1 studies (CX842A2101, CX842A2102, CX842A2103). 
The NOAEL in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (rat and dog) was set equal to the highest doses 
given. Normally this highest dose would be increased in a repeat study of the same duration. In 
this instance however, results from the earlier studies strongly indicated that a saturation of 
exposure to both X842 and linaprazan occurred at all higher dose levels in both species, thus 
limiting the relevance of further increasing the dose and also justifying the use of the same dose 
levels in the repeat studies. The mean AUC 0-24 -values (males and females combined) noted at the 
stated highest dose levels (regarded as being the NOAELs) day 28 in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_78078]-dose 
toxicity studies were 170 h*ng/mL and 2700 h*ng/mL for X842 and linaprazan, respectively, in 
rats and 270 h*ng/mL and 3200 h*ng/mL for X842 and linaprazan, respectively, in dogs. For 
linaprazan, it is therefore necessary to justify the safety of the chosen clinical doses of X842 by 
[CONTACT_421312] X842 with those that have been 
shown to be safe and without any SAEs in previous clinical studies, rather than via a comparison 
with exposure values in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, in which even the highest dose levels of 
X842 given did not provoke any true toxic effects. 
In all three Phase 1 studies, X842 was well tolerated in doses up to 4.0 mg/kg single dose, up to 
2.0 mg/kg when administered as a once daily dose for five consecutive days, and in doses up to 
150 mg BID for two days plus one additional dose on day 3. No SAEs occurred, and no adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) led to withdrawal from the study. In the FIH study CX842A2101, X842 
was given as a suspension at dose levels of 5.6 to 280 mg (0.08 to 4 mg/kg in a 70 kg individual). 
No PK parameters could be calculated for X842, as the plasma concentrations of this compound 
were very low or below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). It is anticipated that this will 
be the same in the current clinical study.

CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 37 of 99 25 Feb 2022 In the development program of X842’s active metabolite, linaprazan, the SAD study with 
linaprazan included single doses up to 4.0 mg/kg which resulted in an AUC of [ZIP_CODE] h*ng/mL, 
which also was MTD [10]. Linaprazan itself was also administered to humans at safe and 
tolerable doses of up to 75 mg QD (1.1 mg/kg in a 70 kg human) for 56 days [3, 4].  
Pharmacokinetic results from the all three Phase [ADDRESS_531579] dose administration.  
The overall evaluation is that X842 doses 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg BID will be safe and 
well tolerated based on the three Phase 1 studies on X842 and supportive published linaprazan 
data on healthy volunteers and in patients. 
2.3.1 Summary of Risk Management 
Visits at the clinic/investigational site may be prolonged in case the Investigator finds it 
medically warranted for safety reasons. In cases of accidental overdose, standard supportive 
measures should be adopted as required. For further information regarding overdosing, refer to 
Section 8.5. 
Each patient will be provided with a Patient Identification Card with information about the 
patient participation in a study, see Section 10.1.4.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_421284]/investigational site will ascertain that adequate 
facilities and procedures are available to handle emergency situations.  
Besides the risks related to the IMP as described above, there may also be risks related to the 
repeated endoscopy after 4 weeks. Other medical devices, e.g., indwelling venous catheters, are 
used in routine medical care and the risk associated with their use is considered low and ethically 
justifiable. Study-specific evaluations and sampling procedures, like blood-pressure 
measurements using a blood pressure cuff and blood sampling, may cause transient discomfort 
but the risk is deemed to be low and ethically justifiable.  
Linaprazan is the acid inhibitory metabolite of the X842 molecule. Linaprazan has been 
extensively studied and in a small number of patients increased LFTs were observed [3, 4] and 
careful evaluation concluded that the high C max of linaprazan was the main reason for the LFT 
increase. The C max of the metabolite linaprazan following administration of its prodrug X842 is 
reduced with about 75% and thereby [CONTACT_421313]. Overall, the 
combined safety data from the pre-clinical and clinical studies have not revealed any safety

4.1 Overall Design 
The study will be conducted in multiple centers in Europe and the US. This will be a 
randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study with a parallel group design 
including four arms with X842 and one arm with lansoprazole. Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood 
sampling pre-dose, close before the first and the second dose administration will be performed at 
Day 7, Day [ADDRESS_531581] 200 evaluable patients.  
Randomization to one of the treatments with X842 BID 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, or 
lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (QD) will be based on a 1:1:1:1:1 scheme. One site cannot enroll 
more than 20% of the overall number of patients (48 patients per site). 
The duration of each patient’s participation in the study, including screening, blind treatment 
period and open-label treatment period, will be approximately 60 days. The patients will be 
randomized for 4 weeks (28 days, -2/+5 days) of double-blind treatment and will be provided 
with IMP for 35 days (including one additional blister pack dispensed at Visit 2/Day 0) to allow 
for treatment up to the visit window. All patients will have an endoscopic evaluation after

4.[ADDRESS_531586] been selected based on the results of three Phase 1 studies on 
X842 and previous development experience from its main metabolite linaprazan. PK/PD data has 
shown a close correlation between plasma concentrations of linaprazan and intragastric pH. The 
critical level of the plasma concentration of linaprazan after its C max needed to ensure an 
intragastric pH > 4 has been identified to be approximately 240 nmol/L. In the first Phase 1 study 
the administration of 1 mg/kg X842 as a liquid formulation (mean absolute dose of 74 mg) 
resulted in a mean plasma linaprazan concentration of 225 nmol/L 12 hours after dose and this 
translated to a fall in intragastric pH to < 4 after this time point. This is similar to what was seen 
after healing dose of linaprazan at steady-state (K Andersson pers. com). A PK study 
(CX842A2102), on X842 50 mg QD dosing showed that the plasma concentration of linaprazan 
during 8 hours indicated good pH control, while the pH control was not maintained at 12, 22 and 
24 hours. The plasma concentrations of linaprazan following 150 mg QD X842 indicated good 
pH control up to 12 hours, while concentration levels of linaprazan did not indicate maintained 
pH control at 22 and 24 hours after administration 
The dose levels in this study (CX842A2201) are selected to accommodate for severe eGERD 
patients representing a “harder to treat” population. The Phase 1 PK/PD (intragastric pH over 
48 hours) study (CX842A2103) on repeated BID dosing of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg X842 
during day 1 and 2 and once daily on day 3 showed a clear dose response. The 50 mg dose 
provided acid control (intragastric pH > 4) during 68% of time while the corresponding figure 
for the 150 mg dose was above 90% of time. In this study (CX842A2201), the lowest dose, 
[ADDRESS_531587] dose 100 mg X842 
BID is selected to provide intragastric pH control during 85% of the time. The intermediate 
X842 doses of 50 mg BID and 75 mg BID are selected to provide acid control of approximately 
70-80% of the time. The predicted efficacy of the 75 mg and 100 mg doses of X842 are assumed 
to be superior to lansoprazole 30 mg QD, i.e., the recommended daily healing dose for patients 
with esophagitis.

The randomization list will be generated, and the original randomization list will be kept.  
All patients will be centrally randomized using an Interactive V oice Response System (IVRS). 
Each patient will be assigned a unique number (randomization number) that encodes the patient’s 
assignment to one of the five  arms of the study, according to the randomization schedule 
generated by [CONTACT_421316] a validated computer program. Details of the procedure are described 
in the IVRS Manual provided to all clinic/investigational sites. 
Randomization will be set as approximately 50% of patients with LA grade A or B and 
approximately 50% of patients with LA grade C or D. 
6.3.2 Blinding 
This is a double-blind study and the allocation of treatments will not be disclosed until the file 
has been declared clean and the database has been locked.  
The IMP tablets will be identical in appearance (dummy, 25 mg and 50 mg tablets) and 
lansoprazole, the reference treatment (capsule), will be identical in appearance as its dummy. All

8 Study Assessments and Procedures 
The study assessments are described in the sections below and the timing of these assessments 
are detailed in the SoA table (see Table 1).  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_421290]/Designee with all data produced during the 
study from the scheduled study assessments. He/she ensures the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to Sponsor/Designee in the electronic CRF (eCRF) 
and in all required reports. 
It is important that PK blood sampling occurs as close as possible to scheduled time and is 
always accompanied with the time for the latest study medication tablet administration. In order 
to achieve this, the preferred timing priority order at a particular time point is: 
 QOLRAD completion 
 Blood samples for PK  
 Safety laboratory samples 
 ECG, vital signs, physical examination 
 Investigator assessment 
 Study drug administration 
The actual sampling time and the time for the latest study medication tablet administration 
should always be recorded in the eCRF and will be used in the calculation of the PK parameters. 
Blood samples will be drawn by [CONTACT_421324]-points 
specified in the detailed schedule of events in SoA (Table 1).

retrospectively. This review will include reassessment of the LA grading and other findings 
which may constitute exclusion criterion. The central reading evaluation will override the 
investigators evaluations. Data obtained from patients deemed to have been ineligible for study 
enrollment following the retrospective analysis will be excluded from the per protocol analysis.  
8.3 Safety Assessments 
8.3.1 Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will be performed as designated on the SoA and will include 
assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, 
cardiovascular system, abdomen (including liver and spleen), lymph nodes, genitourinary system 
(optional) and extremities (musculoskeletal system). 
8.3.2 Weight and BMI 
Weight will be measured wearing light clothes and without shoes as designated on the SoA. The 
method of weight assessment will be the same across all visits. Body mass index (BMI) unit is 
kg/m2 and calculated as weight in kg and height in meter.  
8.3.3 Vital Signs 
Examination of vital signs will be performed as designated on the SoA. Systolic and diastolic BP 
and heart rate (pulse) will be measured in supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] [ADDRESS_531613] using an ECG machine. Heart rate and PQ/PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals will be 
recorded. Safety ECGs will be reviewed and interpreted on-site by [CONTACT_737].

CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 59 of 99 25 Feb 2022 Abnormalities in an ECG will be assessed as “clinically significant” or “not clinically 
significant.” An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol 
(see Section 8.4). 
8.3.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
Blood samples for analysis of clinical chemistry, hematology and coagulation parameters will be 
collected through venipuncture or an indwelling venous catheter and sent to the certified clinical 
chemistry laboratory and analyzed by [CONTACT_421330]. Urine laboratory analysis will 
be performed at the research clinic/investigational site using dip sticks. Additionally, local testing 
at site includes urine drug abuse test and urine pregnancy test (dipstick) will be performed. For 
details, see the laboratory manual. 
The following safety laboratory parameters will be assessed at time-points defined in SoA

8.3.6 Concomitant Medication 
Prior medication will be obtained by [CONTACT_421326] (see also Section 6.6). 
Medications are classified as prior if the stop date was before or on the day of the first dose 
administration (pre-dose), and as concomitant if ongoing on the day of the first dose 
administration, stopped after the first dose administration or started after the first dose 
administration. 
8.3.7 Reflux Related Symptoms Assessed Based on PRO 
Reflux related symptoms will be assessed based on QOLRAD, which is a PRO developed by 
[CONTACT_421331] 1998 [8]. It has been translated and evaluated in multiple languages. The 
heartburn version of the QOLRAD is a disease specific instrument and contains 25 questions 
addressing concerns associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The questions are rated on a 
seven-grade Likert scale; the lower the value, the more severe the impact on daily functions. The 
questions are categorized into five domains: emotional distress (six questions), sleep disturbance 
(five questions), vitality (three questions), food/drink problems (six questions) and 
physical/social functioning (five questions). It will be assessed at baseline, week 1, 2, and 4 (see 
Table 1). The QOLRAD will be completed pre-dose by [CONTACT_421332] 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 (please 
refer to SoA). 
Reflux related symptoms will be also assessed based on a modified RESQ-eDiary; an electronic 
symptom diary developed for use in partial responders to PPI. RESQ-eD has three Domains (i.e. 
Heartburn, Other GERD signs/symptoms and Regurgitations/Reflux) and eight Items. Patients 
will be asked to report every 12-hours, once before the morning dose and once before the 
evening dose of the IMP. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_531615] may include: heartburn (defined as a retrosternal burning pain rising from 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_421293]), acid regurgitation (upward flow of sour 
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.[ADDRESS_531616] the mouth), dysphagia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684]/discomfort, retrosternal tightness, 
burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/belching, nausea/vomiting, fullness, lower abdominal pain, flatulence, coughing. 
At each visit, Investigator will assess the severity of patients’ heartburn, regurgitation and 
dysphagia in the 7 days prior to the visit. The assessment will include both the severity grade and 
the frequency of symptoms. Assessments will be captured in EDC.  
The potential frequency is defined as 7-graded Likert scale:  
 All of the time;  
 Most of the time;  
 Quite a lot of the time;  
 Some of the time;  
 A little of the time;  
 Hardly any of the time;  
 None of the time. 
Symptoms are scored as follows:  
 none (no complaints),  
 mild (aware of symptom, but easily tolerated),  
 moderate (discomforting symptom, sufficient to cause interference with normal daily 
activities and/or sleep),  
 severe (incapacitating symptom, with inability to perform normal daily activities and/or 
sleep). 
8.3.9 Pharmacokinetic Samples and Analysis 
Venous blood samples (approximately [ADDRESS_531617] details are provided in the laboratory manual) 
for the determination of plasma concentrations of linaprazan and X842 after administration of 
the study drug, will be collected at the pre-specified time-points (see Table 1).  
The date and time of collection of each sample and the time for the latest study drug 
administration will be recorded in the eCRF. PK samples will be collected 12 hours after the 
previous study drug dose administration or as close to this timepoint as possible, but always 
pre-dose (close before the first and the second dose administration at Days 7, 14 and 28). 
Plasma samples for determination of plasma concentrations of linaprazan and X842 will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_3553] a validated LC-MS/MS method (see the laboratory manual). The details of

instructions for collection, handling, labeling, storage and shipment of samples will be provided 
in the laboratory manual. 
8.4 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
8.4.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically 
significant abnormal values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, ECGs, 
vital signs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the IMP. 
A TEAE is any AE only present after the initiation of IMP administration or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the IMP. 
Collection of AEs will start directly after the ICF has been signed. Only AEs related to study 
procedure will be collected between screening visit and the first IMP administration. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse event  
An SAE is any AE that: 
 results in death 
 is life-threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it had been more severe) 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is medically important (this refers to an event that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention 
to prevent any of the SAEs defined above) 
Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room for 
allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
development of drug dependency, and drug abuse. 
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.[ADDRESS_531618] be reported as an SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events of special interest (AESI)  
An AESI (serious or non-serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_27480]. Such an event might warrant further investigation 
in order to characterize and understand it.  
All AESI, serious and non-serious, must be reported within [ADDRESS_531619] and require expedited 
reporting: 
a. ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_531620] ≥ [ADDRESS_531621] ≥ [ADDRESS_531622] and total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_531623] (or ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_531624] and 
INR > 1.5) 
d. ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_531625] ≥ [ADDRESS_531626] but < [ADDRESS_531627] weekly for 
≥ 2 week 
 
Hy’s Law, defined as ≥ [ADDRESS_531628] with coexisting  ≥ [ADDRESS_531629] total bilirubin with no 
alternative explanation for the biochemical abnormality other than IMP (for example elevated 
ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, other medication) must always be reported without 
delay as an AESI, and, if applicable, also as an SAE. 
All potential drug-induced liver injuries (PDILI) events require immediate action, testing, and 
monitoring. If tests are done locally for more rapid results, a concurrent sample should also be 
sent to the central laboratory whenever possible.  
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 64 of 99 25 Feb 2022 PDILI events require notification of the Medical Monitor within 24 hours (e.g., by [CONTACT_67600]), and the patient must be discussed with the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. Patients 
with PDILI must be assessed to determine if the study drug must be discontinued (please refer to 
General withdrawal criteria, Section 7.1). 
To ensure patient safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an 
investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver 
events has to be followed.  
Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 2 should be followed up by [CONTACT_421333] (please also refer to 
General withdrawal criteria, Section 7.1). 
A. Liver laboratory trigger: 
 Repeating the LFT within the next week to confirm elevation. The repeat assessment can be 
done as an unscheduled study visit or at a local laboratory. In this case, local laboratory 
normal ranges should be recorded, and the results should be made available to the trial 
investigator immediately, and the data recorded on the CRF. 
 If the elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including 
consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate. 
B. Liver event: 
 Repeating the LFT as soon as possible to confirm elevation as appropriate 
 Monitoring of liver chemistry values at least twice per week until values normalize, stabilize, 
or return to within baseline value 
 Discontinuation of the investigational drug if appropriate 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18539] 
 A causality assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, 
co-medications) 
 An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution.  
These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, 
hepatologist’s consultancy, based on investigator’s discretion. All follow-up information, and the 
procedures performed should be recorded on appropriate CRF pages, including the liver event 
overview CRF pages.

 Any adverse event potentially indicative of a liver toxicity *  
*These events cover the following: hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and other liver damage-related 
conditions; the non -infectious hepatitis; the benign, malignant and unspecified liver neoplasms  
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to follow up on all SAEs until the patient has recovered, 
stabilized, or recovered with sequelae, and to report to the Sponsor or Designee all relevant new 
information using the same procedures and timelines as those for the initial report. Relevant 
information includes discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and medical consultation. 
Serious adverse events spontaneously reported by a patient to the Investigator within [ADDRESS_531630] be handled in the same manner as SAEs occurring 
during the study. These SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor or Designee. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse drug reaction  
The term serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) is to be used whenever either the Investigator or 
Sponsor or designee assessed the SAE as possibly or probably related to the IMP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is any SADR whose nature or intensity is not consistent with the current version of 
the IB (unexpected).

CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 66 of 99 25 Feb 2022 8.4.2 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
Collection of AEs will start directly after the ICF has been signed. During the screening period, 
only AEs related to study procedure will be reported. All AEs (including SAEs) will be collected 
until the End of Study/Early Termination visit. Any AE with start date on the day or after the 
IMP administration must be recorded with start time. At the follow-up visit, information on new 
AEs or SAEs, if any, and stop dates for AEs recorded and ongoing during the dosing period must 
be recorded. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study drug but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded in the Medical History Log of the eCRF, not in the AE Log. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek new AE or SAE after conclusion of the study 
participation (for follow-up of AEs please refer to Section 8.4.7). However, if the Investigator 
learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the 
study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study drug or study 
participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor or Designee. 
8.4.3 Assessment of Severity/Intensity 
The grading of the severity/intensity of AEs will follow the common terminology criteria for AEs 
(CTCAE) v4.03 [9]. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades [ADDRESS_531631] assess the severity/intensity of an AE using the following definitions, and 
record it on the AE Form in the CRF: 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)* 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self- care ADL** 
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5 Death related to AE 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc. 
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 67 of 99 25 Feb 2022 **Self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
Note: a semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of causal relationship 
The Investigator must assess the causal relationship between an AE and the IMP using the 
definitions below and record it the AE Log of the eCRF: 
 Probable – the AE has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on re-challenge, 
and another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely 
 Possible – the AE has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an alternative 
etiology is equally or less likely 
 Unlikely – the AE has no temporal relationship to the IMP or is due to underlying/concurrent 
illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal relationship between the IMP and 
the AE) 
An AE is considered causally related to the use of the IMP when the causality assessment is 
probable or possible. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of outcome 
The Investigator must assess the outcome of an AE using the definitions below and record it on 
the AE Log of the eCRF: 
 Recovered – the patient has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain 
 Recovering – the patient’s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain 
 Recovered with sequelae – the patient has recovered, but some symptoms remain (for 
example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normally, but has some motor 
impairment) 
 Not recovered – the patient’s condition has not improved, and the symptoms are unchanged 
(for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic) 
 Death 
8.4.4 Collecting Adverse Events 
In general, abnormal findings at screening should be recorded in the patient’s Medical History. 
Adverse events identified using any of the following methods will be recorded: 
 AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102] 
 AEs observed by [CONTACT_421334]842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 68 of 99 25 Feb 2022  AEs elicited based on non-leading questions from the Investigator or medical personnel 
8.4.[ADDRESS_531632] with signs and symptoms; start and 
stop dates, start and stop time; intensity; causal relationship to IMP; action taken, and outcome. 
If the AE is serious, this must be indicated in the eCRF.  
Adverse events, including out-of-range clinically significant clinical safety laboratory values, 
must be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of the same medical 
condition or disease state; in such cases, they must be recorded under a single diagnosis. 
If the severity/intensity of an AE increases a new AE Form must be completed in the eCRF. 
Adverse events must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical language, without use of 
abbreviations or acronyms. 
8.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
On discovery, all SAE/AESIs should be immediately reported (latest within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the event) to Parexel Safety Services by: 
[CONTACT_421309] (AE page and/or SAE page) of the eCRF, indicating that 
the event is considered serious, and providing all the details per the eCRF completion guidelines  
and 
Completing the SAE report form and e-mailing/faxing the documents to Parexel Safety Services 
as per details below: 
[LOCATION_009] (Paris) Mailbox: [EMAIL_8039]  
[LOCATION_009] (Paris) Fax numbers: [PHONE_8724] 32 75 or [PHONE_8724] 35 34 
In the event that the site is unable to complete the SAE form or eCRF entry to report the event 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event, the Investigators may report the SAE over the 
telephone via the SAE answering service, and then provide the completed SAE form via (fax or 
email) , or complete the eCRF entry of the event (within the next 24 hours). If questions arise 
regarding the reporting procedures or the specifics of the reporting of an event, sites may call 
(English) utilizing the following numbers:

Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 69 of 99 25 Feb 2022 In case the eCRF cannot be accessed, the SAE should be reported by [CONTACT_421308], provided in the investigator site file (ISF).  
The SAE report is reviewed by a designated person at Parexel to ensure that the report is valid 
and correct. For fatal or life-threatening SAEs where important or relevant information is 
missing, immediate follow-up is undertaken and queries to the site are raised by [CONTACT_147029]. 
Investigators or other site personnel should inform designated person of any follow-up 
information on a previously reported SAE immediately but no later than the end of the next 
business day of when he/she becomes aware of it.  
If an SAE report is updated, the designated study personnel will be informed. 
If any additional documentation is required (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304695], autopsy report, etc.), 
designated person will request this information from the study site.  
 
The study site should notify the CRA via phone or e-mail about the submission of the SAE 
report. As soon as the site personnel have access to the eCRF, the SAE should be reported 
electronically as well. 
The Sponsor or Designee will assume responsibility for reporting SAEs to competent authorities 
(CAs) and the independent ethics committees (IECs) in accordance with local regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to EudraVigilance, local CA and IEC 
The term SADR is used whenever either the Investigator or Medical Monitor deems a blinded 
SAE as possibly or probably related to IMP. If a SADR is assessed as unexpected by [CONTACT_22955], it is a potential S[LOCATION_003]R.  
Under such circumstances, the Sponsor Medical Monitor will be unblinded (see Global Safety 
Reporting Procedure) and reported to the CAs (via the EudraVigilance database, where 
applicable), and to the IEC, in accordance with local regulations and applicable standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) within the following timelines:  
 7 calendar days if fatal or life-threatening (follow-up information within an additional 
8 days) 
 15 calendar days if non-fatal and non-life-threatening (for initial and follow-up information) 
The clock for expedited initial reporting (Day 0) starts as soon as the Sponsor or Designee has 
received the information containing the minimum reporting criteria. The date should be 
documented on an acknowledgment receipt.

CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 70 of 99 25 Feb 2022 The Medical Monitor is responsible for medical review of the SAE narrative in the Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences for (or equivalent) prior to expedited reporting. 
The Sponsor or Designee is responsible for informing the Investigators concerned of relevant 
information about potential S[LOCATION_003]Rs (blinded data) that could adversely affect the safety of 
patients.  
The Sponsor or Designee is responsible for once a year throughout the clinical study (or on 
request), to submit a safety report to the CA and the IEC taking into account all new available 
safety information received during the reporting period.

End of Study/Early Termination visit, whichever comes first. At the follow-up visit, information 
on new AEs, if any, and stop dates for previously reported AEs must be recorded. Adverse events 
assessed as stable by [CONTACT_421335]/Early Termination visit will not have to 
be followed up until resolution. 
For the treatment and follow-up of AESIs please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
All SAEs not resolved by [CONTACT_421336]’s 
discontinuation in the study must be followed until the event resolves, the event stabilizes, or the 
event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_531634] interfered with the 
effectiveness of the contraceptive medication. However, the outcome of all pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be 
followed up and documented even after the patient was discontinued from the study. 
All events of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Pregnancy complications or 
spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as AEs or SAEs. All outcomes of 
pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor or Designee by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_421294]. Follow-up must be performed until delivery or pregnancy 
termination.

Designee on the pregnancy form, immediately or within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of 
its occurrence. 
8.5 Treatment of Overdose 
An overdose is a dose in excess of the dose specified for each cohort in this clinical study 
protocol (CSP).  
There are no data on overdosing of X842. There is no known antidote and an overdose in a study 
patient should be monitored closely and treated symptomatically. The IMP X842 is a glutaric 
acid prodrug of linaprazan that has been extensively studied by [CONTACT_421337] 
2000 patients and 400 healthy subjects. Based on published data, linaprazan was safe and well 
tolerated, [6, IB]. 
There is limited data available regarding the effects of overdose of lansoprazole in humans. 
However, daily doses of up to [ADDRESS_531636] been administered in trials without significant undesirable effects. In one 
reported overdose, a patient consumed 600 mg of lansoprazole (Prevacid) with no adverse 
reaction. Oral lansoprazole doses up to 5000 mg/kg in rats [approximately 1300 times the 30 mg 
human dose based on body surface area (BSA)] and in mice (about 675.7 times the 30 mg human 
dose based on BSA) did not produce deaths or any clinical signs [11]. 
In the case of suspected overdose, the patient should be monitored. Lansoprazole is not 
significantly eliminated by [CONTACT_121264]. If necessary, gastric emptying, charcoal and 
symptomatic therapy is recommended [12]. 
An overdose should be documented as follows:  
 An overdose with associated AE is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms in the AE Log of 
the eCRF.  
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported in the patient’s medical records. 
8.6 Handling, Storage and Destruction of Laboratory Samples 
All biological samples will be handled according to local regulations.  
Cinclus Pharma AG Clinical Study Protocol 
CX842A2201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final, version 3.0 72 of 99 25 Feb 2022 The biological samples will be labeled with a unique code and be stored under Cinclus’s control 
for a maximum of 15 years (some samples may be stored for much less time) to analyse 
metabolites of X842, analyse associated medicines and explore or validate 
biomarkers/assays/new techniques to help develop ways to detect, monitor or treat reflux disease 
and other gastric acid related diseases e.g., peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori  infection. 
8.7 Chain of Custody of Biological Samples 
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.  
The study site should keep full traceability of collected biological samples from the patients 
while in storage at the study site until shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.  
The sample receiver (the analytical laboratory) keeps full traceability of the samples while in 
their storage and during use until used or disposed of.  
The Sponsor keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of 
study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers.  
8.8 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of retained biological samples donated, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroyed, if not already analyzed.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_67416]:

Final, version 3.0 73 of 99 25 Feb 2022 9 Statistical Considerations 
9.1 General Consideration 
The principal features of the statistical analysis to be performed are described in this section. A 
more technical and detailed description of all statistical summaries, presentations and analyses 
will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized and approved prior 
to locking the database and unblinding.  
The primary study objective is to estimate the X842 dose for Phase 3 study with good precision, 
and hence comparison of different doses of X842 to the active comparator arm (lansoprazole 
30 mg) will not involve any formal statistical testing. 
The primary analysis evaluating the dose-response relationship based on different doses of X842, 
as well as secondary analyses, will be based on the overall study population. In addition, the two 
subgroups, erosive esophagitis due to GERD LA grade C or D and erosive esophagitis due to 
GERD LA grade A or B who are partial responders to PPI [CONTACT_3148], will be evaluated separately.  
All data measured on a continuous scale will be presented using summary statistics. Summary 
statistics is defined as number (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum 
Q1, Q3 and maximum value. Where appropriate 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
Categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages. When applicable, summary data 
will be presented by [CONTACT_3148], and by [CONTACT_81510]. Individual patient data will be listed by 
[CONTACT_56324], treatment, and, where applicable, by [CONTACT_81510].

Population Description 
Enrolled All patients who signed the ICF (including screening failures). 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all patients who have been 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of IMP. Patients will be analyzed 
according to randomized treatment (any randomized but not treated patient 
will be marked and reported as such). 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) The per protocol analysis set (PPS) will consist of all patients who have been 
randomized and completed the study without any major protocol deviations 
that are judged to compromise the analysis of the data. All protocol violations 
will be judged as major or minor, taking composite effects of protocol 
deviations into consideration, excluding patients for whom the clinical 
outcome is qualitatively affected by [CONTACT_421338]. Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set will consist of all patients who have been randomized 
and received at least 1 dose of IMP. Patients will be analyzed according to the

Final, version 3.0 76 of 99 25 Feb 2022 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods 
Primary Analysis of primary endpoints will focus on the rate of esophageal 
mucosa healing in the four X842 dose groups to identify the dose that 
will lead to having 85% of the patients have esophageal mucosa 
healing after 4 weeks of treatment. It will involve dose-response 
modeling, evaluating a sequence of dose-response models for the 
healing rate including the Linear, Exponential, E max, Sigmoid E max 
and Logistic models (on logit scale). The models will be compared in 
terms of model fit, and the target dose estimated as the dose 
providing the target effect of 85% healing rate from the best fitting 
model will be derived. The data will be summarized and analyzed 
descriptively by [CONTACT_421341].  Secondary The data will be summarized and analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_421342]:

10.10  Appendix 10: COVID-19 Specifics 
There is currently an outbreak of the disease COVID-19 caused by a novel severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
EMA and FDA have issued guidelines to provide recommendations for actions for conduct of 
clinical studies of medical products during COVID-[ADDRESS_531661] infection . 
Risk mitigation measures: 
 Current country level regulations and local recommendations for prevention of pandemic 
will be strictly adhered to.  
 Patient enrollment in the study will commence only when the Sponsor and CRO in 
collaboration deem it is safe to start the study. 
 Patients participating in the study will be closely monitored for any signs and symptoms 
of COVID-19, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, sore throat and fatigue throughout 
the study. Body temperature measurement and respi[INVESTIGATOR_421300]. 
 Patients participating in the study and site personnel will be advised to adhere to local 
requirements for reduction of the public viral exposure. 
 Confirmation of COVID-19 infection should follow current local regulations and 
guidance. 
The guidance from the Regulatory Authorities may continue to evolve throughout the pandemic 
and Investigators are encouraged to check for updates regularly. Also, as the situation evolves 
COVID-19 related clinical trial measures may be continuously adjusted in line with local 
regulations, guidance and needs.

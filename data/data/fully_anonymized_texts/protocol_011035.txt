 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Bone Loading Exercises versus Risedronate on Bone Health in 
Postmenopausal Women  
Study moniker:  Heartland Osteoporosis Prevention Study (HOPS)  
Précis:  This stratified random study  will compare  
changes in bone strength (bone structure, formation, and bone mineral 
density) at the hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_877031] 12 months of either: 1) 
optimal calcium and vitamin D alone; 2) the bisphosphonate “risedronate” 
with calcium and vitamin D; or 3) a bone -loading exercise program with 
calcium and vitamin D.  
Objectives:  
 Our long -term goal is to contribute development of clinical practice 
guidelines for the promotion of bone health in postmenopausal women 
with low bone mass, thus reducing the personal and societal burden of 
osteoporotic -related fractures.  
Specific Aims:  
Aim1 : To compare Control, Risedronate, and Exercise group subjects on 
changes in bone structure at the tibia (bone strength index [BSI]: pQCT) 
and hip (femoral neck and shaft, intertrochanteric) (hip  struct ural analysis: 
[HSA: DXA]) at baseline, 6, 12 months.  
 
Aim2 . To compare Control, Risedronate, and Exercise group subjects on 
changes in BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (DXA) at baseline, 
6, 12 months.  
 
Aim3 : To compare Control, Risedronate,  and Exercise group subjects on 
changes in bone formation and resorption at baseline, 6, 12 months. 
(formation: AlkphaseB, resorption: Serum NTx).  
 
Aim4 : To explore relationships between adherence to exercise (%sessions 
attended) or adherence to risedronate (% pi[INVESTIGATOR_38947]) and changes in bone 
structure at the tibia (BSI) and hip (HSA).  
Population:  
 A total of N = 246 subjects are  needed to achieve the proposed objectives. 
The subjects will be randomized and evenly allocated across three groups. 
In order to account for a realistic amount of attrition (20%), N = [ADDRESS_1225493] N = 246 should 
be retained if 20% of participants do not complete the study. In order to 
enroll [ADDRESS_1225494]: a) be women who are in their first 5 yea rs of menopause 
(Menopause will be defined as either not having had a menstrual period in 
12 months or having had both ovaries removed. In addition, FSH testing 
will be conducted on women who are unsure of their menopause status) ; 
b) weigh 300 pounds or le ss; c) not use medications or have diagnoses that

Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_1225495] with the individual’s ability to adhere or safely complete 
any of the study components; d) have a T score between 1 and -2.49 at the 
femoral neck, total hip, or L1 -L4 spin e skeletal sites as measured by [CONTACT_877048] (DXA ); f) be 19 years of age or older; and g) have 
their health care providers permission to enroll in the study.  
Number of Sites:  Intervention implementation and data collection will take place at the 
following sites:  
• University of Nebraska Medical Center  
• The Nebraska Medical Center  
• Creighton University Medical Center, Osteoporosis Research 
Center   
• Omaha, Lincoln, and Council Bluffs -based YMCAs  
Additionally, we will be contact[CONTACT_877049] i n Omaha, such as 
Mutual of Omaha, as well as community centers, medical facilities, etc. to 
determine interest in advertising this research study at their facilities. 
Therefore, information for recruitment purposes will be available to 
potential subjects a t entities which choose to advertise information about 
the Heartland Osteoporosis Research Study.  
Description of  
Intervention:  This proposed study has a randomized 3 -group (2 treatment groups & 1 
control group), repeated measures experimental design.   
A computer generated code will be used to stratify subjects by [CONTACT_877050] 3 groups (Control: n =103; Risedronate: n 
=103; Exercise: n =103) with assignments placed in sealed opaque 
envelopes for sequential use. All  subjects will take dosages of calcium 
citrate supplements sufficient to ensure their total daily calcium 
(diet+supplements) is ~ 1200 mg daily and vitamin D3 supplements with 
daily dose to ensure serum levels of vitamin D [25 (OH)D] are between 30 
ng/mL a nd 80 ng/mL(optimal CaD). Subjects randomized to the 
Risedronate group will take optimal CaD daily and 150mg of oral 
risedronate once monthly for 12 months but will not participate in the 
exercise program. Subjects randomized to the Exercise group will tak e 
optimal CaD and also participate in 12 months of a bone -loading exercise 
program three times weekly at a local community -based Y MCA (Y) . To 
ensure the bone outcomes were not due to the CaD supplementation, a 
group taking only optimal CaD will serve as a control. While only women in 
the exercise group will participate in the structured bone -loading exercise 
program developed for this study, all women will be encouraged to 
participate in exercises and will be informed of the benefit of weight 
bearing and re sistance exercises. The primary outcome will be bone 
structure at the tibia and hip and secondary outcomes are bone mineral 
density ( BMD ) and bone turnover. Repeated measures of primary and 
secondary outcome variables will be conducted at baseline, 6 and 1 2 
months to better understand response to intervention components with a

 maximum difference expected at 12 months. An exercise intervention 
lasting 12 months or 2 to 3 bone turnover (resorption / formation) cycles is 
necessary in order to measure the effec ts of training on bone outcomes.

 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
Osteoporosis is a disease of fragile bones (decreased bone strength) and low bone mineral density 
(BMD). Approximately 18% of women with osteoporosis suffer a hip fracture and 22% die within a year 
of their fracture (1 -3). Over [ADDRESS_1225500] low bone mass (BMD T -
scores -1 to -2.49) which increases their risk for osteoporosis (BMD T -scores -2.50 or lower) (2). 
Improving bone strength and preventing further loss in BMD is critical in post -menopausal women with 
low bone mass as  it is difficult to build significant bone without the influence of estrogen (4). 
Preventative treatments are especially important during the first five years post -menopause because 
women lose 2% of their BMD per year during this time. Calcium  (Ca), vitami n D (D) and exercise are 
recommended for prevention of osteoporosis (5) and bisphosphonates (BPs) are prescribed to improve 
BMD in women with diagnosed osteoporosis (6). BPs may also be prescribed for women with low bone 
mass who are not yet osteoporotic, but are more controversial in this population due to the potential 
for adverse effects with their long -term use (7,8). Also, the best predictor of fracture is bone strength, 
and strength is determined by [CONTACT_877052]. While BPs are effecti ve in improving bone 
density, findings on the effectiveness of BPs in improving bone structure are inconsistent (9). A bone 
loading exercise program (high -impact weight bearing and resistance training) promotes bone strength 
by [CONTACT_877053]. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare changes after [ADDRESS_1225501] -menopausal women with low bone mass rando mized to one 
control and 2 treatment groups (N  =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone 
(Control); 2) BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); and 3) a bone loading exercise program plus optimal 
CaD (Exercise). Bone -loading exercise pr ograms for post -menopausal women with low bone mass may 
more effectively improve bone structure than either BPs or optimal CaD alone (9). Prescribing exercise 
programs and delaying use of BPs may prevent adverse effects from long -term use of BPs, and provi de 
the opportunity for later use of BPs when they may be critically needed (8,15). Results of this study 
could be used in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a clinical management pathway for women with low bone mass at their 
peak period of bone loss that would involve lifestyle m odifications such as exercises prior to medications 
such as BPs.  
2.[ADDRESS_1225502] -menopausal women with annual U.S. expenditures of approximately 
$19 billion (16 -18). This problem will be even greater in the future, as the Surgeon General estimates the 
number of hip fractures in the [LOCATION_002] could double or triple by [CONTACT_2892] 2040 (19). Our research 
aims to decrease the incidence of hip fractures by [CONTACT_877054] p reserving BMD  in 
women with low bone mass (pre -osteoporotic) (20) during their first [ADDRESS_1225503] -menopausal women. There is strong evidence that 
adequate CaD through dietary intake and/or supplementation are necessary to maintain bone health 
(21-26). Although  CaD are more effective than no treatment, it frequently is not enough to prevent

Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_1225504] rep orted that use of 
risedronate attenuates the bone loss associated with menopause in osteoporotic women (27). BPs 
improve BMD by [CONTACT_877055]. However, long -term use of BPs can result in a freezing of 
bone resorption and turnover with signific ant accumulation of micro - damage in bone (28). This micro -
damage leads to increased risk of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_877032] (29 -31). As a result, use of BPs in 
women with low bone mass is controversial, and providers are reluctant to prescribe BPs for gr eater 
than 5 years in women (32). Exercise programs combining resistance and high -impact weight bearing 
exercises can improve bone structure and increase bone formation at sites of mechanical stress (33) as 
well as maintain BMD. Participation in exercises improves the ratio of bone formation to resorption and 
improves bone structure by [CONTACT_877056], increasing thickness of cortical 
tissue, improving bone geometry and microarchitecture, and reorganizing bone collagen (34). Col lagen 
reorganization during exercise maintains bone strength, even when BMD is decreased by [CONTACT_45848] 
10% (34). Participation in exercises is not associated with freezing of bone turnover, and furthermore, 
exercise is associated with many other positive e ffects for post -menopausal women including increased 
insulin sensitivity, improved functional ability and decreased risk of falls and depression (35). If an 
effective exercise program could substitute for, or delay the use of BPs in post -menopausal women w ith 
low bone mass, not only would bone health improve through the lifespan, but women would benefit 
from the many other positive effects of exercise.  
 
Critical Need for Three Measures of Bone Strength.  The gold standard for diagnosis of osteopenia and 
oste oporosis is BMD obtained from Dual Energy Absorptiometry (DXA) testing (36). However, the best 
predictor of fracture risk is bone strength. BMD is only one determinant of bone strength, and yet, most 
studies have relied on BMD as the sole measure for predi cting fracture risk (37). Improved bone 
strength is a more realistic outcome for exercises than large increases in BMD (11). Greater increases in 
BMD have been reported with risedronate than with exercise in post -menopausal women. However, the 
magnitude of  change in BMD may not equal the magnitude of change in fracture risk reduction. Marked 
reductions in fracture risk have been reported with small increases in BMD, likely because appropriate 
exercise training will improve bone strength as well as maintain BMD (38,39).  
This study will include three measures of bone status because the strength of bone depends not only on 
the amount of bone present (BMD) but also on bone structure or geometry and on positive bone 
turnover rates (ratio of bone formation to reso rption) (40,41). Bone structure refers to the cortical and 
trabecular network of bone that is vital for maintaining maximum bone strength (10,42). Compared to 
pre-menopausal women, both cortical thickness and trabecular bone volume in post -menopausal 
women  are substantially reduced (43). In the proposed study, bone structure will be measured at the 
tibia and hip (femoral neck and shaft, trochanter). Bone strength index (BSI), will be measured at the 4%, 
and 66% tibial sites using peripheral quantitative com puted tomography (pQCT). BSI is based upon the 
total bone area, tissue density, bone porosity, and distribution or shape (moment of inertia) at that 
bone site and has been found to be a strong predictor of the torsion and bending strength of bones (9). 
Bone structure at the hip will be measured using Hip Structural Analysis (HSA) software and DXA testing 
(10). HSA measures the distribution of bone mass at the hip. The specific data collected includes the 
cross -sectional area [CSA] occupi[INVESTIGATOR_877033], an index of bone strength against compression; 
section modulus [Z, mm3], an index of bone strength against bending; and centroid [mm], the distance 
from the center of the mass to the periphery (10,44).

 Bone turnover is the process of removing old bone (res orption by [CONTACT_234595]) and replacing it with new 
bone (formation by [CONTACT_766899]) (40,41). In this study, resorption will be measured by [CONTACT_877057] 
(nmol/BCE/L) and formation by [CONTACT_877058] (U/C). One remodeling cycle of resorption and formation 
takes up to s ix months with maybe 5 -15% of total bone mass replaced per year. Menopause results in a 
brief period (~5 years) of accelerated turnover with resorption far exceeding formation (45). Increased 
resorption will result in bone loss. With exercise, there is new  bone formation in areas of mechanical 
strain resulting in bones with greater bending strength in those regions (46). While weakening 
mechanical properties of bone (such as decreased bending strength) are possible with long -term use of 
BPs (>5 years) (29 -31,47), long -term participation in targeted exercise training continually improves 
mechanical properties of bone over time. This provides the rationale for the comprehensive 
examination of bone (bone structure, BMD, and bone turnover) proposed in the study.  
This is one of few studies comparing the effectiveness of a bone -loading exercise program with BPs on 
bone strength.  This is the first study to compare the efficacy of optimal CaD  alone, or in combination 
with the BP, risedronate, or with combined resistance and weight -bearing exercises in improving bone 
struct ure and turnover and preserving BMD in women with low bone mass during the first [ADDRESS_1225505] placed too 
much emphasis on BMD (48).  
 
This is the first study to optimize both calcium and vitamin D dosage . Our preliminary  data and 
previous studies of others suggest that the efficacy of both BPs and exercises are improved with use of 
optimal CaD. Our results will provide more data on dosages of calcium required by [CONTACT_447] -menopausal 
women to supplement their dietary intakes, a nd dosages of vitamin D required for post -menopausal 
women to maintain serum levels at >30 ng/ml.  
 
Our results will provide more information on adherence to exercise in post -menopausal women with 
low bone mass  and on use of cognitive/behavioral strategies including education, goal -setting, reducing 
barriers, and graphic feedback to promote adherence to exercise.  
 
This study was informed by [CONTACT_877059] -menopausal women with low bo ne mass in our previous study, concerns about adverse 
effects with long -term use of BPs, the importance of other measures for bone health such as bone 
structure and turnover, studies reporting the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in post -
menopaus al women, and new information on the importance of optimal dose of vitamin D.

 2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1 Potential Risks  
 
Risk of muscle soreness or injury with exercises.  
There may be temporary muscle soreness for up to two days following the initiation of, or increase in 
resistance training or bone loading exercises. Sudden forceful movements (seldom associated with 
progressive and monitored exercise programs) are the most  common cause of musculoskeletal injury 
associated with exercise. In the previous RO1 study, some exercise subjects (< 10%) did complain of 
temporary muscle soreness with initiation of exercises or increase in weights lifted. If subjects 
complained of disc omfort beyond the expected muscle soreness, exercises were not performed until the 
discomfort resolved. When subjects resumed exercises, they began with adapted exercises and lighter 
weights after another session with the YMCA Exercise Trainer (Y ET). No se rious adverse effects occurred 
in the [ADDRESS_1225506] been specified for this protocol to minimize and decrease the likelihood of 
any risk associated with the exercise program. Precau tions include formulation of specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and monitoring of subjects for safe performance of exercises . In addition, the exercise 
program is initiated slowly and gradually, and the estimated 1 repetition maximum ( 1 RM ) testing is not 
completed until week 2, providing the body time to acclimate to strength training before the max 
testing is performed . If subjects complain of discomfort or pain from the exercise program (more than 
the expected muscle soreness) the on -site YETs wil l seek consultation with the Research Exercise Trainer 
(RET) and [CONTACT_877088], Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and if necessary, refer subjects to their health care 
provider. The RET  and [CONTACT_877088], PT, will make the decision to discontinue the exercise progra m 
after consulting with the health care provider and considering the desires of the subject. Generally, 
subjects will not discontinue exercises because of musculoskeletal problems, but this would be 
dependent on the nature and severity of the problem and t he desires of the subject. If the 
musculoskeletal problem and/or persistent pain is/are not resolved, the subject may discontinue the 
exercise program. This subject will be considered off -protocol and will be asked to complete all tests and 
measurements as  scheduled in alignment with intent -to-treat principles.  
 
If the problem and/or pain is/are resolved, subjects will be encouraged to resume the exercises. 
Subjects who are resuming their exercise program may need to begin with lighter weights, will need a 
consultation with the RET, and may require another supervised session with the RET and/or [CONTACT_877089].  
 
Risk of cardiovascular events with exercises.  
There is a small risk of a cardiovascular event with exercise in persons with preexisting cardiovascular 
disease. The incidence of death during vigorous exercise in healthy adults is 1/15,[ADDRESS_1225507] been specified to reduce the infrequent risk of cardiovascular events 
with exercises:

 • Subjects will be assessed for cardiac risk with the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire 
(PAR-Q) prior to study enrollment and those with high risk will be excluded from the study.  
• Approval from the health care provider is required prior to study enrollment  
• Study personnel (Research Project Coordinators (RPCs) or RET) will obtain blood pressures on all 
subjects at baseline, 6, and 12 months and will consult w ith the subjects provider for those with 
blood pressure greater than 140/90  
• RETs and on -site YETs will be CPR certified  
• All Y MCA s are equipped with cardiac defibrillators  
No cardiovascular events occurred with women participating in exercises in the previo us R01, and age 
range for subjects was [ADDRESS_1225508] notably, vertebral comp ression fracture (VCF). Movements most likely to 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a VCF are combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_877034]. So pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a heavy object with 
one hand would be especially problematic. To minimize risk, we will:  
• minimize use of free weights and t he need to lift heavy objects from the floor  
• use strength training machines that assist in stabilizing the body during the lifting motions  
• provide education on correct, upright posture during performance of all exercise to avoid 
loaded spi[INVESTIGATOR_877035] . 
The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) (highest level of daily intake of calcium from food, water and 
supplements that is likely to not pose any risks of adverse health effects for almost all of the general 
population) is currently est ablished as greater than 2,500 mg per day. Risks of intake above the UL 
include hypercalcemia, impaired kidney function and decreased absorption of other minerals (iron, zinc, 
magnesium and phosphorus). Dietary intake of calcium will be monitored at baseli ne with the  National 
Osteoporosis Foundation  (NOF ) Calcium Intake Estimate tool, and supplements will be prescribed to 
ensure subjects obtain approximately 1200 mg of total calcium (diet and supplements) daily which is 
well below the UL . In addition, serum  calcium levels will be drawn at baseline. Kidney stones have 
occurred with high intakes of calcium, therefore, a daily fluid intake of at least 2,000 ccs will be 
encouraged. Participant will be counseled verbally and in writing not to take additional supp lements of 
calcium beyond the study protocol to keep their intake below the UL . 
 
Risk of Vitamin D supplementation.  
Excessive amounts of vitamin D (D) can result in hypercalcemia. The current Recommended Daily 
Amount of D is 400 -800 IU/day (or 2,800 to 5,600 per week), but studies have reported that D 
supplements of 4,000 IU per day are safe. In addition, subjects will be monitored for signs of D toxicity, 
i.e. hypercalcemia (nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness and weight loss) at RPC 
visits throughout the study. At baseline, subjects will be prescribed optimal doses of D based on the

Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.0 - 20140103  17 
 following protoc ol: Subjects who have serum D levels at 30 ng/ml or greater will be prescribed 1,000 IU 
daily; subjects with levels of 20 -29 ng/ml will be prescribed 2,000 IU daily; and subjects with levels of 10 -
19 ng/ml will be prescribed 3,[ADDRESS_1225509] their serum levels 
rechecked at 3 months. Subjects will serum D level ≥ 60 ng/ml at screening will have levels rechecked at 
3 months, as well as calcium and albumin (calcium adjusted for albumin). All other subjects will have 
follow -up serum levels at 6 months.  
Participants will be counseled verbally and in writing not to take additional supplements of D beyond 
the study protocol to keep their intake below the UL. Subjects with a serum 25(OH) D level at baseline < 
10 ng/ml will be excluded from the study and can reapply when their serum levels are within normal 
limits. Participants with serum vitamin D greater than 60ng/ml at the time of screening will have serum 
levels rechecked at 3 months as well as analysis of serum calcium a djusted for albumin. If substantive 
problems occur related to administration of calcium or D or if serum levels of D elevate beyond 
acceptable levels, subjects will be asked to discontinue the supplements and will be referred to their 
health care provider for recommendation.  
 
Risk of risedronate.  
Reported adverse effects of BPs, including risedronate, are rare, but do include local damage to the 
mucous membrane, gastrointes tinal bleeding, abdominal pain, perforating ulcers, vomiting, esophagitis, 
esophageal cancer, renal impairment at certain doses, severe bone, muscle, and joint pain, and atrial 
fibrillation (62). One serious adverse effect that was first reported with use of the BP zoledronic acid in 
high doses in cancer patients is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (63).While short -term use of BPs is 
relatively safe for most women, the safety of long -term use of BPs (greater th an five years) is unclear 
(64). The FDA recommends that providers be aware of a possible risk of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_877036] f ractures in patients 
taking BPs long -term.  
 
To minimize adverse effects of risedronate, subjects will be instructed in the correct method for 
ingestion of the medication (upon arising in the morning with an [ADDRESS_1225510] 30 minutes after taking risedronate). Serious side effects (recurring abdominal pain, gastritis, 
dysphagia or bone, joint, and muscle pain), will result i n discontinuation of the drug. Subjects will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_877060]. RPC will 
confirm that the subject is taking medication as directed, and will ask Nancy Waltman PhD, APRN -NP or 
Jon Beck, Pharm.D to contact [CONTACT_877061]. If the discomfort cannot be easily resolved, 
the subject will be referred to their health care provider for a decision on continuation of BPs.  
 
Risk of increased bone loss.  
Another concern is that pos tmenopausal women with low bone mass may experience more bone loss 
during the study and be at even greater risk for fractures (especially subjects in the control group). 
During the proposed study, DXA testing will be obtained at baseline 6, and 12 months, and all DXA 
results will be sent to the subjects' health care provider. If the subject has completed 6 months of the 
study and her BMD at the hip or spi[INVESTIGATOR_877037] a T -score of -2.5 or below, the health care 
provider may decide to prescribe treatme nt with medications such as bisphosphonates. Subjects in the 
control or exercise groups who begin taking bisphosphonates during this study will be considered off -
protocol but will be asked to continue to participate in all testing for the study as schedule d.

Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_1225511] and DXA testing.  
There is some radiation exposure with quantitative computed Tomography (QCT) testing, especially with 
axial QCT exams. Radiation doses received during a peripheral QCT (pQCT) exam (2.46 uSV) are much 
less than radiation dosages fr om axial QCT exams (30 60 uSV) or from radiation obtained annually from 
background radiation (2500 uSV). Risks associated with DXA bone density testing are minimal. DXAs are 
safe, non -invasive and painless. Subjects will have a DXA of the whole body at bas eline, during which the 
subject is exposed to 20uSV, or a similar amount you would receive during a [ADDRESS_1225512] is exposed to 
4.8uSV at each scan, or app roximately 10% of the radiation required in a mammogram.  
 
Risks associated with obtaining blood and serum specimens . 
Risks from drawing blood are minimal with the most common being bruising or hematoma formation at 
the venous access site. This is minimized  by [CONTACT_877062]. A rare complication of obtaining serum specimens is infection at the venous access site. This is 
minimized with the use of sterile gloves, sterile needles, and antibacterial cleansing of the skin prior to 
the venipuncture. All venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_877063], minimize variation in procedure 
and risk of infection.  
 
Risk of psych ological discomfort . 
Risks associated with completing the questionnaires and journal include the potential for mild 
psychological stress related to questions on the forms. Subjects will be informed that they can refuse to 
answer any question that may be up setting to them.  
 
Risk of loss of confidentiality . 
While not always possible, all measures will be taken to protect the subject ’s identifiable and protected 
health information and research data . 
2.3.2 Potential Benefits  
Subjects may receive no benefits fro m participation in the study. No benefit is guaranteed. However, 
subjects with low bone mass who are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_877038], risedro nate, or

 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
Our long -term goal  is to contribute to the development of clinical practice guidelines for the promotion 
of bone health in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. Our central hypothesis  is that 
improvements in bone health will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exerc ise group compared to 
subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups.  
Aim1: To compare Control, Risedronate, and Exercise group subjects on changes in bone structure at 
the tibia (bone strength index [BSI]: pQCT)  and hip (femoral neck and shaft, inte rtrochanteric) 
(hipstructural analysis: [HSA: DXA]) at baseline, 6, 12 months.  
H1a: At 12 months, there will be significantly greater improvements in bone strength index (BSI) at the 
4% tibial site in Exercise subjects compared to subjects in either Risedr onate or Control groups  
H1b:  At 12 months, there will be significantly greater improvements in bone mass distribution (HSA; 
centroid, mm) at the femoral neck in Exercise subjects compared to subjects in either Risedronate or 
Control groups  
 
Aim2. To compar e Control, Risedronate, and Exercise group subjects on changes in BMD at the total 
hip, femoral neck, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (DXA) at baseline, 6, and 12 months.  
H2a:  At 12 months, there will be significantly greater improvements in BMD at the total hip, femoral 
neck, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_877039]  
H2b:  At least 80% of subjects in both the Exercise and Risedronate groups will have preserved BMD at 
the total hip, femoral neck, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 
Aim3: To compare Control,  Risedronate, and Exercise group subjects on changes in bone formation 
and resorption at baseline, 6, 12 months. (formation: AlkphaseB, resorption: Serum NTx).  
H3a: At 12 months there will be significantly greater decreases in serum markers of bone resorpti on 
(Serum NTx) in subjects in the Exercise and Risedronate groups compared to subjects in the Control 
group  
H3b:  At [ADDRESS_1225513] decreased to levels considered at low risk f or fracture (< 12.6 nmol BCE/L)  
H3c: At 12 months, there will be significantly greater improvements in serum markers of bone formation 
(Alkphase B) in Exercise subjects compared to subjects in either Control or Risedronate group subjects  
 
Aim4: To explore r elationships between adherence to exercise (%sessions attended) or adherence to 
risedronate (% pi[INVESTIGATOR_38947]) and changes in bone structure at the tibia (BSI) and hip (HSA).  
3.2 Study Outcome Measures

 Bone structure will serve as the primary outcome for this study and will be measured using peripheral 
quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)  and Hip Structural Analysis (HSA)  at baseline, [ADDRESS_1225514] will measure bone strength index (BSI) at the 4% and 66% tibial sites. BSI is based upon the total 
bone area, tissue density, bone porosity, and distribution or shape (moment of inertia) at that bone site 
and has been found to be a strong predictor of the torsion and bending strength of bones. (9) Bone 
structure at the hip will be measured  using HSA software and DXA testing. (10) HSA specifically measures 
the distribution of bone mass at the hip. The data collected includes the cross -sectional area (CSA) 
occupi[INVESTIGATOR_877033], an index of bone strength against compression; section modulus  (Z, mm 3), an 
index of bone strength against bending; and centroid (mm), the distance from the center of the mass to 
the periphery. (10, 45)   
 
3.2.2  Secondary  
Bone turnover and BMD will serve as secondary outcomes and will be measured at baseline 6 and 
12M. Bone turnover will be measured by [CONTACT_877057] (nM BCE) and AlkphaseB (ng/ml).  BMD will be 
measured using DXA.

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This study has a stratified, randomized 3 -group (2 treatment groups & 1 control group), repeated 
measures experimental design. A computer generated code will be used for randomization to 3 groups 
(Control: n =103; Risedronate: n =103; Exercise: n =103) with assignments placed in seale d opaque 
envelopes for sequential use. All subjects will take dosages of calcium citrate supplements sufficient to 
ensure their total daily calcium (diet+supplements) is ~ 1200 mg daily and vitamin D3 supplements with 
daily dose to ensure serum levels of v itamin D [25 (OH)D] are between 30 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL(optimal 
CaD). Subjects randomized to the Risedronate group will take optimal CaD daily and 150mg of oral 
risedronate once monthly for [ADDRESS_1225515] restrictions in 
physical activity for 12 months. Thus, while only women in the exercise group will participate in the 
structured bo ne-loading exercise program developed for this study, all women will be encouraged to 
participate in exercises and will be informed of the benefit of weight bearing and resistance exercises. 
The primary outcome will be bone structure at the tibia and hip a nd secondary outcomes are BMD 
and bone turnover . Repeated measures of primary and secondary outcome variables will be conducted 
at baseline, 6 and 12 months to better understand response to intervention components with a 
maximum difference expected at 12 m onths. An exercise intervention lasting 12 months or 2 to 3 bone 
turnover (resorption / formation) cycles is necessary in order to measure the effec ts of training on bone

 6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
6.1 Intervention(s) Description  
 
All subjects will take dosages of calcium citrate supplements sufficient to ensure their total daily calcium 
(diet + supplements) is ~ 1200 mg daily and will take vitamin D 3 supplements with daily dose dependent 
on their serum levels of vitamin D (25 [OH]D) (optimal CaD). Subjects randomized to the Risedronate 
group will take optimal CaD daily and [ADDRESS_1225523] group. Repeated measures of primary and secondary outcome variables will be 
conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months to better understand response to intervention components 
with a maximum difference expected at 12 months.  
6.2 Administration of Intervention  
 
Optimal CaD  
 
All subjects will take calcium citrate supplements daily to ensure total intake (dietary and supplement) is 
~1200 mg. For optimal bone health, serum vitamin D levels are equal to or > 30 ng/ml. In the proposed

with a goal of reaching optimal serum levels of 30 ng/ml. To determine the optimal dose of D, serum 25 
(OH)D measures will be obtained for all s ubjects at baseline. Subjects who have serum D levels at 30 
ng/ml or greater will be prescribed 1,000 IU daily; subjects with levels of 20 -29 ng/ml will be prescribed 
2,000 IU daily; and subjects with levels of 10 -19 ng/ml will be prescribed 3,[ADDRESS_1225524] their serum levels rechecked at 3 months. Participants with serum 
vitamin D greater than 60ng/ml at the time of screening will have serum levels rechecked at [ADDRESS_1225525] reported that 
with daily dosing of D, it may take three months for plateau serum levels to be reached. The serum D 
criteria pertain to all 3 treatment groups. Patients with serum levels < 10 ng/ml have severe D 
deficiency, will be excluded from the study, and referred to their health care provider for management .

Medication Calendar Cards  
CaD tablets will be supplied in Medication Calendar cards and dispensed by [CONTACT_877067] (TNMC) outpatient pharmacy to study personnel. Calendar cards will be stored in [CONTACT_877089]'s lab, 
in a locked cabinet and distributed to subjects at [ADDRESS_1225527] containing D, will be distributed via mail or in 
person. Subjects in t he risedronate group will receive additional cards containing risedronate. The 
medication risedronate requires a prescription. Prescriptions for risedronate will be written by [CONTACT_877068], MD (who serves as supervising physician on the study), dispensed to s tudy personnel by [CONTACT_877069], and mailed to subjects  or delivered in person . Tablets will be secured in individual 
bubbles on the cards. Subjects will be instructed to take their risedronate tablet at a minimum of seven 
days prior to the next  scheduled dose  (see Form 1. Calendar Card Instructions  ). All cards will be 
collected by [CONTACT_877070] 4 -week period. In 
circumstances which a participant does not wish to take study supplements, and would like to continue 
taking their own, personnel will monitor their adherence to taking optimal levels of calcium and vitamin 
D through taking their own vitamins and/or supplements  (see Form 2. Blank Calendar ). 
 
Bone -Loading Exercise Program  In the proposed study, exercise participants will receive CaD 
per protocol as described for the Risedronate and Control participants. In addition, exercise partic ipants 
will participate in an exercise intervention consisting of 1) high impact weight bearing exercise such as 
jogging and 2) resistance exercises three times weekly for 12 months at a community -based YMCA (Y) 
(There are 8 Y's  based in Omaha, NE, [ADDRESS_1225528], NE, and 1 in Council Bluffs, IA). Each session will 
include warm up and cool down exercises consisting of 5 minutes of slow walking.  
 
 
Resistance Exercise  (see Form 3. HOPS Exercise Booklet_Revised  for details)  
1) Upper Extremity  Exercises  - Push Exercises (2 sets each): horizontal press, overhead press.  
2) Upper Extremity  Exercises  - Pull Exercises (2 sets each): lati ssimus pull, sitting row.  
3) Lower Extremity  Exercises : (2 sets each)

 Exercises should be completed as follows (see Form 3. HOPS Exercise Booklet_Revised ): 
Participants will alternate  between colored exercises, i.e. Red is Upper Body, Blue is Lower Body, and 
Green is Core to allow the participant an effective use of time and also meet the requ ired [ADDRESS_1225529] between the same exercises ( see Protocol 4. First Exercise Session Explanation 
and Documentation ) 
 Initial resistance during week 1 will be based upon % of body weight values for each machine 
weight exercise ( Form 4. Starting Load Values Based Upon Body Weight ) along with participant feedback 
using the Borg 
rate of perceived 
exertion (RPE) 
scale (see  Form 
5. Borg RPE 
scale ). For body 
weight exercises, 
the participant 
will start out 
with the basic 
exercises 
options where 
offered. This  
acclimation of 
the machine 
weight exercises 
will prepare the 
participant for 
the estimated 1 
RM testing that will occur  during week 2. Week 2 will be used t o determine loads for weight machines . 
Strength will be assessed by [CONTACT_877071] 9 or less repetitions 
with good form  (Protocol 5. Estimating 1RM ). 
Progression will be prescribed based on the 
participant’s estimated 1 RM  value and the YET 
HOPS excel spreadsheet or progression tables 
(Protocol 6. YET HOPS Exercise Schedule  or 
Protocol 7. Progression and Increase Parameters 
for Exercise ). Reassessment of 1 RM will occur at 
6 months. The purpose of 1 RM reassessment is 
to validate that the intervention is resu lting in 
physiologic change and to evaluate if the 
workload is at a therapeutic potential (goal: workload > 70%of 1RM ). Participants will be encouraged to 
increase workload to > 70% of [ADDRESS_1225530], an advanced movement, or increased hold time. Both resistance and repetitions 
will be increased over time to participant tole rance.   Table 2.  Resistance Training with Weight Machines:   Exerci se Progression

Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_1225531], weight bearing 
exercises with high ground reaction forces to promote bone remodeling. Participants will walk around a 
track, or any other open space, interspersed with  short periods of jogging. A fter walking for 20 -30 
seconds, participants will jog the prescribed number of steps and then return to walking. To avoid 
working at a vigorous intensity, participants will continue walking until they reach an RPE at or below 11  
on the Borg RPE scale provided . (see Protocol 8. Impact 
Jogging ) 
To promote optimal performance, participants w ill be 
provided the Form 3. HOPS Exercise Booklet_Revised  
and Form 8. Exercise Log_Revised . The booklet will 
include detailed written and visual supportive 
instructions for each exercise including specific 
prescribed exercise session parameters to guide the 
participants.  The exercise log applies corresponding 
colors to associate exercises with those in the booklet. 
The exercise log will also be a tool used  to detail the 
prescribed resistance, repetitions, sets, and steps to assure the participant is meeting  the goals se t forth 
for them by [CONTACT_1758].  
To promote optimal adherence  and therapeutic potential of workload, a graphic feedback sheet will be 
provided to the participant ( see Protocol 9. Graphic  Feedback ). The graphic feedback sheet will display 
graphs of the individual’s prior performance relative to study goals in order to improve adherence. For 
statistical analysis, adherence will be defined as the % training s essions attended; this will be calculated 
using the participant logs, which will be validated by Y electronic entrance documentation.  
Exercise participants can perform exercises at the Ys at any time during operating hours regardless of 
whether one of the study’s on -site YET coordinators are  present ( Protocol 10. Exercise Trainer Oversight 
Schedule_Revised ). Even when YET coordinators are not present, other exercise specialists at the Y will 
always be present to answer general exercise questions or assist if problems arise with the exercise 
equipment.  
 
All exercises will be performed at a Y under the direction of Y exercise trainers (YETs) (see  Form 10. 
YMCA Contact  [CONTACT_877072]_Version 3 , Form 11. Availability of YETs ). On -site YETs will 
communicate with each exercise participant every two weeks during the [ADDRESS_1225532]  (see Protocol 11.Storing Exercise Docs at 
YMCAs ). Communication between the RET and YET will be ongoing and will occur at s pecific, along with 
inter mittent, times during the study. The RET and YET’s will also collectively use strategies regarding 
participant adherence to the exercise program (see Protocol 12.Addressing Missing Exercise Session,

According to Bandura, adherence is related to "task and barrier self -efficacy". Task self -efficacy is 
subject ’s confidence in their ability to perform interventions such as exercises, and barrier self -efficacy is 
subjects confidence in their ability to overcome barriers to interventions. We will promote task and 
barrier self -efficacy through subject education, goa l setting, reducing barriers, and by [CONTACT_877074].  
Feedback sheets will be provided to subjects to demonstrate progress over time in adherence to 
interventions, 1RM measures, weight loads for exercises, and  BMD. Scripts will be provided for assisting 
with goal -setting and reducing barriers to promote standardization across sites. Strategies for reducing 
barriers to adherence to exercises will be tailored to subjects based on their scores on the Barriers

 10 DATA ENTRY/ STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1225553] complex 
analysis. Hypothesis 1a states that at 12 months, there will be significantly greater improvements in BSI 
at the 4% tibial site in subjects in the exercise group compared to subjects in the control or risedronate 
groups. Power for the repeated measures analysis of variance (RM -ANOVA) was determined using 
G*Power3.1.5. A within -between inter action will be the primary test of significance (time*group 
interaction). It is assumed that the exercise group will have significantly greater improvements in BSI 
than either the control or risedronate groups. Two groups were assumed for the purposes of t he power 
analysis because the control and risedronate groups will be compared to the exercise group separately. 
The total sample size will then be the number determined plus one half to populate the three groups. 
We investigated effect size evidence from s imilar studies and a variety of effect sizes was observed. 
However, effect sizes were not reported in the studies that were deemed most similar to the planned 
study. This study compares an exercise group to control and risedronate groups, which is unique s o a 
large expected effect size could not be assumed without further evidence.  
Therefore, a small effect size was assumed for this power analysis (f=.10; Cohen 1992). Assuming a 
significance level of .05, 3 time points, and an estimate of .5 for the correla tion between time points, 
246 participants (82 per group) would be needed to have 80% power.  
10.[ADDRESS_1225554], will be measured at 6 -month intervals (0, 6, 
and 12 months). A significant time*group interact ion would indicate that the two groups being 
compared in each model have significantly different changes in bone structure over [ADDRESS_1225555] significantly greater improvements than the control or 
risedronate groups. Up to 20% attrition may be expected over the course of the study, but we expect it

Research Exercise Trainer (RET), and ETs to promote exercise adherence and retention in the study. The 
method of handling missing data is not likely to have an effect with small amounts of missing data. 
Howev er, If there is a higher than expected attrition rate, a maximum likelihood estimation method (e.g. 
mixed models) will be used instead of RM -ANOVA in order to utilize all available data and not delete 
cases in a listwise manner.  
 
Hypothesis 2a compares the  groups changes in BMD and will also be analyzed using RM -ANOVA. 
Hypothesis 2b also involves BMD, but assesses the proportions of preservation of BMD in each group. It 
is expected that at least 80% of subjects in both the exercise+ and risedronate+ groups will have 
preserved BMD at the three skeletal sites, and that the control/CaD group will have a significantly lower 
proportion of participants preserving BMD over [ADDRESS_1225557] in Aim 4 will be explored by [CONTACT_877085], percentage of risedronate pi[INVESTIGATOR_38947], and 12 -month changes in bone structure at 
the tibia and hip. Assuming the variables are normally distributed, Pearson correlations will be used. 
Spearman rank correlations will be used if any of the variables are found to be non -normal.

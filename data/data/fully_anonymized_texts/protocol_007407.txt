STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sample Size 
Calculation The purpose of the study is to provide preliminary comparative data on 
BoNT/A-DP versus  Subsequently the sample size is 
primarily based on clinical judgement and practical considerations, rather 
than formal statistical arguments. However, with a sample size of 
100 subjects per group, a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference between BoNT/A-DP and  will extend 10.8% 
from expected proportions of 81.5% in both groups based on large sample 
normal approximation. 
Analysis Data Sets Safety Analysis Set (SAF): 
All subjects who received at least one injection with study medication 
(independent of whether it is BoNT/A-DP or ) will be valid for the 
SAF. Within the SAF, a subject will be considered for the treatment 
actually received and not for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_17628], if 
different. The SAF will be used for the evaluation of the safety assessments.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): 
The FAS includes all randomized subjects who had a Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_398193] will be considered for the treatment assigned by 
[CONTACT_322534], if different, 
i.e., following the intent-to-treat principle. The FAS population will be the 
primary population for efficacy parameters.  
General Statistical 
Considerations The primary objective of the study is to provide preliminary comparative 
data of BoNT/A-DP versus  
The study comprises co-primary responder endpoints defined as: 
• An FWS score of 0 or 1 and ≥ 1 point reduction in FWS score at 
maximum frown at the Week 4 Visit relative to Baseline based on 
investigator assessment 
• An FWS score of 0 or 1 and ≥ [ADDRESS_398194] assessment 
That is, responders are defined as having an FWS score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvement ≥ 1 point at maximum frown of the glabellar lines at Week 4 
relative to Baseline in FWS, based on the investigators’ and the subjects’ 
in-clinic assessments. 
The focus of the statistical analysis for the co-primary endpoints will be on 
descriptive statistics (n and %), and 95% CIs for the difference in treatment 
effects between BoNT/A-DP and  
95% Clopper-Pearson CIs will be calculated for the difference between 
BoNT/A-DP and  for each co-primary endpoint. No formal 
statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. 
For other endpoints, categorical variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_322535] (n and %) of subjects for each 
endpoint. Continuous variables will be summarized using the following 
descriptive statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. Time-to-response and duration of 
response will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.

Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765]. The main analysis will be performed 
based on all available data. That is, no imputation of missing values will be 
conducted (e.g., no last observation carried forward) except for the 
co-primary endpoints where missing data will be assumed to be 
non-responders. 
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) 
and preferred term (PT) (using current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]). The number of events, as well as the 
number and percentage of affected subjects, will be reported. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (SOC and PT) will also be summarized by 
[CONTACT_12917], severity, relationship to study medication, and relationship to 
procedure.

Botulinum toxin is produced by [CONTACT_322537] ( C. botulinum ). A number of different strains of C. botulinum  have been 
identified, which produce eight immunologically distinct serotypes (types A - H), all of 
which interfere with neural transmission by [CONTACT_322538], 
causing muscle paralysis, however only serotypes A and B are used clinically1,2. The 
toxins are releas
ed from the bacteria as part of a noncovalent multimeric complex, 
associated with up to six auxiliary proteins, including hemagglutinins and a nontoxin, 
nonhematuglitin3. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) is synthesized as a single-chain 
polypeptide with a
 molecular weight (MW) of approximately 150 kilo Dalton (kDa), 
comprising a 100-kDa heavy chain joined by a disulfide bond to a 50-kDa light chain4. 
The heavy chain ta
rgets the toxin to specific types of axon terminals, after which the 
toxin can be taken into neurons by [CONTACT_249426]5,6. The light chain of the toxin, which 
has zinc-dependent endo
protease activity, is then released from the endocytotic vesicles 
and reaches the cytoplasm. The light chain blocks the release of the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine, causing dose-dependent weakening of the target muscle. The type A 
toxin proteolytically degrades its target SNAP-25 protein, which is essential for 
exocytosis of acetylcholine vesicles located in the peripheral motor neurons7,8. By 
[CONTACT_322539]/fusing with the nerve synapse plasma 
membrane and inhibiting acetylcholine release, the toxin interferes with nerve impulses 
and causes muscle paralysis3,9. 
The ability of bot
ulinum toxin to inhibit acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular 
junction has been exploited for use in medical conditions characterized by [CONTACT_322540]10. The broad range of medical indications for botulinum toxin includes 
treatment of movem e
nt disorders (e.g., spasticity, cervical dystonia), urological 
disorders (e.g., overactive bladder), dermatological conditions (e.g., axillary 
hyperhidrosis), chronic migraine, as well as cosmetic applications (glabellar lines, 
canthal lines).  
Glabellar lines, which appear as vertical lines between the eyebrows, are caused by 
[CONTACT_322541]. These glabellar frown lines 
often become more prominent with age and can project negative emotions 
unintentionally11,12,13. In addition, the persistent presence of glabellar frown lines can 
be suggestive of a
n older than actual age, affecting an individual’s self-perception, 
emotional well-being, and perception by [CONTACT_2312], in some cases contributing to 
depression14,15. 
The first authoriz e
d botulinum toxin product on the market was®, which received 
Food and Drug Adminis t
ration (FDA) approval for therapeutic treatment of strabismus

The Sponsor is currently using the name [CONTACT_322578]/A-DP for clinical development, with 
plans to introduce a new name [CONTACT_322579]. 
The indicated clinical condition (glabellar lines) is chronic in nature and the botulinum 
toxin effect typi[INVESTIGATOR_322512] a few months (function is typi[INVESTIGATOR_322513], which usually 
takes two to three months), hence subjects need to be injected repeatedly to maintain 
the effect21,22. The aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 
BoNT/A-DP in the trea
tment of glabellar lines in comparison with  . 
7.2 Clinical Conditi o
n/Indication 
Hyperfunctional facial lines (mimic wrinkles) are common aesthetic deformities 
involving the glabellar area, forehead and periorbital area. Glabellar lines occur as a 
result of the pull on the skin on the underlying facial musculature, predominantly the 
procerus muscle and the corrugator supercilli23; the latter muscle has no essential 
function other than to e
xpress emotion. Although fine wrinkling on the upper lip and 
cheeks, and crow’s feet, as well as the deeper lines in the nasolabial area are a sign of 
aging, wrinkling in the glabellar area is associated with the expression of frowning. 
Excessively prominent lines in this area (which appear as vertical lines between the 
eyebrows) are often misinterpreted as anger, anxiety, fear, fatigue and melancholia, 
causing the subject considerable distress24. As a result, glabellar lines can negatively 
influence self-per
ception, perception by [CONTACT_322542]25,26. Although 
treatments are a
vailable for such lines (including topi[INVESTIGATOR_322514]), there are several disadvantages to currently available treatments and most 
facial rejuvenation procedures do not address the underlying musculature responsible 
for facial lines.  
Studies with botulinum toxin have shown that the toxin weakens the overactive 
underlying muscle contraction, causing a flattening of the facial skin and improved 
appearance. The effect of the neurotoxin on facial lines was first reported in the early 
90’s. Subsequent widespread use has supported its efficacy and safety for several 
therapeutic indications including facial aesthetics10,27. Lewis and Bowler (2009)[ADDRESS_398212] been reported13,20,28.

accountability) will be done by [CONTACT_322544]. 
7.4 Non-clinical and Clinical Summaries 
7.4.1 Non-clinical Summary 
The efficacy and safety of Croma´s BoNT/A have been thoroughly assessed in multiple 
non-clinical studies in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and Beagle dogs treated up to 28 days; 
fertility and reproductive and developmental studies have been carried out in SD rats; 
and selected safety pharmacology (electrocardiogram) and local tolerance examinations 
have performed as part of repeat-dose toxicity studies in both species.  
Across these studies, no significant or unexpected pathology or toxicity findings have 
been observed in single or multiple dose toxicity studies using the i.m. route; no 
histological changes of muscles were observed at the administration site; and no 
compound-related lesions of the muscle groups distant to the injection sites of the 
peripheral or central nervous system were observed. In both SD rats and Beagle dogs, 
significant decreases in body weight, considered an indirect effect related to paralysis, 
have been observed at doses of BoNT/A-DP ranging from 6-30 U/kg of body. Paralytic 
gait has been seen in reproductive toxicity testing, and was considered to be due to 
exaggerated pharmacologic effects of BoNT/A-DP. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) in rats ranged from 1-15 U/kg and in Beagle dogs at or above 30 U/kg. 
The LD 50 value has been calculated to be 129.5 U/kg in rats; in dogs, no LD 50 has been 
calculated. 
In a c om
parison efficacy study in SD rats, the extent of Croma´s BoNT/A-DP paralysis 
potential was comparable to that of   at all time points (3, 7, 14, 21, 
[ADDRESS_398215]-dose) and concent
rations (2, 4, 8 U/animal) tested.  
Because the mechanism behind the recovery of nerve function is well known and well 
described in peer-reviewed scientific literature, and because the FDA noted no evidence

for local or systemic adverse effects after long-term use when evaluating the safety data 
package of Dysport® (six injections, four week intervals)30, Croma has not evaluated 
local and systemi
c toxicity following long-term treatment with BoNT/A-DP. No 
standard pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic studies have been performed with Croma´s 
BoNT/A-DP, since the chemical nature of the drug is a protein and the expected 
consequence of metabolism of proteins is the degradation to small peptides and 
individual amino acids. 
All pi[INVESTIGATOR_322516] (ICH) guidance. For further 
details, please refer to the Investigators Brochure (IB). 
7.4.2 Clinical Summary 
To date, the clinical development of BoNT/A-DP has included multiple Phase 3 studies 
and one Phase 3 study; one Phase 3 study is ongoing.  
Two multi-center Phase 3 studies (BLESS I and BLESS II) were performed in the US 
and Europe. Both studies were comprised of two parts. The first parts of the studies 
were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phases which aimed to 
demonstrate efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo. The second 
part was an open label extension phase to evaluate efficacy after repeat treatments and 
long-term safety. Each product was administered at a dose of 20 U (0.5 mL). The on-
going BLESS III study continues with this study design. 
In all three studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects among 
BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups with a Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) score of 0 or 1 and 
an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown) at the Week 4 visit (of 
the first treatment cycle) relative to Baseline (responders), based on both the 
investigator’s and the subject’s in-clinic assessments. Thus, the primary endpoint was 
a composite endpoint comprising investigator and subject assessments of treatment 
effectiveness. 
In addition, Phase [ADDRESS_398216] been performed in Korea using the IMP 
name “Botulax”. The Sponsor is currently using the name [CONTACT_322578]/A-DP for clinical 
development. 
In clinical studies to date, more than 1,[ADDRESS_398217] been exposed to BoNT/A-DP 
for cosmetic and other indications, with doses ranging from [ADDRESS_398218] stroke upper limb spasticity.  
  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398219] been no deaths reported during the studies, no serious adverse events 
(SAEs) related to study medication, no treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) that led to 
discontinuation and no development of anti-drug antibody during the studies. 
For further details, please refer to the IB. 
7.5 Study Rationale 
BoNT/A-DP has been shown to be safe and well tolerated when administered at doses 
up to 360 U, which is well above the 20 U dose planned for use in this study. This 
current Phase 2 study is designed as a randomized double-blind study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in the treatment of glabellar lines in comparison 
with  Data obtained from this study (and from BLESS I, BLESS II and 
BLESS III) will provide evidence of efficacy and subject safety in controlled clinical 
study setting. The dose rationale for this study is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Design Justi f
ication 
This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study. 
The study will take place in the EU, US and Canada.  
To allow all subjects to profit from treatment and to obtain adequate data for 
BoNT/A-DP treatment, the study will be comprised of a double-blinded treatment 
comparing BoNT/A-DP with  (ratio 1:1). Primary and secondary 
endpoints will compare efficacy, safety and subject satisfaction after a single treatment 
of the investigational BoNT/A-DP to an existing commercially available product 
  
Two hundred subjects will be enrolled, which should allow for a precise estimate of 
response rate and for post-hoc sensitivity analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Justification 
The dose selected is 20 U, where 1 U is defined as "the calculated median 
intraperitoneal LD 50 in mice". Study HG-11-01 performed in South Korea 
demonstrated that a  
dose of 20 U BoNT/A-DP per treatment was safe and highly 
efficacious in the treatment of glabellar lines. The potency units of botulinum toxins for 
injection are specific to the preparation and assay methods utilized and are not 
interchangeable with other preparations31 (historical data with similar products have 
confirmed the effic
acy of a 20 U dose and current safety recommendations favor the 
use of such small doses32; FDA Guidance for Upper Facial Lines). 
Both BoNT/A-DP and  w
ill be administered at a dose of 20 U, allowing 
a comparison of equivalent doses.  

  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398220] 
The benefit of participation in this study is the expected reduction in the severity of 
glabellar frown lines. All subjects will benefit from free medical screenings and 
follow-up.  
7.6.2 Possible Risks/Inconveniences for the Subject 
Botulinum toxin drug products present a unique set of safety concerns related to the 
potential for local and distant spread of toxin effect. Therefore, an active evaluation of 
subjects for signs and symptoms of local and distant spread of toxin effect will be 
performed throughout the study at each study visit. Subjects will be warned about signs 
of the spread of toxin effects including asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, 
diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, breathing 
difficulties and possible AEs of special interest (AESIs; Section 14.1). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
speech or swallowi n
g difficulties can also result, which could be life threatening, 
however no definitive SAE reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with 
cosmetic or dermatologic use of botulinum toxin at the labeled dose of 20 U (for 
glabellar lines) or 100 U (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) have been reported 
to date. BoNT/A-DP will be administered at a dose of 20 U;  will be 
administered per product label (20 U). 
Baseline physical examinations will also be conducted to rule out pre-existing 
neurological or muscular deficiencies. In addition, key safety measures such as vital 
signs and pregnancy tests (where appropriate) will be conducted at suitable intervals to 
ensure no participating subjects are pregnant. 
As is the case with all injected products, injection site reactions such as pain, tenderness, 
redness, induration and/or swelling may occur after administration. In addition, a 
number of other symptoms have been experienced by [CONTACT_322545], 
hypertonia, ptosis, headache, diplopia, edema and blurred vision. The most frequently 
observed injection site reactions were injection site pain and swelling. The vast majority 
of AEs were rated as mild. As a side effect of drawing blood, pain, hematoma, and in 
very rare cases an infection at the venipuncture site may occur. 
In addition, as with any IMP, there may be unforeseeable risks associated with the use 
of BoNT/A-DP.

9.6 Randomization and Blinding 
9.6.1 Randomization 
This is a randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled efficacy and safety clinical 
study. Subjects will be randomly assigned at Baseline (Day 0) to receive a single 
treatment of BoNT/A-DP or  at a ratio of 1:1 
Randomization will be performed per study site via Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). One unique randomization code will be assigned to each subject.  
9.6.2 Blinding 
BoNT/A-DP will be provided to the sites in glass vials.  will be 
provided to the sites as commercially available. 
In order to maintain blinding, both BoNT/A-DP and  will be 
reconstituted and drawn into the syringes by [CONTACT_322547]. After the IMPs have been drawn into the syringes, the treatments will look identical 
(clear solution, comparable volume), thus maintaining the blind.  
The unblinded study team member preparing the IMP at the study site must not, by [CONTACT_148457], be involved in any other study data collection activities including AE 
assessment, electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) completion, diary collection, etc. IMP 
will be assigned to the subjects by [CONTACT_322548]. The assigned vial will 
be reconstituted and the filled syringes for injection will be forwarded to the 
investigator for injection. Specific Blinding Plans will be created at each study site 
during the Study Initiation visits. The blind will be maintained.  
9.6.3 Unblinding 
The decision to unblind lies fully with the investigator. The randomization assignment 
should not be revealed before the study has been completed and the database has been 
cleaned and closed. The study will be unblinded using the Study Specific Unblinding 
Procedure (an unblinding module is standard on all blinded studies; also it is possible 
to grant access to regulatory unblinding users so that they can monitor the safety of the 
study, if required). 
In case of emergency, the IMP administered to the subjects can be revealed using 
the unblinding function of the IWRS. 
In rare emergencies, unblinding may be necessary for the clinical management of an 
AE. Investigators should consider unblinding only if knowledge of the administered 
product will have an influence on the further treatment of the AE. In such events, the 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page 36 of 89 
Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
investigator should make every attempt to inform the Sponsor before breaking the blind 
or as soon as possible after unblinding has been performed. The or Croma 
medical team is available to discuss any unblinding need. However, such discussion is 
not mandatory. The investigator can always unblind per his/her discretion if the actual 
treatment information is considered relevant for subsequent event treatment. Once 
unblinding has occurred, the site should immediately contact [CONTACT_322549]. Communication of the unblinding result is considered acceptable. It is at 
the discretion of the investigator to continue an unblinded subject in the study. The date 
and time of breaking the code, the reason for breaking the code, study product 
administered, subject identification number and randomization code will be 
documented within the IWRS. Subjects for whom the blind had been broken may 
continue in the study as per discretion of the Investigator. 
9.7 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322517] a case of critical non-compliance of site to the Code of Federal Regulation (Title 21, 
CFR Part 312); the study protocol; the Declaration of Helsinki; or any applicable 
regulation, the Sponsor may stop the entire study or participation of a study site at any 
time. In addition, the Sponsor may stop the entire study, or terminate participation of a 
study site for any medical reason at any time. 
In the event of individual subject’s premature study termination resulting from an AE, 
refer to Section 12.6. 
Premature terminat i
on of a subject 
A subject must be terminated from the study if any of the following occur: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent. 
• Treatment with any other investigational product in another clinical study. 
• Treatment with any BoNT other than study medication. 
• Pregnancy detected at Screening or Baseline. 
• Any significant treatment-related side effects where study continuation would 
constitute an unacceptably high risk for the subject. 
Premature termination of a site or of the entire study 
A site or the entire study may be terminated if any of the following occur: 
• Critical non-compliance to Title 21, CFR Part 312; the study protocol; the 
Declaration of Helsinki; or any applicable regulation. 
• The positive benefit/risk ratio is no longer maintained. 
• The Sponsor may stop the entire study for any medical reason at any time.

Sterile physiological saline (0.9% preservative-free sodium chloride solution for 
injection) will be used as the diluent for reconstitution of BoNT/A-DP and will be added 
at a volume of 1.25 mL for 50 U. Diluent will be injected slowly into the vial, to avoid 
foam/bubble formation or vigorous agitation which may cause denaturation. If a 
vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial, the vial will be discarded. Reconstituted 
BoNT/A-DP should be colorless and transparent with no visible particulate matter. The 
reconstituted BoNT/A-DP must be administered within [ADDRESS_398240] will be stored in a refrigerator (+2 to +8°C). A volume of 0.[ADDRESS_398241] clinical procedures.

BoNT/A-DP or : two injections in each corrugator supercilii muscle 
and one injection in the procerus  muscle, as shown in Figure 1.  
 
Figure [ADDRESS_398243] injection will be made right above the medial margin of 
eyebrows. The second injection will be made ca. 1 cm above the supraorbital ridge 
(rigid bony boundaries palpable above the upper part of the upper eyelid) where 
midlines of the eyebrows meet. The injection site of the procerus  muscle will be just 
above the midline of the nasal bridge where horizontal wrinkles are made between the 
medial ends of eyebrows. When injecting into the medial ends of corrugator supercilii  
muscles and on the midlines of the eyebrows, the injection sites will be at least [ADDRESS_398244] from the supraorbital ridge (rigid bony boundaries palpable above the upper part 
of the upper eyelid).

(see Section 11.3). Records will be maintained that include the Subject Identification 
C
ode (SIC), the dispensation date and amount of IMP dispensed. The IMP must be 
dispensed only at the institution specified for each site. After reconciliation by [CONTACT_322554], all remaining unused, unreconstituted IMP will be returned to the 
Sponsor, or destroyed at site with the permission of the Sponsor, in accordance with 
applicable law and study site procedures. Partially used reconstituted IMP will be 
destroyed after use (e.g., autoclaved, treated with hypochlorite or discarded in 
appropriate containers and disposed of as medical biohazardous waste). If unused 
unreconstituted IMP is to be destroyed by [CONTACT_779], the investigator will provide 
documentation in accordance with Sponsor’s specifications. 
 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398247] who provides informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the ICF) and has been 
proven eligible during Screening will be considered enrolled in the study. Study 
procedures cannot commence until the subject has undergone the informed consent 
process and signed the ICF. 
Efforts will be made to include subjects with a diversity of Fitzpatrick skin types. 
12.[ADDRESS_398248] Identification Codes 
An SIC will automatically be assigned by [CONTACT_322555], which will 
comprise H2H (denoting “Head 2 Head BLESS”) followed by a single digit country 
identification, a two-digit site identification and a three-digit subject identification 
number. All study documents (e.g., eCRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, 
drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. An abbreviated SIC 
containing only the 3-digit subject number is acceptable, when the country identifier 
and site number are clearly assigned to the document. 
12.3 Screening and Study Visits 
The study site is responsible for maintaining an Enrollment/Screening Log that includes 
all subjects screened. The log will also serve to document the reason for Screening 
failure. All Screening data will be collected and reported in eCRFs, regardless of 
Screening outcome.

12.5.2 Patient Reported Outcomes 
A patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument (i.e., a questionnaire plus the information 
and documentation that support its use) is a means to capture subject views of outcomes 
used to measure treatment benefit or risk in IMP clinical studies. Two PRO instruments 
will be used in this study to support claims in the product label, comprising:  
• The GLS-S ( Section 13.1.1, Section 23.2). 
• The FACE-Q Satisf a
ction with Outcome Scale which will be used to measure 
subject satisfaction with treatment ( Section 13.2, Section 23.3). 
Entries in the quest
ionnaires will be transcribed into the EDC system by a blinded 
member of the site study team. 
12.[ADDRESS_398257] Completion/Discontinuation 
A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active 
participation in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to have, followed all 
appropriate conditions of a protocol (with or without protocol deviations). Study 
completion will be documented in the eCRF. 
Reasons for completion or non-completion will be reported on the 
Completion/Termination eCRF, including: completed, screen failure, premature 
termination due to AE (including death), discontinuation by [CONTACT_1130] (e.g., dropout, lost 
to follow-up, withdrawn informed consent), physician decision (e.g., non-compliance 
with protocol, or for safety reasons), study terminated by [CONTACT_2728], or other reason to be 
specified by [CONTACT_093]. Regardless of the reason for subject withdrawal, all data 
available for the subject up to the time of completion/discontinuation should be 
transferred from the subject records on the appropriate eCRF.  
Every effort will be made to have discontinued subjects complete the End of Study 
visit. All procedure and assessment results performed at the End of Study visit will be 
recorded under the Termination visit assessments. If a subject terminates participation 
in the study during or after a visit and does not return for a Completion/Termination 
visit, or is lost to follow up their last recorded assessments shall remain under the last 
visit they attended (i.e., no assessment data shall be recorded under/transferred to the 
Completion/Termination visit assessments). The reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded on the eCRF.

13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
13.1 Assessment of Glabellar Line Severity: Facial Wrinkle Scale  
In accordance with FDA Guidelines for Upper Facial Lines, efficacy will be determined 
using well defined, valid and reliable clinician-reported and subject-reported 
assessments, capable of measuring the critical outcomes that contribute to a conclusion 
of overall success or failure. For both investigator and subject assessment, 
measurements will be made at maximum frown (the worst appearance of upper facial 
lines with maximum load on the muscle; eyebrows pushed together as far as they can 
go) and at rest (the best appearance of upper facial lines with the least load on the 
muscle), which allows one to impute benefit when the face is in dynamic motion 
(variable load on the muscle).  
The scale used most frequently in clinical studies is the FWS, which is a four-point 
rating scale as follows: 0=no facial wrinkles; 1=mild facial wrinkles; 2=moderate facial 
wrinkles; and 3=severe facial wrinkles. The scale has been validated and shown to be 
reproducible33. However, this scale includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_322518] l
e, meaning that the sensitivity of the scale at rest is low. The FWS 
proposed for use in this study is comprised of the GLS-I and GLS-S. The scales and the 
instructions for use for the investigator and subject are provided in Section 23.1 and 
Section 23.2, respectively; additional information for the investigator is provi ded in the 
completion manuals: ‘Glabellar Line Scale - Subject: Completion Manual for 
Investigator’, and ‘Glabellar Line Scale - Investigator: Completion Manual’. 
13.1.[ADDRESS_398259]'s glabellar lines at 
maximum frown and at rest using the GLS-I and the GLS-S, respectively.  
Subjects will be trained extensively in accurate self-assessment of their glabellar line 
severity by [CONTACT_315445], as outlined in the completion 
manuals (Glabellar Line Scale - Subject: Completion Manual for Investigator and 
Glabellar Line Scale – Investigator: Completion Manual). Investigators will complete 
training before study initiation. Subject assessment must be performed independently 
of the investigator and ideally before the investigator assessment, to rule out any 
influence or bias from the investigator. The date and time of assessment will be 
recorded for each visit.  
The same investigator must complete Baseline assessments and FWS at Week 4 
(primary endpoint assessments) for a given subject. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be a composite endpoint of the investigators’ and 
the subjects’ assessments of line severity at maximum frown after treatment with

responder if they have a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 1 point in FWS at 
maximum frown at the Week 4 Visit relative to Baseline, based on both the 
investigator’s and the subject’s in-clinic assessments of the GLS-I and GLS-S, 
respectively.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_398260] will 
be taken at the following visits: Baseline before treatment; at study Visits 4, 5, and 7 
(2, 4, and [ADDRESS_398261]-treatment, respectively); and at Visit 8, End of Study ([ADDRESS_398262]-treatment).  
13.[ADDRESS_398263] Satisfaction with Treatment 
Treatment satisfaction will be measured using the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Outcome 
Scale34 (Section 23.3) at Visits 5 and 7, and at Visit 8, End of Study (4, 12, and [ADDRESS_398264]-tr e

therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether 
or not related to the IMP. AEs will be recorded from signing the ICF until the End of 
Study visit. SAEs and AESIs are subgroups of AEs as defined below. Any remark for 
AEs in general also applies to AESIs and SAEs.  
Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the 
start of the study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History; 
however, any increase in severity, frequency or duration of a pre-existing disease during 
the course of the study will be recorded as an AE. Clinically significant test results at 
Screening will be recorded as Medical History. Any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject between ICF and administration of the study treatment will be recorded as a 
Pre-treatment Event on the Medical History page. Any untoward medical occurrence 
in a subject that occurs after treatment until the End of Study visit will be recorded as 
an AE. All AEs, AESIs, and SAEs must be recorded, irrespective of whether they are 
considered study drug related.

educated on possible warning signs and precautions and on rare AESIs through the 
Subject Information Sheet (SIS). Safety data related to this specific potential effect 
should be obtained through directed query at each study visit and if an AESI (as listed 
below) is reported, a targeted physical examination should be conducted to evaluate for 
signs and symptoms of local and distant spread of toxin effect. AESI assessment and 
documentation is mandatory based upon the event term. An AESI must also be reported 
even if e.g., the duration of the event is considered unusual for an AESI or if the event 
is considered as being not related to the study drug. AESIs potentially suggestive of 
distant spread of toxin include:

definitions above. Examples of such events are: invasive or malignant cancers, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependence or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322521]. Pre-planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (known already prior to signing the ICF) will not be considered 
an SAE, unless any of above criteria are fulfilled over the course of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216556]. 
14.4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
A TEAE is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatment, or 
any event already present that worsens in terms of severity, duration, or frequency 
following exposure to the treatment. 
14.5 Evaluation of AEs, AESIs, SAEs, TEAEs 
14.5.1 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator is obliged to assess the relationship between the IMP as well as study 
procedure and the occurrence of each AE/AESI/SAE. This relationship will be classed 
as not related, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related as follows: 
• Not related (both circumstances must be met): 
 Is due to underlying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs. 
 Is not associated with the IMP or study procedure (i.e., does not follow a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP or has a 
much more likely alternative etiology). 
• Unlikely related (either one or both circumstances are met): 
 Has little or no temporal relationship to the IMP or study procedure. 
 A more likely alternative etiology exists. 
• Possibly related (both circumstances must be met): 
 Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP. 
 An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to the IMP or study procedure. 
• Probably related (both circumstances must be met): 
 Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP, 
which may include but is not limited to the following: 
o Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re-administration (positive 
re-challenge). 
o Positive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc.). 
o Toxic level of the IMP as evidenced by [CONTACT_322558]. 
  
BoNT/A-DP Page 55 of 89 
Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 Another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely 
• Definitely related: 
 Has clear and undoubted relationship to the administration of IMP. 
 
The investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to IMP 
administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB in the determination of his/her assessment. 
For the purpose of expedited regulatory reporting, events assessed as possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to IMP or study procedure will be considered as drug 
related.  
14.5.2 Assessment of Severity 
The following definitions for rating severity will be used: 
• Mild:  
 The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity. 
• Moderate:  
 The AE interferes with daily activity but the subject is still able to 
function. 
• Severe:  
 The AE is incapacitating and/or requires medical intervention. 
 
14.5.3 Outcome 
The outcome options that can be utilized include: 
• Ongoing 
• Resolved 
• Resolved with Sequelae 
• Death 
• Unknown 
14.5.4 Action Taken with Study Drug 
Action taken with study drug includes: 
• None 
• Discontinued

result will be evaluated by [CONTACT_322551]/or followed up as per 
local clinical practice. A physician, either at the investigative site or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_322522], will administer treatment for any SAEs. Where appropriate, medical 
tests and examinations may be performed to ensure that an AE has fully resolved. AEs, 
AESIs, and SAEs ongoing at End of Study will be followed up until the event is 
resolved or stable. Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Whenever possible, a 
specific disease or syndrome, rather than individual associated signs and symptoms, 
should be identified by [CONTACT_256299]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific 
disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the 
eCRF.  
When documenting AEs, standard medical terminology should be used in order to avoid 
the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see Section 14.1). Each AE will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_132366] s
tigator for: 
• Seriousness, as defined in Section 14.3. 
• Causal relationship t
o IMP exposure, as defined in Section 14.5.1. 
• Causal relationship t
o procedure, as defined in Section 14.5.1. 
• Severity, as defined i
n Section 14.5.2. 
• Outcome, as defined in Se
ction 14.5.3. 
• Action taken with study 
drug, as defined in Section 14.5.4.

CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
If the severity rating for an ongoing AE worsens before the event resolves, the AE will 
be reported in an additional row in the AE log (or additional AE page) with complete 
information (i.e., start and stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, etc.). 
14.6.[ADDRESS_398270] also be reported. 
Paper SAE/AESI forms should be completed at the site and emailed or faxed to the 
 within 24 hours  of 
awareness of the event: 
 
 
 
 
The preferr e
d way of submitting safety reports is via email; fax numbers are provided 
for backup. 
If a report is sent via email the completed and signed SAE/AESI or Pregnancy report 
form must be attached to the email; describing an event in the email text is not 
sufficient. 
There may be situations when an SAE/AESI has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial SAE/AESI report to Croma, or their 
representative. However, it is very important that the investigator always makes an 
assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE/AESI report 
form. Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), suspect product (i.e., IMP or 
concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source (investigator/study-site 
identification) and an event or outcome that can be identified as serious or as an AESI. 
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_322523]-up 
information, amending the SAE/AESI report form accordingly. The causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements for SAEs. 
14.6.[ADDRESS_398271] be followed to conclusion to determine their outcome. This 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398272] that 
occurs during the study to  Clinical Research, as specified above ( Section 14.6.1) 
within 24 hours  of awarenes
s of the pregnancy, using the pregnancy reporting form. 
Pregnant subjects will be withdrawn from the study if pregnancy is detected at the 
Screening or Baseline Visit. Following detection of pregnancy, no invasive assessments 
may be conducted in pregnant women. The treatment code for pregnant women will be 
unblinded. 
14.6.3 Overdose 
Overdose is defined as any dose above the total body dose per injection 
(i.e., 20 U/treatment of either BoNT/A-DP or ). Single treatment doses 
of up to 50 U of , a botulinum toxin with similar potency units to the 
study drug, are frequently used for cosmetic/aesthetic indications,35,36,37,38and it is 
generally recog ni
zed that doses greater than [ADDRESS_398273], the investigator will notify the 
Sponsor immediately by [CONTACT_322559], but within one calendar day after the change is implemented. The 
Sponsor (Croma-Pharma GmbH) will also ensure the responsible Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) is notified of the urgent measures 
taken in such cases, according to local regulations. 
14.[ADDRESS_398274] with the same severity, frequency, or duration 
subsequent to IMP administration, need not be recorded as AEs. However, if there is 
an increase in severity, frequency or duration of a pre-existing disease, the event shall 
be documented as an AE. 
14.9 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safety 
Information of the IB/SmPC. “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs or suspected adverse 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398275]’s 
clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322524]. The prior 
and concomitant medication information will be documented on the Concomitant 
Medication eCRF.  
In addition to product name (preferably generic name), the dose, indication, route of 
administration and frequency, as well as the start and end date of treatment, will be 
documented. In the context of this study, information on non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322525]. 
Prohibited Medication and Excluded Non-drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322526]: 
• Treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype for any reason during the study, 
other than BoNT/A-DP or  administered as part of this study.  
• Use of a muscle relaxant. 
• Use of anticholinergic drugs, or drugs which could interfere with neuromuscular 
function, including aminoglycoside antibiotics and curare-like compounds. 
• Surgery with general anesthetic. 
The following non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_322527]: 
• Facial laser or light treatment, microdermabrasion, superficial peels or retinoid 
therapy. 
• Treatment with any facial aesthetic procedure in the glabellar area (including 
chemical peeling, injection with biodegradable fillers). 
• Insertion of permanent material in the glabellar area. 
• Surgery in the glabellar area including surgical removal of the corrugator, 
procerus  or depressor supercilii  muscles or a combination of these. 
14.[ADDRESS_398276] of previous treatment 
with botulinum toxin. At Screening and the End of Study visit, a full physical 
examination will be performed by [CONTACT_093]. A full physical exam will include

Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
neurological assessment (including extraocular movements and cranial nerves) as well 
as assessment for muscle weakness. In addition, if the subject reports an AESI (as 
detailed in the AESI Manual) a focused physical examination by [CONTACT_322560]. Any clinically relevant abnormal finding 
will be documented in the eCRF as AE/medical history. 
14.[ADDRESS_398277] 
For all women of childbearing potential (i.e., pre-menopausal with no more than 
12 consecutive months without a menstrual period or not surgically sterilized), a 
pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and at the End of Study visit. 
Additional pregnancy tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at all 
sites in Austria, at Visits 5, 6 and 7 (4, [ADDRESS_398278]-treatment, respectively).  
All pregnancy tests will be urine dipstick tests. 
14.13 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include pulse rate (beats/min), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(mmHg). Vital signs will be measured at Screening; Baseline (to be recorded before 
IMP administration); Visits 3, 5, and 7; and at Visit 8, End of Study. Vital sign values 
will be recorded on the eCRF. 
14.14 Demographic Data 
Demographic data will only be collected at Visit 1 (Screening). These data include age 
(at time ICF signed), year of birth, height (cm), weight (kg), gender, race and ethnicity 
(including Fitzpatrick Skin Type).

15. STATISTICS 
15.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The purpose of the study is to provide preliminary comparative data on BoNT/A-DP 
versus  Subsequently the sample size is primarily based on clinical 
judgement and practical considerations, rather than formal statistical arguments. 
However, with a sample size of 100 subjects per group, a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference between BoNT/A-DP and  will extend 
10.8% from expected proportions of 81.5% in both groups based on large sample 
normal approximation.  
15.2 Data Sets and Analysis Cohorts 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF): 
All subjects who received at least one injection with study medication (independent of 
whether it is BoNT/A-DP or ) will be valid for the SAF. Within the SAF, a subject 
will be considered for the treatment actually received and not for the treatment assigned 
by [CONTACT_17628], if different. The SAF will be used for the evaluation of the safety 
assessments. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): 
The FAS includes all randomized subjects who had a Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_398279] will be considered 
for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_322534], 
if different, i.e., following the intent-to-treat principle. The FAS will be used for the 
evaluation of the efficacy assessments. The FAS serves as the primary efficacy analysis 
set. 
Data Review Meeting: 
Subjects will be assigned to the SAF and FAS during a Data Review Meeting (DRM). 
Further details on the DRM will be specified within the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Details for and decisions on protocol deviations will also be discussed at the DRM, 
taking place between database lock and unblinding. Corresponding documentation 
should be held outside of the SAP. 
15.3 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765]. When estimating the response rate at Week 4 for 
the co-primary endpoints, missing assessments with the FWS at Baseline or Week 4 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page 62 of 89 
Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
will be assigned as being non-responders. For all other visits and endpoints, summary 
statistics will be based on observed data. 
15.4 Methods of Analysis 
15.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
The purpose of the study is to provide preliminary comparative efficacy and safety data 
of BoNT/A-DP versus .  
The study comprises co-primary endpoints defined as: 
• An FWS score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ 1 point reduction in FWS score at maximum 
frown at the Week 4 Visit relative to Baseline, based on investigator assessment. 
• An FWS score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ [ADDRESS_398280] an FWS score of 0 or 1 
and an improvement ≥ 1 point at maximum frown of the glabellar lines at Week 4 
relative to Baseline in FWS, based on the investigators’ and the subjects’ in-clinic 
assessments. 
The focus of the statistical analysis for the co-primary endpoints will be on descriptive 
statistics (n and %), and 95% CIs for the difference in treatment effects between 
BoNT/A-DP and . 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs will be calculated for the 
difference between BoNT/A-DP and  for each co-primary endpoint. No 
formal statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. 
The FAS will serve as the primary analysis set for the descriptive statistics. 
Subjects with missing investigator or subject in-clinic assessments with the FWS at 
Baseline or Week 4 Visit will be assigned as being non-responders. 
Since the focus of the statistical analysis is on descriptive statistics and no formal 
statistical hypothesis testing is planned, no adjustment for controlling the type 1 error 
rate for the co primary endpoints is required. 
Additional Analyses on the Primary Endpoint Variable 
• The primary endpoint measure will also be summarized using the observed 
values only, i.e., missing investigator or subject in-clinic assessments with the 
FWS at Baseline or Week 4 Visits will be excluded from analysis but not 
assigned as being non-responders. 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page 63 of 89 
Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
• The following subgroup analysis will be conducted: 
o site  
o previous use of Botulinum  
o race  
o subjects with previous use of botulinum toxin by [CONTACT_3725] 
o naïve subjects by [CONTACT_3725] 
o Fitzpatrick skin type 
o sex 
o ethnicity 
o age groups (below 65 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years; below 
65 years versus 65 years and older) 
 
15.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
Key Secondary Analyses: 
Since the focus of the statistical analysis is on descriptive statistics and no formal 
statistical hypothesis testing is planned on secondary endpoints, no adjustment for 
controlling the type 1 error rate is required. 
The following are considered key secondary endpoints: 
1. Percentage of responders with an  FWS score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ [ADDRESS_398281] assessment. 
2. Percentage of responders with an FWS score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ [ADDRESS_398282] assessments. 
3. Percentage of responders with an FWS score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ [ADDRESS_398283] is defined as ≥ 1 point 
improvement in Glabellar Line Scale - Investigator (GLS-I) and Glabellar Line 
Scale – Subject (GLS-S) score relative to Baseline at maximum frown in 
glabellar lines. In addition, onset of effect will be assessed by [CONTACT_322561] [ADDRESS_398284] when scores return to Baseline values. 
6. The FACE-Q assessment at Weeks 4, 12 and 16. 
  
BoNT/A-DP Page 64 of 89 
Clinical Study Protocol CPH-201-201461 
 
 
CROMA-PHARMA - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
For categorical endpoints, the same analyses will be conducted as described for the 
co-primary endpoints. Continuous variables will be summarized using the following 
descriptive statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum. 95% confidence of the difference in treatment effects will be 
calculated. Time-to-response and duration of response will be analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
The FACE-Q Satisfaction with Outcome Scale will be derived in accordance with the 
developers’ instructions and missing data treated accordingly. 
Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
Safety endpoint variables will be analysed descriptively only. 
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 1 (AEs): 
Adverse events will be separated to pre-treatment AEs and TEAEs. TEAEs are defined 
as all AEs with onset or worsening (increase in severity) after receiving first dose of 
study medication (independent of whether it is BoNT/A-DP or ). If it cannot be 
determined whether an AE is treatment-emergent due to a partial onset date, then it will 
be counted as such. 
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) (MedDRA). The number of events, as well as the number and rate 
of affected subjects will be reported. Treatment-emergent AEs (SOC and PT) will also 
be summarized by [CONTACT_12917], severity, relationship to study medication, and 
relationship to procedure. Treatment-emergent AESIs will be tabulated separately. 
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 2 (vital signs):  
The analyses of variables for vital signs will focus on the evaluation of the change from 
Baseline to the scheduled time points after Baseline. Descriptive analysis with means, 
standard deviations, medians, minima and maxima of the time course and of changes 
from Baseline to each post-Baseline visit will be presented.  
15.4.[ADDRESS_398285] 
exposure will be tabulated in detail. Concomitant medication, including application site 
concomitant medication, will be coded according to the World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug dictionary and tabulated accordingly.

15.5 General Statistical Considerations 
Further aspects of statistical analyses will be detailed within an SAP. This Plan will be 
finalized prior to th
e database lock and/or study unblinding.  
For statistical
 analyses “baseline” refers to the last observation before treatment, i.e., 
pre-treatment values measured on the treatment day (Baseline Visit, Day 0), and if 
missing or not evaluated, values from the Screening Visit will be used. 
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765], irrespective of any time window deviations.  
15.5.1 Interim Analysis 
No interim analyses are planned. 
  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398286] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
The investigator/study site will cooperate and provide direct access to study-related 
records and data, including source documentation for monitoring by [CONTACT_322562], audits by [CONTACT_322563], IRB/IEC review, and applicable regulatory authority

original copy of the final report, will be retained in the archives of  until at least 
five years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at 
least five years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of BoNT/A-DP. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_13179], or by [CONTACT_16268]. The TMF 
will be archived by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The study site should maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the IB, 
the protocol and any amendments, drug accountability records, correspondence with 
the IRB/IEC and the Sponsor (or designee), and other study-related documents.  
The investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not 
limited to) the identification of all participating subjects, medical records, 
study-specific source documents, source worksheets, all original signed and dated ICFs, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition to enable 
evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities.  
The investigator should retain records required to be maintained for a period of five 
years following the date a marketing application in an ICH region is approved for the 
drug for the indication for which it is being investigated or, if no application is to be 
filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until at least five years 
after the investigation is discontinued. However, these documents should be retained 
for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed 
by [CONTACT_1034]. In addition, the investigator must make provision for the subjects’ 
medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
No data should be destroyed without the agreement of Croma. Should the investigator 
wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, 
Croma must be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new 
location.  
Subjects’ medical records and other original data will be archived in accordance with 
the archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site. 
19.1 Confidentiality Policy 
The investigator and all personnel involved in the study will maintain a policy of 
confidentiality.  
19.2 Source Documentation and Electronic Case Report Forms 
Data will be recorded at sites using eCRFs and reviewed during monitoring visits. The 
recorded data in the EDC system will be verified with source documents. All 

  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398292], and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for. Data collected at Screening 
will be reported in eCRFs, regardless of Screening outcome. 
Source data (Subject Diary, etc.) should bear the study number, subject number, date 
of data generation, and, if reviewed, dated signature [CONTACT_322581]. 
Adverse events, concomitant medication data and clinical observations will be in the 
subjects’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], or recorded on source data forms, and will be transferred into 
the eCRF after assessment by [CONTACT_1719]. 
Other data of medical measurement without print-outs (date and time of study activities, 
i.e., administration of study medication, completion of PROs) performed during the 
study will be captured on the respective requisition forms or dispensing/administration 
log, which will serve as source documentation for the respective activities. The 
investigator will maintain complete and accurate study documentation in the 
Investigator Site File. 
The investigator will comply with the procedures for data recording and reporting. Any 
corrections to source documentation must be performed as follows: 1) the first entry 
will be crossed out entirely, remaining legible; 2) if not self-evident a reason for the 
change must be given; and 3) each correction must be dated and initialed by [CONTACT_322574]; the use of correction fluid and erasing are prohibited. 
19.2.1 Electronic Case Report Forms 
The investigator is responsible for the procurement and the quality of source data.  
Authorized study site personnel will transcribe source data and source data changes to 
the eCRF. All data should preferably be entered into the eCRF on the day of the study 
visit, but no later than two working days thereafter. Changes to an eCRF, if not 
self-evident, will require documentation of the reason for each change. After 
completion of the study, an electronic (or if necessary paper) version of the complete 
set of eCRFs for each subject will remain in the investigator file at the study site in 
accordance with the data retention policy (Section 19.3). 
The handling of dat a
 by [CONTACT_1034], including data quality assurance, will comply with 
regulatory guidelines (e.g., Title 21, CFR Part 312). All data management activities will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_1034]’s representative who will follow their SOPs. Data 
management and control processes specific to the study will be described in the Data 
Management Plan. 
Once all the Data Quality Control steps have been performed, the database will be 
locked and the records will be released for reporting and statistical analysis. Data will 
  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398293] comply with the Title 21 CFR Part 11. All 
passwords will be strictly confidential. 
19.2.4 Medical Information Coding 
For medical information, the following thesauri will be used: 
• Latest version of MedDRA for medical history and AEs. 
• WHO drug information for concomitant medications. 
19.3 Document and Data Retention 
The investigator will retain study documentation and data (paper and/or electronic 
forms) in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the data retention 
policy, as described in the Clinical Study Agreement. 
The medical files of study subjects must be retained in accordance with local legislation 
and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], 
institution or private practice. 
19.4 Data Base Lock 
The database will be locked as soon as the database is confirmed as ‘clean’. Before the 
database is locked, a blinded DRM will take place. Further details will be described in 
the Data Management Plan. 
20. FINANCING AND INSURANCE 
The investigator will comply with investigator financing, investigator/Sponsor 
insurance, and subject compensation policies, if applicable, as described in the Clinical 
Study Agreement.

23. SUPPLEMENTS 
23.1 Glabellar Line Scale – Investigator (GLS-I) 
• In this questionnaire you will be asked to rate the severity of the subject’s 
glabellar lines when their face is at rest and when they are at maximum frown 
(the worst appearance of upper facial lines with maximum load on the muscle; 
eyebrows pushed together as far as they can go).  
• Please use the accompanying drawings and the photo atlas to help you make 
your ratings.  
• If the subject has any asymmetry in their glabellar lines, please use the most 
severe line to score the questionnaire. 
 
 
  
BoNT/A-DP Page [ADDRESS_398294] (GLS-S) 
• Glabellar lines, also known as frown lines, are the vertical wrinkles between 
your eyebrows that may appear worse when you frown.  
• In this questionnaire you will be asked to rate the severity of your glabellar lines 
(how deep they are) when your face is relaxed (at rest) and then when you are 
frowning (eyebrows pushed together as far as they can go).  
• Please use the accompanying drawings and the photo atlas to help you make 
your ratings.  
• Not everyone’s lines are the same on both sides of their face. Please use your 
most severe line to score the questionnaire.

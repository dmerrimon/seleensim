 1.3 Exploratory Objectives:  
1. To study immunological and  molecular  changes  in  the  peripheral  blood  and  bone 
marrow in response to nivolumab and 5-azacytidine therapy or nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_432488] 5-azacutidine therapy or ni volumab with azacytidine and venetoclax therapy, including: 
 --To investigate possible relationships between response and non-response to the 
combination with pretherapy, on-therapy, and progression gene expression signatures. 
 --To investigate the characteriz ation of genetic heterogeneit y in tumor cell populations, 
by [CONTACT_525246]-cell sequenci ng on longitudinally collected AML tumor 
populations from patients using a novel microf luidic approach that barcodes amplified 
genomic DNA from thousands of individual leukemia cells confined to droplets (single cell sequencing). Targeted single-cell sequenc ing is able to sensitively identify cells 
harboring pathogenic mutations during comp lete remission and uncover complex clonal 
evolution within AML tumors that are not observable with bulk sequencing.  --To identify individual cell populations (AML blasts, T-ce lls – both bulk and T-cell 
subsets and coreceptor/ligand expression, m acrophages and their coreceptor/ligands) and 
how their signaling state in disease relates to  clinical outcomes we will perform CyTOF 
(mass cytometry) using a customized CYTOF pa nel specifically developed for this study 
on patients’ bone marrow samples and peri pheral blood at diagnosis, remission and 
relapse and potentially other time-points on study.  --To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissu e including bone marrow, if available, for 
potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of 
AML and/or response to the combination (whe re response is define d broadly to include 
efficacy, tolerability or safety).  
2. To determine induction of hypomethylation and DNA damage during therapy with this 
combination and its corr elation with response. 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Acute myeloid leukemia  
AML is a malignancy of immature granulocytes or monocytes. The malignancy is 
characterized by [CONTACT_525247] a, anemia, and neutropenia. . There are 
approximately 13,000 new cases of AML per year in the [LOCATION_002], with an estimated 
10,000 deaths occurring in the same time period[1]. Almost all newly diagnosed cases, as well as deaths, will be in adults[2]. Sta ndard treatment for AML includes systemic 
combination chemotherapy to control bone marrow and systemic disease. Treatment is generally divided into an induction phase, to attain remission, and a maintenance phase[2]. 
Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected to attain complete remission status following appropriate inductio n therapy. Remission rates in adult AML are 
inversely related to age, with an expected re mission rate of >65% for those younger than 60 
years. Increased morbidity and mortality during induction appear to be directly related to 
age[3-5].

2.2 A Relapsed/ Refractory AML 
 
Approximately, 30-40% of adults with AML fail to achieve CR with 1 or 2 cycles of 
induction chemotherapy, and are deemed primary refractory. The outcome of patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are refractory to induction therapy are dismal, with low response rates to salvage chemotherapy and poor long-term survival [6-8]. We have previously reported a dismal median OS of  3.8 months for patients with AML who are 
refractory to HiDAC-containing induction therapy (defined as ≥ 1gm/m
2 cytarabine per 
dose)[7]. Salvage therapy in such patient populations yielded a response rate of 18% and median response duration of 9 months. 
 
These results emphasize the need to explore alternate salvage regimens for patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML. The development of novel and effective anti-AML agents and/or combinations is crucial to im proving the outcome of AML. 
 
2.2 B Newly Diagnosed AML in Older Patients 
 
AML is primarily a disease of older people with a median age of diagnosis of 68 years. 
There are approximately 13,000 new cases of AML per year in the [LOCATION_002] and 55% of 
these occur in individuals who are age [ADDRESS_681420] cytotoxic agents and/or relatively poor 
tolerance of these agents because of comorbidity and reduced tolerance of adverse effects. As a result, despi[INVESTIGATOR_525132], treatment for 
elderly patients with AML has not improved for decades. Among patients 70 years or older and those with adverse karyotypes the 4-8 week  mortality with intensive chemotherapy is 
30%-50%, and the median survival is 4-[ADDRESS_681421] resulted in a reluctance to treat AML in ol der patients. A Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525133] 64% of AML patients over age [ADDRESS_681422] frequently used agents in the treatment of less fit, 
older patients with AML in the US and Europe. The DACO-016 study compared the 
efficacy and safety of decitabine (20 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 weeks) versus treatment 
of choice (TC) (including LDAC 20 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_681423] 
supportive care) in 485 patients with AML (median age 73 years) ineligible for cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (Kantarjian et al., JC O 2012; Thomas X et al., CLML 2014). The CR rate 
plus CRp was 17.8% with decitabine versus 7.8% with TC (odds ratio, 2.5; P = .001). The 
initial analysis showed a trend toward impr oved survival with decitabine (7.7 vs. 5.0 
2014‐0861

 months; P = 0.108) that became significant ( P = 0.037) with further follow-up. Azacitidine 
has shown benefit in elderly patients with AM L in two large multicenter trials. In one trial 
patients with AML with 20–30% blasts were eval uated as a subset analysis of the phase III 
 
AZA-001 trial (Fenaux et al., JCO 2010). The patients were randomly assigned to receive 
subcutaneous azacitidine or conventional care regimen CCR (best supportive care [BSC] only, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), or intensive chemotherapy [IC]). The morphologic CR rate was 18% (10 of 55 patients) in the azaci tidine group and 16% (nine of 58 patients) in 
the CCR group ( P = .80). At a median follow-up of 20.1 months, the median OS for 
azacitidine-treated patients was 24.5 months compared with 16.0 months for CCR-treated 
patients (P = 0.005), and 2-year OS rates we re 50% and 16%, respectively (P = 0.001). In 
another trial, 488 elderly patient’s with AML with >30% blasts and age ≥65 years were 
randomized to receive eith er azacitidine (75 mg/m
2/day for 7 days every 4 weeks) or a CCR 
(standard induction chemotherapy, LDAC, or supportive care only) (Dombret et al., Blood 2015). Overall response (CR + CRi) rates were comparable in the azacitidine (27.8%) and 
CCR (25.1%) arms ( P = .5384). Median OS was 10.4 months (1-year survival 47%) for 
patients receiving azacitidine compared to 6.5 months (1-year survival 34%) for patients receiving CCR ( P = 0.0829). A prespecified analysis censoring patients who received AML 
treatment after discontinuing study drug showed  median OS with azacitidine vs CCR was 
12.1 months vs 6.9 months (stratified log-rank P = .0190). The dismal prognosis in elderly AML patients has resulted in increased efforts and clinical trials to improve the frontline 
therapy in elderly patients ( ≥ 60 years) with AML. 
 
These results emphasize the need to explore alternate strategies to intensive chemotherapy 
for AML in older patients and/or those unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy (based on predicted high eight-week mortality rates of 30% or more). The development of novel and effective anti-AML agents and/or combinations is crucial to improving the outcome of older patients (age ≥ 65) with AML. The clinical results with azacytidine and nivolumab in the 
salvage setting are encouraging (see clinical update of ongoing 5-azacytidine and nivolumab 
trial in section 2.3 C on page 4). Therefore, we would like to evaluate the efficacy and 
tolerability of the combination of 5-azacytidine with nivolumab in older patients with AML. 
 
2.3  A Role of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA4 interactions in AML 
It is well known that negative regulato ry mechanisms within the solid tumor 
microenvironment inhibit antitumor T-cell func tion. Proteins produced by [CONTACT_525248]-tumor activity of the microenvironment by [CONTACT_525249]-suppressor cells to 
that microenvironment. One inhibitory mechanism is up-regulation of programmed death- ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on tumor or stromal cells, which binds to programmed death-1 (PD-1) on activated T cells[9-12]. PD-1/PD-L1  engagement results in diminished antitumor 
response by [CONTACT_133239] a state of exhaustion for tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).  PD-L1 expression is associated with  poor prognosis in many cancers, including 
those of the lung, stomach, colon, breast, cervix, ovary, renal cell, and liver, as well as in adult T-cell leukemia, glioma, and melanoma[13-15]. Interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 plays an important role in co ntrolling immune responses and is involved in peripheral 
tolerance, autoimmunity, allergy, infection, and antitumor immunity[13, 16]. 
 
2014‐0861

Page 7 of 99 
 The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a major role in immune evasion and cytotoxic T-cell 
exhaustion in hematologic malignancies including AML and MDS[17-19]. Garcia-Manero 
et al identified ≥ 2-fold expression of PD-L1 in 34% of patients with AML or MDS[19]. 
Chen et al found increased expression of  PD-L1 at AML progression, which was an 
independent negative prognostic factor for French-American-British type M5 AML[20]. 
 
Similarly, Zhou et al have demonstrated that AML progression in a murine model is associated with elevated PD-1 expression on CTLs and increased T-regulatory cells at the tumor site[21]. Both these mechanism decrease CTL activity at the tumor site. Elevated PD- [ADDRESS_681424] of CTLs. T-regulatory cells (Tregs) further suppress CTL activity and this suppression depends on PD-1 expression by [CONTACT_525250]-L1 expression by [CONTACT_488]-presenting cells. Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody treatment increased the proliferation and func tion of CTLs at tumor sites by [CONTACT_525251]1 and PDL1 resulting in decreased Treg-mediated suppression of CTLs. The enhanced CTL activity resulted in reduced AML tumor burden, and resulted in 
long-term murine survivors. 
 
CTLA4:  The role of CTLA4 in AML is not as we ll defined in AML. Ho wever, recent data 
suggest the CTLA-[ADDRESS_681425]. 
Matthews et al evaluated anti-CTLA4 agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525134] a phase I/IB study in patients with 
relapsed AML post-allogeneic stem cell tran splant (Matthews D et al., NEJM 2016; 375:143-
153). Among [ADDRESS_681426] relapse 13 had relapsed AML (including medullary 
and/or extramedullary relapse). The patients ha d a median of 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_317142]. A 
complete response was obtained in 5/13 patient s. The therapy was ge nerally well tolerated, 
with 2/[ADDRESS_681427]-hypomethylator therapy we evaluated single-agent nivolumab as well as single agent (Garcia-Manero G, Daver N et  al., American Society of Hematology, 2016, 
abstract # 344). Nivolumab as a single-agent  did not induce a respons e in [ADDRESS_681428] activity. The ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525135] a ni volumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525136], 
similar to outcomes noted in solid tumors. 
 
2.3 B Defining PD1, CTLA4 and Immune checkpoint expression in AML (MDACC 
experience) Between March, 2015 and October 2015 we performed 17-color multi-
parameter flow- cytometry (MFC) on 15 untreated AML and 25 relapsed AML to assess 
expression of costim ligands (4-1BBL, B7 -1, B7-2, ICOSL, PDL-1, PDL-2, OX40L) on 
leukemic blasts and costim receptors (4-1BB, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, OX40, GITR, LAG-3, 
TIM-3) on Tcell subsets: CD4 T effector cells [Teff]: CD3+CD4+CD127lo/+Foxp3-, CD4 T 
regulatory cells [Treg]: CD3+CD4+CD127-Foxp3+, and CD8 T cells: CD3+CD8+. Four 
healthy human BMs were used as control. Expre ssion is denoted by [CONTACT_525252] 
T-cell subset or gated AML blasts positive fo r the marker indicated. PB mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) and blasts were evaluated at the same time-point. OX40+ Teffs and OX40+ CD8

 cells were higher in untreated AML BM as compared to healthy donor BM (median [med]: 
7.2% versus [vs] 0.26%; P=0.0005 and med: 2.03% vs 0.06%; P=0.07, respectively). PD1+ Tregs and OX40+ Tregs were also higher in untreated AML BM as compared to healthy donor BM (med: 19.7% vs 7.5%; P=0.03 and med: 10.3% vs 0.5%; P=0.02, respectively). PD1+ Teffs, OX40+ Teffs, and ICOS+ Teffs  were higher in relapsed AML BM as 
compared to healthy donor BM (med: 17.7% vs 6.7%; P= 0.047, med: 12% vs 0.27%, P=0.002, and med: 13.3% vs 1.1%; P=0.07, respectively). OX40+ CD8 cells, ICOS+ CD8 cells, TIM3+ CD8 cells (med: 5.0% vs 0.07%; P=0.04, med: 18.5% vs 2.6%; P=0.09, and 
med: 2.7% vs 0.7%; P=0.01, respectively) and OX40+ Tregs (med: 15.5% vs 0.5%; 
P<0.0001) were also higher in relapsed AM L BM as compared to healthy donor BM. 
GITR+ Teffs, PD1+ CD 8 cells, and LAG3+ Tr egs were higher in relapsed AML BM as 
compared to new AML BM (med: 10.9% vs 1.7%; P=0.08, med: 36.2% vs 21.3%; P=0.03, and med: 46.7% vs 16.9%; P=0.07, respectively). No other noteworthy differences were noted for costim receptor expression. CTLA4 expression on CD3+ T-cells as well as Teff, 
Treg, and CD8+ T-cells was evaluated and was found to be  expressed on <10% of each 
respective population and wa s not significantly increased as compared to CTLA4 
expression on corresponding T-ce ll populations in healthy donor s (Daver N, Sharma P et 
al., American Society of Hematology 2016, abstract # 2900). There were no other 
noteworthy differences in ligand expression patterns between relapsed AML and new AML. There was significant variability in BM expression of costim receptors and ligands between individual pts. The expression of costim receptors and ligands differed 
significantly between BM and PB from the same  time-point in the same pt. A larger sample 
size is needed to confirm these data and find a dditional associations and this is currently 
underway at our institution. 
Thus, it appears clinically targetable checkpoint receptors including PD1 appear to be 
overexpressed in the BM of patients with AM L. Relapsed AML had higher expression of 
costim receptors. These data have been su bmitted (Daver N, Sharma P et al. AACR 2016) 
and further support the evaluation of anti-PD1 based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525137]. 
 
2.3 C  5-azacytidne and nivolumab clinical trial update (11/29/2016):  
 
We have thus far treated 70 patients on the vi daza + nivolumab trial for relapsed/refractory 
AML as of Dec 30 2016 (Daver N, Sharma P et al., American Society of Hematology, [ADDRESS_681429]). The RP2D of 5-azacytidine and nivolumab was established as 5-azacytidine 
75mg/m2 days 1-7 and nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg on days 1 and 14 of each cycle in the ongoing 
clinical trial. 0/[ADDRESS_681430] 3 cycles and are evaluable for re sponse and toxicity. 51 
pts with a median age of 69 years (range, 45 – 90), secondary AML (55%), poor risk cytogenetics (47%), median number of prior regi mens 2 (range, 1-7) have been enrolled. All 
[ADDRESS_681431] fre quently detected mutations 
included DNMT3A  (n=12), TP53 (n=11), TET2 (N=9), ASXL1 (n=7), and RAS (n=7). 35 pts 
are evaluable for response: 6 (18%) achieved complete remission (CR)/ complete remission 
with insufficient recovery of counts (CRi ) (3 CR, 3 CRi), 5 (15%) had hematologic 
improvement (HI), 9 (26%) had ≥50% BM blast reduction, 3 pts (9 %) had stable disease > 6 
months, and 12 (34%) had progression. 16 pts are early for response assessment (<3 
courses). The median number of courses to CR/CRi/HI was 3 (1 – 9). The CR/CRi/HI 
2014‐0861

Page 9 of 99 
 (n=11) have been durable with no relaps es among pts who achieved CR/CRi/HI [CR 
duration; not reached (NR)]. The 4- and 8-week  mortality were 0 and 6%, respectively. The 
median overall survival for the 35 evaluable pts was 9.3 months (range, 1.8 – 14.3) (Fig 1) 
and this compares favorably to historical su rvival with AZA-based salvage protocols in 
similar pts treated at MDACC.  
Grade 3/4 and Grade 2 immune mediated toxicities were observed in 7 (14%) and 6 (12%) 
pts, respectively. These included 8 epi[INVESTIGATOR_525138], 2 nephritis, 2 transaminitis, and 
1 skin rash. 1 pt died from grade 4 pneumonitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_351339]. In the remaining [ADDRESS_681432] udies and Mass-cytometry (CyT OF) studies are conducted by 
[CONTACT_525253] -treatment BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56607] (end of cycle 1, 2, 
4, 8) and peripheral blood to assess the T-cell repertoire and expression of co-stimulatory 
receptors and ligands on T cell subsets and leukemic blasts respectively. Baseline and end 
of cycle 1 BM was evaluated on 25 of the 35 evaluable patients, including 6 responders (CR/CRi/HI) and 19 non-responders. Pts who achieved a CR/CRi/HI had a baseline higher live total CD3 (P=0.10), CD8
+ T-cells (P=0.02), and lower live CD4+Foxp3+PD1+ T-
regulatory (T-reg) cells (P=0.01) infiltrate in the BM (Figure 2) . The ratio of PD1+CD8+ T-
effector cells to PD1+CD4+Foxp3+ T-reg cells was significantly higher in the CR/CRi/HI pts 
vs non-responders (208.4 vs 8.91, P<0.05) in baseline BM. On further evaluation of post cycle [ADDRESS_681433] cycle 2 BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (unpubl ished – to be presented at ASH 2016) the 
responders demonstrate a progressive increase in the live CD3+ and CD8+ BM infiltrate and an increase in CD8+ ICOS+ cells. On the other hand non-responders did not have an 
increase in the live CD3+ or T-cell subsets.  However, CTLA4 and Tim3 were up-regulated 
on CD8+, T-eff and to a lesser extent on T-re gs post-cycle [ADDRESS_681434]  been noted in 3 patients 
including 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13368] 2 pneumonitis and 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_119988]2 nephritis. All 3 cases 
of immune mediated toxicity responded rapi[INVESTIGATOR_525139]

2.3 D 5-azacytidne with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525140] (08/02/2019):  Cohort 2 of azacitidine with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525141] 6 patients at the dose 
level 0 in Table 5B (i.e. azacitidine 75mg/ m2 D1-7 with Nivolumab 3mg/kg Q2weeks 
and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg Q12 weeks). These pa tients were observed for the DLT period 
(28 days) and no DLTs were encountered amon g the first 6 patients treated at dose 
level 0. Subsequently, in accordance with Table 5B the dose level +1 was evaluated (i.e. 
azacitidine 75mg/m2 D1-7 with Nivolumab  3mg/kg Q2weeks and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg 
Q6 weeks).  These patients were observed for the DLT period (28 days) and no DLTs 
were encountered among the first 6 patients treated at dose level +1. The RP2D was

 selected as dose +l (i.e, with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] Q6 weeks) and study opened to expansion with 
24 additional patients to be enrolled in  expansion using the dose level +1.  
 
As of 08/01/2019 (Daver N et al, ASH [ADDRESS_681435]: attached as Appendix), 
31 R/R AML patients have been treated with Aza+Nivo+Ipi [INVESTIGATOR_525142] (dose level 0 = 6 patients, dose level +1 = 6 pati ents, and expansion at RP2D= 19 patients).  
Median age 71 years (26-86), secondary AM L (49%), ELN unfavorable cytogenetics 
(65%), TP53 mutated (38%), median of sa lvage 2 (range, 1-4) status. 54% of the 
patients had previously received hypomethyl ating agent (azacitidine or decitabine)-
based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525143]. 4 patients had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (median time from allogeneic stem cell transplant of 13 months).  
 24 patients were evaluable for response and su rvival, 7 too early (<3 months from start 
of therapy on protocol). CR/CRi was note d in 9 (36%), additionally 2 (8%) had 
hematologic improvement in one or more parameter (HI) maintained >6 months, 4 
(16%) stable disease (SD) (defined as absence of CR, CRi, PR, MLFS; with stable disease on treatment for at least 6 months ), and 10 (40%) were non-responders (NRs).

DAC10+venetoclax in R/R AML (med OS: 7.1 months) that will be reported from our 
center in a similar salvage population at ASH 2019 (Maiti A et al, ASH 2019). The 1-

CR/CRi rates were also higher with AZA+Nivo+Ipi [INVESTIGATOR_525144]+Nivo and historical HMA-based controls . Grade 3/4 immune mediated  toxicities were observed 
in 6 pts (25%), including rash, pneumonitis, and colitis. One pt required ICU stay but 
no deaths were attributed to immune toxi city. Other grade >2 toxicities were as 
expected for R/R AML population and were mo stly infections/febrile neutropenia, and 
electrolyte disturbance. The 4-week mortal ity was 0, 8-week mort ality was 8% and no

2.3 E                Venetoclax in AML (Background and unmet need) 
--Venetoclax plus HMA in patien ts with newly diagnosed AML  
An ongoing phase Ib/II stud y has reported promising safety and efficacy of 
venetoclax in combination with either azaci tidine or decitabine in patients ≥ 65 
years of age with previo usly untreated AML and who are ineligible for 
chemotherapy (DiNardo CD et al, Blood. 2019 Jan 3;133 (1):7-17). At the most 
recent update (Pollyea D et  al ASH [ADDRESS_681437]  285: full 
PowerPoint attached as Appendix), 145 patien ts were treated with  a median age of 
74 years (range, 65-86 years). Cytogenetics were poor risk in 49% of patients. The 
30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 3% and 8%, respectively.  Tumor lysis 
syndrome was not observed. The CR/CRi rate for the en tire cohort was 66% with 
a median duration of CR/CRi  of 11.[ADDRESS_681438] survival data for 
older, unfit patients repo rted to date in newly di agnosed AML. Based on these 
exciting results in this historically difficult-to-treat patient population, in 
November 2018 the US FDA approved venetoclax in combination with either 
LDAC, azacitidine or decita bine for patients with ne wly diagnosed AML who are 
≥[ADDRESS_681439] risk-benefit prof ile, and a phase III study of venetoclax 
400mg with azacitidine in the frontline setting is ongoing and has recently 
completed enrollment (VIALE A). 
 
--Unmet Need in AML and Need to Continue Improving HMA with 
Venetoclax 
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_525145] c induction therapy, the 
median CR/CRi durations are </= 11-12 months and medi an 3-year OS is <45% 
(DiNardo CD et al, Blood. 201 9 Jan 3;133(1):7-17) sugges ting that there is room 
for improvement by [CONTACT_525254] e durability of CR/CRi’s and thereby 
[CONTACT_525255]. Similarly, MRD-nega tive rates with HM A with venetoclax 
are 40-50% and these may be further improved by [CONTACT_525256], potentially translating into more durable response and 
improved OS. 
 The long-term outcomes of pa tients with poor-risk disease features remain poor. 
Among frontline older poor risk patients treated with  HMA with venetoclax 
(defined as patients with TP53 and ad verse cytogenetics) eval
 uated in both the 
MDACC internal data se t (Shoukier M et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology  37, 
no. 15_suppl (May  20, 2019) 7034-7 034) and in the multicente r phase Ib/II trial of 
HMA with venetoclax (DiN ardo CD et al, Blood. 201 9 Jan 3;133(1):7-17) the 
2014‐0861

Page 13 of 99 
 CR/CRi rates were significan tly lower at 45-47% , median response  durations were 
<6 months, median OS was 6-9 months, and only 14% of the patients achieving 
CR/CRi became MRD-negative. 
 Venetoclax plus HMA in R/R AML: Several retrospective studies have been 
published evaluating the safety and efficacy of venetoclax plus an HMA in 
patients with R/R AML.  
-A study from MD Anderson evaluated the outcomes of 43 patients with R/R 
myeloid malignancies (n=3 9, 91% with AML) who re ceived venetoclax in 
combination with other agents (DiNardo CD et al, American journal of 
hematology  2018; 93(3): 401-7). Thirty -one of the evalua ted patients (72%) 
received venetoclax with an HMA. Most patients (84%) were treated in salvage 2 
or later (range 2-8) with  a median of 3 prior treat ment regimens. Objective 
response rate (ORR) was achieved in 9 (21%) patients, includi ng 2 (5%) with CR, 
3 (7%) with CRi, and 4 (9%) with morphologic leukemia ‐free state (MLFS). Of 
the 9 responding patients, al l responded within 1 cycle of venetoclax  combination 
therapy. These nine responding patients included eight (26% ) of the patients 
treated with an HMA combination. With  a median follow-up of 3 months, the 
estimated 6-month OS rate was 24% and median OS was approximately 5 months.  
-In another study of venetoclax in co mbination with HMAs in R/R AML from 
City of Hope, 33 patients we re treated (Aldoss I et al, Haematologica. 2018 
Sep;103(9):e404-e40) . The median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 2 (range, 1-8). 
Twenty patients (61%) had failed HMA th erapy previously an d 13 patients (39%) 
had prior allogenic stem ce ll transplantation.  The ORR was 64% (N=21), with 10 
patients (30%) achieving CR, 7 (21%) achieving CRi and 4 (12%) achieving 
MLFS. With a median follow-up of 6.5 mo nths, the 1-year OS  rate was 53%.  
 
-The group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Ca ncer Center has also reported their 
experience with venetoclax in combination with either low-dose  cytarabine or an 
HMA in patients with R/R myeloid malignancie s (Goldberg A et al, Blood 2017; 
130(Suppl 1): 1353). A total of 24 patients were treated (n=8 with HMA; N=16 
with low-dose cytarabine). Twenty-three patients (96%) had a diagnosis of AML. 
The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range, 1-8); 6 patients (29%) had 
prior stem cell transplantation. Of 21 pa tients evaluable for efficacy, the ORR was 
29%, including a CR rate of 24% (n=5) and PR rate of 5% (n=1). W ith a median 
follow-up of 4.1 months, the 3-month OS rate was 72%.  
 
Pre-clin
ical rationale for combination of venetoclax with immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525146] a series of human in vitro and in vivo syngeneic tumor model studies, venetoclax 
does not appear to antagonize anti-PD-1 th erapy with nivolumab (Mathew R et al. 
Blood 2018 132: 3704). Ve netoclax was shown to decr ease naïve T-cells and B-
cells but not central and effector memory T cells (these being crit ical to anti-tumor 
immunity) in in vitro studies of human lymphocyte s. In a mixed lymphocyte 
reaction assay, venetoclax  did not affect IFN-gamma secretion from CD3/CD28 
2014‐0861 
5/26/[ADDRESS_681440] that veneto clax does not impair anti-P D-1 anti-tumor therapy and 
may synergize with immune checkpoint therapy through its favorable modulation 
of the T-cell profile. Lasate r et al demonstrated that  significant venetoclax-
induced cell death at clinically relevant drug  concentrations is limited to the B-cell 
subset and that BCL-2 inhibition is not de trimental to survival  or activation of 
NK- or T-cell subsets (Lasater E et al, Blood 2018 132:11 18). Both posters 
highlighting the potential for preclinical synergy between venetoclax and immune checkpoint inhibitors (specifically PD1 antibodies) are att ached as Appendix. 
 
 
2.4 Nivolumab (BMS-936558, MDX1106):  
 
2.4.1 Mechanism of Action  
 
Immune activation is tightly regulated by  [CONTACT_3252]-stimulatory (e.g. CD28 and ICOS) and 
co-inhibitory (e.g. CTLA-4 and PD-1) r eceptors expressed on T cells. Agonistic 
antibodies against co-stimulatory T cell re ceptors and blocking antibodies against co-
inhibitory T cell surface receptors have  both been shown to potentiate T cell 
activation for tumor cell killing. 
 
PD-1 is mainly expressed by [CONTACT_195713] 4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as antigen 
presenting cells (APCs). It has two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, with distinct expression profiles.[16] PD-L1 is expre ssed not only on APCs, but also on non- 
hematopoietic cells, including tumor ce lls. Expression of PD-L2 is largely 
restricted to APCs including macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, as well as 
mast cells. The role of PD-[ADDRESS_681441] 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_195714]-1 deficient mice developed significant autoimmunity with high titers of auto antibodies.[22, 23] Subsequently, blocking 
antibodies against PD-1 were shown to ac tivate immune responses that resulted in 
reduction of tumor metastasis and tumor growth in a numb er of experimental tumor 
models.[24, 25] Consistent with the imm une inhibitory role of PD-1/PD-L1/[ADDRESS_681442] of PD-L1 on tumor growth was reve rsed by [CONTACT_39627]-L1 with anti-PD-L1 
 
antibodies.[26] 
 
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully huma n, IgG4 (kappa) isotype, monoclonal 
antibody that binds PD-1. Blockade of th e PD-[ADDRESS_681443] by [CONTACT_525257] (M LR). PD-1 blockade resulted in a 
reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN- γ release in the MLR. The 
2014‐0861 
5/26/[ADDRESS_681444] of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response was investigated using a 
CMV-restimulation assay with huma n peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), and was evaluated by [CONTACT_6428]. These data indicated that nivolumab, 
versus an isotype-matched c ontrol antibody, augmented IFN- γ secretion from CMV- 
specific memory T cells in a dose-depende nt manner. PD-1 blockade by [CONTACT_525258] a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. 
 
2.4.2 Summary of Safety Results from Nivolumab Program  
For a complete review of clinical info rmation, please refer to the nivolumab 
Investigator Brochure. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Safety  
The monitoring of subject safety during a nd after a clinical study with nivolumab, 
including any special monitoring precauti ons, tests, or observations, and the 
proper means of recording and reporting adverse safety information [including 
adverse events ( AEs) and abnormal laboratory values] will follow the procedures 
outlined in the specific study protocol. 
 
The overall safety experience with ni volumab is based on experience in 
approximately 1500 subjects as either a m onotherapy or in  combination  with 
other therapeutics. In general for monother apy, the safety profile is similar across 
tumor types. The one exception is pulmonary inflammation AEs which may be numerically greater in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) possibly because in some cases it can be difficult to distinguish between nivolumab-related and unrelated causes of pulmonary  symptoms  and radiographic changes. The most frequently reported treatment-related AE is fatigue, which is almost always low grade. 
 
The safety profile is generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached at any dose tested up to 10 
mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incide nce, severity, or causality of AEs to 
nivolumab dose level. Most related AEs ar e thought to be due to the effects of 
inflammatory cells on specific tissues. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to Grade 2) with relatively few related high -grade (Grade 3 to Grade 4) AEs. Most 
high-grade events were manageable wi th use of corticos teroids or hormone 
replacement therapy (endocrinopathies).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
There was no pattern in the incidence, se verity, or causality of AEs related to 
the dose of nivolumab, between 1 a nd 10 mg/kg, in MDX1106-03. Of the 306 
treated subjects in MDX110 6-03, 303 (99.0%) subjects have at least 1 reported 
AE regardless of causality (Table 2). The most frequently reported AEs were 
fatigue (54.9%), decreased appetite (35.0 %), diarrhea (34.3%), nausea (30.1%), 
and cough (29.4%). Treatmen t-related AEs were report ed in 230 (75.2%) of the 
[ADDRESS_681446] frequently reporte d treatment-related AEs were fatigue 
(28.1%), rash (14.7%), diarrhea (13.4%), and pruritus (10.5%). Most treatment-

reported in 52 (17.0%) of subjects. The most frequently reported treatment- 
related high grade AE was fatigue (6.5%).

through T-cell potentiation and mediati on of antitumor immune responses.

ongoing in melanoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. In melanoma, 2 completed 
Phase 3 studies (MDX010-20 and CA184024) have demonstrated a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant survival benef it in pretreated advanced 
melanoma and previously untreated advanced melanoma, respectively ®). 
 The safety profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525152] a) the 
majority AEs being inflammatory in nature  consistent with the proposed mechanism 
of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], b) the same type s of such immune-mediated events in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tr act, skin, liver, and endocrine system being reported, and c) 
most of these events being manageable with immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In 
melanoma, 2 BMS-sponsored Phase 3 studies  are ongoing in subjec ts with high-risk 
Stage III melanoma (CA184029, with adjuva nt immunotherapy) and pretreated and 
treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (CA184169, 3 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]). The completed Phase 3 study CA184043 evaluated ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525153]-re sistant prostate can cer (mCRPC) who had 
progressed during or following docetaxel. El igible subjects were randomized to a 
single dose of bone-directed radiotherapy (RT), followed by [CONTACT_525263][INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg or placebo (799 randomized: 399 ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 400 placebo). This study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall surviv al (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.72 to 1.00) for survival favored  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525154] a P-value of 0.053. Planned sensitivity analyses favored ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],

 regression and declines in pros tate specific antigen (PSA). The safety profile in this 
study was consistent with the previously de fined adverse event (AE) profile at the 
same dose.  A second Phase 3 study CA184095 evaluating ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg 
versus placebo in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, chemotherapy-
naïve mCRPC with no visceral metastases is ongoing. In addition, a completed large Phase 2 study (CA184041) has investigated the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525156] 2 different schedules (c oncurrent and phased) in subjects with 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC, a secondary endpoint). The phased, but not the concurrent schedule, demonstrated activity in both NSCLC and SCLC, including significant improvement of immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) and a num eric trend for OS improvement (not 
significant). The efficacy and safety of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a phased schedule with carboplatin/paclitaxel is also  being investigat ed in an ongoing Phase 3 study in 
subjects with advanced squamous NSCL C (CA184104). The efficacy and safety of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a phased schedule with etoposid e/platinum in subjec ts with extensive 
stage disease SCLC is being investigated in an ongoing Phase 3 study (CA184156). The unique immune-based mechanism of action is  reflected in the clinical patterns of 
anti-cancer activity in some patients. Ipil imumab impacts tumor cells indirectly, and 
measurable clinical effects emerge after the immunological effect s. Tumor infiltration 
with lymphocytes and the associated in flammation (documented by [CONTACT_525265]) is likely the cornerstone of the effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525157] r control. In some cases, 
inflammation may not be noted by [CONTACT_525266]  a manner seen in patients receiving other 
types of anti-cancer treatments. In othe r cases, response may be preceded by [CONTACT_525267] a nd/or the appearance of new lesions, which 
may be mistaken for tumor progression on radiological evaluations. Therefore, in 
patients who are not experien cing rapid clinical deteri oration, confirmation of 
progression is recommended, at the investigat or’s discretion, to be tter understand the 
prognosis as well as to avoid unnecessarily initiating poten tially toxic alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525158]. Immune-related 
response criteria were developed based on these observations to systematically

 categorize novel patterns of clinical activity and are currently being prospectively 
evaluated in clinical studies. In metastatic  diseases, stabilization is more common than 
response, and in some instances is associ ated with a slow, steady decline in tumor 
burden over many months, sometimes improving to partial and/or complete responses. 
Thus, the immune-based mechanism of ac tion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525159], sometimes with novel patter ns of response, which contribute to its 
unique improvement in OS.  The unique immune-based mechanism of action is  also reflected in the safety profile. 
The most common treatment-related AEs are in flammatory in nature, consistent with 
the mechanism of action of the drug and gene rally medically manageable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_525160]/or systemic immunos uppressants. Such immunological safety events are 
described as irAEs or immune-mediated a dverse reactions (imARs). The irAEs are 
described as AEs of unknown etiology, wh ich were consistent with an immune 
phenomenon and were considered causally related to drug exposure by [CONTACT_431]. 
The irAEs primarily involve the GI tract and skin. Immune-related AEs in the liver 
were also observed, particularly in su bjects receiving 10 mg/kg. Endocrinopathy and 
neuropathy were important irAEs obser ved less frequently. The imARs were 
adjudicated in a blinded fashion based on sponsor-physician data review to exclude 
noninflammatory etiologies, such as infec tion or tumor progressi on, and to consider 
available evidence of inflammation, such as tumor biopsies or responsiveness to 
steroids, in an effort to determine whether specific AEs or abnormal hepatic 
laboratory values were likely to be immune mediated and associat ed with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525161]. The early diagnosis of inflammatory events is im portant to init iate therapy 
and minimize complications. Inflammatory events are generally manageable using symptomatic or immuno-suppressive therapy as recommended through detailed diagnosis and management guidelines. The management guidelines for general irAEs 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-related GI toxicities, hepati tis, endocrinopathy, a nd neuropathy are 
described in appropriate section. A program-wide independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) reviews data from the ip ilimumab studies, allowing for an ongoing 
safety and benefit/risk assessment in subjects receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43839]. The DMC charter 
includes explicit stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525162], allowing the DMC to recommend 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine

 discontinuing further treatment across the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79297], if necessary. 
 
In summary, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525163] (as 3 mg/kg 
monotherapy compared to the melanoma peptide vaccine gp100) and previously untreated advanced melanoma (at 10 mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine [DTIC] 
compared to DTIC alone), and evidence of clinical activity in randomized studies in 
other tumor types. These findings, together wi th evidence of a safety profile that is 
manageable with careful monitoring and a ppropriate intervention for treatment of 
immune-related toxicities, suggest an  acceptable benefit to risk ratio.

2.5 5-azacytidine (Vidaza):  
 
5-azacytidine, an analog of the pyrimidi ne nucleoside cytidine, has effects on cell 
differentiation, gene expression, and deox yribonucleic acid ( DNA) synthesis and 
metabolism. Since the early 1970s, 5-azacyt idine has been investigated primarily 
in the US for the treatment of acute le ukemia. Clinical studies have focused 
mainly on patients with disease refractory  to conventional chemotherapy. Results 
of these investigations demonstrated activity of 5-azacytidine in the treatment of 
AML. Clinical studies subsequently eval uated the effects of 5-azacytidine in a 
variety of other malignant and hematolo gic disorders, including solid tumors, 
hemoglobinopathies (eg, thal assemia and sickle cell an emia), and MDS. In 1984, 
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB ) began a series of clinical studies 
with 5-azacytidine in patients with MD S. These studies, in addition to other 
supportive data, led to the approval of Vidaza® (5-azacytidine) in May 2004 for the treatment of MDS. 
 
5-azacytidine inhibits the methylation of newly synthesized DNA by [CONTACT_525268] (DNMT).[28-30]  Increased methylation of DNA 
(hypermethylation) may result in the si lencing of critical ge nes responsible for 
cell growth control and differentiation. Hypermethylation of CpG islands spanning the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is commonly associated 
with cancers.[31] It is now widely reco gnized that hypermethylation of DNA is 
frequently associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and other cancers,[32-34] 
such as renal,[35] melanoma,[36] br east,[37] colorectal,[38] non-small cell 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 24 of 99 
 lung[39] and hematologic malignancies.[40] 5-azacytidine is believed to exert its 
antineoplastic effects thr ough hypomethylation and cytotoxicity on abnormal 
hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. [41-45] Hypomethylation may restore 
normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation.[31, 
46, 47] The cytotoxic effects of 5-azacytidine cause the death of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_017], including cancer cells  that are no longer responsive to normal  growth 
control mechanisms.[41, 48-50] 
 
The cytotoxicity of 5-azacytidine is proportional to dose and exposure time.[41, 
42] Although the mechanisms of cytotoxi city are complex and multifaceted, there 
is general agreement that incorporation of 5-azacytidine into DNA  and ribonucleic acid (RNA), a nd inhibition of protein synthesis, are critically 
important.[51] Cytotoxicity is greatest in cells that are proliferating (S phase) and metabolically active.[41] Cytotoxic ef fects may also be mediated through 
induction of the DNA damage response pa thways.[50] Nonproliferating cells are 
relatively insensitive to 5-azacytidine.[41] 
 
Toxicology studies have been conduct ed in mice, rats, dogs, and Rhesus 
monkeys.[52] Most of the studies were performed during the 1970s and early 
1980s according to existing guidelines and standards in place during that period. 
The preclinical studies id entified the bone marrow, liver, kidneys, and lymphoid 
tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus) as the main target orga ns of toxicity for 
 
 
5- azacytidine.[52] In single-dose studies, the lethal dose of 5-azacytidine 
after intravenous (IV) administra tion in mice, rats, and dogs was 
approximately 250 mg/m2. Repeated daily dosing appears to increase the 
toxicity of 5- azacytidine.[52] The genotoxicity of 5-azacytidine is consistent 
with that of other nucleoside analogs th at interact with nucleic acids.[52] 
Likewise, similar to other 
agents with cytostatic properties, 5-az acytidine was embryotoxic and reduced the 
reproductive performance in  mice and rats.[52] 
 
Limited 5-azacytidine pharmacokinetic data are currently available. Based on human plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (whi ch represents parent drug 
plus circulating metabolites), 5-azacyt idine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_525165] (SC), with maximum pl asma concentrations found 0.5 to 2 hours 
after dosing.[52] 5-azacytidine and/or its by-products are then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_525166]. The half-lives and percent radi oactivity recovered in urine are similar 
following IV and SC routes of administration. The effe cts of renal or hepatic 
impairment, gender, age, or race on th e pharmacokinetics of 5-azacytidine have 
not been studied.[52] A single dose (75 mg/m
2) SC versus IV crossover study in 6 
MDS subjects[53] revealed an approximat e bioavailability of 89% for the SC 
dose (range 52% to 128%) with mean half-lives of  0.69 hour and 0.36 hour after 
SC and IV administration, respectively. These results demonstrated that 5- 
azacytidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_525167].  The  apparent  SC  clearance   (167   L/h   or 
2791 mL/min) and systemic IV clearance (147 L/h) of 5-azacytidine exceeded the 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 25 of 99 
 glomerular filtration rate (approximatel y 125 mL/min) and total renal blood flow 
(1200 mL/min) in health y subjects. This indicates that  non-renal elimination (eg, 
metabolism, hydrolysis, and/or degradati on) plays a role in the elimination of 
parent 5-azacytidine. In addition, 5-azacytidine 75 mg/m2  was generally well- 
tolerated after single SC injection or IV infusion over 10 minutes.[53] 
 
A number of studies have l ooked at different parenteral doses and schedules of 5- 
azacytidine, finding maximum to lerated doses of  up to 500 mg/m2 when 
administered weekly.[54] 
 
During the two decades between the start of the CALGB studies and the approval 
of 5-azacytidine, a new understanding of  MDS has developed, such as the World 
Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria, the International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPSS), and the Intern ational Working Group (IWG) response 
criteria. Silverman et al. reevaluated th e combined data (N = 309) from 3 of the 
CALGB studies using the WH O classification system for MDS and AML and the 
IWG response criteria.[55] Using the IW G response criteria in MDS patients, 
response rates were between 40% and 70% in 5-azacytidine treated patients. Ten 
to 17% of patients achieved a complete remission; partial remission was rare; and 
23% to 36% of patients ha d a hematologic improvement . In patients with AML 
(N = 103), 35% to 48% had hematologic improvement or  better responses. The 
median survival time for 27 patients assi gned to 5-azacytidine was 19.3 months 
compared with 12.9 months for the 25 patients assigned to observation.[55]
 
A randomized international Ph ase III trial (Study 5-az acytidine PH GL 2003 CL 
1) for higher-risk MDS patients, classi fied by [CONTACT_525269], RAEB-T, or 
CMML with 0-29% marrow blasts, with an IPSS of Intermediate -2 or High by 
[CONTACT_193403]/cytogenetic review wa s recently reported.[56] Patients were 
randomized to 5-azacytidine (75 mg/m2/day x 7days in 28 day cycles) or 
conventional care regimens (CCR), where CCR was pre-selected by [CONTACT_525270] (transfusions, antibiotics, and G-CSF for 
neutropenic infection), lo w-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2/day x 14 days in 28 day 
cycles); or standard chemotherapy (conventional inductio n/consolidation). 
Patients were stratified by [CONTACT_339122]/IPSS and randomized 1:1 to 5-azacytidine or 
CCR. This trial did not allow erythropoi etin. Three hundred fifty eight patients 
(70% male) were randomized at 79 ce nters to 5-azacytidine (N=179) or CCR 
(N=179): best supportive care only (N= 105, 59%), low-dose cytarabine (N=49, 
27%), or standard chemotherapy (N=25, 14%). Median age was 69 years (range 
38-88 years). The 5-azacytidine and CCR gr oups were comparable for baseline 
patient characteristics. At baseline, 95%  of patients were higher risk: RAEB 
(58%), RAEB-T/WHO AML (34%), CMML (3%), and other (5%). By [CONTACT_56623], 87% were higher risk: Intermediate  -2 (40%), High (47%), and 13% 
Indeterminate/other. 5-azacytidine was ad ministered for a median of 9 cycles; 
low-dose cytarabine for [ADDRESS_681450] atistically superior overall survival 
compared to CCR, with a median overa ll survival of 24.4 months vs. 15 months 
for CCR (stratified log-rank p=0.0001, haza rd ration 0.58). Two-year survival 
approximately doubled in the 5-azacytid ine arm compared to CCR: 51% vs. 26%

 (p<0.0001). 5-azacytidine was well tolerate d with safety data consistent with 
previous reports.

2.6 Venetoclax Drug Information Summary 
See the Venetoclax Prescribing Label (Appendix) for additional details on 
nonclinical and c linical studies. 
 Bcl-2 overexpression has been implicated in maintaining the survival of AML cells and has been associated with resi stance to chemotherapy and inferior overall 
survival (Konopleva M et al, Cancer cell  2006; 10(5): 375-88). Venetoclax 
(VEN) is a potent and selective small-mo lecule inhibitor of Bcl-[ADDRESS_681451] a variety of leukemia cell lines, primary 
patient samples and leukemia stem/pr ogenitor cells (Souers AJ et al, Nat Med  
2013; 19(2): 202-8;  Pan R et al, Cancer discovery  2014; 4(3): 362-75). VEN also 
has been found to synergize with agents known to down -regulate Mcl-1, including 
azacitidine (Tsao T et al, Ann Hematol  2012; 91(12): 1861-70). 
 Based on the mechanism of action and nonclin ical and clinical data available to 
date, the safety profile of venetoclax  is well described.  The most common 
adverse drug reactions across all indicati ons are nausea, diarrhea, hematological 
effects, and serious and/or opportunistic infections.  Hematologic effects include 
neutropenia/febrile neutr openia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia.  
Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_525168].  TLS is 
an important identified risk and is predominantly seen in the CLL population with high tumor burden.  Based on pre-clinical  data, decreased spermatogenesis has 
been identified as a potential risk for venetoclax.  
Summary of Venetoclax Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Venetoclax is a potent, selective and ora lly bioavailable small molecule inhibitor 
of Bcl-2 that binds with > 1,000-fold higher affinity for Bcl-2 (dissociation 
constant [K i] < 0.010 nM) than for Bcl-X L (K i - 48 nM or Mcl-1 (K i > 444 nM) 
(Souers AJ et al, Nat Med  2013; 19(2): 202-8). In vitro, venetoclax has 
demonstrated cell killing activity agains t patient-derived ch ronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) cells and a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines (Souers 
AJ et al, Nat Med  2013; 19(2): 202-8). Venetoclax has demonstrated potent 
killing of AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo, and has also exhibited an ti-tumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting the 
growth of AML cells systemically en grafted into immunoc ompromised mice. 
 
Summary of Venetoclax Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of venetoclax was evaluated in mice, rats, monkeys, and 
dogs.  Venetoclax pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was characterized by [CONTACT_525271].  Half-lives ranged from 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 27 of 99 
 2.2 hours in monkeys to 12 hours in dogs.   
 Venetoclax demonstrated high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey 
plasma proteins (  99.9%).  Blood to plasma ratio s showed that venetoclax does 
not partition preferentially in to the red blood cells.  Fo llowing oral administration 
of venetoclax to nonclinical spec ies and humans, parent compound and 
metabolites were mainly cleared via biliar y excretion and fecal elimination, with 
minimal renal clearance. 
 Venetoclax is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) 3A4 (CYP3A4) in vitro; UDP-glucuronosyltransf erases (UGTs) are not involved in the 
metabolism of venetoclax.  In addition, venetoclax is also a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Active uptake of venetoclax was not observed in cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1.  In vitro studies indicated that venetoclax is not 
an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 
at clinically relevant concentrations. Venetoclax is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and UGT1A1 in vitro, but it is not predicted to cause clinically relevant 
inhibition due to high plasma protein binding.  Venetoclax is a P-gp and BCRP 
inhibitor and weak OATP1B1  inhibitor in vitro.  In vitro, venetoclax is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and is a moderate  inhibitor of CYP2C8.  Definitive in 
vitro experiments showed that venetoclax is not predicted to be an inducer or 
inhibitor of the metabolism of CYP2C9 substrate compounds .  Venetoclax is not a 
reversible inhibitor of  CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D 6, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (IC
50 
 30 µM) in vitro and does not induce CYP3 A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up 
to 10  M.  
 
Summary of Nonclinical Toxicology 
Venetoclax has been assessed in repeated -dose general toxicology studies and in 
genetic, developmental/reproductive, and safety pharmacology studies.  The 
primary toxicities associated with vene toclax administration included effects on 
the hematologic system (decreased lym phocytes and erythrocytes) in mice and 
dogs, the male dog reproductive system (t esticular germ cell depletion), and 
embryo-fetal toxicity in mice.  
Summary of Venetoclax Clinical Data 
Clinical Efficacy Data for Venetoclax: Preliminary efficacy results are available 
for subjects with a variety of hematologi cal neoplasms; the drug is approved for 
the treatment of CLL patients whose cells have a 17p chromosomal deletion. 
Preliminary data indicate that venetocl ax shows promising efficacy in AML. 
 In Study M14-212 the CR/CRi rate for subjects treated with venetoclax 
monotherapy was 19% (Konopleva M et al, Cancer discovery  2016; 6(10): 
1106-17). 
 In Study M14-358 the CR/CRi rate for AML subjects (given venetoclax 
plus azacitidine or decitabine) was 66% (DiNardo CD et al, Blood. 2019 Jan 3;133(1):7-17). 
 In Study M14-387 the CR/CRi rate for AML subjects (given venetoclax 
plus low dose ara-C) was 54% (Wei A et al J Clin Oncol.  2019 May 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 28 of 99 
 20;37(15):1277-1284). 
 
Venetoclax Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics:  Venetoclax clinical 
pharmacology is being evaluated in several Phase I to III clinical trials, and data 
are available from three Phase I st udies (M12-175, M13-367, M12-630), four 
Phase Ib studies (M13-365, M12-90 1, GO29440, GP28331), one Phase II study 
(M14-212) and five dedicated clinical  pharmacology studies (Study M13-364, 
M14-497, M13-363, M14-253 and M15-101).  In the Phase 1 Study M14-358, preliminary pharmacokinetic results in 31 treatment-naïve AML subjects were availa ble for venetoclax doses ranging from 
400 mg to 800 mg when given in combination with de citabine (Arm A) or 
azacitidine (Arm B) and with or without  posaconazole (Arm C). For Arm A and 
Arm B, venetoclax steady-state mean Cmax and AUC24 (Cycle 2 Day 5) ranged from 1.77 – 3.36 μg/mL and 24.7 – 59.5 μg/mL, respectively. Based on the 
limited preliminary pharmacokinetic data, there was no evidence to suggest a marked effect of the co-administra tion of decitabine and azacitidine on the 
pharmacokinetics of venetoclax. In Arm C of this study, preliminary 
pharmacokinetic results from [ADDRESS_681452] s were available on Cycle 1 Day 20 
(venetoclax 400 mg alone QD until Day 20) and Cycl e 1 Day 28 (venetoclax 100 
mg QD with posaconazole given from Da y 21 to Day 28). Venetoclax Cmax and 
AUC following co-administration of vene toclax 100 mg with posaconazole were 
2.1- and 2.7-fold higher respectively, co mpared to venetoclax 400 mg alone. 
 Preliminary pharmacokinetic results of venetoclax are available from 12 treatment-naïve subjects with AML in Cohorts 1 (600 mg) and 2 (800 mg) from the ongoing Phase 1 combination study of venetoclax and low dose cytarabine (Study M14-387). On Cycle 1 Day 10 (with cytarabine), venetoclax mean Cmax and AUC24 values ranged from 2.25 – 2.56 μg/mL and 34.7 – 44.6 μg•hr/mL, 
respectively. On Cycle 1 Day 18 (venetoc lax alone), mean Cmax and AUC values 
of venetoclax ranged from 2.38 – 2.89 μg/mL and 37.9 – 45.3 μg•hr /mL. Dose-
normalized Cmax and AUC24 of venetocl ax on Cycle 1 Day 10 (with cytarabine) 
were comparable to dose normalized Cmax and AUC24 on Cycle 1 Day 18 (venetoclax alone), suggesting that co-administration of cytarabine did not markedly affect venetoclax exposures.  Clinical Safety Data for Venetoclax:  As of 05 June 2017, three Phase 1/[ADDRESS_681453] been conducted in the AML indication as described below. 
 Overview of Phase 2 Study M14-212:  Venetoclax Monotherapy in AML 
This is a completed study with single ag ent venetoclax in subjects with R/R AML 
and those unfit for intensiv e therapy.  A total of [ADDRESS_681454] common 
adverse events observed in ≥ 30% of the subjects in  Study M14-212 were nausea 
(59.4%); diarrhea (56.3%); hypokalemia, vomiting (40.6% each); fatigue, headache (34.4% each); hypomagnesemia ( 37.5%); febrile neutropenia (31.3%);

 each); dyspnea, hypotension, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and pneumonia (21.9% 
each).  Serious adverse events were reported in 27 subjects (84.4%), the most common being febrile neut ropenia (28.1%), maligna nt neoplasm progression 
(25.0%), and pneumonia (15.6%).   Three serious adverse events were considered 
to have a reasonable possibili ty of being related to vene toclax (i.e., 1 event each 
of diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and pseudomonal bacter emia).  No cases of TLS 
occurred during venetoclax treatment.  In this phase II multicenter trial single agent VEN produ ced an overall response in 
5/32 relapsed/refractory AM L patients (CR in 1 patient, CRi in 4 patients) 
102. Of 
the 5 patients with CR/CRi, 3 had IDH mutations suggesting that patients with 
IDH mutations may be particularly sensitive to VEN. 
 Two ongoing trials are evaluating VEN comb ination regimens in  treatment naïve 
patients with AML who are ≥[ADDRESS_681455] 
induction: (a) to evaluate th e efficacy and tolerability of the combination of VEN 
with a methyltransferase inhibitor (azacyti dine or decitabine) (ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); (b) to evalua te VEN with low-dose cytarabine 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).   
Overview of Ongoing Phase 1b Study (M14-358): Venetoclax in Combination 
with HMA in Treatment Naïve AML 
As of 09 March 2016, a total of 45 subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_681456] induction therapy were enrolled into the 
escalation stage at 3 dose levels of ve netoclax at 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg. 
Venetoclax was administered daily during the 28-day cycles in combination with 
decitabine (20 mg/m
2 intravenously on Days 1 – 5 once every 28 days) or 
azacitidine (75 mg/m2 intravenously or subcutaneous ly on Days 1 – 7 once every 
28 days). Preliminary safety and efficacy data are available from the ongoing dose 
escalation stage of this trial.  The most common adverse events for al l subjects in Study M14-358 were nausea 
(53.3%), diarrhea (44.4%), febrile neutropenia (40.0%) , neutrophil count 
decreased (31.1%), platelet count decr eased, cough, and fatigue (28.9% each), 
edema peripheral and hypokalemia (26.7% each). Events grade 3 and above were reported for the majority (91.1%) of subj ects; the most common event was febrile 
neutropenia (40.0%). Serious adverse events were reported for 27 (60.0%) 
subjects, including febrile neutropeni a (11 subjects), malignant neoplasm 
progression (3 subjects) atri al fibrillation, abdominal pa in, non-cardiac chest pain, 
pyrexia, pneumonia, sepsis, bone pain (2 s ubjects each). All othe r events occurred 
in [ADDRESS_681457] each. The combination of vene toclax with decitabine and azacitidine 
demonstrates a tolerable safety profile.  
 
As of 09 March 2016, the ORR, as assessed by [CONTACT_525272] 3 dose levels, was 62.2% (28 of 45), with CR in 12 (26.7%), CRi in 15 (33.3%), and PR in 1 (2.2%). Four subjects (8.9%) were reported to have morphologic leukemia-free state (less than 5% blasts in bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_525169] 200 nucleated cells) after completion of Cycle 1. Eight

 patients (17.8%) had resistant disease. However, all of the patients with resistant 
disease had evidence of blast reduction at  completion of Cycle 1. The patients 
enrolled into the 1200 mg dose level had a shorter follow-up at the time of this 
analysis.   The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in either arm and dose escalation stage has completed enrollment.  Enrollment into safety expansion at 
400 mg and 800 mg dose of venetoclax in combination with both HMAs is 
ongoing. 
 
Study M14-387:  Study M14-387 titled, "A Phas e 1/2 study of venetoclax in 
combination with low-dose cytarabine in treatment naïve subjects with acute myeloid leukemia who are ≥ [ADDRESS_681458] 
anthracycline-based induction therapy,"  is an ongoing, open -label, multicenter 
safety and pharmacokinetics study. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to assess the safety profile, characterize pharmacokinetics, and determine the dose schedule, the MTD, and the RPTD of  venetoclax in combination with low-
dose cytarabine (LCD) in treatment-naïv e AML subjects. The primary objectives 
of the Phase 2 portion of the study are to evaluate preliminary estimates of efficacy (including ORR and TTP) and to characterize the toxicities of the 
combination at RPTD. Secondary object ives of the Phase 2 portion include 
evaluating leukemia response (rates of CR, CRi, PR, RD, and HR including 
transfusion support needs) and DOR. An additional exploratory objective includes the evaluation of biomarkers that may serve as surrogate or predictors for clinical 
outcomes for future studies. Of the 25 subjects in Study M14-387, 24 (96.0%) experienced at least [ADDRESS_681459] common adverse events for all subjects in Study M14-387 were: nausea (54%), febrile neutropenia (41%), 
diarrhea (44%), decreased appetite (33%), and periphe ral edema (31%). Adverse 
events leading to study drug disconti nuation occurred in 4 (16.0%) subjects, 
including 1 event each of disease progression, acute hepatic failure, Candida pneumonia, and subdural hemorrhage. Fatal adverse events occu rred in 5 (20.0%) 
subjects: 2 events of malignant neoplasm  progression and 1 event each of acute 
hepatic failure, Candida pneum onia, and lung infection.

2.6 Rationale for study: 
Arm 1 and 2: Rationale for azacitidine with nivolumab and azacitidine with 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: 
The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a major role in immune evasion and cytotoxic T- 
cell exhaustion in AML[17, 20, 21]. PD-L1 expression in AML samples is 
increased at the time of disease progression or after exposure to IFN-gamma[20, 57]. Overexpression of PD-L1 is an independent negative prognostic factor in 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 31 of 99 
 AML[20]. Hypomethylating agents may alter immune regulation[58]. Yang et al 
have recently demonstrated that hypomethy lating therapy leads to up regulation of 
PD-L1, PD-1, and PD-L2 gene expression[19]. Patients resistant to hypomethylating therapy had higher increments in gene expression suggesting that PD-1 up regulation may promote resistance to hypomethylating agents. Demethylation of the PD-L1 gene by [CONTACT_525273]-L1 up- regulation and CTL exhaustion[59]. Similarly, exposure to decitabine up regulates PD-L1, PD-1 and PD-L2 by [CONTACT_525274]-L1 locus[19]. These data
suggest that blockage of PD-1 by [CONTACT_525275]. The data with  the vidaza+nivo 
combination are encouraging as  outlined in detail in section 2.3.4 with a higher 
response rate and improved median overall survival as  compared to historical 
outcomes with azacytidine or  decitabine based prior salvage clinical trials 
performed at MDACC (Daver  N, Sharma P et al.,  ASH 2016, Abst #763), 
however there is much r oom for improvement in th e response rate and OS. 
Immune mediated toxicities occur bu t are being manage d with improved 
awareness and early interven tion with steroids and on ly [ADDRESS_681460] 
come off therapy due to immune mediated  organ toxicity. Furthermore, all 15 
patients who had an imm une mediated grade 2-4 toxicities could continue 
therapy with nivolumab with out recurrence of the IO -toxicity except in one 
case. The vidaza+nivo is being evaluated in the frontline older (>65 year) 
patients with AML as well and we have treated 5 patie nts with no major 
immune mediated G3/4 toxi cities observed. The frontline patients are early for 
evaluation of respons e (none have completed > 3 cycles).  
 
Evaluation of multiple costim receptors from BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] a nd peripheral blood 
in patients at baseline and every 4-8 w eeks on trial by 17-col or flow-cytometry 
in collaboration with the Immunotherapy Platform ([CONTACT_525305]) at 
MDACC revealed that the CTLA4 on CD8+, T-eff and to  a lesser extent on T-
reg went up in non-respond ers after 2 cycles of vidaza+nivolumab suggesting 
up-regulation of this inhi bitory checkpoint as a potential mechanism of 
resistance. This suggests that simultaneous  blockade of the PD1 and CTLA4 
may improve the response rate as has been  seen in solid tumo rs. Based on this 
we propose to evaluate a combination of nivolumab wi th ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525170] a frontline approach in older AML 
patients >/=65 years not candidates  for cytotoxic induction therapy. 
 
Arm 3: Rationale for ni volumab in combination with azacitidine and 
venetoclax: 
Bcl-2 overexpression has been implicated  in maintaining th e survival of AML 
cells and has been associated with resi stance to chemothe rapy and inferior 
overall survival as in itially shown by [CONTACT_525276] (Konopleva et al, Cancer cell  
2006; 10(5): 375-88.). Venetoclax (formerly ABT-199) is a potent and selective 
small-molecule inhibitor of  Bcl-[ADDRESS_681461] a variety of leukemia cell line s, primary patient samples and leukemia 
stem/progenitor cells (Souers A et al Nat Med  2013; 19(2): 
 202-8;  Pan R et al 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 32 of 99 
 Cancer discovery  2014; 4(3): 362-75). Venetoclax also has been  found to 
synergize with agents k nown to down-regulate Mcl- 1, including azacitidine 
(Ann Hematol  2012; 91(12): 1861-70). 
 
Studies have evaluated venetoclax in combination with low-intensity therapy in 
older adults with newly diagnose d AML deemed unf it for intensive 
chemotherapy. This is a popul ation of patients in whom  standard therapy over 
the last 10-15 years has comprised of either an HMA (e.g. azacitidine or 
decitabine) or low dose cytarabine (LDAC ), with published CR/CRi rates of 15-
28% and median OS of 6-10 months wi th HMA, and CR/CRi rates of 10-15% 
and median OS of 5-7 months with LDAC (Kantarjian H et al JCO 2012; 
Dombret H et al, Blood 2015). An o ngoing phase Ib st udy has reporting 
promising safety and effi cacy of venetoclax in combination with either 
azacitidine or decitabine in patients ≥65 years of age with previously untreated 
AML and who are inel igible for chemothe rapy (DiNardo CD et al, Blood. 2019 
Jan 3;133(1):7-17). At the most recent update (Pollyea D et al ASH [ADDRESS_681462]: fu ll PowerPoint attached as  Appendix), 145 patients 
were treated with a median age of 74 years (range, 65-86 years). The 30-day 
and 60-day mortality rates were 3% and 8%, respectively.  Tumor lysis 
syndrome was not observed. The CR/CRi  rate for the entir e cohort was 66% 
with a median duration of  CR/CRi of 11.[ADDRESS_681463] risk-benefit 
profile. Based on these exc iting results in this historically difficult-to-treat 
patient population, in  November 2018 the US FDA approved venetoclax in 
combination with either low-dose cyta rabine, azacitidine or decitabine for 
patients with newly diagnosed AML who are ≥[ADDRESS_681464] intensive chemotherapy.  
 
Confirmatory phase III tria ls of azacitidine with or  without venetoclax (VIALE 
A), and low-dose cytarabi ne with or without venetoclax (VIALE C) have 
completed enrollment and results are eagerly anticipated.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_525171]-based regimens in 
frontline older AML not suitable for induction therapy, relapses are still 
common, and it is becoming clear  that these regimens are unlikely to be  curative 
in the vast majority of these patients. The median CR/CRi durations in this 
population are </= 11 months and 2-3 year OS is appr oximately 45% suggesting 
there is room for significant improvemen t by [CONTACT_525277] g the durability of 
CR/CRi’s and thereby [CONTACT_525278]. The long-term outcomes of 
patients with poor-risk di sease features re main poor even am ong frontline older 
patients. Among frontline poor-risk elderly unfit pa tients treated  with HMA 
with venetoclax (defined as patients  with TP53 and adverse cytogenetics) 
evaluated in both the MDACC intern al data set (Sh oukier M et al, J ournal of 
Clinical Oncology  37, no. 15_suppl (May 20, 2019) 7034 -7034) and in the 
multicenter phase Ib/II trial of HMA with  venetoclax (DiNardo CD et al, Blood. 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 33 of 99 
 2019 Jan 3;133(1):7-17 ) the CR/CRi rates were sign ificantly lower at 45-47%, 
median response durations were <6 months, median OS was only 6-9 months, 
and only 14% of these fr ontline patients achiev ing CR/CRi became MRD-
negative. 
 
Similarly, among R/R AML the efficacy of HMA with venetoclax are dismal 
with multiple datasets showing CR/CRp/CRi  rates of 20-40% with CR durations 
<6 months and median OS 4-7 months (DiNardo CD et al, American journal of 
hematology  2018; 93(3): 401-7;  Aldoss I et al, Haematologica. 2018 
Sep;103(9):e404-e40;  Goldberg A et al, Blood  2017; 130(Suppl 1): 1353), 
suggesting that there is scope for significant improvem ent by [CONTACT_525279][INVESTIGATOR_525172].  
 
Preclinical Rationale for this combination:   
In a series of human in vitro and in vivo syngeneic tumor model studies, 
venetoclax does not appear to antago nize anti-PD-1 therapy with nivolumab 
(Mathew R et al. Blood  2018 132: 3704). Venetoclax was shown to decrease 
naïve T-cells and B-cells but not central  and effector memo ry T cells (these 
being critical to anti-tumor immunity) in in vitro studies of human lymphocytes. 
In a mixed lymphocyte reac tion assay, venetoclax did not affect IFN-gamma 
secretion from CD3/CD28 stimulated T-cells  either by [CONTACT_525280]-treated 
with the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. Simi lar findings were  observed in a 
cytomegalovirus recall assay, suggesti ng that venetoclax  does not impair 
immune response to infections. In an in vivo experiment with the murine 
syngeneic tumor model MC38, venetoclax did not impair the efficacy of anti-
PD-[ADDRESS_681465] ug concentrations is limited to the B-cell subset and that 
BCL-2 inhibition is not detr imental to survival  or activation of NK- or T-cell 
subsets (Lasater E et al, Blood 2018 132:1118). Both  posters highlighting the 
potential for preclinical syn ergy between venetoclax  and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (specifically PD1 antibod ies) are attached as Appendix. 
 
We have developed a great deal of expertise with ve netoclax and developed and 
published optimized dosing schedules, assessment  time-points, safety 
monitoring, and biomarker assays. Additi onally, with >[ADDRESS_681466] 
internal controls for expected outcomes with HMA with VEN based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525173] "go" or "no go" si gnals. We have also led the developmen t of T-cell 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681467] that 
the combination of AZA+VEN with nivolum ab may not result in severe and/or 
prolonged cumulative neutropenia/thro mbocytopenia, and thereby [CONTACT_525281] a numbe r of other ongoing doublet/triplet comb inations of other 
AML drugs with venetoclax that often in corporate two myelosuppressive agents 
and encounter problems due to cumulative myelosuppr ession. This may be an 
added tolerability benefi t for this combination. 
 
 
 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
 
 This will be a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study with a safety 
lead-in phase. 
 
 Patients will receive 5-azacytidine subc utaneously or intravenously daily for [ADDRESS_681468] 28 days to evaluate DLT. Subsequently, cycles will be repeated 
approximately every 28 days (+/-7 days), and therapy will be continued until clinically significant disease progression or documentation of unacceptable toxicity. 
 
 
 Arm 1  (Vidaza+Nivolumab): Patients will receive therapy with nivolumab IV 
infusion on Day 1 and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each 5-azacyidine cycle for first 4 
cycles or until CR (whichever occurs earlier) followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of nivolumab on da y 1 of each cycle of 5-azacytdine). 
Patients who have evidence of budding rela pse or seem to have clinical benefit 
may continue or revert back to receiving nivolumab on Day 1 and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each cycle of 5-azacytidine. Patients may receive nivolumab more or 
less frequently during the maintenance regimen at the discretion of the treating 
physician only after discussion with the PI.  Arm 1 includes a salvage cohort and a frontline AML >/= 65 years age cohort. 
The salvage cohort of vidaza+nivolumab has completed accrual of 70 patients 
as of 12/15/16 and will not enroll any more  patients at this time. The frontline 
cohort of vidaza+nivolumab has enrolle d 5 patients as of 12/15/16 and will 
continue to enroll frontline ol der AML (>65 years) patients. 
 
 Arm 2: Patients will receive therapy with nivolumab IV infusion on Day 1 
and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each 5-azacyidine cycle for first 4 cycles or until CR (whichever occurs earlier) followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of 
nivolumab on day 1 of each cycle of 5-azacytdine). Patients who have 
evidence of budding relapse or seem to ha ve clinical benefit may continue or 
revert back to receiving nivolumab on Day 1 and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each 
cycle of 5-azacytidine. Patients may receive nivolumab more or less frequently 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 35 of 99 
 during the maintenance regimen at the disc retion of the treating physician only 
after discussion with the PI. Patients will receive Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525174] 1 
and every 6 (or 12) weeks (+/-3 days) there after. The plan is to give a total of 
4 doses of the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 6 (or 12 ) week intervals and then stop therapy. 
Patients who have evidence of budding rela pse or seem to have clinical benefit 
may continue the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852] 6 (or 12) weeks.  
Arm 2 includes a salvage cohort and a frontline AML >/= 65 years age cohort. 
The salvage cohort of vidaza+nivoluma b+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525175] 66 slots and 
will the priority protocol in salvage setting as the vidaza+nivolumab has 
already completed enrollment of 70 patie nts and has no additional slots. The 
frontline cohort of vidaza+nivolumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525176]+nivolumab will be open simultaneously and we will enroll  alternately to these two frontline 
protocols with close monitoring for futil ity and toxicity as specified in the 
predefined statistical efficacy and futili ty stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525177] 
11.0. This will allow us to closely assess differences in efficacy and toxicity 
among these two protocols in a similar patient population. 
 
 Arm 3 (Vidaza + Nivolumab + Venetoclax):  Patients will receive therapy 
with nivolumab IV infusion on Day 8 and Day 22 (+/-3 days) of each 5-azacyidine cycle for first 4 cycles or until CR (whichever occurs earlier) 
followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of nivolumab on Day 8 of each cycle of 5-azacytdine). Patients who have evidence of budding relapse or seem 
to have clinical benefit may continue or  revert back to receiving nivolumab on 
Day 8 and day 22 (+/-3 days) of each cycle of 5-azacytidine. Patients may 
receive nivolumab more or less frequently during the maintenance regimen at 
the discretion of the treating physician only after discussion with the PI. 
Venetoclax will be administered orally daily on Days 1-[ADDRESS_681469] cycle; 
and Days 1-14 or Days 1-21 for subseque nt cycles based on response achieved 
and degree of myelosuppression as de scribed later in the protocol.  
 Arm 3 includes a part a lead-in phase (n=6-18) followed by [CONTACT_14455] b expansion 
in two cohorts: a salvage cohort (n=30) and a frontline cohort AML >/= 65 year age cohort (n=30) (see inclusi on 4.2.1 for detailed eligibility to these 
cohorts).  
 
During the lead-in phase (part a), see Table 5C below, only R/R AML patients 
will be enrolled. Once the lead in phase (part a) is completed and 
recommended phase [ADDRESS_681470] be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_450350] s/her designee prior to enrollment of that 
patient. In addition, the pati ent must be thoroughly inform ed about all aspects of the 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681471] be obtained from 
the patient prior to initiating treatment or any study-specific procedures. The following 
criteria apply to all patients enrolled onto the study unless ot herwise specified. 
 
4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
 
4.2.1 A. Arm 1 Salvage cohort:  Patients with AML or biphenotypic or 
bilineage leukemia who have failed prior therapy. Patients with AML 
should have failed prior therapy or have relapsed after prior therapy will be 
eligible for Arm 1. 
 B. Arm 2 and 3 Salvage cohorts:  Patients with AML who have failed up 
to two prior therapeutic regimens (i .e. salvage 1 or 2 status) will be 
eligible for Arm 2 relapse cohort. A llogeneic stem cell transplant for 
patients in remission at the time of stem cell transplant will not be considered a salvage regimen. Simila rly, hydroxyurea if used alone will 
not be considered a salvage regimen.  During the lead-in phase (p art a) of Arm 3, see Table 5C below, only R/R 
AML patients who meet the “Salvage c ohorts” criteria will be enrolled.  
 C. Arm 1, 2 and 3 Frontline cohorts:  Not considered candidates for 
intensive remission induction chemothe rapy at time of enrollment based 
on EITHER: A. ≥75 years of age OR 
 B. <[ADDRESS_681472] 1 of the following: -Poor performance status (ECOG) score of 2-3. -Clinically significant heart or lung comorbidities, as  reflected by [CONTACT_2669] 1 
of: a. Left ventricular ej ection fraction (LVEF) ≤50%. 
b. Lung diffusing capacity fo r carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≤65% of 
expected. c. Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_525178] 1 second (FEV1) ≤65% of expected. 
d. Chronic stable angina  or congestive heart fa ilure controlled with 
medication. -Liver transaminases >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN). 
-Other contraindication(s) to anthracycline therapy (must be documented). -Other comorbidity the investigator judges incompatible  with intensive 
remission induction chemotherapy, wh ich must be documented and 
approved by [CONTACT_978]. 
Patients with newly diagnosed AML with poor risk karyotype or complex 
karyotype and/or TP53 deletions/mutations equal or younger than 60 year 
old will be eligible for the Frontline cohort as well. 
 
4.2.2 Patients with MDS or CMML who received therapy for the MDS or 
CMML and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless any prior therapy for MDS or CMML. The WHO 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 37 of 99 
 classification will be used for AML.  Prior therapy for MDS or CMML 
will not be considered as a prior th erapy for AML, hence such patients 
will be considered as frontline AML and eligible for the frontline elderly 
cohort. 
 
4.2.3 Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chem otherapy, biological or targeted 
therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed as long as within restrictions outlined in inclusion 4.2.1 
 
4.2.4 Age >/=18 years 
 
4.2.5 White blood cell count <20 x 109/L  
 
4.2.6 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status </=2 
 
4.2.7 Adequate organ function: total bilirubin </= 2 times upper limit of normal (x ULN) (</= [ADDRESS_681473] if considered to  be due to leukemic involvement or

The half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure’s, or drug-administration manuals) and w ill be documented in the protocol 
eligibility document. Since the effect  of immune checkpoint therapy and 
hypomethylating agents may be delayed, use of one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m

 treatment. 
 
Adequate methods of contraception include: 
 Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation me thods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception. 
 Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy 
with or without hysterect omy) or tubal ligation at  least six weeks before 
taking study treatment. In case of  oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_302571] 
 Male sterilization (at least 6 months  prior to screening). For female 
patients on the study, the vasectomized  male partner should be the sole 
partner for that patient 
 Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c) 
a. Use of oral, injected or im planted hormonal methods of 
contraception  or  other  forms  of  hormonal  contraception  that  have 
 
 
comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring 
or transdermal horm one contraception 
b. Placement of an intrauterine devi ce (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS) 
c. Barrier methods of contraceptio n: Condom or Occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) w ith spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ 
vaginal suppository 
 
In case of use of oral contraceptio n, women should ha ve been stable 
on the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_248247]. 
 
Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but  should be used in conjunction 
with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug 
interaction. 
 
Women are considered post-menopaus al and not of child bearing

5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 General  
 
All patients will be registered through CORe. The objective will be to administer 
nivolumab and 5-azacytidine OR nivolum ab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43861] 5-azacytidine 
OR nivolumab with 5-azaci tidine and venetoclax at established published doses 
from solid tumor and leukemia studies.  
 
5.2 Schedule  
 
The Investigator is responsible for completing the cohort summary template and submitting to the IND office Medical Mon itor for review and approval prior to 
advancing subjects to the next protocol specified cohort/dose level. A copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder under “sponsor correspondence”.  This should be submitted after the first six patients. 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_681483] ing to the following schedule: 
 
 Arm 1: 5-azacytidine will be administered subcutaneously (SQ) or 
intravenously (IV) for 7 days of every cycle with daily schedule of 7 consecutive days (Days 1-7) or for days 5-2-2 which is 5 consecutive weekdays (Days 1-5) with rest on the 2 weekend days (Days 6 and 7) and then dosing the first two weekdays of the next week (Days 8 and 9) of each 28-day cycle as determined by [CONTACT_35425]. Alternative dosing 
schedules such as 4-2-3 which is 4 cons ecutive weekdays (Days 1-4) with rest 
on the 2 weekend days (Days 5 and 6) and then dosing the first three weekdays of the next week (Days 7, 8, and 9) of each 28- day cycle or other 
schedules allowing the [ADDRESS_681484] as determined by [CONTACT_525284] a pproval from the PI. Both SQ and IV 
forms of administration are FDA approved and considered interchangeable. Patients may start receiving 5-azacytidine by [CONTACT_525285] 41 of 99 
 other, and also administration schedules from one schedule and changed to 
the other at any time as needed based on patient and/or physician preference. 
 
Nivolumab will be administered as an approximately 60 minute IV infusion on Day 1 and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each 5-azacyidine cycle for the first 4 cycles or until CR (whichever occurs earlier) followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of nivolumab on da y 1 of each cycle of 5-azacytdine). 
Patients who have evidence of budding relapse or seem to have clinical benefit may continue or revert back to receiving nivolumab on Day 1 and day 14 (+/-3 days) of each cycle of 5-azacytidine. Patients may receive nivolumab more or less frequently during the maintenance regimen at the discretion of the treating physician only after discu ssion with the PI. Nivolumab will be 
administered every cycle with no interr uptions unless there are adverse events 
as described in Section 5.3. 
 
 Arm 2: Azacytidine and nivolumab will be administered as described for 
Arm 1. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525182] a 90 minute IV infusion on day 1  
and then every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) or  every 12 weeks (+/- 3 days) depending 
on the dose level being evaluated during the lead in phase (Table 5B). The 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525183] 4 doses but may be 
continued beyond dose #4 if there is reason to believe this will be of clinical 
benefit. The ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525184] a 
budding relapse. 
 
 
 Arm 3: Azacytidine will be administered subcutaneously (SQ) or 
intravenously (IV) for 7 days of every cycle with daily schedule of 7 
consecutive days (Days 1-7) or for days 5-2-2 which is 5 consecutive 
weekdays (Days 1-5) with rest on the 2 weekend days (Days 6 and 7) and 
then dosing the first two weekdays of the next week (Days 8 and 9) of each 28-day cycle as determined by [CONTACT_35425]. Alternative dosing 
schedules such as 4-2-3 which is 4 cons ecutive weekdays (Days 1-4) with rest 
on the 2 weekend days (Days 5 and 6) and then dosing the first three weekdays of the next week (Days 7, 8, and 9) of each 28- day cycle or other 
schedules allowing the [ADDRESS_681485] as determined by [CONTACT_525284] a pproval from the PI. Both SQ and IV 
forms of administration are FDA approved and considered interchangeable. Patients may start receiving 5-azacytidine by [CONTACT_525286], and also administration schedules from one schedule and changed to the other at any time as needed based on patient and/or physician preference. 
 
Nivolumab will be administered as an approximately 60 minute IV infusion on Day 8 and Day 22 (+/-3 days) of each 5-azacyidine cycle for the first 4 cycles or until CR (whichever occurs earlier) followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of nivolumab on Da y 8 of each cycle of 5-azacytdine).

benefit may continue or revert back to receiving nivolumab on Day 8 and Day 22 (+/-3 days) of each cycle of 5-azacytidine. Patients may receive 
nivolumab more or less frequently during the maintenance regimen at the discretion of the treating physician only after discussion with the PI. Nivolumab will be administered every cycle with no interruptions unless there are adverse events as described in Section 5.3. 
 
Venetoclax will be administered orally daily on Days 1-[ADDRESS_681487] cycle; 
and Days 1-14 for subsequent cycl es depending on the dose level being 
evaluated in the lead in  phase (Table 5C).  
 
 5-azacytidine at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on  days 1-7 or days 5-2-2 has been 
shown to be safe in combinatio n with multiple agents including 
lenalidomide[60], bortezomib[60], and vor inostat[61, 62].  Alternative dosing 
schedules such as 4-2-3 which is 4 cons ecutive weekdays (Days 1-4) with rest 
on the 2 weekend days (Days 5 and 6) and then dosing the first three 
weekdays of the next week (Days 7, 8, and 9) of each 28-day cycle or other 
schedules allowing the 2 day weekend inte rruption may be applied as long as 
we make every attempt to give the 7 da ys of azacytidine as consecutively as 
possible. The maximum dose for this trial of nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_681488] proposed the starting dose level 0 of 5-azacytidine 75 mg/m2 x 7 days and nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg on days [ADDRESS_681489]

The goal of the lead-in phase is to  identify the MTD i.e. the dose at 
which <2/6 patients experience DL T. During the lead-in phase the 
dose’s/duration of nivolumab and/or ve netoclax may be reduced if 2 or 
more patients experience DLT at an y given dose as shown in Table 5C. 
The RP2D will be selected at the en d of the lead-in phase and may be 
the MTD dose or a dose level lower than the MTD.  
 
Once the RP2D is deci ded the expansion (part b) will open in 2 
cohorts: Frontline cohort (n=30)  and Salvage Cohort (n=30) with 
eligibility as defined in 4.2.1. See “statistics” sect ion for more details. 
 After the lead-in (part a) the dose of nivolumab may NOT be reduced in the expansion (part b) of the study. For potential nivolumab related AEs only dose interruptions will be permitted. Dose reductions or escalations of venetoclax and 5- azacytidine are permitted in the 
expansion (part b) of the study and dose reductions or escalations of 5-
azacytidine or venetoclax beyond those mentioned in table 5C or 5.3.2 should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_525192]. Only Salvag e patients as defined in Inclusion 
criteria 4.1B will be enrolled during in the lead-in phase.  The dose and /or schedule of administ ration is subject to modification 
pending information from ongoing clinical trials of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525193] a sing le agent and in combination with 
other drugs.  
DLT is defined as clinically signific ant non-hematologic adverse event or 
abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and occurring during the first cycle on study that meets any of the following criteria: 
 
 
 CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_681490] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) for >/= 7 days or 
grade 3 hyperbiliribunemia for >/= 7 days 
 
 CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_681491] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) of any duration 
 
 All other clinically significant non-hematological adverse event 
that is Grade 3 or 4 according to the NCI common terminology 
criteria version 4.0 with the following exceptions:

 Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting and diarrhea will be 
considered DLT only if not controlled by [CONTACT_185986]. 
 
 
 Grade 3 biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lipase or bilirubin 
elevation) will only be considered DLT if accompanied by [CONTACT_185987].  Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities will only be considered DLT if possibly related to study drug and not corrected by [CONTACT_339126]. 
 
• Results in discontinuation of therapy 
 • Any treatment-related death;  
 
Hematologic DLT is defined as grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and/or 
thrombocytopenia with a hypocellular bone marrow (<10% cellularity) 
lasting for 42 days or more from Cycle 1 Day 1 in the absence of residual leukemia (i.e., with less than 5% blasts or residual leukemia by 
[CONTACT_1603]-cytometry or RT-PCR). Anemia will not be considered for the 
definition of DLT.   -Patients that are removed from study before day [ADDRESS_681492] be clearly documented in the patients chart.   -Patients who do not receive venetoclax on day 1 due to logistical 
and/or financial reasons, the DLT period will be extended to [ADDRESS_681493] dose of venetoclax. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Arm 1: We will first treat 6 patients at dose level 0 in the lead-in phase. 
If DLT occurs in >/=2/6 patients, this dose level would exceed the 
MTD, and 6 patients will be treated at the next lower dose level (i.e. 
dose level -1). The dose de-escalatio n (Table 5) will continue in cohorts 
of 6 until we reach a dose level at which <2/[ADDRESS_681494] 28 days. The dose level at which 0-1/[ADDRESS_681495] 28 days  of treatment will be the MTD and 
will be used to treat an additional patients in the phase II portion of the study. If >/=2/6 patients experience  DLT at dose level -4, the study will 
be revised to consider additional lowe r dose levels (based on potential 
synergistic toxicity). 
 
If DLT is observed in the first 28 days  of treatment in 0 or 1/[ADDRESS_681496] not e xperienced DLT will be replaced. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Arm 2: We will first treat 6 patients at dose level 0 in the lead-in phase. 
If DLT occurs in >/=2/6 patients, this dose level would exceed the 
MTD, and 6 patients will be treated at the next lower dose level (i.e. 
dose level -1). If DLT occurs in </=1/6 patients, this dose level would not exceed the MTD, and 6 patients will be treated at the next higher 
dose level (i.e. dose level +1).  The dose escalation or de-escalation (Table 5b) will continue in cohorts of 6 until we reach a dose level at 
which <2/[ADDRESS_681497] 28 days or if </=1/6 
patients experience a DLT at dose leve l +1. The highest dose level at 
which 0-1/[ADDRESS_681498] 28 days of treatment will be the MTD and will be used to treat an additional 54 salvage 1 
and 2 patients (Arm 2 Salvage Cohort) and 30 frontline AML >/= 65 years not candidates for induction th erapy (Arm 2 Frontline cohort) in 
the phase II portion of the study. If >/=2/6 patients experience DLT at dose level -2, the study will be revised to consider additional lower dose levels (based on pote ntial synergistic toxicity). 
 
Patients that are removed from study before day [ADDRESS_681499] not e xperienced DLT will be replaced.

 Venetoclax will be administered orally daily on Days 1-[ADDRESS_681503] cycle; 
and Days 1-14 for subsequent cycles.  
 
 In cycle 1, patients should undergo a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_525194] 21 (+/- 4 days). Patients who achieve marrow remission (i.e. bone 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 47 of 99 
 marrow blasts <5% by [CONTACT_5293]) or marrow aplasia/hypoplasia (</=10% 
cellularity or insufficient sample ) should discontinue venetoclax for the 
remainder of the cycle and be monitored for count recovery.  
 
a)  If the Day 21 bone marrow shows <5% blasts, the venetoclax should be 
held, and cycle 2 should not be initiated till ANC>0.5 and platelets are >30K without platelet transfusion support for >5 days.  
 
b)  If the Day 21 bone marrow shows aplasia/hypoplasia (</=10% 
cellularity or insufficient sample), the venetoclax should be held on Day 21, and a repeat bone marrow should be performed on Day 28 (+/- 4 days) for response and MRD assessment. If the Day 28 bone marrow shows >/=5% blasts proceed with cycle [ADDRESS_681504] of the patient (those with C1D28 bone marrow >/=5% are allowed to receive 21 days of venetoclax in cycle#2). If the Day 28 bone marrow 
shows <5% blasts, the venetoclax should continue to be held, and cycle 
2 should not be initiated till ANC>0.5 and platelets are >30K without platelet transfusion support for >5 days. If the Day 28 bone marrow shows persistent aplasia/hypoplasia (< /=10% cellularity or insufficient 
sample) continue to hold the venetoclax and repeat a bone marrow in 
approximately 10-14 days. 
 
c) If a bone marrow remission (<5% blasts) or aplasia/hypoplasia is not 
confirmed on the Day [ADDRESS_681505] a repeat bone marrow on Day 28 (+/- 5 days). If the Day 28 bone marrow shows >/=5% blasts proceed with 
cycle [ADDRESS_681506] of the patient (those with C1D28 
bone marrow >/=5% are allowed to receive 21 days of venetoclax in cycle #2). If the Day 28 bone marrow shows <5% blasts or aplasia/hypoplasia follow steps outlined in “a” and “b” above. 
 
d) Treatment interruptions and dosing schedules other than the ones 
mentioned above can be considered after discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_525195]. 
 
e) Of note the nivolumab infusion will continue as scheduled and will not 
be impacted or adjusted based on venetoclax dosing schema or 
venetoclax related delays. 
 
 Physicians should leukoreduce with hydroxyurea to reduce the peripheral 
white blood count to below 15,000/ μL prior to the administration of the first 
dose of venetoclax. If the WBC is >15,000/ μL the venetoclax should not be 
initiated till the white count is brought down to below 15,000/ μL. 
 
 As venetoclax is obtained commercially, some patients may have delays in 
beginning venetoclax due to financial or other logistical considerations. Even if venetoclax is not yet available, patients may begin azacitidine and 
nivolumab on day 1.  Venetoclax should be started when it is obtained and continued as above (i.e. through day 21 bone marrow and subsequent dosing of venetoclax will be based on the Day 21 bone marrow results as described above in a - c). 
 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 48 of 99 
  Failure to begin venetoclax on day 1 will not be considered a protocol 
deviation or violation. 
 
 The patient will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525196] [ADDRESS_681507] cycle of concomitant azacitidine-venetoclax-nivolumab therapy (e.g., 
Days 1 through Day 14) of cycle 1, potentially admission will be longer if we encounter TLS, infections or other complications that would be better managed inpatient. To mitigate the risk for tumor lysis syndrome, patients 
must be receiving tumor lysis prophylaxis, including hydration (oral, 
intravenous) and treatment with a uric acid reducing agent (allopurinol, rasburicase) prior to the start of venetoclax therapy and continued during Cycle 1.  
 
TLS chemistry tests (potassium, uric acid, creatinine, calcium and phosphorus) will be obtained prior to dosing and 5-[ADDRESS_681508] meets cr iteria for clinically significant 
laboratory or clinical TLS, no additional venetoclax should be administered until resolution of the TLS. Venetoclax interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (< 48 hours) chemical changes and laboratory TLS will be allowed and will not require a dose reduction.  
 See section 6.4 for details of TLS management.  
 
 During cycle 1, venetoclax will be dose escalated daily to the goal dose of 
400mg daily.  Patients will receive 100mg on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2 and 
400mg on Day 3 and onwards, or adjusted dose if on concomitant azoles 
(discussed below in section 6.3). Venetoclax dose ramp-up as described in section 6.4.  
 If venetoclax is not available at the start of therapy due to different reasons 
(insurance, financial, transportation, others), azacitidine and nivolumab can start and venetoclax is added when it becomes available.  
 
 If azacitidine cycles are delayed, venetoclax therapy may continue on Days 
1-[ADDRESS_681509]. If azacitidine cycles are delayed, 
nivolumab may continue as scheduled (q2 weeks) after discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_525197]. 
 
 
5.2.2 One cycle of therapy is defined as 28 days. Patients will receive one 
cycle of therapy every 28 days (+ /- 7 days). The ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525198] 6 weeks (+/-3 days).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In the expansion (part b) portion of the study (once the 
MTD/RP2D dose has been defined) cycles may be started early (but not earlier than day 21) for patients with active disease if judged in the best interest of the patient. 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 49 of 99 
 For the lead-in (part a) cohort, DLT defining period is 28 
days. As such, cycle 2 should not be started before 28 days 
for the patients being treated on the lead-in cohort. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subsequent cycles may be delayed for recovery of toxicity or other medical conditions (e.g. infections). Delays in start of subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only 
for patients who are deriving  clinical benefit and after 
discussion with the principa l investigator of potential 
risk/benefit ratio. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In instances where one drug has to be discontinued 
transiently because  of safety, the administration of the other drug may continue as schedu led. If the drug that is held 
can resume at a later time, no doses will be made up and the 
administration will follow the originally defined schedule calendar according to the drug that was continued.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subsequent courses of [ADDRESS_681510] 4 cycles and/or in the presence of residual leukemia. 
 
If prolonged myelosuppression (more than 8 weeks) WITH 
evidence of a hypocellular marrow (marrow cellularity less than 5% without evidence of leukemia) is observed, 5- azacytadine and nivolumab OR 5-azacytidine wih nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] O R  5-azacytidine w i t h  nivolumab and venetoclax will be discontinued. Delays in start of subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only for patients who are deriving clinical benefit and after discussion with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_128870]/benefit  ratio.  If  the  peripheral  counts  do  not  recover 
(ANC <1 x10

administered at the discretion of the treating physician not 
earlier than 21 days after the prior cycle. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] For patients who discontinue therapy, the reason for treatment 
discontinuation will be captured.

on trial after discussion with t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_525199] r easons for continuation and 
potential benefit/risk profile for the patient must be 
clearly documented in the medical records. In the 
expansion phase (part b), DLT will not be monitored. We will perform continuous safety monitoring every 5 patients for “drug-related non-hematological Grade 3/4 AE’s.”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose modifications other than the ones mentioned above 
can be considered after discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_525200]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical trial update: The safe dose of 5-azacytidine and 
nivolumab has been established as 5-azacytidine 75mg/m2 
days 1-7 and nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg on days 1 and 14 of each 
cycle in the ongoing clinical trial. 1/6 patients experienced a DLT   at   this   dose   during   the   safety-run-in   phase.   All 
subsequent patients (including relapsed/refractory AML and 
newly diagnosed elderly AML) will receive this dose of 5- 
azacytidine and nivolumab. For the 5-azacytidine with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525201]-
in phase will be used to treat both salvage and frontline patients. For the 5-azacytidine with nivolumab and venetoclax the MTD/RP2D established from the lead-in part a (Table 5C) 
will be used to treat both salvage patients and frontline patients in the expansion part B:  see “statistics” section for 
more details.

interrupt nivolumab and/or venetoclax therapy, nivolumab 
and/or venetoclax administration can be transiently discontinued and re-started as per guidelines in section 6.0.  
 
 
5.3.0 Dose Adjustments  
 
Toxicity Directly Attributable to Study Drugs 
 
Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity  directly attributable to the study 
drugs should temporarily stop treatment according to the guidelines in the dose adjustment schema. 
 
5.3.1 Nivolumab, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Venetoclax and 5-azacytidine dose 
adjustments for hematological drug- related adverse events (AE):  
 
Dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation decisions should be based on the 
CTCAE version 4.0 (Appendix C) of the toxicity and the guidelines provided below. 
 
 Patients with acute leukemia’s usually present with abnormal peripheral blood counts at the time therapy is started and myelosuppression is an 
expected event during the course of therapy for acute leukemia’s. Thus, no dose adjustments or treatment interruptions for myelosuppression 
 
 
will be planned for the first 4 cycles and/or in the presence of residual 
leukemia. After that, treatment interruptions and dose adjustments may 
be considered according to the followi ng guidelines only when there is 
no evidence of active leukemia (e.g., only if <5% blasts in the bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_525287]-cytometry or cytopenias not considered to be related to leukemia). 
 
 Patients with a response (no marrow evidence of leukemia) and 
pre-cycle counts of neutrophils >1x109/L and platelets >50 
x109/L who have sustained low counts of neutrophils <0.5 
x109/L or a platelet count <20 x 109/L for more than [ADDRESS_681514] the treatment 
with 5-azacytidine and/or venetoclax interrupted at the discretion of the treating physician after discussing with the

x109/L. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525203]/or thrombocytopenia in prior studies 
and should generally not be interrupted or discontinued for 
myelosuppression.

 If there are persistent peripheral blood blasts, or the bone 
marrow shows >5% blasts or evidence of leukemia by [CONTACT_4133], treatment may be continued regardless of neutrophil and platelet count with supportive care as needed. Dose-interruptions of 5- azacytidine a n d / o r  v e n e t o c l a x  in these patients should be considered on an individual case and discussed with the PI. 
 
 Patients with a resp onse (no marrow evidence of leukemia) and 
pre-cycle counts of neutrophils <1x109/L and platelets <50 
x109/L may be continued regardless of neutrophil and platelet 
count with supportive care as needed. Dose-interruptions of 
5- azacytidine a n d / o r  v e n e t o c l a x  in these patients 
should be considered on an individual case and discussed 
with the PI. 
 
 Investigators should, whenever possible, determine which 
medication is causing the toxicity and interrupt or dose reduce 5-azacytidine and/or venetoclax  and/or interrupt nivolumab 
and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143793], as a pplicable. No dose reductions 
are permitted for nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525204]2D is established. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525205]/or thrombocytopenia in prior studies and should generally not be interrupted or discontinued for myelosuppression. 
 
5.3.2 Nivolumab, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Venetoclax and 5-azacytidine dose adjustments for non-hematologic drug- related AEs  
Investigators should, whenever possi ble, determine which medication is 
causing the toxicity and interrupt or  dose reduce 5-azacytidine and/or 
venetoclax or interrupt nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143793], as applicable. No dose reductions (only interruptions ) are permitted for nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].   Dose reductions of azacitidine will be as follows:  Baseline dose level: 
75 mg/m^2 x 7 days, dose level -1 of azacitidine: 50 mg/m^2 x 7 days, 
dose level -2: 37.5 mg/m^2 x 7 days, dose level -3: 25 mg/m^2 x 7 days. 
Further reductions or modifications  to schedule beyond what is shown 
above or alternative reductions (e.g.  75mg/m2 x 5 days) may be allowed 
if deemed in the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_510509]. 
 Dose reductions of venetoclax will be as follows: Baseline dose level 
of venetoclax: 400mg, dose level -1 of venetoclax: 200mg, dose level -
2: 100mg, dose level -3, 50mg. Altern atively, the duration of venetoclax 
administration can be decreased (e.g. decrease from 21-days per cycle to 
14-day per cycle to 10 days per cycl e) rather the dose being reduced.

 Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or in tercurrent illness, which in the 
judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
 Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525210] 
(only dose delays when indicated). 
 
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab (Arm 1 and 3) or nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Arm 2) with study drug  when the drug-related AE(s) resolve 
to Grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
 Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue 
 Subjects who have not ex perienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may 
resume treatment in the presen ce of Grade 2 skin toxicity 
 Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea , or colitis, must have resolved to 
baseline before treatment is resumed 
 Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately  controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement may resume treatment 
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart 
treatment at the next scheduled time point per protocol. However, if the 
treatment is delayed past the next sche duled timepoint per protocol, the next 
scheduled timepoint will be delayed until dosing resumes. Patients who receive combination therapy in whom continuation of 5-azacytidine and/or 
venetoclax is considered to be inadequa te, or inappropriate (e.g., because of 
pancytopenia) can discontinue 5-azacytid ine and/or venetoclax and continue 
with nivolumab only. 
 
If treatment is delayed > [ADDRESS_681521] be permanently discontinued from study therapy, exce pt as specified in discontinuation 
section. Delays in start of subsequent  cycles greater than 8 weeks will be 
acceptable only for patients who are deriving clinical benefit and after

 neurological) are provided in Appendix G. These gene ral guidelines constitute 
guidance to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_525211]. 
 
5.3.6 CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dose modifications 
Venetoclax 
-Venetoclax should be administered at 50% dose 
reduction in the setting of moderate CYP3A inhibitor 
and at 75% dose reduction in the setting of strong 
CYP3A inhibitor for the duration of co-administration. The dose will be reduced by 75% if patient is on posaconazole.   -In the event the co-administered CYP3A inhibitor is 
discontinued, the assigned venetoclax dose should 
be resumed 2-3 days after discontinuation.  -Every effort should be made to adhere venetoclax dose reduction. Variations in schedule of events such 
as late/missed interventions that do not affect the 
rights and safety of the patient will not be considered as deviations.    
5.3.7 Tumor Lysis Prophylaxis (TLS) 
-The venetoclax dose titration scheme utilized in the AML studies performed to date to mitigate the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) will be empl oyed. All patients will be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525212] 1 of treatment initiation and until 24 hours 
after the completion of venetoclax dose escalation. During cycle 
1, venetoclax will be dose escalated daily to the goal dose of 400mg daily.  Patients will receive 100mg on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2 and 400mg on Day 3 and onwards, or adjusted dose if on concomitant azoles (discussed below in section 6.3).  
 
-To mitigate the risk for TLS, subjects must be receiving tumor lysis prophylaxis, including hydration (oral, intravenous) and treatment with a uric acid reducing agent (allopurinol, rasburicase) prior to start of venetoclax and at least during the first cycle of therapy.  
 
-TLS chemistry tests (potassium, uric acid, creatinine, calcium and phosphorus) will be obtained prior to dosing and 5-[ADDRESS_681528]’s next dose to ensure appropriate management. If 
a subject meets criteria for clinically significant laboratory or clinical TLS, no additional venetoclax should be administered until resolution.  
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 58 of 99 
 -Venetoclax interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (< 
48 hours) chemical changes and laboratory TLS will be allowed and will not require a dose reduction.  
5.3.8 Meals and Dietary Requirements: 
-Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with approximately [ADDRESS_681529] had dose-reductions 
due to hematological or non-hematological toxicity:  
Once the MTD has been established in the lead-in, the nivolumab dose 
(Arm 1 or 3) or nivolumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102334] (Arm 2) will not be reduced or escalated during the phase II portion. Intra-patient dose re-escalation of 5-azacytidine and/or venetoclax will be permitted provided: 
 
 Patient has completed >/=1 cycle at their current dose level 
 
 Patient has not experienced any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic 
drug-related toxicity, and 
 
 Patient has not experienced drug-related hematologic DLT, and 
 
 At least [ADDRESS_681530] 28 days without experiencing DLT. 
 
 The dose may be escalated by [CONTACT_525288] (per section 
5.3.2) provided such dose level does not exceed the established 
MTD or dose level 0, whichever is lower. Dose level 0 (Table 5A, 5B, 5C) is the maximum dose allowed on this study. No dose escalation beyond dose level 0 will be permitted. 
 
5.3.10 Modifications of dose schedules other than the above will be allowed within the 
following guidelines: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Further dose reductions can be made to keep clinically significant toxicities grade < 2. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose adjustments by [CONTACT_726] 1 dose level at a time (e.g., from 5-azacytidine 
75 mg/m2 to 25 mg/m2) can be considered when judged in the best interest of 
the patient (e.g. severe myelosuppression) when toxicity has resolved. The 
reason for this reduction must be di scussed and approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681531]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] A patient who has had a dose reduction because of any of the reasons 
mentioned above may have their dose escalated provided the patient has remained free of toxicity requiring dose  adjustments as defined above for at 
least 1 month. Escalation will be made by 1 dose-level increment only, and not more frequent than every month. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment interruptions and dose modifications other than the ones mentioned above can be considered after discussion and approval by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_525195].. Dose adjustment/delay of only one of the agents is permissible if the toxicity is most likely judged to be 
related to one of the agents by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis or autoimm une hepatitis this would be likely 
secondary to nivolumab or nivolumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], in patients with cytopenia’s this would be likely secondary to 5-azacytidine or venetoclax). 
 
5.4   Duration of Therapy  
In  the  absence  of  treatment  delays  due  to  adverse  events,  treatment  may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
1. Clinically significant progressive disease, or 
 
2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, or 
 
3. Patient request, or 
 
4. General or  specific  changes  in  the  patient's  condition  render  the  patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator, or 
 
5. Unacceptable toxicity that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_525213]. 
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_681532] on e dose of any of the two drugs will be 
considered evaluable for toxicity. 
 
5.5 Supportive Care:  
Supportive care measures including blood products, infection prophylaxis and 
growth factors will be administered according to institutional and Leukemia 
Department guidelines.

general principle is that differential di agnoses should be di ligently evaluated 
according to standard medical practice. Non- inflammatory etiologies should 
be considered and appropriately treated. Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno-oncology drug-rel ated adverse events, and nivolumab 
o r  i p i l i m u m a b  no exception. The or al equivalent of the recommended 
IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low-grade 
toxicities. The lower bioavailability of  oral corticosteroids should be taken 
into account when switching to the equiva lent dose of oral  corticosteroids. 
 
 
Management Algorithms have been de veloped to assist investigators in 
assessing and managing the following groups of adverse events: 
Endocrinopathy, Gastrointestinal, Hepatic, Neurological Pulmonary, 
Renal and Skin . These algorithms are found in the “Nivolumab Investigator 
Brochure” (Appendix E), Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002] (Appendix J) and 
“Management algorithms for immuno-onc ology drug-related adverse events” 
(Appendix G) of this protocol. The guidance provided in these algorithms should not replace the Investigator’s medical judgment but should complement it. 
 
Finally, consultation with a medical or su rgical specialist, especially prior to 
an invasive diagnostic or  therapeutic procedure, is highly recommended. 
 
 
5.6  Concomitant Medications:  
Consistent with subject safety and comfort, administration of any prescription 
or over-the-counter drug products other than study medication should be 
minimized during the study period. Subjects should be discouraged from use of street drugs, herbal remedies, self-prescribed drugs, tobacco products, or excessive alcohol during the clinical study. 
 
If considered necessary for the subject’s wellbeing, drugs for concomitant medical conditions or for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator’s de cision to authorize the use of any drug 
other than study drug should take into account subject safety, the medical need, 
the potential for drug interactions, the possibility for masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether use of the drug will compromise the outcome or integrity of the study. 
 
Subjects should be instructed about the importance of the need to inform the 
clinic staff of the use of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over-the-

 counter, or illicit) before and during the course of the study. 
 
Recommendations with regard to specif ic types of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
supportive care; diet and other interventions are as follows: 
 
Concomitant medications are recommended as prophylaxis for nausea, 
vomiting, and infections, and are allowed for managing myelosuppression as shown in Table 8. Myelosuppression is e xpected in patients with AML due to 
underlying disease, as well as due to chemotherapy (such as 5-azacytidine and venetoclax), or both. Most patients have neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both at study entry. Significant or life-threatening myelosuppression may be managed with growth factor support and blood transfusion according to institutional standard of care, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Practice Guidelines, and/or NCCN Practice Guidelines. 
 
 
Infections secondary to myelosuppression are common in patients with AML, 
and may be related to underlying disease, chemotherapy, or both. Therefore, 
the use of prophylactic antibiotics, anti fungal agents, and antiviral agents is 
recommended according to institutional standards. 
 
Since the effect of both nivolumab and 5-azacytidine may be delayed, patients 
with high WBC counts may receive hydroxyurea and up to 1 dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m
2) prior to study entry. Hydroxyurea is allowed before 
the start of study therapy and during the study treatment. Hydrea and cytarabine use would be recorded in the CRF. Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy fo r controlled CNS disease is permitted. 
With the exception of these agents, co ncomitant systemic chemotherapy or 
concurrent radiation ther apy for other (non AML) ca ncers should be discussed 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_525217] a case-by-case  basis. Subjects 
are not allowed to participate concurrently in any other therapeutic clinical study. 
 
Subjects may be receiving systemic corticosteroids (daily doses ≤ 10 mg of 
prednisone or equivalent if indicate d for adrenal replacement or antiemetic 
therapy), topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], or inhaled corticosteroids at study enrollment. They may receive systemic, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, or enteric corticosteroids while on study 
without limitation if they develop co nditions that require  corticosteroid 
therapy; such subjects are not require d to discontinue study participation. 
 
All ongoing medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including herbal products, nutritional supplements, and nontraditional medications) at screening will be considered prior medications. Concomitant medica tion data will not be collected or 
entered into the case report form other than hydrea and cytarabine as mentioned above; however, the subject’s medication record will contain a list 
of concomitant medications. If a pr ohibited medication is inadvertently 
administered/ taken by [CONTACT_102], the patient may remain on study as long as the prohibited medication is discontinued as soon as feasible. If a prohibited 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 62 of 99 
 medication is considered essential for th e patient well being, continuation on 
study with concomitant administration of such medication(s) will need to be 
discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_214058].  Investigational agents that are not used  for treatment of the leukemia per se 
(e.g. anti-infective prophylaxis or thera py) will be allowed. Other supportive 
care studies are allowed, even if under an IND.

 label fashion. Ten nivolumab vials (each 10 mL ) will be packaged within a carton. The 
vials are not subject specific although there wi ll be specific vial assignments by [CONTACT_525290]-supply. 
 
6.1.1 Dose Calculation of nivolumab  
Total dose should be calculated as in the following example: 
 
Subject’s actual body weight in kg x MTD in mg = total dose in mg 
 
For example, a subject weighing 70 kg who is scheduled receive a dose of 3 mg/kg would 
be administered 210 mg of nivolumab (70 kg x 3 mg/kg = 210 mg). 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_681533] storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance 
with the environmental conditio ns (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by 
[CONTACT_525291]. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study 
drug arise, do not dispense the study drug and contact [CONTACT_8650]. 
 
Investigational product documentation must be maintained that includes all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, stor age temperatures, reconstitution, and use of 
required processes (e.g. required diluents, administration sets). 
 
 
 
Nivolumab vials must be stored at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C and should be protected 
from light. If stored in a gl ass front refrigerator, vials sh ould be stored in the carton. 
Recommended safety measures for preparation and handling of nivolumab include laboratory coats and gloves. 
 
For details on prepared drug storage and use time of nivolumab under room temperature/light and refrigeration, please refer to the Investigator Brochure section for “Recommended Storage and Use Conditions”. Care  must be taken to assure sterility of 
the prepared solution, as the product does not contain any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. No incompatibilities between nivolumab and polyolefin bags have been observed. 
 
Nivolumab is to be administered as an approximately 60 minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2/0.22 micron in-line filter at the protocol-specified dose. Variations in infusion times due to minor differences in IV bag overfill/underfill and institutional procedure on flushing chemothe rapy lines will not result in protocol 
deviation. All infusion times are considered approximate . The drug can be diluted with 
0.9% normal saline for delivery but the total drug concentration of the solution cannot be 
below 0.35 mg/ml. It is not to be administer ed as an IV push or bolus injection. At the 
end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline. 
 
6.1.3 Administration of nivolumab  
Patients will receive nivolumab as an approximately 60 minute IV infusion on Day 1 and

Page 64 of 99 
 day 14 (+/-3 days) of a treatment cycle every 28 days for 4 cycles or until CR (whichever 
occurs earlier) followed by a maintenance regimen (one dose of nivolumab on day 1 of each cycle of 5-azacytidine). Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at the start of each cycle as descri bed above. All doses should be rounded to the 
nearest milligram. The screening body weight may be used for dosing of cycle 1. 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_681534] infusion patient vital sign s should be monitored prior to dosing, 
approximately every 30 minutes after the initiation of the infusion, and up to 
approximately 60 minutes after the completion of the infusion , or longer if indicated, until 
the vital signs normalize or return to baseline.  For subsequent infusions, vital signs should 
be collected prior to dosing, and at the completion of the infusion. If the patient 
experiences and infusion  reaction, the patient will be monitored up to 60 minutes after the 
completion of the infusion, or lo nger if indicated, until the vita l signs normaliz e or return 
to baseline. A+/- [ADDRESS_681535] w ith fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, 
pruritis, arthralgia’s, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All 
Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical 
Monitor and reported as an SAE if criteria ar e met. Infusion reactions should be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) guidelines. 
 
 
Treatment recommendations for nivolumab related infusion reactions are provided below 
and may be modified based on MD Anderson treatment standards and guidelines, as 
appropriate: 
 
For Grade 1 symptoms (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated): Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen [ADDRESS_681536] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g. antihistamines, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroid s, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours): 
 
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of  the original infusion rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue af ter 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 
100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor su bject closely. If symptoms recur then no 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681537] be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/ or acetaminophen [ADDRESS_681538] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms [Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged (i.e. not 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12258] (e.g. renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates), Grade 4: life- threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated]: 
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivoluma b. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, 
and treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that th e symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Institutional guide lines will be followed for the treatment of 
anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. In 
the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g. appearance of a localized or 
 
 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treat ment), symptomatic treatment may be given 
(e.g. oral antihistamine or corticosteroids). 
 
For further details regarding dose-calculation  of nivolumab, preparation and dispensing 
of nivolumab, administration of nivolumab, patient monitoring during infusion and treatment of nivolumab related infusion reac tions please see the dosing procedure manual 
(Appendix I). 
 
6.2 Azacytidine:  
 
5-azacytidine will be commercially obtained. Standard procedures should be used for preparation and administration of 5-azacytid ine. The following guidelines are suggested: 
 
Vidaza® (5-azacytidine) (is a cytotoxic drug and, as with other potentially toxic 
compounds, caution should be exercised when handling and preparing Vidaza® (5- azacytidine) suspensions. 
 
If reconstituted Vidaza® (5-azacytidine ) comes into contact [CONTACT_8124], 
immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water.  If it comes into contact [CONTACT_525292], flush thoroughly with water. 
 
The Vidaza® (5-azacytidine) vial is single-use and does not contain any 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681539] any unused portions for later administration. 
 
6.2.1 Preparation for Subcutaneous Administration: Vidaza® (5- 
azacytidine) should be reconstituted as eptically with [ADDRESS_681540] ed slowly into the vial.  Vigorously 
shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved.  The 
suspension will be cloudy. The resu lting suspension will contain 5- 
azacytidine 25 mg/mL. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration: 
Doses greater than [ADDRESS_681541] be admini stered within 1 hour after 
reconstitution. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration:  The 
reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a 
syringe. Doses greater than [ADDRESS_681542] be refrigerated immediately, and may be held under refrigerated conditions (2ºC–8ºC, 36ºF– 46ºF) for up to 8 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration. 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subcutaneous Administration: To provide a homogeneous 
suspension, the contents of the syringe must be re-suspended 
by [CONTACT_390220] 2–3 times and vigorously rolling the syringe between the palms for approximately 30 seconds immediately prior to administration. Vidaza® (5-azacytidine) suspension is administered subcutaneously. Doses greater than 4 mL should be divided equally into 2 syringes and injected into 2 separate sites. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least [ADDRESS_681543]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspension Stability : 5-azacytidine reconstituted for 
subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 1 hour at 25°C (77°F) or for up to 8 hours between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F). 
 
6.2.2 Preparation for Intravenous Administration: Reconstitute the 
appropriate number of Vidaza® (5-a zacytidine) vials to achieve the 
desired dose. Reconstitute each vial wi th 10 mL sterile water for injection. 
Vigorously shake or roll the vial  until all solids are dissolved.  The 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine

7.3.10 For patients that remain on study with  no significant toxicity for more than 
6 months, subsequent evaluations during study may be modified after discussion with the principal investig ator.  These include a decrease in 
frequency of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_307774] 6-12 months (or as clinically indicated), correlative studies to every 6-12 months (or 
suspension of sample collection for co rrelative studies), other laboratory 
tests to once every cycle. 
 
7.3.11 ALL treatments with nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525223] . The first cycle of azacytidine must be fully 
administered at the MDACC outpatient clinic. Starting cycle #2, patients will 
have the option of receiving 5-azacytidine injections or infusions at the 
MDACC outpatient clinic or local ambulatory treatment center. We do not 
intend for the subjects to receive the nivolumab or the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525224]’s office at any time on the study.  During the first cycle 
all the laboratory evaluations will be done at MDACC. Subsequently, the 
patient may have the laboratory work done at a local clinic and the results reported to the research nurse for the study. The laboratory work done at the local clinic will be forwarded to  the patient’s attending physician at 
MDACC or PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966], who will sign  off on the labs to verify that the 
results have been reviewed. Patient s hould have end of cycle visit here at 
MDACC and/or prior to starti ng next cycle (+/- 4 days).

hEOS visitis include a physical examination, CBC with differential and platelets and a limited chemistry 
profile (total bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGPT or  SGOT). A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_525227]- response or progressive disease cannot be unequivocally diagnosed from peripheral blood. 
 
Data regarding adverse events will be collected during the study. Please see Appendix D 
regarding data capturing of adverse events and adverse events source documentation. 
Protocol specific data will be entered into  PDMS/CORe. PDMS/CORe will be used as  
the electronic case report form for this prot ocol. Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in 
the Case Report Form (CRF). The Principal In vestigator will sign and date the AE log per 
each patient at the completion of each course . Following signature, the AE log will be 
used as source documentation for the adverse events for attribution. 
 
Treatment may be discontinued for a variety of reasons, including patient withdrawal, investigator decision, and reasons specified by [CONTACT_760]. Reasons for discontinuation 
of treatments are described below. 
 
 
 
8.1 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE:  
 
Response Criteria for AML 
 
Response criteria will be modified fr om the International Working Group for 
AML [67]. Responders are patients who obtain a CR, CRi, or PR, with or without 
cytogenetic response, hematologic improvements, and morphologic leukemia-free state. Briefly, criteria are as follows: 
 
8.1.1 Complete remission (CR):  
 
 Peripheral blood counts: 
No circulating blasts Neutrophil count >/=1.0 x10
9/L 
Platelet count >/=100 x109/L 
 
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]: 
≤5% blasts 
No Auer rods 
No extramedullary leukemia 
 
8.1.2 Complete Remission with Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp):  
 
 
 
For patients to be classified as being in CRp, they must achieve CR 
except for incomplete platelet recovery (<100 × 109/L). 
 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 75 of 99 
 8.1.3 Complete remission with incomple te blood count recovery (CRi):  
 
 Peripheral blood counts:  
No circulating blasts 
Neutrophil count <1.0 x109/L, or 
Platelet count <100 x109/L 
 
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]:  
</= 5% blasts 
No Auer rods 
No extramedullary leukemia 
 
8.1.4 Partial remission : 
 All CR criteria if abnormal  before treatment except: 
 >/=50 % reduction in bone marrow blast but still >5% 
 
8.1.5 Morphologic leukemia-free state : 
 Bone marrow: </=5% myeloblasts 
 
8.1.6 Hematologic  Improvement  (HI):   Hematologic  response  must  be 
described by [CONTACT_511803]. 
 
 
 Erythroid response (E) (pretreatment Hgb <11 g/dL) 
Hgb increase by >/=1.5 g/dL 
 
 Platelet response (P) (pretreatment platelets <100 x109/L) 
Absolute increase of >/=30 x 109/L for patients starting with > 20 x 
109/L platelets 
Increase from < 20 x 109/L to > 20 x 109/L and by [CONTACT_2669] 100% 
 
 
 Neutrophil response (N) (pretreatment ANC <1.0 x109/L) 
At least 100% increase and an absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L 
 
 Blast response (B)  
>/=50% reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts but still >5% 
 
9 DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT:  
 
9.[ADDRESS_681555] udy treatment for the following reasons: 
1. Patient requests discontinuation. 
2. Unacceptable toxicity that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the investigator makes it unsafe to 
continue therapy. 
3. Clinically significant progressive disease. 
4. Investigator discretion. 
 
9.1.4 Follow-Up at Treatment Discontinuation or Early Withdrawal  
Patients who discontinue treatment for any reason should complete end-of-treatment 
procedures when possible. End of treatm ent procedures will include a physical 
examination, CBC with differential and plat elets and a limited chemistry profile (total 
bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGPT or SGOT). A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_525228]-response or progressive disease cannot be unequivocally diagnosed from peripheral blood. Although treatm ent will be discontinued at that time, all 
patients who do not withdraw consent for follow-up, die, or become lost to follow-up, will remain on study for follow-up evaluations. Subject will be followed for toxicity for  
at least [ADDRESS_681556] protocol treatment. The 30-day follow-up visit (+ or – 3 days) will be scheduled as a clinic vis its for clinical evaluation and physical 
examinations. If the patient cannot make it to the MDACC clinic for this visit, the 
required follow up treatment procedures may be done with a local physician and the records forwarded to MDACC. The research nurse will contact [CONTACT_525297] a verbal assessment of the patient’s condition. The phone conversation will then 
be documented in the patient’s charts. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_681557] ing terminating the study, 
temporarily suspending enrollment, or stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_525229]. 
Reasons for terminating the clinical study or a study site’s particip ation include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 
 The incidence or severity of an adverse re action related to treatment in this study 
or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients 
 Data recording is significan tly inaccurate or incomplete 
 Study site personnel are noncompliant with study procedures
 
 Pattern of noncompliance is observed

 safety or clinical activity. A protocol deviation is a departure from the protocol that does 
not meet the above criteria. Protocol violations or deviations may be grouped into the following classes: 
 Enrollment criteria 
 Study activities (missed evaluations or visits) except for those allowed per 
protocol 
 Noncompliance with dose or schedule, including dose calculation, administration, 
interruption, reduction, or delay; or discontinuation criteria 
 Investigational product handling, including storage and accountability 
 Informed consent and ethical issues 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_681559] a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to  a drug which is noxious and unintended 
and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or 
therapy of disease or for the modification of physiologic function. 
 
Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fundamental to the understanding of adverse drug reactions. In  general, a drug may be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the event would not have happened at all, 2) the event would have occurred later than it actually did, or 3) the event would have been less severe. 
 
The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the trial. 
 
10.2 Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the latest CTC version 4 
(Appendix C) and documented in medical record.  Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  Expected events during leukemia therapy are:

will be captured on the Leukemia AE log as well as entered in the CRFs, 
regardless of expectedness. 
 
10.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an 
adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525232] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropri ate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_223857], IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the cond uct of a protocol and meeting the 
definition of a SAE must be reported  to the IRB in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institu tional Review Board Policy for 
Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or 
 
 
unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution 
(within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
 
 All life-threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page [ADDRESS_681561] a written report submitted within 24 hours (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in 
the IND Office. 
 
 
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to  the IND Office and MDACC IRB. 
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol- 
specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_681562] retu rned to baseline, progression of the 
event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events  that occur after the [ADDRESS_681563] be re ported to the IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 Serious adverse events will be forw arded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] 
(Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_192807], 
Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy  
 
10.[ADDRESS_681564] be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety  
 All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to nivolumab and all pregnancies 
must be reported to BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within 
24 hours. 
 All SAEs should be reported via confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission, 
or scanned and reported via electronic mail to: 
SAE Email Address : [EMAIL_176] 
SAE Fax Number : [PHONE_188] 
 
11.1 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This will be a phase II, three parallel arm, open-label, non-randomized study with a safety 
lead-in phase.  
 
 
11.2 Sample Size 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 81 of 99 
  
Arm 1:  
Part a. Lead-in phase  
The primary objective of the lead-in phase is to determine the safety of nivolumab in 
combination with 5-azacytidine in patients with  refractory/ relapsed AML. Up to 30 patients 
will be accrued into the lead-in part of the study. 
 
Part b. Expansion phase  
A. Up to 70 patients (including 6 patients treated at the MTD from the lead-in part) with 
relapsed/refractory AML will be recr uited for the Arm 1 Salvage cohort . 
  B. Up to 40 newly diagnosed older AML patients (age ≥ 65) will be recruited for the Arm  
1 Frontline older cohort . 
 Arm 2:  
Part a. Lead-in phase The primary objective of the lead-in phase is to determine the safety of nivolumab with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_246695] 5-azacytidine in patients with refractory/ relapsed AML. Up to 
24 patients will be accrued into the lead-in part of the study. 
 Part b. Expansion phase 
A. Up to 54 patients (including 6 patients tr eated at the MTD from the lead-in part) with 
relapsed/refractory AML will be recruited for the Arm 2
 Salvage cohort. 
B. Up to 30 newly diagnosed older AML patients (age ≥ 65) will be recruited for the Arm 
2 Frontline older cohort. 
The efficacy of the combinatio n will be measured by [CONTACT_147447] (ORR), 
defined as CR (complete remission) + CRp (complete remission with incomplete platelet 
recovery) + CRi (complete remission with in complete count recovery) + PR (partial 
response) + marrow clearance of blasts + hematologic improvement (HI) in platelets, 
hemoglobin, or ANC within 3 months of treatm ent initiation among adult patients with 
refractory/ relapsed AML AND newly diagnosed older patients with AML. ORR and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the extension by [CONTACT_210872] (1998). 
 
Arm 3:  
Part a. Lead-in phase 
The primary objective of the lead -in phase is to determine the safety of nivolumab with 5-
azacytidine and venetoclax in patients with refr actory/ relapsed AML. A total of 18 patients (3 
dose levels with a maximum of 6 patients at eac h dose level) will be accrued into the lead-in 
part of the study.  
Part b. Expansion phase 
A. A total of 30 patients (excluding 6 patient s treated at the MTD from the lead-in part) 
with relapsed/refractory AML will be recruited for the Arm 3Salvage cohort. B. A total of 30 newly diag nosed older AML patients (age ≥ 65) will be recruited for the 
Arm 3 Frontline older cohort. 
 
Once safety of the MTD has been established, any patients still on study at a dose lower 
than MTD can be dose escalated up to MTD. Pa tients treated in the lead-in phase at MTD 
Nivolumab  and azacytidine    
Page 82 of 99 
 will be included in the Phase II portion of the study. 
 The efficacy of the combinatio n will be measured by [CONTACT_147447] (ORR), 
defined as CR (complete remission) + CRp (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with in complete count recovery) + MLFS within 6 
months of treatment initiation among adult pa tients with refractory/ relapsed AML AND 
newly diagnosed older patients with AM L. ORR and toxicity will be monitored 
simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the extension by [CONTACT_210872] (1998). 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_681565] dose level with < [ADDRESS_681566] 28 days of treatment. DLT is defined in section 5.2.2. The dosing schema for the combination treatment during the lead in pha se is shown in Tables 5 and 5B in section 
5.2.1. 
 
Part b. Expansion phase  
 
A. Arm 1 Relapsed/Refractory AML cohort (Aza+Nivo) (N=70: completed accrual 
and closed to accrual)
 
Historical data on similar patients show  a ORR of 10-15%. The target ORR with the 
experimental treatment is 30%. This regi men of the combination treatment will be 
considered worthy of further investigation if  it elicits an increase  in ORR to 30% with 
acceptable toxicity.  A >30% drug-related grade 3/4 toxicity rate is considered unacceptable. Thus, interim monitoring rules, assuming the prior distributions below, were constructed that meet the following two conditions, 
 
1) Stop if Prob{ p(ORR,E )<p(ORR,H) + 0.15 | data} > 0.99, or 
 
2) Stop if Prob{ p(TOX,E)>0.30| data}>0.95, 
 
Where P(ORR, E) and P(TOX, E) are the true  ORR and toxicity rates for the combination 
treatment, and p(ORR, H) is the true ORR rate  of the standard treatment. The first rule 
provides for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525233] (i.e., probability < 1%) 
that ORR rate of the combination treatment is greater than the ORR rate of standard 
treatment by 15.0%. The second condition will stop the study early if excessive therapy- related grade 3/4 toxicity (>30%) is highly probable (i.e., probability >95.0%) for the combination treatment.  Monitoring for toxici ty and futility will not begin until [ADDRESS_681567] 6 patients.

Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1.0) was used to generate the toxicity and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304470] (Table 11). In order to utilize the software for the design, a 
15% constant rate and beta(0.3, 1.7) priors were assumed for the standard treatment response distribution and experimental treatment response prior distribution, respectively. In addition, a 30% toxicity constant rate and be ta (0.6, 1.4) priors were assumed for the 
standard treatment toxicity constant rate and experimental treatment toxicity prior distribution, respectively. 
 
 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525234] 30% and the true toxicity rate was 30% was 24.7%.  Probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525235] (i.e., 50%) were 97.5% when the true ORR was 30% and 99.6% when true ORR rate was 15%.

Historical data on similar patients show an ORR of 18-25% [the historical response rate in 
older newly diagnosed AML ( ≥65 years) with single agent hypomethylator therapy (5- 
azacytidine or decitabine) in three large randomized phase II trials was 17.5 % with 
decitabine alone in patients with AML (Kan tarjian et al., JCO 2012), 18% with azacytidine 
alone in patients with AML and blasts 20-3 0% (Fenaux et al., JCO 2010), and 27.8% with 
azacytidine alone in patients with AML and blasts >30% (Dombret et al., Blood 2015)]. The target ORR with the experimental treatmen t is 40%. This regimen of the combination 
treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation if it elicits an increase in ORR 
to 40% with acceptable toxicity. A >30% drug-r elated grade 3/4 toxicity rate is considered

Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1.0) was used to generate the toxicity and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304470] (Table 14). In or der to utilize the software for the design, a

response distribution and experimental treatment response prior distribution, respectively. In addition, a 30% toxicity constant rate and be ta (0.6, 1.4) priors were assumed for the 
standard treatment toxicity constant rate and experimental treatment toxicity prior distribution, respectively. 
 
 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525234] 30% and the true toxicity rate was 30% was 17.6%.  Probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525235] (i.e., 50%) were 86.5% when the true ORR was 40% and 93.1% when true ORR rate was 25%.

 Historical data on similar patients show an ORR of 12-15%. The target ORR with the 
experimental treatment is 30%. This regi men of the combination treatment will be 
considered worthy of further investigation if  it elicits an increase  in ORR to 30% with 
acceptable toxicity.  A >30% drug-related grade 3/4 toxicity rate is considered unacceptable. 
Thus, interim monitoring rules, assuming the prior distributions below, were constructed that meet the following two conditions,

 Historical data for salvage patients with azacit idine and venetoclax show an overall response rate 
(ORR) of 25-50% (DiNardo CD et al, American journal of hematology  2018; 93(3): 401-7;  Aldoss I et 
al, Haematologica. 2018 Sep;103(9):e404-e40;  Goldberg A et al, Blood  2017; 130(Suppl 1): 1353). 
It is expected for the current trial that the three-drug combination will improve the ORR by 35% while 
the toxicity rate is maintained at or below 30%. A sample size of 30 patients ensures that, if the trial 
is not terminated early, a posterior 90% credible in terval for ORR will have width of 0.[ADDRESS_681577], 
under the assumption of a 60% of ORR rate. The prior probabilities of ORR and toxicity for the experimental regimen are model ed by [CONTACT_525298] ( Beta (0.5, 1.5) and Beta (0.6, 1.4), 
respectively). Denoting the historical proportion of overall response rate and toxicity rate by 
{p(ORR,H) = 25% , p(TOX,H) = 30%}, the following decision criteria will be applied:

The Investigator is responsible for completing an efficacy/safety summary report, and submitting it to 
the IND Office Medical Affairs and Safety Group, for review and approval.  This should be submitted 
as follows: 
 
Lead-in Phase: Every 6 evaluable patients complete cycle 1 of  study therapy before advancing/changing dose 
levels.  
Expansion Phase: 
After the first 5 evaluable patients per cohort, complete 3 months of study treatment, and every 5 evaluable patients per cohort, thereafter.  
A copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder under 
“sponsor correspondence”. 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
All patients who received any dose of the stud y agent will be included in the analysis for 
efficacy and safety.  Demographic/clinical ch aracteristics (including duration of response) 
and safety data of the patients will be summari zed using descriptive sta tistics such as mean, 
standard deviation, median and range. For the primary efficacy analysis, we will estimate 
the ORR for the combination treatment, along with the 95% confidence interval. Patients 
who drop out of the study before completing all the cycles will be treated as “failures” for 
the primary analysis. Overall response rate (ORR) during the study period will also be 
presented with the 95% confidence interval . The association between ORR and patient’s 
clinical characteristics will be examined by [CONTACT_195463]’s rank sum test or Fisher’s exact test, 
as appropriate. Toxicity type, severity and attribution will be summarized for each patient 
using frequency tables. 
 
The distribution of time-to-event endpoints (DFS and OS) including overall survival and progression free survival w ill be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 
Comparisons of time-to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_525300]- rank tests. Paired t-tests will be used to de termine the immunological and molecular changes 
in the peripheral blood and bone marrow from baseline to the time of response, and to the 
time of disease progression. Correlation analysis  (such as logistic re gression analysis) will 
be conducted to determine the relationship be tween induction of hypomethylation / DNA 
damage and clinical response. 
 
 
 
Statistical analysis of biomarker data : Descriptive statistics including plots, mean, median 
and standard deviations will be used to summari ze data. For continuous  outcomes, t-test and 
ANOVA will be used to compare outcome m easures across patient characteristics. 
Dunnett’s and Tukey’s test that properly adjust for multiplicity in multiple tests will be 
implemented. Pair-wise comparisons will be pe rformed using pre- and post-therapy samples 
from each patient . The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the association between two categorical variables such as disease state and performance status.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol AI424451
Title of Study: Protocol AI424451 : A Prospective Single Arm, Open-Label, International, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy and Pharm acokinetics ofAtazanavir (ATV) Powder boosted with Ritonavir (RTV) 
with an Optimized NRTI Background Therapy, in HIV Infected, Antiretroviral, Naive and Experienced Pediatric 
Subjects from 3Months to Less Than 11Years. (Pediatric Atazanavir International Clinical Evaluation: the 
PRINCE IIstudy)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): ATV oral powder with RTV liquid (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only) at 
doses recommended per protocol. 
Subjects will receive ATV powder with RTV liquid (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only) 
once a day with food. 
Duration of treatment is dependent on a subject’s age, weight, and the timing with which a country receives 
approval and has availability for the pediatric indicat ion of a formulation whose requirements are met by [CONTACT_423].
ATV/RTV should be taken orally with food at approximately the same time of each day .
Two NRTIs must be locally approved for pediatric use and should be dosed as per the local country label. Study 
physicians will prescribe NRTIs based on viral resistance results, the local guidelines for ARV treatment and 
subject’s treatment history . Tenofovir is prohibited. 
Study Phase: 3b
Research Hypothesis: Regimens consisting of ATV powder boosted with RTV with an optim ized dual-NRTI 
backbone are safe and well tolerated in pediatric subjects 3 months to  yrs who are 5 kg to < 35 kg.
Prim ary Objective: To describe the safety of ATV pow der formulation boosted w ith RTV based HAART regimens 
in pediatric subjects dosed through a minimum of 24 weeks , as measured by [CONTACT_211014], serious adverse 
events and discontinuation due to AEs.
Secondary Objectives:
1)To describe efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_211015] a virologic response as defined by [CONTACT_211016] < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and < 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL by [CONTACT_211017]HIV-1 RNA Assay (version 1.5), or Abbott

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
3.1.1 Study Design
This study  is a prospective, internat ional, multicenter, non-randomized study  of a cohort of HIV 
infected pediatric subjects 3 months to  years of age and weight 5 kg to < 35 kg, treated 
with ATV powder and RTV optimized regimens. 
Subjects can be antiretroviral naive or experienced ( without prior exposure to ATV). Treatment 
experienced subjects are defined by a previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) through 
either prior treatment for their HIV disease or through a post natal treatment with 1 ARVs as 
part of a prevention ofmother to child transmission (PMTCT) program (in accordance with 
multiple guidelines: WHO, DHHS and South Africa PMTCT guidelines). For the purposes of 
this trial, subjects exposed to ARVs intra -uterine or peri-partum will not be considered treatment 
expe rienced (but are still eligible for the study). 
Nucleoside backbone therapy  will be determined by [CONTACT_211023]’s treatment history . It will consist 
of 2 NRTI s approved for pediatric use and dosed as per the local country  label (tenofovir will be 
excluded). Background NRTI s should remain unchanged through the duration of the study  unless 
changes are required for treatment -limiting NRTI toxicity . 
The choice of theswitched NRTI backbone has to be locall y approved for pediatric use and 
dosed as per the local country  label and will be determined by  [CONTACT_211024], susceptibility  profile of the NRTI s being considered, and 
local guidelines for treatment of HIV infected children.
A total of approximately 95 subjects will be treated with the ATV powder formulation boosted 
with RTV oral solution (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only)in order to 
have a minimum number of [ADDRESS_252286] 24 weeks follow -upon ATV powder 
formulation .In the event that the minimum number of subjects (overall and/or per weight band) 
with at least 24weeks follow -up is projected not to be metdue to higher than projected early 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Apr-[ADDRESS_252287] these subjects.
The study  consists of two stages (see Figure 3.1.1-1):
STAGE 1
In-clinic study  visits in Stage 1 will be at Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, then every  4 weeks through 
Week 16, then every  8 weeks through a minimum of 24 weeks or a maximum of 48 weeks. A 
“visit” done via the telephone is conducted after the first week of study  participation, primarily  to 
check in with the caregiver to ask how the subject is tolerating the stud y drug regimen.
Important assessments done during Stage 1 include but are not limited to:
A Week 2Intensive 24 hour PK samples will be collected only for subjects in Stage 1 who 
either enter the study  weighing 25 - < 35 kg and/or 6 to 11 years of age or those who 
grow into that weight or age range during Stage 1, or for subjects enrolling in a new 5 -
<10 kg cohort with 200 mg ATV and 80 mg RTV dose, (see Section 5.5.1 )
Malfunctions to the venous catheter, poor venous access, or other difficulties which 
would cause time point sample delay s may be cause for the reschedule of the Intensive 
PK visit ;
A PK Trough sample (Ctrough ) will be collected for all subjects for ATV and RTV (see 
Section 5.5.2) at each scheduled visit from Week 4 through a minimum of 24 weeks up 
through Week 48,
ECGs will be collected at each scheduled in-clinic visit for all subjects, and during the 
Intensive PK portion at Week 2 (pre-dose, 2.5, [ADDRESS_252288]-dose) for subjects weighing 
25 - < 35 kg and/or 6 to < 11 years of age or those who grow into that weight or age 
range during Stage 1, or for subjects enrolling in a new 5 - < 10 kg cohort with 200mg 
ATV and 80 mg RTV dose . 
It is important to note that all visits in Stage 1 (with the exception of Week 2 and Transition 
Visits) includ e a PK trough assessment, so it is of critical importance to instruct the caregivers 
that study  medication should NOT be administered on the day  of a study  visit, rather at the clinic 
after the blood draw has been completed.  An elapsed time from the previ ous dose of study 
medication to the draw of the blood for PK must be within a 20 -28-hour window.
Dosing of ATV in Stage 1 is performed only with the powder formulation, dosed according to 
weight, as outlined in Table 3.1.1 -1. When dosing with ATV powder, RTV oral solution is dosed 
at 80 mg for subjects weighing 5 to < 25 kg, and 100 mg RTV oral solution or 100 mg RTV 
tablets/capsules for subjects weighing 25 to < [ADDRESS_252289] has qualified by [CONTACT_211025] a higher weight band/higher dose, they will 
remain at that new dose regardless of an y subsequent weight loss.
BMS will require extra monitoring of subjects each time they transition to a higher weight 
band/higher dose of ATV. If a subject is moved to a higher weight band during Stage 1 on or 
after Week 16 (beyond which study  visits occur every  8 weeks), the subject will be required to

Subjects who reach the weight 35kg during Stage 1: Subjects must immediately enter Stage 2 
and be switched to the capsule formulation of ATV and the corresponding capsule/tablet formulation of RTV.
Subjects who do not reach the weight 35kg during Stage 1: Subjects continue on the powder

performed and will immediately move into Stage 2 while remaining on ATV powder. These 
subjects will follow then the assessments and in-clinic study visits specified in Stage 2.
STAGE 2
In-clinic study visits in Stage 2 will be conducted every 12 weeks through the end of study 
participation. 
Dosing of ATV in Stage 2 may include subjects taking ATV powder and subjects taking ATV 
capsules, dosed according to weight, as outlined in Table 3.1.1-1 and Table 3.1.1- 2, respectively. 
When dosing with ATV powder, RTV oral solution is dosed at 80mg if weight < 25 kg and is 
dosed at 100 mg RTV oral solution or 100 mg RTV tablets/capsules when weight is 25 -
< 35 kg. When dosing with ATV capsules, RTV (capsules/tablets) is dosed at 100mg.
Once a subject has qualified by [CONTACT_211025] a higher weight band/higher dose, they will 
remain at that new dose regardless of any subsequent weight loss.
BMS will require extra monitoring of subjects each time they transition to a higher weight 
band/higher dose of powder and capsules. If a subject is moved to a higher powder or capsule 
weight band during Stage 2, the subject will be required to return to the clinic for a weight band 
transition visit 4 weeks later.

ATV Powder-to-Capsule Transition :
Subjects who are transitioning from powder to capsules, either at entry to Stage 2 or at any point 
during Stage 2, will be required to return to the clinic for two subsequent powder-to-capsule 
transition visits 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the switch is initiated.
Dose of the ATV capsule will be determined by [CONTACT_8497], according to Table 3.1.1-2 ; RTV is 
dosed at 100mg (capsules or tablets) when dosing with the ATV capsule;
Subjects who are unable to swallow the ATV and RTV capsules/tablets by [CONTACT_2671] 
8-week transition period will be required to be discontinued from the study;
Subjects who complete a successful transition to ATV and RTV capsules/tablets will 
continue in Stage 2 and will be dosed according to the recommendations provided in Table 
3.1.1 -2. 
Subjects are required to switch to capsules in Stage 2 when they reach 35 kg and/or 12 years 
of age. However, subjects who reach a weight of 25 kg and/or 6 years of age during Stage 2 
may, at the discretion of the investigator and caregiver, choose to attempt switch to the solid 
dosage forms of ATV/RTV. Careful consideration should be given to the time of switch as subjects who are unable to swallow capsules after an 8-week transition period must be discontinued from Stage 2.
Stage 2 participation ends when:
A subject reaches the age of 18 years
A subject’s country has an approved and available pediatric indication whose requirements 
are met by [CONTACT_423]; the subject will then transition off of the study and will be dosed 
according to those local guidelines.
If an approved pediatric indication for ATV capsules becomes available for a subject who 
is dosing with the powder formulation, the powder-to-capsule transition will occur within 
the study within an 8-week timeframe as desc ribed above.  After the 8-week transition 
period, the subject will be discontinued from the study, regardless of tolerability of the capsule.
Subjects who are medically stable may be eligible for a post-study drug program to 
ensure continuity of care (for greater detail regarding the post-study drug program, please

A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information a bout the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigati onal product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
[CONTACT_20443]. 
In this protocol, investigational product(s) is/are: Atazanavir, and Ritonavir. Both will be 
provided as part of the study . Please refer to Table 4.1-[ADDRESS_252315](s) is/are: Any antiretroviral medication from the 
NRTI  class. NRTIs must be approved for pediatric use and should be dosed as per the local 
country  label. Study  physicians will prescribe NRTI s based on viral resistance results and 
subject’s treatment history . In cases where NRTI backbone therap y is not covered by [CONTACT_211033], government programs, etc, Bristol -Myers Squibb will provide treatment or reimburse 
for the cost of prescription therap y.

Report Form (CRF). This unique subject number must be used on all further documentation and 
correspondence referring to this particular subject.
For subjects who meet the protocol eligibility  criteria, the investigative staff will call the IVRS 
on Day 1 and subjects will be assigned to a dose of ATV/RTV appropriate to weight. It is the 
responsibility  of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_210978] a second call to the assignment center for confirmation of the appropriate dosage. It is 
important that the investigative staff reconf irm the subject’s willingness to continue in the trial 
prior to treatment administration. Once the dosage has been confirmed, study  medication should 
be initiated within [ADDRESS_252318] dose being given in the clinic at the Day  1 visit. Note: if, 
inorder to allow for timely  provisioning of study  medication by [CONTACT_211035] , it is necessary  to call IVRS in advance of the subject’s Day 1 visit (within 1day 
prior), this is acceptable and will not be considered a protocol deviation. All efforts should be 
made to call IVRS on Day 1, however, to limit the possibility  of enrolling subjects that do not 
start treatment. If a subject is enrolled but does not receive study  medication, the study  team 
must be notified immediately.
A minimum of 56treated subjects on ATV powder with at least [ADDRESS_252319] 24 weeks of follow -up from the 
following weight bands: 
Minimum 5 subjects (on 150 mg ATV powder and 80 mg RTV) between 5 - < 10 kg,

will be required to complete study  medication diaries through Stage 1 of the study . Caregivers 
should be provided with the medication diary  at the Day 1 visit, instructed on its completion, 
including the importance of making daily entries and bringing the diary  at each visit throughout 
Stage 1. Where feasible, the study  coordinator should make a telephone call to the caregiver in 
the interim period (eg, at Week 1) to provide further adherence support. Adherence will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_211038]’s caregivers, a sachet count and the review of a diary. In addition, periodic contact [CONTACT_211039]. The caregiver should be instructed to bring all unused study  medication back 
in the original container to each visit. Use of the study  medication diaries; will be used for all 
subjects.
Subjects remaining on ATV powder in Stage 2 are encouraged to continue using the study 
medication diaries. After the switch from the 10% aspartame ATV powder to the new 4.2% 
aspartame ATV powder in Stage 2, study medication diaries will be used as long as the subject is 
on the new 4.2% aspartame ATV powder or maximum duration of one year, whichever comes 
first. The caregiver should be inst ructed to continue bringing the diary at each visit.
4.5.1 Guidelines for the Management of Subjects with Rebound HIV RNA 
Levels Greater Than or Equal to 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL
This section provides clinical guidance for the management of subjects with virologic failure 
during the study . Laboratory  results must be confirmed with repeated testing before a final 
assessment of virologic treatment failure is made.
Virologic failure occurs as an incomplete virologic response to therapy  or as a viral rebound after 
virologic suppression is achieved.
Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined as:
Less than a 1 log10 drop from baseline in plasma HIV RNA level by [CONTACT_10585] 16(using the 
Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay, or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the [COMPANY_002] Amplicor 
assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV RNA), confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA 
level redrawn within 2 and 4 weeks from original sample; or

A plasma HIV RNA level > 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL after Week 24, confirmed by a second plasma 
HIV RNA level redrawn within 2 and 4 weeks from original sample; or 
Repeate d plasma HIV RNA level 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , or 
Abbott RealTime HIV -1 assay  after the [COMPANY_002] Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for measuring 
HIV RNA) after Week 48.
Viral rebound is defined as:
A plasm a HIV RNA level 400copie s/mL  (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay ,or Abbott 
RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the [COMPANY_002] Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV 
RNA) confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA level of 400copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  redrawn within 2 
and 4 weeks from original sample) at any time in a subject who had previously  achieved a 
plasma HIV RNA level < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL .
Subjects with a plasma HIVRNA level 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  and < 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  (using the 
Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the [COMPANY_002] Amplic or 
assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV RNA) followed by [CONTACT_211040] a viral blip and not a viral rebound. 
The subjects meeting the criteria for viral rebound or virologic failure at any time during the study 
will be managed as follows:
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of < 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  may continue on their assigned 
treatment and must have a repeat confirmatory  HIV RNA checked every  study  visit.
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  and < 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ mL may  remain on 
assigned treatment at the discretion of the investigator, in consultation with the BMS Medical 
Monitor. 
A viral resistance test will be conducted automatically  and the result forwarded to the site 
investigator.
Subjects with Genot ypic and / or Phenot ypic resistance to ATV/RTV and/or one or more 
assigned NRTI study drugs must be discontinued. 
Further management will be at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the 
BMS Medical Monitor.
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  must be discontinued from the 
study .
Those subjects with an incomplete virologic response defined as less than a 1log10 drop 
from baseline in plasma HIV RNA level by [CONTACT_10585] 16 (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , 
or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay after the [COMPANY_002] Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for 
measuring HIV RNA), confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA level redrawn within [ADDRESS_252331] be discontinued from the study .
Plasma samples for resistance testing will be collected at screening and at, or immediatel y after, 
a rebound or virologic failure. Samples will be submitted for immediate testing and the results

There are several important dates and times to record relative to the Intensive PK visit at Week 2, 
not only on the day of the actual visit, but also on the day prior to the visit, as well as the day 
after the visit is in itiated.
PK data is viable only  if the time elapsed between the dose taken prior to the sampling (taken on 
the day before the sampling) and the actual start of the Intensive PK blood sampling (the 0-hr 
blood draw) is between 20 - 28 hours.  In order to determine adherence to this window, data 
points collected on the CRF and on the laboratory  requisition are analy zed to calculate the 
elapsed time.

Important CRF data points
1.Date and Time* of Dose PRI OR TO the 0- hr PK blood draw 
a)This date and time should be the day  prior to the visit (20 -28 hours before the PK blood 
sampling is started).  If the subject was mistakenly  dosed on THE DAY OF the Intensi ve 
PK visit before they came to the clinic, then the 20 - 28- hour window cannot be applied 
and the Intensive PK visit should be rescheduled to occur as quickly  as possible. 
(Immediatel y notify  your BMS Site Manager.)
2.Date and Time* of Dose and light Meal A FTER the 0- hr PK blood draw
a)This is the date and time of the dose on THE DAY OF the Intensive PK visit. This dose 
must not be taken at home, rather AT the clinic visit and AFTER the 0-hr blood draw is

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Apr-[ADDRESS_252357]. (In ord er to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such event s include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled as SAEs for data 
transmission purposes (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscop y)

cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative).
6.1.[ADDRESS_252358]’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing. The investigator should report any SAE 
occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study  drugor protocol -
specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness . 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therap y, or a complication of a study  
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs must be recorded on the BMS SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a BMS Pregnancy  
Surveillance Form. These original BMS Forms are to remain on site. SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or designee) within 24 
hours via confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission, or scanned and re ported via electronic mail to:
SAE Email Address: Worldwide.Safet [EMAIL_4094]
SAE Facsimile Number: See Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): See Contact [CONTACT_211043].
If only  limited information is in itially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes availa ble, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.

6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug, or those that are present at the end of study  
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.[ADDRESS_252359] Abnormalities
The following laboratory  abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or 
SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  abnormali ty that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or 
interrupted
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term would be used 
by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
Females who may become sexually  active women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use 
an effective method of birth control during the course of the study , in amanner such that risk of 
failure is minimized. The definition of WOCBP is addressed in protocol Section 3.3.3. 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, 
including during at least [ADDRESS_252360] will 
be permanentl y discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, do se tapering if necessary  for subject 
safet y).Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663]  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures sh ould be considered if indicated.
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Apr-[ADDRESS_252361] immediately  notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_252362] be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form. 
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form.
Specific Information Related to ATV and Pregnancy
Atazanavir is classified by [CONTACT_211044]  “Category  B” (Animal reproduction 
studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well -
controlled studies in pregnant women.)
At maternal doses producing the s ystemic drug exposure levels equal to (in rabbits) or 2 times (in 
rats) those at the human clinical dose (400 mg once daily), ATV did not produce teratogenic 
effects. In the pre -and post -natal development assessment in rats, ATV, at maternally  toxic drug 
exposure levels [ADDRESS_252363] on 
reproductive performance of the offspring. In conclusion, ATV demonstrated no selective 
developmental toxicity  and no effects on reproductive function or fertility  in rats and/or rabbits at 
exposures that were at least equal to or slightly  greater than that observed in humans given 400 
mg once dail y.
Atazanavir has been evaluated in a limited number of women during pregnancy  and postpartum. 
In clinical trial AI424-182, ATV/RTV (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with 
zidovudine/lamivudine was administered to [ADDRESS_252364] trimester. The study  also assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral 
prophy lactic treatment (which did not include ATV) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the 
time of delivery  and/or during the first [ADDRESS_252365]- feed if they  are receiving ATV.
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Apr-[ADDRESS_252366] also be performed throughout the study  as specified in Section 5.1(see 
flow chart/time and events schedule) and the results of all pregnancy  tests (positive or negative) 
recorded on the CRF or transferred electronically .
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_211045] (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.
6.[ADDRESS_252367] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1. for reporting details).
Potential drug in duced liver injury  is defined as 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_252368], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase),  
AND 
3..No other immediately  appare nt possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic 
or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x-rays, and any other potential safety  assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, 
as appropriate, and reported accordingly . 
6.7.1 Toxicity Management
There will be no dose reductions for study drug toxicities. Additionally, there will be no 
substitutions for ATV/RTV. On-study  substitutions of nucleoside analog therapy  with one or 
more other nucleoside analogs approved for use by [CONTACT_211046]/children will be permitted for toxicity  
at the discretion of the investigator. The BMS medical monitor or designee should be contact[CONTACT_211047], if possible. 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Apr-[ADDRESS_252369] of “alternative” NRTI  agents not provided per protocol will be defray ed by [CONTACT_456]. 
Alternative nucleoside analogs, if used, must be administered according to labeled dosing 
recommendations. Subjects must receive 2 nucleoside analogs in addition to ATV/RTV 
throughout the st udy. 
If it becomes necessary  to temporarily  interrupt any study medication for toxicity , all 
antiretrovirals must be stopped and restarted at the same time (on the same day), at full dose. If 
either NRTI is replaced with an alternative nucleoside analog a ll, new drugs should be started on 
the same day  with ATV/RTV; sequential restarting of study  medications is not allowed.
Symptomatic therap y for toxicity  (eg, analgesics, anti-emetics, anti -diarrhea agents, or other 
medications) is permitted as long as it is not an exclusionary  medication, but must be recorded in 
the CRF.
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) standardized toxicity  table for grading severity  of pediatric 
adverse experiences (Appendix 2) will be used for grading toxicities. The supplemental toxicity  
tables supersede the DAIDS toxicity  table when grading skin rash, triglyceride, and cholesterol 
toxicities.
In general, for abnormal treatment -related, or possibly  treatment-related, clinical or laboratory  
observations of:
Grade 1 severit y -Continue study  medications; routine monitoring.
Grade 2 severit y -Continue study  medications; monitor closely  with more frequent visits; 
work -up to exclude other causes.
Grade 3 severity  (with the exception of hyperbilirubinemia) -Repeat observation within 
72hours for confirmation. Subjects should continue taking study  medications pending receipt 
of the confirmatory  laboratory  tests. However, the clinician has the option of immediately 
interrupting the study  medications if a repeat confirmatory  laboratory test cannot be
performed within [ADDRESS_252370] results. For all confirmed Grade 3 toxicities, stop 
all study  medications until toxicity  resolves to Grade 2. Subjects will be allowed to 
interrupt study  treatment for up to 14 days. If toxicity  persists at Grade 3 for more than 
14days or recurs on re-challenge, study  medications generally  should be discontinued 
permanentl y. 
Grade 4 severit y* (with the exception of hyperbil irubinemia) - Hold study  medications and 
notify  the BMS medical monitor or designee. Obtain confirmatory  laboratory  results within 
72hours and notify  the BMS medical monitor or designee of those results. For all confirmed 
Grade 4 toxicities, stop all study medications until toxicity  resolves to <Grade 2. Subjects 
will be allowed to interrupt study  treatment for up to 14 days. If toxicity  persists at 
Grade 4for more than 14 days or recurs on re-challenge, discontinue study  medications 
permanentl y.
*Note :For all Grade 4 toxicities (with the exception of hy perbilirubinemia) -, telephone the BMS 
medical monitor or designee within 24 hours of the event.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperbilirubinemia
Many  subjects taking ATV experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) 
bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP -glucuronosy l transferase (UGT). Hepatic transaminase 
elevations that occur with hy perbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. Dose 
modification of ATV is not permitted. Subjects who experience unacceptable jaundice/ocular 
icterus should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine if subjects are to be 
discontinued from study .
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_211048].
A post -study  follow up will be require d for the following discontinued subjects: 
Subjects who discontinue for hy perbilirubinemia and/or jaundice or ocular icterus (regardless 
of the grade of either) 
Subjects who discontinue for other reasons unrelated to hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice or 
ocular icterus but have a total bilirubin of Grade [ADDRESS_252371] of study  medication (eg, it is attributable to other 
medication or concomitant illness). 
Follow -up visit procedures will include laboratory evaluation of liver function, assessments of 
concomitant medications and adverse events (and jaundice or ocular icterus resolution if 
applicable), and a targeted phy sical exam as needed (see Table 5.1 -4).
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Treatment Interruption
Study  medications may be interrupted either for medication toxicity , as detailed previously , or 
for an intercurrent illness, for up to 14 days. Therapy  or proph ylaxis for opportunistic infections 
requiring use of concomitant medications not allowed in the protocol should be discussed with
the BMS medical monitor or designee.

For Grade 2 hyperlipasemia (> 1.[ADDRESS_252395]), consider holding all study  drugs, Notify  BMS 
medical monitor or designee immediatel y, schedule follow -up visits every  two weeks if 
necessary  until toxicity  resolves to  Grade 1.
For any Grade 3 hyperlipasemia (> 2.[ADDRESS_252396]), hold all study  drugs until both lipase and 
amylase are Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee immediately .
For Grade 4 hyperlipasemia (> 5.[ADDRESS_252397]), all study  drugs should be held and may be 
permanentl y discontinued. If study  drugs are not permanently  discontinued, do not restart 
until both lipase and amylase are Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee 
immediate ly to determine course of action. If hyperlipasemia recurs, discontinue all study 
drugs.
3 HYPERA MYLA SEMI A
For Grade 3 or 4 hyperamy lasemia, the amylase should be fractionated and the pancreatic 
fraction should then be used for toxicity  management. A lipase should also be obtained and the 
following algorithm applies:
If there is an elevation in lipase, hold all study  drugs until both amylase and lipase are 
Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee immediately . 
Pending the results of the fractionated amylase evaluation if the lipase is normal, study 
medications may  be continued. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee.
Once available, fractionated pancreatic amylase elevations should be managed in 
consultation to with the BMS Medical Monitor or designe e.

4 INCREA SE IN VA LUES F OR THE LIVER FUNCTION TESTS (LFTS):
The following algorithm for management of this toxicity  should be observed:
For all Grade [ADDRESS_252398] every  two weeks until values return to Grade 1. Notify  
BMS medical monitor or desi gnee
In general all Grade 2 LFTs or higher, should be reported to the team every other week.
Elevations in LFTs shou ld be managed as per Section 6.7.1 depending on the toxicity  grade.
5 CNS SYMPTOMS
For grading CNS symptoms follow Appendix 2 “Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Toxicity  Table for 
Grading Severity  of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 months of age) Adverse Experiences [December 
2004; clarification August 2009].” 
For management of CNS toxicities follow Section 6.7.1. Contact [CONTACT_211067] i f you have an y doubts on how to proceed after observing specific CNS sy mptoms.
6 CHOLESTEROL A ND TRIG LYCERIDES
Initiation of HAART therap y, with and without PIs and/or NNRTIs has been associated with 
elevations in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. (See Appendix 2 “the Division of AIDS 
(DAIDS) Table for Grading Severit y of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 Months of Age) Adverse 
Experiences [December 2004; clarification August 2009]”).
If triglycerides 750mg/dL  (Grade 2 or greater), obtain fasting triglycerides, as well as amylase 
and lipase (follow Section 6.7.1 for toxicity  management if elevated); if fasting triglycerides < 
749mg/dL, continue study  drugs; if fasting trigly cerides 750mg/dL (Grade 2), notify  BMS 
medical monitor or designee immediatel y to determi ne course of action. After a subject has had a 
Grade [ADDRESS_252399] be obtained in 
fasting state.
7 HYPERGLYCEMI A/GLYCOS URIA
If non-fasting blood glucose > 200 or urinary dipstick > 2+ positive , obtain fasting blood 
glucose. If the fasting blood glucose is 150mg/dL  or greater, notify  BMS medical monitor or 
designee immediatel y. Consult with an endocrinologist regarding possible new onset diabetes, 
and relay  this information to the BMS medical monitor or designee.
8 SKIN RA SH
Rashes which meet the criteria for Grade 2 or higher AE (using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) 
Toxicity  Table for Grading Severit y of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 months of age) Adverse 
Experiences [December 2004; clarification Augu st 2009]), (Appendix 2) must be reported 
immediately  to the BMS medical monitor or designee.

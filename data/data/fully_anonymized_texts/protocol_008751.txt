PROTOCOL TITLE:  Maintenance Lenalidomide Therapy after Autologous Stem Cell 
Transplant (ASCT) in Patients with High Risk Relapsed/ Refractory Lymphoma s 
 
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:  September 27, 2016  
INDICATION:  Relapsed/refractory lymphomas (diffuse large B-cell, 
mantle cell, follicular, marginal zone, peripheral T -cell, 
small lymphocytic with large cell transformation,  and 
Hodgkin  lymphomas)   
STUDY PHASE:  Phase I /II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:  
 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®, CC -5013)  is an oral immunomodulatory drug which has activity in 
several hematologic mal ignancies.  Patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas who failed 
multiple cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens were found to have encouraging overall response rates 
(over 30%) and duration of response (over 10  months) when treated with lenalidomide as a single 
agent.  
 
We have previously reported the  outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas who 
continued to have residual hypermetabolic lesions on positron emission tomography (PET)  scans 
after salva ge chemotherapy and prior to ASCT (Svoboda et al. 2006, 211 -216).  We concluded  
that these patients have an extremely poor chance of  durable remission after ASCT and should be 
considered for novel  therapeutic ap proaches .  Using lenalidomide mainten ance therapy after 
ASCT in this setting  is a novel  concept which might improve the historically  poor outcomes in 
this population.  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:  
Determine the safety of lenalidomide maintenance therapy implemente d early after ASCT  and the 
appropriate dose for further studies . 
Secondary:  
Determine the progression free survival (PFS)  and overall survival (OS) after ASCT in this high 
risk group with relapsed/refractory lymphomas treated with lenalidomide maintenance.   We will 
compare these findings to our historical controls with PET positive disease prior to ASCT.  
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
We propose a phase I /II trial of lenalidomide maintenance therapy after ASCT in high risk 
patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas.  We  define this group of patients by [CONTACT_196991](s)  on PET scans (PET positive disease) after salvage 
chemotherapy and prior to ASCT.   This will be a non -randomized, single institution study.  
 
Patients will be identified and  undergo screening activity to determine eligibility w ithin [ADDRESS_233721]  following positive PET scan.   Patients will be registered if determined to be 
eligible .  Eligible patients will proceed with lenalidomide maintenance therapy .

STUDY DURATION:  60 months  
 
DOSING REGIMEN:  The initial dose of lenalidomide will be 10 mg daily .  We will use a 3 +3 
design to det ermine tolerability of this dose in these heavily pretreated patients .  We will allow 
decreasing  lenalidomide to 5 mg daily according to specific dose modification criteria .  We will 
stop the study if there are 2 subjects with DLTs at the 5 mg dose level.  
 
TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE:  We plan to enroll 24  evaluable patients  with relapsed/refractory 
lymphoma who will initiate lenalidomide maintenance  after ASCT  during the initial [ADDRESS_233723]  28 patients may be enrolled to provide 24 evaluable patients .

Version:  09/27/[ADDRESS_233736] (Philip et al. 1987, 1493 -1498) .  Traditionally , the response to 
salvage chemotherapy prior ASCT was determined by [CONTACT_196992] (CT)  
scans using size criteria .  In the past several years,  it has been shown that functional imaging with 
PET scans using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)  provides additional information  to anatomic imaging 
with CTs.  Recently, PET scans have  been incorporated into the response assessment as published 
by [CONTACT_196993] (Juweid et 
al. 2007, 571 -578).  These days, most institutions use ‘PET/CT scan s’ which incorporate 
functional imaging with PET scan fused with low dose non -contrast enhanced CT scan.  
We have previously reported the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas who 
conti nued to have residual FDG avid  PET (‘positive’)  lesions after salvage chemotherapy and 
prior to ASCT (Svoboda et al. 2006, 211 -216).  This group of patients included those who had 
excellent anatomic response by [CONTACT_196994], but continued to have persistent hypermetabolic 
FDG activity within the residual lesions.  We found that PET positive patients have an extremely 
poor chance of durable remission after ASCT.  In the PET negative group, the median PFS was 
19 months wi th 54% of patients without progression at [ADDRESS_233737].  In the PET 
positive group, the median PFS was 5 months with only 7% of patients without progression at [ADDRESS_233738], novel therapeutic approaches and agents need to be 
investigated.  
Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corporation .  IMiD® compounds 
have both immunomodulatory and anti -angiogenic properties  which could  confer antitumor and 
antimetastatic effects.  Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is 
unknown, a number of mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity 
against hematological malignancies.  Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess anti -
angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF -alpha induced endothelial cell 
migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF  (Dredge et 
al. 2005, 56 -63).  In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects.  
Lenalidomide stimulates T cell proliferation, and the production of IL -2, IL -10 and IFN -gamma, 
inhibits IL -1 beta and IL -6 and modulates IL -12 pro duction  (Corral et al. 1999, 380 -386).  Up -
regulation of T cell derived IL -[ADDRESS_233739] in part t hrough increased AP -1 
activity (Schafer et al. 2003, 1222 -1232 ).  The increased level s of circulating cytokines augment 
natural killer cell number and function, and enhance natural killer cell activity  (Davies et al. 2001, 
210-216). 
Clinical activity of lenalidomide in various l ymphoma subtypes has been documented in several 
phase II trials  (Wiernik et al. 2008, 4952 -4957; Witzig et al. 2009, 5404 -5409; Habermann et al. 
2009, 344 -349; Boll et al. 2010, 480 -482).  In patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma, the overall response rate (ORR) was 53% with PFS at 12 month 40%  (Habermann et 
al. 2009, 344 -349).  In patients with aggr essive lymphoma (mostly diffuse large B -cell subtype ), 
the ORR was 35% with PFS at 12 months about 25%  (Wiernik et al. 2008, 4952 -4957) .  There

Version:  09/27/[ADDRESS_233740] been many  case reports  of patients who achieved durable complet e response to 
lenalidomide after failing multiple cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens  (Musuraca et al. 2010; 
Ivanov et al. 2010, 1758 -1760) . 
Most clinical studies of lenalidomide in patients with active  lymphoma u sed dose of 25 mg daily 
on days 1 -21 in 28 day cycle which is the dosing recommended for active  multiple myeloma.  
While lenalidomide  was well tolerated  in the lymphoma studies , the dose of 25 mg is associated 
with high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_196970] 3 neutropenia in 25 -40% of patients and 
thrombocytopenia in 12 -20% (Habermann et al. 2009, 344 -349; Wiernik et al. 2008, 4952 -4957) .  
Our group reported that low dose lenal idomide at 10 mg daily ( continuous dosing ) in combination 
with weekly de xamethasone  can be effective in patients with active relapsed/refractory low grade 
and mantle  cell lymphoma s (Ahmadi et al. 2009, 1700) .  The  continuous dose of 10 mg daily has 
also been used in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma  
(Andritsos et al. 2008, 2519 -2525) . 
Lenalidomide has been  used as maintenance therapy in mu ltiple myeloma, but there is limited 
experience with maintenance lenalidomide in lymphoma  patients .  Two large clinical trials of 
maintenance lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma after ASCT have shown benefit in 
PFS over observation.  These studi es used daily dosing of lenalidomide at 10 mg or 15 mg which 
were well tolerated over long term administration (Attal et al. 2010; McCarthy et al. 2010) . 
3.1.1 Indications and Usage : 
Revlimid® (lenali domide) is currently indicated for the treatment of  patients with transfusion -
dependent anemia due to Low - or Intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with 
a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnorma lities.  
Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients 
with multiple myeloma that have recei ved at least one prior therapy.

Version:  09/27/2016  5 Investigational Plan  
5.1 Overall Design  
Patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma will undergo screening after ASCT following 
positive PET/CT scan.  PET/CT scan results will be categorized as negative when no evidence of 
lymphoma is found by [CONTACT_172922] a t the time of the scan.  PET/CT results will be categorized 
as positive when the intensity of any non -physiological signal is over 2.5 SUV, which is the 
measurement of FDG uptake often used to differentiate betwee n benign and malignant lesions 
(Elstrom et al. 2003, 3875 -3876; Al -Sugair and Coleman 1998, 303 -319).  Patients with diffuse 
bone marrow activity while on growth factors and with mild symmetric supraclavicular adipose 
tissue activity in th e absence of focal lesions will be deemed as negative.  All studies will be

[IP_ADDRESS]  Lenalidomide Description  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti -
angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it h as the following chemical structure:

NH2  
3-(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione  
The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic solvent/water 
mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvents and 
low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging fr om about 0.4 
to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active 
forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechan ism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the 
secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased the secretion of anti -inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, 
lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B  cell lymphoma cell 
line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of 
KG-1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other 
cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lena lidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
Absorption:  
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_196971] s occurring between 0.[ADDRESS_233748] -dose. 
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide 
is linear. Cmax and  AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the 
recommended dose -regimen does not result in drug accumulation.  
UPCC  #[ZIP_CODE]              Confidential  Page 15 of 46 
         
 
Version:  09/27/2016  Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the phase I 
studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maximum 
blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No 
plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  Plasma lenalidomide declined in  
a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 
28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing 
range of 5mg to 50mg  (Wu A. 2004, 2056) .  Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 
57% higher t han in healthy male volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters:  
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism and Ex cretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. The 
process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefo re is partially or entirely active.  
Half-life of elimin ation is approximately 3 hours.

5 mg daily (on days 1 -28 of each 28 day cycle) * See * below   
 
* Lenalidomide 5 mg daily (on days 1 -28 of each 28 day cycle) is the minimum lenalidomide dose.  
Lenalidomide will be discontinued in patients who cannot tolerate this dose.  However, patients 
who experience toxicity requ iring dose reduction while receiving lenalidomide [ADDRESS_233771] their dose held until toxicity resolves as described in Sections 
5.5.2 and 5.5.3, and then restart lenalidomide 5 mg daily.  If the same toxicity r ecurs at 
lenalidomide 5 mg daily, consideration should be given to discontinuing lenalidomide.  
5.5.2  Instruction s for Initiation of a New Cycle  
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled day 1 of a new cycle if:  
 The ANC is ≥  1,000 /uL 
 The platelet  count is ≥  50,000 /uL 
 Any drug-related rash or neuropathy that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ 
grade 1 severity . 
 Any other drug-related adverse event s that may have occurred have resolved to ≤ 
grade [ADDRESS_233772] will be evaluated 
weekly and a new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as 
described above.  
5.5.3 Instructions for Dose Modifications or Interruption During a Cycle 
Dose delay and dose reduction rul es are as follows and in the table below.  
 Lenalidomide dose reduction steps are outlined in Section 5.5.1.  
 For treatment interruptions during a cycle, the 28 -day schedule of each cycle will 
continue to be followed.  Missed doses of  lenalidomide are not mad e up.  
 For treatment interruptions that delay the scheduled start of a new cycle, when 
toxicity has resolved as required to allow the start of a new cycle (Section 5.5.2), 
the restart day of therapy becomes day 1 of the next cycle.

the study diary at the end of each cycle.  These diaries will not be mandatory, but will 
serve as supplemental documentation to dosing information collected during each study 
visit.  
Any unused Revlimid® (len alidomide) should be returned by  [CONTACT_196999] ® program.  
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
5.6.1 Recommended Concomitant T herapy  
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, analgesics, and antiemetics when appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anticoagula tion 
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or 
with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to 
cause thrombosis. When lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as stero ids 
(e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropo ietin 
the risk of thrombosis is increased.  For information on the risk of venous 
thromboembolism with combined oral contraception see Appendix: Risks of Fetal 
Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods.  
Study subjects will  use aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 or 325 mg) or some other form of prophylaxis as 
deemed appropriate  while taking lenalidomide . Low molecular weight heparin may be 
utilized in patients who are intolerant of  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] . Coumadin should be used with caution 
and close monitoring of INR.   Patients who are intolerant of anti -coagulants due to

study and recei ve daily dosing with lenalidomide with approval from the principal 
investigator.  
If prophylactic anti -coagulation is used, it should be held for platelet counts < 50,000/uL , 
and then restarted when platelet counts are at or above this level.  
5.6.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant use of sargramostim (GM -CSF) , anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including radiation, 
thalidomide, or other investigational agents is not permitted while subjects are receiving 
lenalidomide therapy  during the  maintenance  treatment phase of  the study.  
5.7 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Study t reatment will continue until the completion of 24 cycles of lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy,  or the occurrence of any of the following events : 
 Disease progression  (See Appendix D)  
 Adverse event(s) that , in the judgment of the Investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the treatment regimen . 
 Discontinuation or interruption in lenalidomide  therapy  for > 28 consecutive days. 
 Withdrawal of consent

Version:  09/27/2016  6 Adverse Events  
6.1 Serious Adverse Even t (SAE) Definition  
A serious advers e event is one that at any dose  (including ov erdose):  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening1 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196974]2 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event3 
 Pregnancy  
 
 1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Pers istent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropria te in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  
Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196975].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as 
medically important.

of lenalidomide and will end twenty -eight days after each patient’s last dose of 
lenalidomide, or upon resolution of any treatment -related adverse events, should their 
duration extend beyond the 28 -day repo rting period.  Pre -existing conditions (those 
events existing prior to each patient’s first dose of lenalidomide) will not be reported as 
adverse events unless they worsen in grade or severity.  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity a nd adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage (HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH .GOV ).  All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether 
observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with details 
about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the test 
drug, and the patient’s outco me.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience 
for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness.

about the patient’s outcome  on the adverse event CRF .  Lab abnormalities graded < grade 
2 in severity will not be reported as  adverse events, unless deemed to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_1963].  
Lymphopenia of any grade will not be considered an adverse event.  
6.2.1 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on lenalidomide, or 
within  [ADDRESS_233777]’s last dose of lenalidomide, are considered immediately 
reportable events. Lenalidomide  is to be discontinued immediately. The pregna ncy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_64823]. The female 
subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one ex perienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
 
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form.  If the 
outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome 
meets any of th e serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_233778] 
to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene 
Drug Safety immediately by  [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the e vent using the SAE Report Form.  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking lenalidomide sh ould notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.

Version:  09/27/2016  In addit ion, if other information becomes available that indicates a change to the risks or 
potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency, this should be 
reported within 3 days.  Examples of this include:  
 An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
 Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more sever, or more 
frequent than initially expected.  
 A paper is published from another study that shows that an a rm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value.  
 Any adverse event that represents a serious, unexpected problem that is rare in 
absence of drug exposure.  
 Withdrawal from marketing for safety of a drug, device, or biologic used in a 
research protocol.  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
 Violation, meaning an accidental or unintentional change to the IRB approved 
protocol that placed one or more participants at increased  risk, or has potential to 
occur again.  
 Breach of confidentiality.  
The IRB will accept other reports when the investigator is unsure whether the event 
should be reported, and the IRB will review such reports to determine whether the event

9.3 Study Auditing  
9.3.1  Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, au dits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201],  
ACC DOCM,  the suppo rter (Celgene) , government regulatory bodies,  and University 
compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The 
investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable s tudy-related facilities 
(e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
The Investigator will permit study -related audits by [CONTACT_197007], to source documents, 
to CRFs, an d to all other study documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at 
some time during audits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access 
to the subject’s records (e.g., medical rec ords, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study 
related charts) for source data verification.  The data collection must be completed prior 
to each visit and be made available to the Celgene representative so that the accuracy and 
completeness may be checke d.

Version:  09/27/2016  10 Statistical Considerations  
10.1  Design  
This is a single a rm phase I/II trial of lenalidomide maintenance for patients with high 
risk relapsed/refractory lymphomas who underwent  high dose chemotherapy and ASCT. 
At 28-[ADDRESS_233791] by a 3+[ADDRESS_233792]. A monitoring rule for 
unacceptable toxicity due to lenalidomide wi ll be followed during phase II.  
10.2 Objectives  
The primary  objective:  
-Dose -limiti ng toxicity due to lenalidomide  
 
The secondary objective is to determine:  
-Progression -free survival  
-Overall survival  
 
10.3 Endpoints  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as  any grade [ADDRESS_233793]  28 days of therapy and is possibly, probably or definitely related to 
lenalidomide  maintenance .  Because certain levels of toxicity are considered acceptable 
in lymphoma therapy, the definition of DLT is limited to the following:  
-Any grade [ADDRESS_233794] 
anti-diarrhea l therapy.  
-Nausea, vomiting,  heartburn, anorexia, diarrhea, or constipation that improved to 
grade 1 or better within 2 days with the addition of symptom directed treatment 
will not be considered a DLT.  
NCI Common toxicity criteria (CTC Version 4.0) grade s will be employed.  Toxicity 
unrelated to lenalidomide (i.e. clearly related to A SCT) will be scored separately.  
UPCC  #[ZIP_CODE]              Confidential  Page 35 of 46 
         
 
Version:  09/27/2016  Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined from  date of ASCT (day 0)  to first documented 
progression of disease, death due to any cause or las t patient contact. Progression -free 
survival rate at 12 months (PFS12) is also of interest and is defined as the percentage of 
patien ts that are alive and progression -free at 12 months. Overal l survival (OS) is defined 
as days from date of ASCT  to death du e to any cause or last patient contact.  
Patients are enrolled [ADDRESS_233795] (day 0) .  Patients who complete one full 
cycle of lenalidomide maintenance or who experience DLT during the first cycle will be 
considered evaluable for DLT determinati on.  Patients who withdraw from the study 
prior to initiation of lenalidomide maintenance, or who initiate and discontinue 
lenalidomide maintenance  before completing one full cycle and do not experience DLT , 
remain in the study population and are followed for PFS and OS but do not contribute to 
the determination of DLT.  These patients will be included in the estimation of PFS and 
OS, according to an intent -to-treat analysis plan.  A secondary analysis of PFS and OS 
will include only patients who complete a t least one full cycle of lenalidomide  or who 
experience DLT at any point during cycle 1 (“evaluable population” ).  Patients who did 
not progress will be censored at the time of last contact. Evaluable patients contribute to 
determination of DLT, PFS and O S. Evaluable patient outcomes will be compared to 
historical rates for PFS12.  
10.4 Phase I Design  
A 3+3 design will be employed to determine the tolerability  of lenalidomide  maintenance 
at the dose of 10 mg  daily  in this setting . The dose will not be escalated,  but in the event 
of 2 or more DLTs at 10 mg, the dose will be de -escalated to 5 mg.  
 
Dose Level 1: Three evaluable patients will be treated at [ADDRESS_233796] DLT, then the dose will be de -escalated 
to 5 mg  daily . 
Dose Level -1: Three evaluable patients will be treated at [ADDRESS_233797] DLT, then the appropriate dose  is not 
defined and the trial will be terminated.

Version:  09/27/[ADDRESS_233798] 3+3 phase I design. We will assume a beta(1,5) prior, which is 
information equivalent  to DLT observed in 1 of 6 treated patients. A DLT rate <33% is 
considered acceptable. If the number of patients with DLT is greater than or equal to the number 
in the table below then termination will be considered as it is likely that the DLT rate is >33%, as 
noted by [CONTACT_197008].

10.6  Plans for Data Analysis  
All observed tox icities will be graded and tabled. The toxicities may be stratified as either related 
to lenalidomide  or other medications (i.e. high dose chemotherapy and ASCT) .  Progression -free 
survival and overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_197009]. A minimum  
of 12 months of observation time is required on all patients  (or less if patient has failed), in order 
to estimate PFS12. The PFS12 rate and 95% confidence interval will be computed. In addition to 
the observed rate and 95% CI, evidence f or success of lenalidomide will be assumed if >4 of 24 
evaluable patients are alive and progression -free at 12 months, based on operating characteristics 
defined by [CONTACT_197010]. The probability of observing >4 patients alive and progression -

lymphomas have historically pro duced a PFS12 of <10% .  Single agent lenalidomide in 
relapsed/refractory lymphoma s has been shown to produce a PFS12 of approximately 30%.  The 
use of lenalidomide after high dose chemotherapy and ASCT will be considered worthy of further 
development if th e PFS12 is 30% and will be considered not worthy of further development if the 
PFS12 is 10 %. A total of 24 evaluable patients will provide 89% power  for an exact test for a 
single proportion, with null rate of no interest ( 0) of 10%, alternative rate of i nterest (A) of 30%, 
at one -sided type I error ( ) = 10%. A one -sided test is appropriate for early phase trials seeking 
to detect an imp rovement over historical rates.  
10.8  Study Duration  
Assuming that lenalidomide at 10 mg will be feasible and an accrua l rate of 8-10 patients  per 
year, accrual will continue for initial 3 6 months . PFS12 will be evaluated 12 months after end of 
accrual .  Lenal idomide maintenance will continue for up to 24 months after the end accrual.  The 
total duration of the study will be up to 60 months.

Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied 
nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  Lenalidomide is 
structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalid omide produced malformations in the offspring of 
female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of 
lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to 
prevent pregnancy must be observed.  
All s tudy participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS ® program, 
and be  willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS ®. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been 
naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months ). 
The investigator must ensure that:  
 Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of 
understanding  
 Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge tha t she understands the 
hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide  
 Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential 
terato genic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing 
potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has 
had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a fem ale of childbearing 
potential.  
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from 
heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study : 1) for at 
least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days afte r 
lenalidomide discontinuation.  
UPCC  #[ZIP_CODE]              Confidential  Page 40 of 46 
         
 
Version:  09/27/2016  The two methods of reliable contraception mus t include one highly effective method and 
one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider 
of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effec tive methods of contra ception:  
o Highly effective methods:  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
 Tubal ligation  
 Partner’s vasectomy  
o Additional effective methods:  
 Male condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervical Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous th romboembolism in patients with multiple 
myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_196989]. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient 
should switch to one of the effective meth od listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6  weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -treatment 
with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing in trauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularl y in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised p regnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing 
potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before Starting Lenalidomide  
Female Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within [ADDRESS_233807] be perform ed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive 
lenalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests 
are negative.  
Male Patients : 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree t o use a condom during sexual 
contact [CONTACT_197013], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days 
following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has und ergone a successful 
vasectomy.

Version:  09/27/2016  During Study Participation and for 28 days Following Lenalidomide 
Discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
 FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
every [ADDRESS_233808] occur weekly every 14 days throughout the duration of lenalidomide 
treatment, including dose interruptions, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and a t 
Day 28 following  lenalidomide discontinuation.  
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of bi rth control at each visit during the time t hat birth 
control is required.  
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued.  
 Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patien t misses her period 
or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide 
treatment must be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation.  
 Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and 
for at leas t 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation.  
Male Patients:  
 Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_197014], during  dose interruptions and for at least 28 
days following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has und ergone a 
successful vasectomy.  
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, th e investigator must be notified immediately.  
Additional precautions : 
 Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person.  
 Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of le nalidomide.  
 Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at 
least 28 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
 Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be prescri bed with each 
cycle of therapy.

Hodgkin  Lymphoma  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Complete disappearance of all detecta ble clinical and radiographic evidence of disease 
and disappearance of all -disease related symptoms if present before therapy, and 
normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] 
definitely assignable to NHL.  
 
All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (< 1.[ADDRESS_233809] transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved 
nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_233810] decreased to < [ADDRESS_233811] transverse diameter after treatment, or by [CONTACT_26813] 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD).  
 
The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, must 
have of th e difficulties in accurately evaluating splenic and hepatic size.  For instance, 
spleens thought to be of normal size may contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen 
may not necessarily reflect the presence of lymphoma but variations in anatomy, blood 
volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or other causes.  The determination of 
splenic volume or splenic index by [CONTACT_197015].   Any 
macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be 
present.  Similarly, other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy due to 
involvement by [CONTACT_56927], such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size.  
 
If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must be 
cleared  on repeat bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22612].  The sample on 
which this determination is made must be adequate (>20 mm biopsy core).   Flow 
cytometric, molecular, or cytogenetic studies are not considered part of routine 
assessment to docume nt persistent disease at the present time.  
 
Comp lete Response/Unconfirmed (Cru)  
CR/unconfirmed (CRu) includes those subjects who fulfill criteria 1 and 3 above, but 
with one or more of the following features:  
 
A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.[ADDRESS_233812] transverse diameter that has 
regressed by [CONTACT_726] 75% in the SPD.  Individual nodes that were previously confluent 
must have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 75% in their SPD compared with the size of the 
original mass.  
Indeterminate bone marrow (incr eased number or size of aggregates without cytological 
or architectural atypia).

Version:  09/27/2016  Partial Response (PR)  
>50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes 
or masses should be selected according to the following features: ( a) they should be 
clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions, (b) they should be from as 
disparate regions of the body as possible, and (c) they should also include mediastinal 
and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
 
No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
 
Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by [CONTACT_2669] 50% in the SPD.  
 
With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
considered assessable and not measurable disease.  
 
Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is assessable 
and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type should be specified in the 
report, e.g., large -cell lymphoma or low -grade lymphoma (i.e., small, lymphocytic small 
cleaved, or mixed small and large cells.)  
 
No new sites of disease.  
 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Stable disease is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease (see 
below).  
 
Relapsed Disease (RD)  
Appearance o f any new lesion or increase by >50% in the size of previously involved 
sites (only applies to subjects that achieve a CR).  
 
>50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater than 1 cm in 
its short axis or in the SPD of more than  one node.  
 
Progressive Disea se (PD)  
>50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs 
or nonresponders.  
Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy which is >1.5 cm by 
[CONTACT_197016] 1 cm by [CONTACT_197017] n

N. Active Duty Military Personnel as Study Subjects 
Special consideration will be given to the recruitment process for military personnel.  The Chain 
of Command will not be involved in the recruitment of military personnel and will not encourage 
or order soldiers to participate in research study.   An ombudsman will be used when conducting 
group briefings with active duty personnel to ensure that volunteers understand that participation 
is voluntary.  Restrictions on compensation for active duty military members will be adhered to 
as applicable.  
 
O. Title 10 [LOCATION_002] Code 980  
I acknowledge the requirements of Title 10 [LOCATION_002] Code 980: “Funds appropriated to the 
Department of Defense may not be used for research involving a human being as an 
experimental subject unless-(1) the informed consent of the subject is obtained in advance; or (2) 
in the case of research intended to be beneficial to the subject, the informed consent may be 
obtained from a legal representative of the subject.” 
 
If an individual cannot give his or her own consent (e.g., incapacitated individuals, incompetents, 
minors) to participate in the research study, consent of the individual’s legally authorized 
representative will be obtained prior to the individual’s participation in the research.  Moreover,  
such subjects will not be enrolled in DoD sponsored research unless the research is intended to 
benefit each subject enrolled in the study.

pain, the use of narcotics comes with unpleasant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and 
constipation. 12  As dehydration is a common complication after a tonsillectomy due to limited 
swallowing capability, the side effects of narcotics can further exacerbate this problem. 13 Other 
commonly used treatments for pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
acetaminophen.  Both have been found to be effective in controlling post-operative pain, but 
should be used with caution.  Due to their antiplatelet effect, NSAIDs in particular can be 
harmful after tonsillectomy, as bleeding is a common morbidity with this surgery.  
Acetaminophen has little impact on clotting; however, long-term usage or over dosage can result 
in liver failure. 14  Steroids (typi[INVESTIGATOR_874820]) are used to prevent inflammation, but may 
also have some analgesic benefit.   While no adverse effects have been shown, efficacy studies 
have produced mixed results, with some reporting an improvement in pain post-operatively and 
others reporting no effect observed. 15,16,[ADDRESS_1221692]-operative analgesia has also been studied, and acupuncture has been shown to reduce pain

Many different acupuncture techniques are commonly used for managing pain; 
specifically, auricular acupuncture has been a long-standing therapeutic modality dating back 
thousands of years.  The use of auricular acupuncture has been applied to many conditions 
including headache, allergic rhinitis, chronic fatigue, anxiety and pain.27,28,29,30,31  The 
hypothesized efficacy of auricular acupuncture comes from the premise that the external ear 
represents a microsystem of the entire body.  The ear serves as a miniature homunculus, whereby 
[CONTACT_874842].32  A modified technique, 
referred to as Battlefield Acupuncture (BA), was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Richard Niemtzow in 2001 
and utilizes only five major auricular points (see Figure 1).  [CONTACT_874860] collaborated with a 
neurophysiologist to determine which areas of the brain were activated in patients experiencing 
pain.  They utilized functional MRI to visualize these pain centers and found less activity in 
these areas after the application of auricular acupuncture. [ADDRESS_1221694]-operative

imaginable pain) up to [ADDRESS_1221704]-operation.   
 
7.1 HYPOTHESES/RESEARCH QUESTIONS: We hypothesize that subjects receiving intra-
opertive auricular acupuncture during a tonsillectomy will have statistically significantly less 
post-opertaive pain scores in comparison to subjects receiving standard of care.   
 
7.2 SPECIFIC AIMS/SIGNIFICANCE:    
Aims:  The specific aim of this study is to compare post-operative pain, as measured by [CONTACT_874845] (SPI) from the time of first to waking to [ADDRESS_1221705]-opertative using the 
Numerical Rating Sacle (NRS), between subjects receiving intra-op erative auricular acupuncture 
or standard of care during a tonsillectomy.   
 
Significance:  Post-opertive pain in adults after a tonsillectomy is significant, despi[INVESTIGATOR_874823].  Identification of an intra-opertive intervention that 
results in significant reduction in post-operative pain would improve patient’s quality of life, and 
may reduce medication usage and improve return- to-duty time.   
 
Secondary aims:  We will also compare outpatient pain medication use and resumption of normal 
diet between subjects receiving intra-operative auricular acupuncture or standard of care during a 
tonsillectomy.   
 
7.3 DESIGN:    
 Design type:  Prospective, randomized control trial 
 Sample 
­ Description of the population:  All adults (>18 years) undergoing a tonsillectomy 
with or without adenoidectomy at WAMC are eligible for participation in the study.     
­ Sample Size:  125 subjects.  A target of 45 subjects per group for a total of 90 
subjects, and accounting for a 10% drop out rate.   With current diary return low, 
to ensure complete data for analysis we will continue to recruit and enroll up to 
125 subjects.   
­ Power Analysis: Under the assumption of a linear time by [CONTACT_9866], 
assuming subject-level randomization, five time-points, power of 80%, a Type I error 
rate of 5% and no attrition, to detect a 1.6 difference in pain score requires a total 
sample size of 90 subjects or 45 per treatment arm. 
­ Inclusion Criteria: 
 All adults (males and females) 18yrs of age or older having a 
tonsillectomy or tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy.  
 ASA I-III 
­ Exclusion Criteria:  
 Chronic pain syndromes (pain symptoms lasting greater than three months 
or taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_39938] a daily basis for > 3 months) 
 ASA IV

Recruitment to participants discharge will follow the following steps:  .   
 Patient sees ENT surgeon for standard of care visit to discuss upcoming (to be scheduled) 
tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy at which time, IRB-approved study flyers 
will be available to patients in the surgeons’ exam rooms. 
 
 The surgeon who is planning a patient’s tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy  
gives the clinic Medical Support Assistant (MSA) a surgical scheduling form 
(STANDARD OF CARE) 
 
 Approximately 30 days prior to surgery, the MSA schedules the patient’s tonsillectomy 
with or without adenoidectomy if a time slot is available; if not, the MSA calls the patient 
within next 30 days when a slot is available. The MSA also schedules an appointment for 
the patient to see CRNA and RN  (1-3 days pre surgery) (STANDARD OF CARE.)  At 
this time the MSA gives the patient an OPTIONAL RESEARCH PACKET (Appendix 
G) in which there is the following: 
 
 Study Flyer (Appendix G) 
 Patient Information sheet (Appendix G) 
 
 The MSA’s will go by a specific script on what to say to potential candidates when giving 
them the OPTIONAL RESEARCH PACKET. (Appendix F) .  
 
  
  The PI, AI or any other designated team members will use the S3 list for  potential 
participan ts that are scheduled for a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy and 
will call them as previously approved for those that had no address. They will utilize the 
previously approved script that has been adjusted slightly for their role.  (Appendix G1)

giving the potential participants ample time for questions or concerns.  
 
  If a potential participant contacts the study team, a team member will arrange for the 
participant to review the consent at his or her pre-admission appointment. The study team 
will ask if the patient would like an emailed copy of the consent document. If yes, the 
team member will send her/him the consent form by [CONTACT_874846]. The 
study team member will not maintain the email or postal address on file.  
 
  
 
  If screening criteria based on inclusion and exclusion criteria are not met  the potential 
participant will be thanked for their time and informed that they do not qualify for the 
study.  
 
 If the patient meets the screening criteria and verbalizes interest in participating in the 
study, he or she is notified that s/he can be scheduled to further review and complete the 
consent paperwork if s/he wishes with study staff when s/he is present for the pre-
admission appointment or at another time convenient for the potential participant.  Then, 
at that time, the potential participant will have a chance to review any questions s/he 
may have about the study and complete the study consent paperwork if s/he wishes to 
participate.  Consenting will take place in advance of the day of the procedure; if 
possible and if not a team member  will meet with potential participant on the day of 
surgery in holding.   Once a subject has consented to be in the study, the individual 
consenting them will interview them for demographics, medical history, medication 
history, and allergies (Appendix A). The pain diary will be reviewed at this time as well.  
If the subject is determined to be eligible for the study, her/his scheduled date of surgery 
will be confirmed .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a list of all subjects and their respective surgery 
dates in a password protected electronic enrollment log kept in the V drive.  
 
   Home diary teaching:  At the Pre admit and/or  consent appointment,  a research team 
member  will review the home pain diary with the subject.  They will be asked to record 
their pain score in [ADDRESS_1221707] pain level.  Subjects will be asked to return their pain scores by 
[CONTACT_648],email, or mail (addressed envelope provided).  If the subject has not sent their 
diary by  [CONTACT_4475] 15, an attempt at a reminder to the  subject via phone call or email 
(whichever the subject prefers, as collected during enrollment) will be done. .   
 
 On the day of the surgery:  On the day of surgery, the randomization category will be 
determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874825]. Prior to surgery, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874826] (if not already done so) and confirm enrollment in the study.  Anesthesia for 
the surgical case will then proceed per standard of care.

occur. 
 
The procedure for the auricular acupuncture is standardized based on the Battlefield 
Acupuncture technique.  The ear will be cleaned with alcohol prior to insertion of the 
needles.  Five sterile, single-use, gold needles will be placed in each ear according to the 
figure below.  The needles penetrate about a millimeter (or 4/100ths of an inch) into the 
skin.

7.4 RISKS TO SUBJECTS:  Acupuncture is considered a safe technique with minimal risk to 
the subject.  Acupuncture needles only penetrate the skin approximately one millimeter.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_874833], needle insertion poses the risk of infection, bleeding and bruising.  All 
acupuncture needles used in this study will be sterile and inserted after alcohol preparation of the 
ear surface.  The needles are made of gold and pose minimal, if any, allergic reaction.

8.0 DATA ANALYSIS:  The primary metric  for this study is pain score.  Pain scores will be 
collected for [ADDRESS_1221709].  Analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_874852] (1) 
difference in pain scores by [CONTACT_874853] (2) rate of change in pain score over time.   
 Age and sex will be considered as potential confounders.  Duration of needle 
insertion may also be evaluated for effect on outcome, if significant variability in length is noted.  
The type of surgical technique (cold knife coblation versus cautery) may be a potential 
confounder.  Finally, intra-operative anesthesia and dexamethosone dose will be evaluated for 
potential confounding.

9.0 MILITARY RELEVANCE :  The use of Battlefield A cupuncture is increasing in all 
services in the military as a treatment option for pain.  The DOD as a whole is implementing and 
employing BA as taught by [CONTACT_874854].  The military is using it to treat pain and PTSD , and acupuncturists are being hired at 
the major military medical centers.  Several grants have been offered to physicians to attend 
medical acupuncture courses.  Therefore, Battlefield Acupunture techniques will become 
increasing more common for military physicians.  The efficacy of Battlefield Acupuncture for 
post-operative pain is inconclusive (or untested?).  This study may provide the intial work for 
future incorportion of Battlefield Acupuncture in the operating room, further expanding the role 
of this technique in the military.   
 Additionally, faster post -operative recovery (as measured by [CONTACT_77368]) may benefit the 
military by [CONTACT_874855].

10.0 MEDICAL APPLICATION:    
 
Over the last decade, the concept of multi-modal analgesia has been utilized in the 
treatment of acute post-operative pain.33, 34 The American Society of Anesthesiologists published 
a practice guideline stating: “Whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain 
management therapy. Central regional blockade with local anesthetics should be considered. 
Unless contraindicated, patients should receive an around-the- clock regimen of COXIBs ( Cox-2 
Inhibitors), NSAIDs (Non-Steroid Anti-inflammatory Drugs), or acetaminophen.35”  The 
treatment of both acute and chronic pain has received national attention.[ADDRESS_1221711] on self-reported pain scores was an average reduction of approximately 55 
percent, without increased risk of adverse effects.41

 No – Research subjects will need to sign a HIPAA Authorization.  
 
iv. What precautions will you take to protect the confidentiality of research source documents (Case 
Report Forms, questionnaires, etc.), the research data file, and the master code (if any)?  
- All the enrolled subjects will be assigned a study identification number which will not be 
linked to any Identifiable Protected Health Information (PHI).  There will be a master list 
linking the subject, including the subject’s social security number, with the study ID 
which is kept in a password protected file on the V: drive .  The subject’s Social Security 
or other PHI will not be included in the study database.  The master list will be destroyed 
after the study has been completed and all the data has been analyzed.   
 
- Deidentified database without links to subject identifiers in an Excel spreadsheet will be 
stored on the WAMC V: drive.  The deidentified data will only be shared among the PI, 
AI and collaborators of this study. 
   
- The pain diary along with other case report forms will only be marked with the study ID 
and will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the research coordinator’s locked office.

12.1 BENEFITS:  Identification of a minimal risk intra-operative technique that minimizes post-
operative pain benefits the healthcare system as a whole.  Acupuncture is a relatively 
inexpensive and quick procedure.  Implimentation of this technique may reduce healthcare costs.  
Additionally, individual subjects may benefit from decreased post-operative pain and experience 
shorter recovery time. 
 
12.2 RISKS:  The only risk of data collection during the study is potential loss of 
privacy/confidentiality of enrollment in the study.  The consents forms with the subject’s name 
[CONTACT_192570] a locked file cabinet in  the anesthesia office area  at WAMC.  The master link

12.3 HIPAA AUTHORIZATION WAIVER 
If you wish to obtain and use identifiable protected health information for a study without obtaining 
written approval (“HIPAA Authorization”) from the subject, please complete a HIPAA 
Authorization Waiver Form to provide justification for IRB review and approval. Contact 
[EMAIL_16605]  for assistance.  
 
13.0 WAIVER OF THE REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN INFORMED CONSENT:    
  The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects and,  
 The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects and, 
The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.  
 
  Not applicable  
 
13.1 WAIVER OF THE REQUIREMENT TO DOCUMENT INFORMED CONSENT:  
  1. The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document 
and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each 
subject will be asked whether  the subject wants  documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or  
 
  2. The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to s ubjects and involves no 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 
In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the 
investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the research.

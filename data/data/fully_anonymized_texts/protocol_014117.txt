1.1 Study  Objectives
1.1.1 Primary  Objectives
To  determine the impact of a chemokine-modulatory regimen on the immune 
microenvironment of colorectal liver metastases, specifically the changes in the ratio 
between CTL marker (CD8a gene expression) to Treg markers (FoxP3 gene expression)
1.1.2 Secondary  Objectives
Estimate  the objective response rate of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in metastatic 
colorectal cancer (per RECIST 1.1)
Examine  the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of Interferon Alpha-2b, 
rintatolimod, and celecoxib when given as chemokine modulation to colorectal cancer 
patients prior to surgical resection using the CTEP NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0).
1.1.3 Exploratory  Objectives
Estimate  the median progression free survival of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in 
metastatic colorectal cancer.
Estimate  overall survival in participants with recurrent and/or metastatic unresectable 
colorectal cancer who received the chemokine-modulatory regimen
To  conduct correlative science studies including:
oComparison  (using RT-PCR, Immunofluorescence [IF] and immunohistochemistry 
[IHC] on serial sections) of the metastatic tissue specimen with regard to total 
numbers of infiltrating T cells, their CD4/CD8 ratios, frequencies of FoxP3 cells, 
and the expression of chemokine receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CXCR3, 
CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, and CXCR4).
oEvaluate  the local expression of T eff-attracting chemokines (CCR5, CXCL9, 
CXCL10 and CXCL11) and T reg-favoring chemokines (CCL22 and CXCL12) 
using IF and RT-PCR.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Metastatic  Colorectal Cancer
Cancer of the  colon and rectum (colorectal cancer, CRC) is the third leading site of cancer 
diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002] and the most common form of gastrointestinal malignancy. 
It accounts for approximately 150,000 new cases annually. Hepatic metastases as the sole or 
dominant site of life-limiting disease occur in approximately 20-50% of all patients. Median 
survival for patients with untreated hepatic metastases ranges from 4-12 months [1]. Complete 
surgical resection of isolated hepatic metastases has been demonstrated in numerous series to result 
in 5-year overall survival up to 58% in some series [2]. However, most patients are not candidates 
for resection and systemic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Systemic chemotherapy with

PROTOCOL TITLE: Phase 2A Study Evaluating a Chemokine-Modulatory Regimen in Patients 
with Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver 
Date [ADDRESS_671495] improvements in survival as compared with 
supportive care alone (8-14 months) [3]. The addition of oxaliplatin or irinotecan can increase 
survival up to 24 months. The addition of further biologic agents, including bevacizumab and 
cetuximab, further improves median survival to approximately 30 months [4]. However, gains in 
outcomes have petered off with the most recently approved agents. In the last [ADDRESS_671496] been approved, 2 of 3 confer a median survival benefit of less than two months 
[5, 6]. Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517792]. 
On the basis on compelling activity in MSI-H (micro-satellite instability-high)/MMR (mismatch 
repair) deficient cancer, PD-1 targeting therapy has recently been approved in MSI-H tumors and 
offers new hope for these patients [7]. However, MSI-H tumors represent just 3% of all stage IV 
colorectal cancers [8]. For the other 97%, great need remains. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517793].
2.2 Critical  Role of the Chemokine-Driven T Cell Migration in Colorectal and Other 
Cancers
The numbers  of effector T cells (T eff) in CRC tissues have been shown to be an independent 
prognostic marker in CRC, with their high numbers predicting a delayed time to tumor recurrence 
[9-12]. In contrast, regulatory T cells (T reg) in CRC patients are associated with poor tumor 
responses [13-16]. Chemokines and their respective receptors are critical for T cell migration and 
homing into tissues during homeostasis and inflammation [17-22]. Several studies have shown 
that chemokines are equally important for migration and homing in cancer tissues. For example, 
the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are critical for T cell entry into tumors, a process 
which is guided by [CONTACT_90169]-tumoral expression of their respective chemokines. High levels of the 
chemokine ligands for CCR5 (CCL5/RANTES) and CXCR3 (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, 
CXCL11/I-TAC) in tumor tissue have been associated with infiltration of CD8 T cells in CRC 
[23], malignant melanoma [24] and gastric cancer [25]. High CXCR3+ T cells in the peripheral 
circulation for example have been associated with increased survival of stage III melanoma 
patients [26]. In contrast, high levels of CCL22 (ligand for CCR4) expression by [CONTACT_405] 
(DC) or macrophages in ovarian ascites leads to recruitment of regulatory T cells; a pattern 
associated with decreased patient survival [27]. 
As shown  by [CONTACT_517809], selective enrichment of T cells with specific chemokine receptors 
in patients with cancer may impact tumor response and patient survival. But most tumors do not 
have T cell infiltration or express the right chemokines for effector T cell (T eff) entry. Colon tumors 
frequently show elevated CCL22 levels induced by a Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) rich tumor 
microenvironment [28, 29] permitting the influx of regulatory T cells (T reg) rather than T eff . This 
leads to a highly biased and unfavorable T reg/Teff ratio in tumors. 
This study  attempts to correct the above mentioned chemokine bias in the colorectal tumor 
microenvironment and analyze whether such modulation can help T eff, entry while simultaneously 
preventing T regs influx into tumors.

Page 7 of 63of metastatic  CRC (as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or IL-2), but was shown 
to be largely ineffective [31-48] at daily doses ranging from 3-20 million units/m2, administered 
subcutaneously or intravenously. In the treatment of melanoma, a small study by [CONTACT_517811] [49] administered IFN b in previously vaccinated melanoma patients, and was 
shown to convert immunization into objective clinical responses, suggesting its ability to amplify 
the effectiveness of local T cells infiltration and/or function at the tumor site. Vaishampayan et al 
examined IFNα-2b 5 million units subcutaneously three times a week following vaccination with 
a melanoma vaccine (Melacine) [50]. Treatment at this dose was well tolerated. Similarly Mitchell 
at al recently completed a large trial examining IFNα-2b, 5 million units subcutaneously three 
times a week for one year [51]. Di Pucchi and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_517794] a 
melanoma peptide vaccine with IFNα-2b, 3 million units subcutaneously three times a week, with 
little to no toxicity. 
We propose  to include a short course of high dose Interferon Alpha-2b (20 million units/m2, IV, 
daily for  3 days), a dose similar or lower than the previously evaluated dose in melanoma patients 
[52-54]. In this  group of patients, in accordance with previous reports, we expect to consistently 
observe flu-like symptoms but no regimen limiting toxicities, particularly taking into account the 
short duration of this administration.
Celecoxib has  been extensively studied in long term clinical trials in patients predisposed to the 
development of colorectal cancer [55, 56]. However, there is to our knowledge, no clinical data 
examining its use as a short term immune modulator in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy. Several 
studies in murine models have suggested improved efficacy of anti-tumor vaccination with Cox-2 
inhibition [57-59]. Recent literature suggests increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events 
associated with the administration of some selective Cox-2 inhibitors [60-62].The literature 
regarding the precise risk with celecoxib remains controversial, with reported cardiovascular side 
effects observed mainly in long-term users. It has been suggested that lower doses and shorter 
lengths of administration may decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. This trial will 
involve a short course of celecoxib, consisting of 200 mg twice a day for 3 days during 
administration of the chemokine modulation.
Rintatolimod (Selective  toll-like receptor-3 [TLR3] Ligand; analog of poly IC with reduced 
toxicity for i. v. use). 
Rintatolimod is  a TLR3 specific Poly IC analog in which the cytidylic acid chain has uridylic acid 
substitutions at a molar ratio of 12:1. Chemokine modulation in temporal association with type I 
interferon administration is observed with this agent.
Rintatolimod has  been studied extensively in multiple clinical settings including cancer, chronic 
viral infection, vaccination protocols, and in chronic treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome.
Rintatolimod (Ampligen®)  has been generally well tolerated with only a low incidence of clinical 
toxicity. Clinical experience with Rintatolimod now totals over 800 patients with more than 200 
patients receiving Rintatolimod for up to one (1) year, over 50 patients up to two (2) years, and 
more than 20 patients over two (2) years.
The proposed  dosage of 200 mg IV is the starting dose used in chronic treatment of Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). That dose is escalated to 400 mg IV twice weekly for the CFS indication; 
however for use as a chemokine modulator, pharmacologic peak serum levels are achieved at 200 
mg; thus, 200 mg daily for 3 days will be incorporated for the immune modulation regimen.

production of the effector T cell-attracting chemokines.
2.4 Clinial experience with Rintatolimod (Ampligen®) in combination with Interferon 
Alpha-2b and Celecoxib.
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (UPCI 10-131)  was a phase I study which evaluated the combination of 
rintatolimod, interferon-Alpha 2b, and Celecoxib administered for one course over 5 days, prior 
to tumor resection. The phase I study was completed, with escalation to the maximal planned dose, 
without the emergence of undue toxicity. A 5 day regimen consisting of rintatolimod 200 mg IV 
daily, Interferon Alpha-2b (20 million units/ m2) IV daily and celecoxib 200 mg po bid was deemed 
tolerable and suitable for further investigation. 
In addition to  the demonstrated safety, preliminary evidence of biologic efficacy was observed. 
Individuals who were treated with CKM prior to resection, demonstrated an improvement in 
intratumoral CD8/FOXP3 ratios as well as CXCL10/CCL22 ratios when compared to 
nonrandomized controls, treated with standard care at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. The design 
(neo-adjuvant treatment) and numbers of patients treated do not permit any meaningful estimate 
of clinical outcomes or radiographic response at this time. 
In addition to  the evaluation of rintatolimod, interferon Alpha-2b and Celecoxib administered i. v. 
for one course over 5 days, as a stand-alone treatment,  the same combinations (but different 
administration regimens) are being evaluated  as a part of combinatorial regimens in additional 
patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] / UPCI 12-110) and recurrent ovarian 
cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] / UPCI 11-128). Clinical trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (over 50 patients evaluated

regimen, with rintatolimod administered on days 2 and 4 of each cycle). Clinical trial

chemotherapy followed (with 1 day delay) with single i.p. doses of rintatolimod (with increasing 
i.p. doses of IFN and a standard dose of celecoxib (orally).
No DLTs have been observed in either of these trials.
2.5 Rationale  and significance
As detailed above,  a previously-demonstrated correlation between the density of CRC-infiltrating 
effector T cells and long-term outcomes [11, 12] has been established. In our preclinical ex vivo 
studies performed using explants of resected metastatic CRC, the combination of IFNα with 
nonselective or COX2-selective inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis resulted in elevated 
production of the effector T cell-attracting chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5. This was associated 
with concomitant suppression of the intratumoral expression of CCL22, a T reg-attracting 
chemokine [63, 64]. However, in a subset of patients, the optimal results, particularly with regard 
to CCL5 induction, required additional stimulation by a third agent, a TLR3 Ligand. 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] demonstrated the safety of the CKM regimen administered over [ADDRESS_671498] on 
colorectal were demonstrated, this would strongly support further investigation, as a self-standing 
treatment in adjuvant settings or in combination with checkpoint blockade, vaccination or adoptive 
T cell transfer, which all depend on the presence of T cells in tumor microenvironments (or the 
ability of T cells to enter tumors).
We seek  to establish the immunologic impact of an abridged 3 day course of a chemokine regimen, 
consisting of Interferon Alpha-2b, celecoxib, and rintatolimod, administered in repeated sessions 
over 3 weeks. A 3 day regimen will be used preferentially over the 5 day regimen due to concerns 
of chronic toxicity with multiple cycles and also for ease of implementation and participant 
scheduling. We further seek to evaluate clinical activity and to confirm the observed safety profile 
with repeated dosing. We hypothesize that the proposed chemokine modulation treatment in 
recurrent/metastatic CRC patients may increase the density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILS) and provide anti-cancer benefit.
Treatment with  serial liver biopsies will allow us the comparative analysis of the effect of 
chemokine modulation on the local recruitment of effector-type T cells and the de-recruitment of 
Treg within affected tumor tissues; helpi[INVESTIGATOR_517795] “preferred” chemokine-modulating 
regimen for subsequent extended studies. Such prospective studies will focus on using 
combinations of chemokine modulation and cancer vaccines or immune checkpoint inhibitors in 
patients with CRC. We have, for example, recently observed that αDC1, a new type of DC vaccine 
[65, 66] is particularly effective in inducing the effector pathway of T cells differentiation. This 
was manifested by [CONTACT_517812]-killing function and the induction of effector-type 
chemokine receptors (CXCR3 and CCR5) [65, 67]. Combining the αDC1vaccine  to a safe, 
tolerable and efficacious CKM regimen may hold promise for patients with poor prognostic CRC.

10.2.3 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  of high dose interferon (20million units/m²/d) has been established by [CONTACT_517816] a number of trials. Most notable was the E1684 trial [68] where HDI (20 million units/m²/d) 
was administered daily for 5 days x 4weeks. In that trial (n=143), grade 3 toxicities were 67%, 
grade 4 toxicities were 9% (mainly constitutional and neurologic), and there were 2 treatment 
related mortalities (grade 5) due to hepatoxicity. The proportion of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities in that 
trial were 48.2% for constitutional toxicities (defined as ‘worst grade of any constitutional toxicity, 
including fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, fatigue, malaise, and diaphoresis), and 66% for non-
constitutional toxicities (23.8% for myelosuppression, 13.9% for hepatotoxicity, 28% for 
neurological toxicity).
While the  combination of HDI and rintatolimod may lead to synergistic additive side effects, we 
will monitor subject toxicities for unexpected increases in constitutional symptoms, 
myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and neurological toxicity. Moreover, the presence of celecoxib 
may improve the side effect profile. Rather than a separate phase of the study to characterize safety, 
we will use continual Bayesian monitoring of SAEs with a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_517801] (DSMC).  
We will focus on monitoring for grade 3 or greater treatment related hematologic toxicities, and 
grade 4 or greater treatment related non-hematologic toxicities. A non-informative prior 
distribution of SAEs will be utilized to develop the safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (details in Section 19.4).
Gastrointestinal  Toxicity:
oNausea  and/or vomiting should be controlled with adequate antiemetic therapy. 
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy can be used at the discretion of the 
investigator/sub-investigator. Subjects are encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids.
oDiarrhea  should be managed with appropriate antidiarrheal therapy. Subjects 
should be encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids. If symptoms do not decrease to 
grade 1 or less with adequate antidiarrheal therapy, all protocol drugs should be 
held until resolved to < grade 1.
Pain
oFor  fever or mild local pain, acetaminophen will be utilized at the discretion of the 
investigator/sub-investigator or designee.
Hypersensitivity  Reactions
Caution: Subjects who  had a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction have been successfully 
re-challenged, but careful attention to prophylaxis and bedside monitoring of vital signs is 
recommended. Hypersensitivity reactions to Interferon Alpha-2b  and/or rintatolimod will be 
managed as follows:
oMild symptoms  (e.g., mild flushing, rash, pruritus): Complete infusion. Supervise 
at bedside. No treatment required.

13 RISKS TO SUBJECTS
13.1 Celecoxib
Prolonged use  of celecoxib may cause dyspepsia, headaches (including migraines) and borderline 
elevated liver function tests (which could indicate liver damage). Recently, information from three 
long-term studies of celecoxib has become available. In the first study, a cancer prevention study, 
an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and/or deaths resulting from heart or blood vessel disease 
was reported among people taking celecoxib. Approximately [ADDRESS_671528], between 2 and 
3 in 100 subjects taking celecoxib (between 400 and 800 mg daily) had one of these serious events. 
Another clinical cancer prevention study found no increased risks in subjects taking celecoxib [ADDRESS_671529] study, an Alzheimer's disease prevention study, did not find increased risks 
with celecoxib. Dosing has been suspended in all three of these studies based on the findings of 
the first cancer prevention study. As a result, the FDA is now evaluating the possibility that 
celecoxib increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and or death resulting from heart or blood vessel 
disease. Known infrequent side effects of celecoxib include nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, 
flatulence, abdominal and stomach pain, bleeding ulcer, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, peripheral edema, back pain, dizziness, insomnia, and skin rash. 
Rare risks include sudden death (unexpected or instant death that occurs within minutes or hours 
from any cause other than violence), vasculitis, hepatitis, liver failure, kidney failure, blood 
dyscrasia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, viral meningitis, severe allergic reaction, visual changes, 
and transient ischemic attack. Warnings/Precautions: Stomach problems may be more likely to 
occur if patients drink alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine. Taking two or more of the 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs together on a regular basis may increase the chance of 
unwanted effects. Also, taking acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_402662], or ketorolac (e.g., 
Toradol) regularly, while taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, may increase the chance 
of unwanted effects. The risk will depend on how much of each medicine is taken every day and 
how long the medicines are taken together. Therefore, patients should not take acetaminophen or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_517802] (e.g., Toradol). Clinical studies with celecoxib have 
identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and lithium. Experience with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests the potential for interactions with 
furosemide and ACE inhibitors. Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to celecoxib. Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have demonstrated 
allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides. Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have 
experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_162882]. 
Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients.

Page 25 of 6313.2 Interferon Alpha-2b
Interferon Alpha-2b  may cause fever, chills and flu-like symptoms; loss of appetite; nausea; 
vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain; fatigue; lowered white blood count may increase risk of 
infection; lowered platelets may lead to an increase in bruising or bleeding; hair loss. Other risks 
which may be common in cases of prolonged administration of Interferon Alpha-2b include 
drowsiness; temporary confusion; anxiety, amnesia, irritability, confusion, delusions and 
depression which can be severe; numbness and/or tingling in the hands and/or feet, skin rashes and 
inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation of the pancreas is swelling or irritation of the pancreas 
which may result in tenderness or pain in the stomach and/or back. When the pancreas is inflamed, 
the body is not able to absorb all the nutrients it needs.

1200 mg i. v. twice weekly. No evidence of dose-limiting organ toxicity, including hematologic, 
liver, or renal toxicity, has been observed.
Adverse events  related to infusion such as mild flu-like symptoms, transient headache, fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue/malaise which were seen, usually occur during the initial weeks of 
treatment and tend to subside on repeated administration. These side events were seen in Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome patients, cancer patients, chronic hepatitis B infected patients and individuals 
infected with HIV at doses of [ADDRESS_671531], which has been 
observed in approximately 10% of patients treated in various studies. Usually the flushing is both 
mild and transient and disappears with repeated dosing. Occasionally, it can be accompanied by a 
tightness of the chest, tachycardia, anxiety, shortness of breath, subjective reports of "feeling hot", 
diaphoresis and nausea. The reaction is usually infusion-rate dependent and can generally be 
controlled by [CONTACT_1743]. An antihistamine (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) can 
be helpful in controlling and reducing the response in the occasional patient for whom the symptom 
persists. Other less frequently occurring adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, itching, urticaria, 
bronchospasm, transient hypotension, photophobia, rash, bradycardia and transient visual 
disturbances. A severe unexpected local reaction to extravasation of rintatolimod (Ampligen®, 
Poly I:Poly C 12U) at the infusion site in the dorsum of the left hand was reported in a Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome patient with chilblains. Several patients experienced liver enzyme level 
elevations while receiving Rintatolimod associated with chronic dosing over many weeks.
Rintatolimod has been  dosed in combination with alpha interferon in investigator initiated studies 
under investigator IND applications during the period between December 1985 and April 1994. A 
total of 24 patients received combination treatments. Clinical conditions included renal cell 
carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. Rintatolimod  was 
given as an IV infusion at a dose of 300 mg twice weekly. The starting dose was sometimes as low

chills, cold feeling, fatigue, decreased appetite, fever, muscular aches. Also shortness of breath has 
been seen as well as hypotension, nausea, anemia, dyspnea, numbness, itching and blurred vision. 
These adverse events were judged possibly related to the condition of the patients, but also possibly 
related to the administration of rintatolimod or interferon. In some cases worsening of the patient’s 
condition has been seen due to tumor progression, but in general favorable clinical patterns were 
observed in these patients with advanced disease. Such combinations were not intended to be 
immune modulating and were evaluated in the context of clinical cancer care.

After processing, all  samples for correlative analysis (blood and tissue) will be sent to [CONTACT_517832]’s laboratory for storage and analysis (CCC, C-502). Samples will be used for planned 
study assays as well as for future analysis for other, yet to be identified biomarkers that may be 
related to clinical outcome. Any clinical data that is associated with the samples will be stored on 
a secured server in the Department of Medicine, will be accessible only by [CONTACT_978], co-investigators 
and PI-designated data manager and, will be password protected. All computer entry and 
networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107].
Note: All  investigator or analyzing research laboratories housing research samples need to 
maintain current Temperature Logs and study-specific Sample Tracking and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_191195]. The 
Principal Investigator/Laboratory Manager must ensure that the stated lab(s) have a process in

17 SAFETY  EVALUATION
17.1 Adverse  Events
17.1.1 Definition
An adverse  event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, 
‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
in other study-related documents.
Diagnosis  Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a  diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up information.
Adverse  Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general,  AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically  significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a 
severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded 
separately on the CRF.
Abnormal  Laboratory Values
Only clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
APPROVED RPCI IRB

PROTOCOL TITLE: Phase 2A Study Evaluating a Chemokine-Modulatory Regimen in Patients 
with Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver 
Date 102920
Page 28 of 63If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse 
Event CRF.
If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated blood potassium level of 7 mEq/L should 
be recorded as “hyperkalemia”
Observations of the  same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes.
Preexisting  Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting medical condition  should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events 
on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition 
has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
17.2 Grading and Reporting Adverse Events
Grading  and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. 
CTEP Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.
AEs not  covered by [CONTACT_248289], and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE 
Version 4.
The relationship  of event to study drug will be documented by [CONTACT_73951]:
Unrelated: The  event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the 
participant.
Unlikely: The  event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.
Possible: The  event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Probable: The  event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.

17.3 Serious  Adverse Events
A serious adverse  event (SAE) is any adverse event (experience) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_517804]:
Death.
A  life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a participant or 
participants, in the view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from 
the reaction as it occurred. It does NOT include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.
Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (for > 24 hours).
A  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
A  congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Important  Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.
Reporting Serious Adverse Events
All new  SAEs occurring from the date the participant signs the study consent until [ADDRESS_671536], will be reported. The

written authorization of the participant.
19 STATISTICAL PLAN
19.1 Study  Design/Endpoints
This is  a Phase 2A study of the chemokine-modulating regimen Celecoxib, IFNα, and rintatolimod. 
The regimen will be evaluated via serial biopsies comparing the quantity of tumor infiltrating 
CD8+ cells prior to therapy with that seen post-therapy. Tumor imaging will be repeated at day 46 
(+/- 3 days) to assess objective response to therapy. Tumor infiltrating CD8+ cells in the biopsied 
tumor will be measured by [CONTACT_4503]-PCR and results will be expressed as a ratio to a 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171520]. 
19.2 Power and Sample Size
Sample Size  Determination: We consider a five-fold increase in TIL expression as clinically 
meaningful. In  a series of 55 ex-vivo CRC tumor specimens from patients treated surgically for 
recurrent CRC, the log (base 10) transform of the TIL expression yielded an estimated mean = 1.2

Date [ADDRESS_671539] deviation  = 0.9. A fivefold increase due to chemokine modulation would increase the 
mean from 1.2 to 1.9 (a 0.77 SD shift).
The sample size  calculations are based on the primary analysis, where the change in TILs is 
evaluated using a one-sided permutation t-test. With a sample size of n=12 evaluable patients, the 
study design has 90% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_671540] deviation increase (pre- to post-treatment) 
at a significance level of 0.1. Therefore we have an adequate design to detect a clinically 
meaningful increase in TIL expression.
Analysis Cohorts  and Patient Replacement: Patients missing pre-treatment and/or post-treatment 
TILs are  consider unevaluable for the primary endpoint, and will be replaced. Patients that receive 
at least one study dose will be included in the safety analysis cohort. Patients that are considered 
‘evaluable’ for the primary endpoint will be included in the primary analysis cohort. All patients 
that receive at least one study dose and are followed for clinical outcomes will be included in the 
secondary analysis cohort.
Demographics: Patient characteristics  will be summarized for each analysis cohort using the 
appropriate descriptive statistics  – mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for continuous 
variables; and frequencies and relative frequencies for categorical variables.
19.3 Proposed  Data Analysis
Primary Analysis : The primary objective is to determine the impact of a chemokine-modulatory 
regimen on  the immune microenvironment of colorectal liver metastases. The primary endpoint is 
the change in TILs, as measured by [CONTACT_398]8= transcript, which is treated as a continuous variable.
The TILs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_5586]-point (pre-/post-treatment) using the mean, median, 
standard deviation; and graphically using dot-plots. A 90% confidence interval for the mean 
change in TILs will be obtained using standard methods. Using a one-sided permutation paired t-
test, the following hypotheses about the change in TILLs will be evaluated:
 versus , 𝐻0: 𝜇𝑑≤0 𝐻𝐴: 𝜇𝑑>0
where  is the true change in TILs (post-treatment – pre-treatment).𝜇𝑑
This analysis will be limited to subjects who are considered evaluable for efficacy. Therefore the 
recommended sample size for efficacy is 12 evaluable subjects.
Secondary Analysis:  The secondary objectives are to evaluate the clinical outcome of objective 
response and  safety of the proposed therapy. The responses (based on RECIST v1.1 criteria) will 
be treated as binary data and summarized using frequencies and relative frequencies; with the 
objective response rate (ORR) estimated using a 90% confidence interval obtained using Jeffrey’s 
prior method.  The safety analysis is described in Section 9.4.
Exploratory Analyses:  The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the clinical outcomes of overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The OS and PFS will be treated as bivariate 
time-to-event data and will be summarized using standard Kaplan-Meier methods. OS will be 
defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause or last follow-up. PFS 
will be defined as the time from the start of treatment until disease progression (defined by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1) or last-follow-up.

Page 34 of 63Interim Analysis : As part of amendment #8, an interim analysis will be utilized to examine whether 
refinement of  patient selection (i.e. earlier line) and tumor selection (i.e. selection of lesion and 
number of tumor cores) will improve: 1) the intra-subject variability observed in the first patients 
(likely due to choice of lesion and abundance of necrotic tissue), and efficacy with respect to the 
primary end-point (change in TILs).
The intra-class  correlation coefficient (ICC) as an interim evaluation of the intra-subject variability 
associated with TILs. The conditional power for the one-sided paired t-test about the change in 
TILs will be calculated as an interim evaluation of efficacy. 
The research  team will meet to discuss these results and determine whether to: 1) continue 
enrollment in this patient cohort at the given dose level; or 2) incorporate a dose escalation scheme. 
If there is reduced intra-patient variability and potential evidence of efficacy (i.e. high ICC and 
conditional power), then the study enrollment will be completed as currently described. Otherwise, 
we may consider increasing the dose of Rintatolimod using an accelerated titration design (detailed 
in a subsequent amendment).
19.4 Safety Monitoring
Safety Evaluation :  A previous Phase I study utilized the same dosing strength (at a different dosing 
schedule: 5  days versus the proposed 3 days), but only gave one cycle; whereas the current study 
purposes [ADDRESS_671541] safety  will be monitored continuously using Bayesian methods with the following decision 
rule: if the posterior probability is .80 or greater that 33% or more of treated subjects experience a 
treatment related  serious adverse event (SAE), then the study will be suspended pending review. 
This posterior probability will be calculated from the study’s accumulating data and a weakly 
informative prior distribution. If π denotes a random variable representing the proportion of 
subjects who will experience a treatment related SAE, we assume π has a beta distribution with 
parameters a = 1 and b = 2.
Selected values  of the posterior distribution PP(π ≥ .33 | SAEs and prior) are shown in the table 
below. Also shown are the binomial probabilities of suspending the study for observed count of 
SAE’s.

*π is the SAE rate. The minimum acceptable upper bound of a treatment-related SAE is 33%. 
PP(π > 33%) is the posterior probability that the SAE rate exceeds this 33% upper bound. This 
posterior probability of an SAE is calculated from the prior distribution, the number of subjects 
treated and the observed number of treatment-related SAEs.
It is  anticipated that 15 patients will be enrolled to this study. The table above presents the 
minimum number of subjects experiencing treatment-related SAEs (i.e., those SAEs judged to be

calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. This will be used as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.

have a reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_671574] met.

lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_279071] [ADDRESS_671575] met.
Progressive  Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression.

will be listed with stable disease.
Non-Target Lesions
All other  small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short

disease progression, taking into account any requirement for confirmation. In general, the

Page 59 of 63participant’s best  response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria and will be determined by [CONTACT_356703]’s status of target lesions, 
non-target lesions, and new lesions.
Symptomatic  Deterioration: Participants with global deterioration of health status 
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions 
should be reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every 
effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment due to symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead 
to discontinuation of treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:
Weight  loss > 10% of body weight.
Worsening  of disease-related symptoms (e.g., worsening dyspnea, increasing 
pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).
Decline  in performance status of > [ADDRESS_671577] scan demonstrates stable disease/response, patients will continue in follow-up with 
CT imaging every 8 weeks until progression, clinical deterioration or withdrawal from study.
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements  should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All baseline evaluations should 
be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks 
before the beginning of the treatment.
The same  method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical  Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.
Chest  x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_671578] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., 
for body scans).
Use of MRI remains  a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
APPROVED RPCI IRB
11/16/2020
PROTOCOL TITLE: Phase 2A Study Evaluating a Chemokine-Modulatory Regimen in Patients 
with Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver 
Date [ADDRESS_671579], the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_397838], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor  Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.
Cytology,  Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in 
tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).
The cytological  confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
FDG-PET:  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New 
lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:
Negative  FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
No  FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD.

Page 61 of 63FDG-PET  may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET  scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

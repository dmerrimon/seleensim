Indication  Hereditary Angioedema  (Type I and II ) 
Study Summary  This is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, parallel -arm, phase 
3b study designed to investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of 
subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema  (HAE) . The study will consist of 2 
treatment periods. Treatment Period 1 (24 weeks) will be a fixed-dose period. Treatment Period 2 (28 weeks) will be a dose-adjustment period to allow for individual optimization of prophylaxis. S ubjects from the [LOCATION_002] who complete 
Treatment Period 2 will be allowed to participate in an  Extension 
Period to  conti nue to receive treatment with open -label CSL830.  
Subjects belonging to the following categories will undergo 
assessment at a Screening Visit in order to confirm their eligibility:  
• “CSL830-N aïve” Subjects (subjects who did not participate in 
study CSL830_3001; subjects who participated in study CSL830_3001 but did not receive blinded investigational product). 
• “CSL830-Interrupted” Subjects (subjects who completed 
participation in study CSL830_3001, but who delayed entry 
into the current study [ie, > [ADDRESS_1177716] visit of CSL830_3002 Treatment Period 1 ]).  
Subjects belonging to the following category will not have a Screening Visit: 
• “CSL830-Continuation” Subjects (subjects who complete 
participation in study CSL830_3001 and who continue directly 
on to participate in the current study [ ie, ≤ [ADDRESS_1177717] visit of CSL830_3002 Treatment Period 1] ).  
The eligibility  of “CSL83 0-Continuation ” Subjects  will include

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  evaluation based upon  assessments performed in CSL830_3001 
(see additional details in the protocol body).  
Treatment Period 1 will begin with the Day 1 Visit and will end 
with the Week 25 Visit. Treatment Period 2 will begin either  during 
the Week 25 Visit (if CSL830 is administered at the study visit) or 
immediately following the Week [ADDRESS_1177718] visit in Treatment Period 1 : 
• 40 IU/kg CSL830 treatment group , OR   
• 60 IU/kg CSL830 treatment group .  
CSL830 will be administered as a single subcutaneous injection 
twice weekly either independently (ie, self -administered by [CONTACT_1560]) or with assistance (ie, with the help of a caretaker such as a parent or guardian) at home during Treatment Period 1 and 
Treatment Period 2. Treatment will be administered in an open -
label manner.  
During the fixed -dose Treatment Period 1, subjects who experience 
very frequent HAE attacks  (ie, ≥ 12 attacks, as defined  per 
protocol, within a 4 -week evaluation period) are eligible for 
CSL830 dose increases in increments of 20 IU/kg  (up to a 
maximum dose of 80 IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are 
optional, and will be made only in subjects who are eligible, at the 
sole discretion of investigator. D ose increases during Treatment 
Period [ADDRESS_1177719] very frequent HAE attack s to 
continue in the study during this  otherwise fixed -dose t reatment 
period .  
Beginning with the Week 25 Visit and throughout Treatment Period 
2, subjects who experience ≥ 3 HAE attacks (as determined per protocol) within an 8-week evaluation period are eligible for 
CSL830 dose increases in increments of 20 IU/kg  (up to a 
maximum dose of 80 IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are 
optional, and will be made only in subjects who are eligible, at the 
sole discretion of investigator. D ose increases during Treat ment 
Period [ADDRESS_1177720]/optimize the dose for subjects who may need a higher dose for prophylaxis .  
An evaluation period for any dose increase in either Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2 is defined as beginning af ter a dose -
stable period (ie,  2 weeks after the initiation or dose increase of 
CSL830).

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  Subjects will attend a Follow -up Visit occurring 14 days (±  3 days) 
after the final visit in Treatment Period 2 or any visit resulting in 
study discontinuation, unless informed consent/assent has been withdrawn  or if the Extension Period starts prior to the scheduled 
Follow- up Visit . During the Follow-up Period, subjects will be 
followed for HAE attacks , the emergence of new adverse events  
(AEs), and the use of concomitant medication . 
Primary Objective(s)  The primary objective is to assess the clinical safety of subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the long- term 
prophylactic treatment of HAE.  
Primary Endpoint(s)  The primary endpoints are the person- time incidence rates of each 
of the following: 
• Adverse events leading to premature study discontinuation. 
• Thromboembolic events (TEEs). 
• Anaphylaxis.  
• HAE attacks resulting in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (where 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847041]) . 
• Solicited AEs (injection site reactions  at the CSL830 injection 
site) graded as severe by [CONTACT_093].  
• Related serious adverse events (SAEs) , other than events 
specified above. 
• Anti-C1-INH (anti-C1-esterase inhibitor) antibodies (inhibitory 
or non-inhibitory). 
The person- time incidence rate s are the number of subjects 
experiencing each primary endpoint safety event during treatment  
with CSL830, divided by [CONTACT_847048]’s time at risk. 
The primary endpoints will be assess ed for Treatment Period  1, 
Treatment Period 2 and Treat ment Periods 1 and 2 together. The 
primary endpoints will also be assessed for the Extension Period 
(only) and for the treatment periods overall  for subjects who are 
included in the Extension Period. 
Secondary 
Objective(s)  The secondary objectives are the following:  
1. To further characterize the clinical safety of subcutaneously 
administered CSL830 in the long- term prophylactic treatment 
of HAE.  
2. To characterize the clinical efficacy of subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the long- term prophylactic treatment 
of HAE.

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  Secondary 
Endpoint(s)  1. The secondary safety endpoints are the following:  
a) The percentage of subjects experiencing the following events: SAEs, temporally -related AEs , increased risk scores 
for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism 
(PE), TEEs , inhibitory anti-C1-INH antibodies, or clinically 
significant abnormalities in laboratory assessments  (ie, lab 
abnormalities reported as AEs) . 
b) The percentage of administrations of CSL830 resulting in 
solicited local AEs (discomfort [eg, pain, burning], swelling, bruising, or itching at the CSL830 injection site).  
c) The percentage of subjects who have at least 1 solicited local AE  (discomfort [eg, pain, burning], swelling, bruising, 
or itchin g at the CSL830 injection site).  
d) The percentage of subjects who become seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 or 2 (HIV -1/-2), 
hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).  
The secondary safety endpoints will be assessed for Treatment 
Period 1, Treatment Period 2, and Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (together). The secondary safety endpoints will also be assessed for the Extension Period (only) and for the treatment periods overall  
for subjects who are included in the Extension Period .  
2. Efficacy endpoints considered as secondary include the following:  
a) The percentage of subjects who experience a time -
normalized HAE attack frequency of < 1 HAE attack per 
4-week period.  
b) The percentage of subjects who are responders. “R esponse” 
is defined as a ≥ 50% relative reduction in the time-
normalized number of HAE attacks during treatment with CSL830, compared with the time -normalized number of 
attacks that is used to qualify the subject for participation in 
the study.
 
The secondary efficacy e ndpoints will be assessed for Treatment 
Period 1, and Treatment Period s 1 and 2 (together). The seconda ry 
efficacy  endpoints will also be assessed for the Extension Period 
(only) and for the treatment periods overall for subjects who are included in the Extension Period.

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  respectively, until the time they undergo the final study visit . 
The analyses will be done both for Treatment P eriod 1 (only) and 
for Treatment Period 1 and 2 (together), unless otherwise noted. 
Furthermore, safety analyses will be summarized by [CONTACT_847052] 40 IU/kg CSL830 and who have 1 dose 
increase; by [CONTACT_847053] 40 IU/kg  CSL830 and 
who have 2 dose increases; by [CONTACT_847053] 
60 IU/kg  CSL830 and who have [ADDRESS_1177729] in Treatment Period 1 or 2. 
The person- time incidence rate of each primary endpoint safety 
event will be assessed  as primary safety analysis, as defined above 
and overall. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Serious AEs,  temporally -related 
AEs,  increased ris k scores for DVT or  PE, thromboembolic events, 
inhibitory anti -C1-INH antibodies, or clinically significant 
abnormalities in laboratory assessments occurring during treatment 
will be summarized  for the safety analyses.  
Extension Period  
Data collected during the Extension Period will be summarized as follows:  
• For the Extension Period only (separate from data collected during Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 using 
descriptive statistics. ) 
• For Treatment Period 1, Treatment Period 2 and the Extension Period (combined) 
Only data collected from subjects who are in enrolled the 
Extension Period will be included in these analyses. 
Interim Analyses  Interim analyses will be conducted on an as-needed basis in order to support regulatory activities.  The results of interim analys es are 
not intended to be used to stop or adapt the study. Additional 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  1 Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder with 3 known types (I, II, and III) 
[Rosen et al 1965; Bork et al 2000]. Type I and II HAE are autosomal dominant inherited 
disorders, which are associated with a deficiency in C1- esterase inhibitor (C1 -INH) 
[Donaldson and Evans 1963]. In type I HAE (common form genotype), an impaired synthesis 
of a normal and functionally active C1- INH molecule occurs  [Rosen et al 1965]. This c auses  
a reduction in the availability of functionally active C1 -INH levels to between 6% and 25% 
of normal [ Rosen et al 1965]. In type II HAE (variant form genotype), normal levels of a 
functionally impaired C1-INH molecule are synthesized, but the normal form of C1 -INH is 
considerably reduced in the circulation. Type III HAE is even less frequent  and is not 
associated with C1 -INH deficiency [ Bork et al 2000]. The prevalence of type I and II HAE is 
estimated to be in th e order of 1:50,000 [ Göring et al 1998, Kunschak et al 1998], with 
approximately 85% of subjects having type I HAE and approximately 15% of subjects 
having type II HAE [ Longhurst and Bork 2006].  
HAE is a debilitating disease and subjects with frequent attacks are severely affected in their quality of life. Clinically, type I and II HAE are  characterized by [CONTACT_847055] (SC) / submucos al swellings of the skin (ie, edema of the extremities, facial 
edema, and edema of the genitals), abdominal pain attacks, and, rarely, life -threatening 
attacks of laryngeal edema [ Bork 2008]. Attacks typi[INVESTIGATOR_192211] a course in which the 
edema increases for 24 to 36 hours and then slowly decreases during the following 48 to 72 hours [ Zuraw 2008].  
Treatment for type I and II HAE can be subdivided into the acute treatment of attacks and 
prophylaxis. T he treatment of choice in the event  of an HAE attack is the rapid replacement 
of the functionally missing plasma protein (ie, by [CONTACT_33980] [IV] administration of C1- INH 
concentrate or fresh frozen plasma) [ Bork 2008, Gompels et al 2005, Longhurst 2005]. 
Recently, compounds including a kallikrein inhibitor and a bradykinin receptor antagonist have been added to the spectrum of anti- HAE medications [ Cicardi et al 2010a , Cicardi et al 
2010b]. Attenuated androgens or antifibrinolytics are effective in some subjects as 
prophylactic therapy, but may have significant  side effects [ Banerji et al 2008 , Göring et al 
1998]. Regular IV infusions of C1-INH can also be used for HAE prophylaxis [ Zuraw et al 
2010]. However, repeated IV administration may not be practical for all patients, and IV access can become progressively more difficult with time.

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  A more convenient route of administration (eg, SC) may facilitate the use of C1- INH in HAE 
prophylaxis. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of subcutaneously administered C1-INH in pat ients 
with HAE have been investigated using a currently available formulation [ Martinez -Saguer et  
al 2013] . The study examined 1000 units (U) of C1-INH, in a volume of 20 mL, administered 
intravenously or subcutaneously; subcutaneously administered C1- INH had a bioavailability 
of approximately 40%, and was generally well tolerated [ Martinez -Saguer et al 2013].  
To further enhance the feasibility of SC administration of C1- INH, CSL830  has been 
developed as a human plasma- derived C1- INH concentrate that can be reconstituted in a low 
volume. CSL830 is being investigated for the prevention of HAE attacks.

Berinert. The major differ ence between these 2 products is the concentration of C1- INH after 
reconstitution; CSL830 contains [ADDRESS_1177738] been conducted in rabbits. In these 
2 nonclinical studies, administration of a single injection of CSL830 (3 mL; IV, SC, intra-
arterial, and intramuscular injection) revealed no findings of clinical significance and was 
locally well tolerated.  
1.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
Currently, clinical data are available from two studies that were conducted with CSL830: study CSL830_1001 and study CSL830_2001. 
CSL Behring GmbH   Study Number:  CSL830_3002

Country -Specific Amendment No. 1   10 JULY 2015  Page 40 of 130 
([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  Study CSL830_1001 was conducted in healthy subjects in order to compare the safety and 
PK of intravenously ad ministered CSL830 and Berinert (the currently marketed C1- INH 
concentrate). CSL830 had acceptable safety and local tolerability profiles. There were no adverse events ( AEs) causally related to CSL830 or Berinert, and there were no clinically 
significant ab normalities in laboratory parameters, viral safety assessments, vital signs, 
physical examinations, or electrocardiogram results. No anti -C1-INH antibodies were 
detected in any subject. There were no thromboembolic events (TEEs), and no surrogate markers s uggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were 
identified. CSL830 and Berinert also had comparable PK profiles following single-dose, IV 
administration.  
Study CSL830_2001 was conducted in subjects with HAE (type I or II) in order to characterize the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of SC administration. Functional 
levels of C1 -INH activity and levels of C1 -INH antigen and C4 antigen were achieved with 
each CSL830 dosing regimen that was tested. Subcutaneous administration of CSL830 of up to 6,000 IU was tolerated with local site events. Safety events were not related to either absolute CSL830 dose or dose per body weight. There was no evidence of a dose-response 
relationship between the administered dose of CSL830 and the intens ity of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Inhibitory auto - antibodies to C1-INH did not develop in 
any of the subjects in the study. Further, there were no TEEs. 
The efficacy and safety of SC CSL830 are currently being assessed  in a double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 3 study (study identifier CSL830_3001) 
that is enrolling at least 80 subjects with HAE . During participation in CSL830_3001 
subjects are randomly assigned to either a 40 IU/kg CSL830 or 60 IU/kg CSL830 treatment 
sequence. Each sequence consists of [ADDRESS_1177739] receives  
the assigned dose of CSL830 in 1 treatment period and placebo in the other treatment period. 
Subjects who participate in study CSL830_3001 will be eligible to participate in this long-term safety study if they meet all eligibility criteria (see Section 4.1).  
1.3 Study Overview  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label, parallel -arm, phase 3b study to investigate the 
clinical safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the prophylactic treatment of HAE.  Section 3 presents a detailed overview of the study design and other 
supporting information.

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Potential for Virus T ransmission  
CSL830 contains human plasma-derived C1-INH and, therefore, has the potential for virus 
transmission to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. However, CSL830 has a high margin of virus safety. T he risk of 
virus transmission is minimized by [CONTACT_847056] , and by 
[CONTACT_847057]-enveloped viruses using pasteurization, nanofiltration methods, and chromatography [ De Serres et al 2003 ].  
During study CSL830_2001 (see Section 1.2.3), no new viral infections were detected in 
subjects who received CSL830. No changes in serology results for HIV  (human 
immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis A virus, HBV (hepatitis B virus) , HCV  (hepatitis C virus) 
were observed from baseline to study exit. 
During this  12-month safety  study, evidence of potential viral transmission will be collected 
as part of the safety evaluations.  
Immunogenicity or Anaphylactic -type Reactions  
Immunologic or anaphylactic -type reactions have been rarely reported with the use of 
C1-INH. Antibodies against C 1-INH have been identified in patients with HAE, irrespective 
of whether they have received C 1-INH. However, the presence of antibodies against C 1-INH 
does not appear to inhibit the activity of C1 -INH [data on file at CSL; Farkas et al 2007 ].  
The immunogenicity of CSL830 was examined as a part of study CSL830_2001 (see 
Section  1.2.3). C1 -INH antibodies were detected for 7/18 subjects during that study; 
however, the presence of C1 -INH antibodies was not associated with inhibition of C1- INH 
activity. There was no apparent relationship between the dose of CSL830 administered and 
the presence of C1 -INH antibodies.  
The development of immune reactions to CSL830 will be monitored in this  study, and will 
include testing for and characterization of (eg, idiotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) anti -C1-INH an tibodies.  
Thromboembolic E vents  
Thromboembolic events have been occasionally reported following the use of C1- INH, 
especially in patients receiving off -label high doses of up to 500 U/kg IV in the setting of 
cardiac surgery and extracorporeal circulation. At the recommended IV doses, a causal 
relationship between TEEs and the use of C1-INH has not been established.

Study Product:  CSL830  
 
Country -Specific Amendment No. 1   10 JULY 2015  Page 42 of 130 
([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  During study CSL830_2001 (see Section 1.2.3) no TEEs were reported. Further, no subject 
treated with CSL830 was considered to be at risk for DVT , when assessed using a clinical 
model scoring system.   
TEEs  including DVT and PE will be monitored during this  study (see Section 8.1.2).  
Local Tolerance 
Because of the SC route of administration and the high protein concentration of CSL830, 
transient local reactions may occur at CSL830 injection sites.  
During study CSL830_2001, a small proportion of subjects administered CSL830 
experienced local administration site reactions. The reactions were mostly mild to moderate 
in intensity, most resolved within 3 days.  
Local reactions will be documented as part of the safety evaluation during this study.  
Efficacy 
Intravenous C1-INH has been demonstrated to be effective in the prevention of HAE attacks 
[Zuraw et al 2010]. However, the efficacy of SC C1 -INH for prop hylaxis of HAE attacks has 
not been established , but is under evaluation as a part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_847042]830_3001 (see 
Section  1.2.3). As such, throughout the current study, eligible subjects will be permitted to 
use medication  for the treatment of breakthrough HAE attacks.  
Overview  
This clinical study may contribute to the development of a new therapy to effectively manage HAE. Given the low probability of potential risks and the study procedures that will closely 
monitor the safety of study subjects, the associated risk -benefit  assessment of the study is 
acceptable for s ubjects enrolled in the study. 
2 Study Objectives  and Endpoints  
2.1 Primary O bjective and Endpoint s 
2.1.1 Primary Objective

Country -Specific Amendment No. 1   10 JULY 2015  Page 43 of 130 
([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  2.1.2 Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoints are the person- time incidence rates of each of the following: 
• Adverse events leading to premature study discontinuation. 
• Thromboembolic events. 
• Anaphylaxis.  
• HAE attacks resulting in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (where hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847043]) . 
• Solicited AEs (injection site reactions  at the CSL830 injection site ) graded as severe 
by [CONTACT_093].  
• Related serious adverse events (SAEs) , other than events specifie d above . 
• Anti-C1-INH antibodies (inhibitory or non-inhibitory). 
The person- time incidence rate s are the number of subjects experiencing each primary 
endpoint safety event during treatment with CSL830 , divided by [CONTACT_847048]’s 
time at risk.  
The primary endpoints will be assessed for Treatment Period 1, Treatment Period 2 and 
Treatment Period s 1 and 2 (together). The primary endpoints will also be assessed for the 
Extension Period (only) and for the treatment periods overall for subjects who are included in 
the Extension Period. 
2.2 Secondary O bjectives and Endpoints 
2.2.1 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are the following:  
1. To further characterize the clinical safety of sub cutaneously administered CSL830 in 
the long- term prophylactic treatment of HAE.  
2. To characterize the clinical efficacy of subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the 
long- term prophylactic treatment of HAE .

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  2.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
1. The secondary safety endpoints are the following: 
a. The percentage of subjects experiencing the following events: SAEs, 
temporally -related AEs , increased risk scores for DVT  or PE, TEEs , inhibitory 
anti-C1-INH antibodies, or clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory 
assessments ( ie, lab abnormalities reported as AEs) . 
b. The percentage of administrations of CSL830 resulting in solicited local AEs (discomfort [eg, pain, burning], swelling, bruising, or itching at the CSL830  
injection site).  
c. The percentage of subjects who have at least  1 solicited local AE ( discomfort 
[eg, pain, burning], swelling, bruising, or itching  at the CSL830 injection site ). 
d. The percentage of subjects who become seropositive for HIV-1/-2, HBV , or 
H C V.  
The secondary safety endpoints will be assessed for Treatment  Period 1, Treatment Period 2 
and Treatment Period s 1 and 2 (together). The seconda ry safety  endpoints will also be 
assessed for the Extension Period (only) and for the treatment periods overall for subjects who are included in the Extension Period. 
2. Efficacy endpoints considered as secondary include the following:  
a. The percentage of subjects who experience a time -normalized HAE attack  
frequency  of < 1 HAE attack per 4-week period. 
b. The percentage of subjects who are responders. “R esponse” is defined as a 
≥ 50% relative reduction in the time -normalized number of HAE attacks 
during treatment with CSL830, compared with the time -normalized number of 
attacks that is used to qualify the subject for participation in this study (see 
Section 4.1.2 [inclusion criterion 5]).

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  3 Study Design 
3.1 Study Design and R ationale 
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label, parallel -arm, phase 3b study designed to 
investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered CSL830 in the 
prophylactic treatment of HAE . An overview of the study is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1. 
Figure 1: Study Overview  
 
 
Footnotes to Figure 1 : 
a  “CSL830- Interrupted ” Subjects and “CSL830- Naïve ” Subjects  will participate in a Screening Visit in order to 
confirm their eligibility. “CSL830- Continuation” Subjects  will not be required to participate in a Screening 
Visit. Instead, data from study CSL830_3001 will be used to confirm their eligibility  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
NOTE: The definitions for “CSL830- Continuation ” Subjects, “CSL830- Interrupted ” Subjects, and 
“CSL830- Naïve ” Subjects are presented  in Section 4.1.1 . 
b  During the fixed -dose Treatment Period 1, subjects who experience very frequent HAE attacks  (ie, ≥ 12 
attacks, as defined  per protocol , within a 4 -week evaluation period ) are eligible for  CSL830 dose increase s in 
increments of 20 IU/kg (up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are optional, and 
will be made only in subjects  who are eligible, at the sole discretion of investigator . An evaluation period for 
any dose increase is defined as beginning after a dose- stable period (ie,  2 weeks after the initiation or dose 
increase of CSL830) . See  Section 3.2 for additional details.  
c  Beginning with the Week 25 Visit and throughout Treatment Period 2 , subjects who experience ≥ 3 HAE 
attacks (as determined per protocol) within an 8 -week evaluation  period are eligible for CSL830 dose 
increases in increments of 20 IU/kg  (up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are 
optional, and will be made only in subjects  who are eligible, at the sole discretion of investigator . An 
evaluation p eriod for any dose increase is defined as beginning after a dose -stable period (ie,  2 weeks after the 
initiation or dose increase of CSL830) . See  Section 3.2 for additional details.   
d  For subjects (from the [LOCATION_002]) enrolled in the Extension Period, their CSL830 dose  will be escalated in 
increments of 20 IU/kg (up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg) according to the rules outlined for Treatment 
Period 2  (see Section 3.2), but their CSL830 by -weight dose will be rounded to the nearest (ie, up or down) 
1000 IU based on their assigned dose  for subjects weighing ≥ 40 kg ; subjects weighing < 40 kg will continue 
to undergo rounding as during Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (ie, rounded up to the nearest 500 IU ).   
e Subjects will undergo a 2- week (± 3 days) follow -up contact  [CONTACT_847058] /withdraw ing from the  Extension Period .

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  3.1.1 Screening Visit  
A Screening Visit will be conducted within the 4 weeks before  Treatment Period 1 in order to 
confirm the eligibility of the following subjects belonging to groups of subjects: 
• “CSL830-Naïve” Subjects : subjects wh o did not participate in study CSL830_3001; 
subjects who participated in study CSL830_3001 but did not receive blinded 
investigational product as a part of that study. 
• “CSL830- Interrupted ” Subjects : subjects who completed participation in study 
CSL830_3001, but who delayed entry into the current study (ie, > [ADDRESS_1177740] visit of CSL830_3002 Treatment 
Period  1). 
The first visit in Treatment Period 1 (ie, the Day 1 Visit) may occur on the same day as the 
Screening Visit. 
“CSL830-Continuation” Subjects  will not have a Screening Visit. “CSL830 -Continuation” 
Subjects are subjects who complete participation in CSL830_3001 and who continue directly 
on to participate in the current study [ie,  ≤ [ADDRESS_1177741] visit of CSL830_3002 Treatment Period 1].  
The eligibility of “CSL830 -Continuation” Subjects will include evaluation based upon the 
assessments performed during study CSL830_3001 as described in Table 6 (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). For “CSL830-Continuation” Subjects, the End of Study Visit of 
CSL830_3001 and the first study visit of Treatment Period 1 of CSL830_3002 may occur on 
the same day.  
3.1.2 Treatment Period s 1 and 2 
Treatment Period 1 will begin with the Day 1 Visit and will end with the Week 25 Visit. 
Treatment Period 2 will begin either  during the Week 25 Visit (if CSL830 is administered at 
the study visit)  or immediately following the Week [ADDRESS_1177742] visit in Treatment Period 1 : 
• 40 IU/kg CSL830 treatment group , OR   
• 60 IU/kg CSL830 treatment group .

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  CSL830 will be administered as a single subcutaneous injection twice weekly  at home either 
independently (ie, self -administered by [CONTACT_423]) or with assistance (ie, with the help of a 
caretaker  such as a parent or guardian) during Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177743]’s CSL830 dose if that subject is 
eligible  for dose increase. A subject’s eligibility  for a dose increase is  related to the frequency 
of their HAE attacks and the rules are different during the “ fixed dose” Treatment Period 1 
and the “dose o ptimization” Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177744] very frequent attacks; these increases are intended to provide an opportunity for such subjects to remain in the 
study. During Treatment Period 2, dose increases are intended to allow the inves tigator to 
optimize the dose for subjects whom the investigator considers may benefit from a higher prophylaxis dose. Dose increase rules are presented in Section 3.2. 
The last  visit of Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177745] visit (Week 53 Visit, Day 367 ) 
of Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177746] visit of the Extension Period (Extension Period 
Day 1) , unless there is a rest period of up to [ADDRESS_1177747] visit of the 
Extension Period will be a new (separate) visit . The Extension Period is intended to allow 
subjects from the [LOCATION_002] who complete Treatment Period 2 according to the protocol 
to continue to receive treatment with open -label CSL830. During the Extension Period 
(unlike during Treatment Periods [ADDRESS_1177748] 500 IU) for subjects weighing ≥ [ADDRESS_1177749]’s dose will be rounded to the nearest 1000 IU (up or  down) based on his/her assigned by-weight dose ; 
subjects weighing < 40 kg will continue to undergo rounding as during Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (ie, rounded up to the nearest 500 IU). During the Extension Period, each subject  will 
continue to be eligible for dose escalation in increments of 20 IU/kg (up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg) according to the rules outlined for Treatment Period 2 (see Section 3.2). 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1177750]-treatment Follow -up  
Subjects will attend a Follow -up Visit occurring 14 days (± 3 days) after the final visit in 
Treatment Period 2 or any visit resulting in study discontinuation, unless informed consent/assent has been withdrawn or if the Extension Period starts prior to the scheduled 
Follow-up V isit.

next sched uled day and time. 
If a subject requires the use of C1 -INH medication  for the treatment of breakthrough HAE 
attacks  within 24 hours before a scheduled injection of CSL830, the scheduled injection may 
be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 24 hours. 
Additional information on the dosing regimen can be found in Section 6.2. 
CSL830 Dose Increase   
Some subjects may be eligible to increase the dose of CSL830 to whic h they were assigned at 
the beginning of Treatment Period 1.  During the fixed -dose Treatment Period 1, subjects who experience very frequent HAE 
attacks  (ie, ≥ 12 attacks, as defined  per protocol, within a 4 -week evaluation period) are 
eligible for CSL830 dose increases in increments of 20 IU/kg  (up to a maximum dose of 80 
IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are optional, and will be made only in subjects who are 
eligible, at the sole discretion of investigator. D ose increases during Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177751] very 
frequent HAE attacks to continue in the study during this  otherwise fixed -dose t reatment 
period.  
Beginning with the Week 25 Visit and throughout T reatment Period 2 , subjects who 
experience ≥ 3 HAE attacks (as determined per protocol) within an 8-week evaluation period 
are eligible for CSL830 dose increases in increments of 20 IU/kg  (up to a maximum dose of 
80 IU/kg). All CSL830 dose increases are op tional, and will be made only in subjects who are 
eligible, at the sole discretion of investigator. D ose increases during Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177752]/optimize the dose for subjects who may need a 
higher prophylactic dos e.  
During the Extension Period (unlike during Treatment Periods [ADDRESS_1177753] 500 IU) for subjects weighing 
≥ [ADDRESS_1177754]’s dose will be rounded to the nearest 1000 IU (up or  down) based on 
his/her assigned by -weight dose ; subjects weighing < 40 kg will continue to undergo 
rounding as during Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (ie, rounded up to the nearest 500 IU). During the Extension Period, each subject will continue to be eligible for dose escalation in increments of 20 IU/kg (up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg) according to the rules outlined 
for Treatment Period 2 (see above ).

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  An evaluation period for any dose increase in Treatment Period 1 , Treatment Period 2 , or the 
Extension Period is defined as beginning after a dose- stable period (ie,  2 weeks after the 
initiation or dose increase of CSL830). 
All CSL830 dose increases are optional, and will be made only in subjects  who are eligible, 
at the sole discretion of investigator. CSL830 dose increases may be made in increments of 
20 IU/kg up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg.  Subjects who are randomized to treatment with 
40 IU/kg CSL830 and who are eligible for a dose increase may undergo up to 2 independent 
20 IU/kg dose increases (at the sole discretion of the investigator), up to a maximum dose of 
80 IU/kg. Subjects who are randomized to treatment with 60 IU/kg CSL830 and who are 
eligible for a dose increase may undergo a single 20 IU/kg dose increase (at the sole 
discretion of the investigator), up to a maximum dose of 80 IU/kg.   
Assessment of Subject Weight  
The weight of the subject is assessed at study visits. The baseline body weight for “CSL830-Naïve” and “CSL830 -Interrupted” Subjects will be recorded at Screening. The baseline body 
weight for “CSL830-Continuation” Subjects will be recorded at the CSL830_3001 End of Study Visit.   
The actual dose of CSL830 will be adjusted, if necessary. The actual dose administered wi ll 
be based on the weight at Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 and will only be adjusted if the patient has a body weight change of more than 10% compared to baseline. If a new body weight is used, this weight will become the new baseline weight and subsequent w eight measures will 
be compared to this. If there is a change of more than 10% compared to this new baseline weight the dose will be adjusted again. This will be repeated throughout the study. 
3.[ADDRESS_1177755] is expected to be up to 58 weeks . This 
estimation is based on: 
• A Screening P eriod  lasting up to 4 weeks (≤  28 days), as needed . 
• Two treatment period s totaling  52 weeks  (367 days ± 2 days) . 
• A Follow-up Period  lasting  2 weeks  (14 days ± 3 days). 
The overall study duration (ie, from the first subject’s first Screening Visit to the last subject’s 
Follow- up Visit ) is planned to be 26 months, but will depend on recruitment.

completers. These subjects will attend the final study visit ( Extension Period Week 88) in 
place of their next study visit or telephone c ontact and will receive follow -up telephone 
contact ( Extension Period Week 90 ± 3 days).  Subjects who roll-over into the Extension 
Period prior to the Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1177757] not participated in study CSL830_3001 will be enrolled so that the total 
number of subjects randomized is approximately 110.

A stratified block randomization scheme will be used to ensure that subjects are randomized 
to a starting dose of CSL830 of either 40 IU/kg or 60 IU/kg in a balanced manner and  to 
ensure that “CSL830-Continuation” Subjects, “CSL830-Interrupted” Subjects, and “CSL830-
Naïve” Subjects are distributed evenly between the 2 CSL830 treatment groups. 
Eligible  subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups ( CSL830  40 IU/kg or 
CSL830 60 IU/kg) by [CONTACT_847066] (IRT). The IRT will assign 
the appropriate s tudy treatment to each subject . CSL  will supply the investigator with a user 
guide for the IRT.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_1177778]  
The investigator (or delegate) will only dispense the investigational product (ie , CSL830) to 
subjects included in this  study following the procedures set out in this study protocol. 
CSL830 will be administered either independently (ie, self -administered by [CONTACT_423]) or 
with assistance (ie, with the help of a caretaker such as a par ent or guardian) at home via a 
single SC injection in the abdomen. The injection site should be changed for each new 
administration of CSL830 ; ideally, the site of injection should alternate between the right and 
left sides of the abdomen and should be at least 5 cm (2 inches) away from the previous injection site.  
The abdomen is the preferred injection location in this study. However, if the investigator 
believes that another SC injection site (eg, outer thigh, upper arm) is more clinically 
appropriate for an individual subject, this location can also be used.

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-

criterion.  
• Is life-threatening:  The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires in -patient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]: CSL  
considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for at least 24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847047] e management procedures (eg, chemotherapy) are not considered as 
defining criteria for SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is medically significant:  A medically significant event is  defined as an event that does not 
necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as non- serious AEs.  
9.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
9.2.1 Unsolicited Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE  (ie, non-serious and serious AEs) is to be assessed using the

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  9.2.2 Solicited Local Adverse Events (Injection Site Reactions)  
Solicited local AEs are injection site reactions at the CSL830 injection site  that are 
specifically asked for and recorded.  
Subjects will record the occurrence of local AEs (injection site reactions) in their eDiary by 
[CONTACT_16134]: “Have you experienced any local reactions at the injection 
site (eg, discomfort, swelling, bruising, or itching)? (yes/no)”. Subjects will be instructed to take notes (outside of the diary) to describe any local AEs they experience and to report that information to their investigator. Each investigator will use the information from the diary 
and the subject to identify and grade the intensity of each symptom. Each symptom will be 
entered as an independent AE.  
Solicited local AEs are defined an d graded as follows:

([LOCATION_002])  Confidential  The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to CSL830 or an alternative cause (eg, 
natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by [CONTACT_1004]: 
• Known pharmacology of CSL830. 
• Clinically and  / or pathophysiologically plausible context. 
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the 
literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, faci al flushing, 
pallor). 
• Plausibility supported by [CONTACT_254847] ( eg, the event being related by [CONTACT_847070]830, drug withdrawal or reproduced 
on re- challenge). 
9.4 Observation Period s for Adverse Events 
Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2  
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the time of giving written informed consent/assent (as appropriate) for participation in this  study 
and finish with the final study visit.  
Extension Period  
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent/assent (as appropriate) for participation in the 
Extension Period and finish with the follow-up visit contact .  
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has started after the observation period has 
finished, and the event could in some way be associated with the investigational product, then 
this must also be reported to CSL Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (see Section  9.6).  
9.5 Adverse Event Reporting 
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have occurred. AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the e CRF. I f known, the medical 
diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and 
symptoms.  The investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution or

followed up until resolution, stabilization, or for [ADDRESS_1177804]  should be considered medically significant and are 
therefore SAEs. The expedited reporting procedures for SAEs are described in detail in Section 9.6.1. 
9.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
For SAEs occurring during the study, the investigator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the AE page of  the eCRF.  An electronic document containing the AE page and 
other applicable pages of the eCRF must be sent (via facsimile or email) to the sponsor 
together with a Notification of Serious Adverse Event at Investigator Site  cover page, 
which has been signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. If an electronic document is not able to 
be generated (eg, internet access problem), a handwritten paper SAE report  must be 
completed, which must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. In this case, the investigator 
should follow-up with a completed, signed, and dated electronic document. 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
CSL830, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event) to CSL .  
Adverse events occurring in the period between the time the subject gave written informed consent /assent (as appropriate)  and the first exp osure to CSL830 that meet [ADDRESS_1177805] be reported to CSL  in the same manner as other SAEs and 
will be included in the clinical study database.

9.6.1  Requirements for Immediate Reporting of  Serious Adverse 
Events 
The minimum reporting requirements for immediate reporting of SAEs include: 
• Identifiable subject.  
• Suspected medicinal product and / or procedure. 
• Event term . 
• Identifiable reporting source.  
In addition, the investigator must: 
• Report all SAEs to the relevant institutional review board ( IRB) / independent ethics 
committee ( IEC) within the timeframe  specified by [CONTACT_1201] / IEC . 
• Submit follow -up reports to CSL  Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance until the SAE 
has resolved, or, in the case of permanent impairment, until stabilized. 
• Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled , the investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying CSL .  
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports (eg, discharge summaries) to 
CSL, subjects should be identified only by [CONTACT_570762]. The 
investigator should not include the subject’s name, date of birth, or address.  
In cases of death, the investigator should supply CSL  and the IEC  / IRB (as applicable) with

All instances where the requirements of the study protocol were not c omplied with will be 
tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the 
investi gator and  / or CSL. Study protocol deviations arise when subjects who have been 
entered in the study deviate from the IRB / IEC -approved study protocol.  
If a major protocol deviation (ie, a deviation that could have a significant effect on the 
subject’s s afety, rights, or welfare and / or on the integrity of the study data) occurs, the 
investigator must notify CSL and the appropriate IRB  / IEC as soon as possible or as per 
local requirements.

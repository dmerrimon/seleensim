PRÉCIS
Background:
•Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood 
cancer.  Survival rates have improved, but outcomes for some subgroups, including 
infants and young adults remain poor, and survival for patients who relapse is <50%, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_83811].
•CD19 immune escape has been observed by [CONTACT_83890]19-CAR 
therapy for B-ALL.  Investigation of this phenomenon reveals a complex biology 
responsible for loss or downregulation of CD19 expression observed in these cases.
•Sequential therapy using CD22-CARs to treat CD19 dim/lo escape is associated with 
rapid development of resistance due to CD22 downregulation.  This trial will test whether 
simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a novel bivalent CD19/22-CAR is safe 
and feasible.
Objectives:
•Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR 
engineered T cells that meet established release specifications in children and young 
adults with CD19+CD22+ B cell ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma following a 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning regimen. 
Eligibility:
•Participants between > 3 years and < 39 years of age, with CD19+/CD22+ B cell ALL, 
isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma who have relapsed or have refractory disease after at 
least one standard chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen, with no alternative 
curative options who meet standard Phase I eligibility criteria.
Design:
•Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation design using the following dose levels: -1: 1 x 105 
transduced T cells/kg (± 20%); 1: 3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%); 2: 1 x 106 
transduced T cells/kg; and 3: 3 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%); 4: 1 x 107 transduced 
T cells/kg (± 20%).
•Participants will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 
mg/m2/d x 3 on Days -4, -3, -2) and cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m2/d x 1 on Day -2) 
followed by [CONTACT_83891]19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. Participants who are CAR pre-
treated (with exception for those with an interval HSCT) will receive increased 
lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 ˆ mg/m2/d x 4 on Days -5, -4, -3, 
-2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2/d x 2 on Days -3, -2) followed by [CONTACT_83892]19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. If fludarabine is unavailable, pentostatin may be given 
as an alternative.
•Patients will be evaluated sequentially for toxicity, antitumor effects, CAR expansion and 
persistence, as well as research correlatives.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Children and Young Adults
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy, accounting for 
approximately 25% of childhood cancer. Disease-free-survival rates have improved during the 
last 20 years to approximately 90% for children with B-ALL(1), however, outcomes for some 
subgroups, including infants and young adults remain poor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_83812](2-4).  Survival for patients who relapse remains <50%, despi[INVESTIGATOR_83813]. Finally, short-term and long-term 
toxicity remain substantial(5-9).  Novel treatment approaches are needed to improve cure rates 
and diminish toxicity associated with current standard therapy for B-ALL(6). Outcomes for 
children and young adults with B cell lymphoma have also improved during the last two decades, 
although outcomes for patients with B cell lymphoma refractory to frontline therapy remain 
suboptimal(10, 11).
1.2.2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] CD19-CAR Therapy in B-ALL
CARs are non-native receptors that link an antigen-binding domain to cell signaling domain(s).  
When expressed in T cells, CARs endow MHC-unrestricted antigen specificity.  Most 
commonly, CARs utilize a single chain variable fragment (scFv) coupled to TCR zeta and CD28 
or 4-1BB endodomains. Beginning in 2010, several groups published clinical results using CAR 
T cells targeting CD19 for B cell malignancies.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_91362] with terminal plasma cell differentiation(12). It is not 
expressed on primitive hematopoietic stem cells. CAR T cells targeting CD19 first demonstrated 
11
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
impressive clinical efficacy in small case series in adults with B cell lymphomas and chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia( 13-15).  The first pediatric report followed shortly after and demonstrated 
striking responses in two children with refractory and relapsed B-ALL(16).  The demonstration 
of exquisite sensitivity of acute B cell leukemias inspi[INVESTIGATOR_83814]19 targeting CARs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_83815], clinical trials from multiple 
institutions have consistently shown dramatic activity of CD19-CAR T cells in patients with 
relapsed and refractory B-ALL, with complete responses rates of ≥70% across trials(17-20).  
Kochenderfer et al.(20) demonstrated CAR efficacy in aggressive lymphomas and reported 4 out 
of 7 complete responses in adults with refractory DLBCL treated with CD19 CAR T cells.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_91363] than that of a non-replicating drug, however there does appear to be a 
threshold dose of CAR T cells required for efficacy and toxicity.  In the phase I study of anti-
CD19 CAR therapy by [CONTACT_43265], the dose level of 1 x 106 cells/kg was found to be safe and 
effective, but the higher dose of 3 x 106 cells/kg while effective, was found to exceed the 
maximum tolerated dose(19). Similarly, the work by [CONTACT_83894]., 1-2 x 106 cells/kg dose 
has been safely and effectively employed, while higher doses have been associated with 
toxicity(20). In contrast, the lower starting cell dose of 3 x 105 cells/kg tested in the ongoing 
phase I study of anti-CD22 CAR T cells at the NCI (PI-Shah) was largely ineffective in the 
majority of patients treated ([ADDRESS_91364] 6), while the 1 x 106 cells/kg dose was, as in 
the anti-CD19 CAR experience, both safe and effective, with the higher cell dose of 3 x 106 
cells/kg associated with potentially more severe toxicity.  In most active clinical studies, the 
recommended dose of CD19-CAR T cells is 1 x 106 cells/kg.  The inclusion of endogenous 
costimulation within CAR constructs permits lower dosing than that required to achieve efficacy 
when using adoptive T cell methods lacking co-stimulatory signals.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.1 CD19-CAR T cell efficacy  
Independent of the infused T cell dose, anti-leukemic effects generally do not occur in the 
absence of expansion of the CD19-CAR T cells in vivo.  Dramatic CD19-CAR T cell expansion 
can be observed, with >1000-fold expansion occurring within 1-2 weeks in patients with high 
tumor burden.  CAR expansion can be quantified using polymerase chain reaction to measure the 
number of cells with integrated virus or by [CONTACT_4133], where is it not uncommon to observe 
that >70% of all circulating T cells transiently express the engineered CD19-CAR receptor.  
Expansion of CAR T cells is antigen driven, but is greatly enhanced following treatment with a 
lymphodepleting preparative regimen. Extensive preclinical work has demonstrated that 
lymphopenia induces elevations in the availability of cytokines that drive T cell expansion, 
notably IL-7 and IL-15, and that increased availability of such factors lead to enhanced 
expansion and improved efficacy(21).  Based upon this paradigm, the vast majority of clinical 
trials using CAR T cell incorporate a pre-infusion preparative regimen, comprising 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, agents known to induce profound lymphocyte depletion.

[IP_ADDRESS] CD19-CAR T Cell Therapy Associated Toxicities
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
Dramatic and rapid expansion of CD19-CAR T cells is often associated with toxicity, including 
cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.  Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been the 
topic of several reports and reviews(17, 22). In brief, CRS comprises a febrile, sepsis-like pi[INVESTIGATOR_83816] T cells.  Among the most important of 
these cytokines are IL-6 and IFN-gamma(17-19).  CRS can be safely managed with supportive 
care and in some cases, immunosuppression using anti-IL6R mAbs therapy and 
corticosteroids(22).  Notably, CRS is limited in patients with low tumor burden with 
contributions from any existing normal B cell population, and CRS severity correlates with the 
degree of CAR T cell expansion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Neurotoxicity
Neurotoxicity is also observed in a significant minority (20-30% in most series) of patients(17-
19) with toxicity ranging from mild to severe.  The pathobiology of CD19-CAR associated 
neurotoxicity is not fully understood, but the clinical syndrome is also associated with increased 
expansion of CD19-CAR T cells as well as evidence for CD19-CAR T cells in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_13858].  In as much as patients with high tumor burden often have some level of CNS leukemia, it 
is seen more often in patients with CNS leukemia( 19), however, patients without documented 
CNS leukemia or lymphoma can also manifest the syndrome.  Hence, any direct association of 
CNS disease burden to neurotoxicity severity is unclear.  The syndrome typi[INVESTIGATOR_83817], aphasia and/or dysmetria, and occasionally seizures.  Radiographic 
changes are typi[INVESTIGATOR_83818] 1-2 weeks and appears 
fully reversible.  The prevailing hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of this syndrome is 
that it reflects non-specific neurotoxic effects of cytokines and/or activated T cells, rather than a 
direct on-target effect of CD19-CAR T cells.  Indeed, the dose limiting toxicity of IL-6 when 
administered in a Phase I trial was neurotoxicity and transient aphasia(23).  In further support of 
this hypothesis, the Jensen laboratory at Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83819] a 
rhesus model of neurotoxicity that utilizes a CD20-CAR rather than the CD19-CAR platform 
and the model appears to model the human syndrome well (ASH presentation, unpublished).  
This provides further evidence against a direct, on-target effect involving CD19 in brain tissue.
In the summer of 2016, three deaths were reported as a result of severe neurotoxicity and 
cerebral edema in patients treated with CD19-CAR T cells.  Given that more than [ADDRESS_91365] to understand the basis for this phenomenon.  Subsequently, two additional 
deaths were noted in the same trial utilizing high dose cyclophosphamide (in the absence of 
fludarabine) and CD19-CAR T cells incorporating a CD28 costimulatory domain.  Notably, 
CAR T cells that incorporate a 4-1BB costimulatory domain do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_83820] a CD28 costimulatory domain, so we postulate that the risk of fatal or 
very severe neurotoxicity may be reduced with a 4-1BB containing CAR.  However, very 
recently (February 2017, personal communication-Seattle) one case of fatal neurotoxicity 
13
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
(cerebral edema) using a CAR incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory domain was reported. The 
CAR utilized in this study will incorporate a 4-1BB costimulatory domain.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_91366] costimulatory domains on T cell 
function.  It has become evident that CD28 costimulation facilitates more rapid and higher peak 
T cell expansion(18, 19), it also predisposes T cells to early exhaustion, which leads to poor 
long-term T cell persistence as a result of activation induced cell death(24).  In contrast, 4-1BB 
costimulation is associated with a slower expansion rate, lower peak level, a diminished risk of T 
cell exhaustion and more prolonged persistence following adoptive transfer(24).  Although 
remission induction rates do not appear to differ between CD28 and 4-1BB containing CD19-
CARs, sustained remission likely requires T cell persistence and thus l 4-1BB CARs may confer 
improved long-term outcomes.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 B-cell Aplasia
The cumulative CD19-CAR experience affirms that prolonged B cell aplasia is an expected 
consequence of effective, persistent CD19-CAR therapy.  Similar to the management of patients 
with congenital absence of B cells, and patients treated with chronic rituximab, CAR-mediated B 
cell aplasia can be managed effectively with immunoglobulin replacement therapy(25, 26).  Thus 
far, significant increase in infection susceptibility or other toxicity related to chronic B cell 
depletion has not been noted(18). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_91367] by [CONTACT_83895] (MRD) following 
standard cytotoxic therapy in B-ALL( 27-29).  However, with the introduction of CD19-based 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], relapse with diminished or absent surface CD19 has been increasingly 
observed. CD19 immune escape was first reported following blinatumumab therapy(30), and has 
been observed by [CONTACT_83890]19-CAR therapy for B-ALL.(16, 19, 31)  In a 
recent report from Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83821] 50 patients rendered into remission 
with CD19-CAR therapy, 40% of patients had relapsed with a median follow-up of 10.5 months, 
and loss of the CD19 target accounted for 65% of the total relapses(32). While the true incidence 
of relapse due to CD19 immune escape has not yet been established, our CD19-CAR experience 
to date implicated CD19 escape as the most common cause of post-CAR relapse in B-ALL. 
Investigation into the biology of CD19 immune escape has identified a complex biology guiding 
the loss or downregulation of CD19 expression. The two distinct pathways of tumor remodeling 
that have been recognized are categorized as the “isoform switch” and “lineage switch”.  The 
majority of cases fall into the isoform switch category, wherein the cells retain all other 
characteristics of B-ALL and there is no clear evidence for alteration in fitness.  In the majority 
of “isoform switch” cases, mRNA specific for CD19 is retained, but is enriched for CD19 
isoforms that preferentially remain intracellular, lack a transmembrane domain, and/or lack the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_83822]19-CARs currently under study as well as blinatumomab(33).  Such 
B-ALL cells resultantly express reduced total surface levels of wild-type CD19 or express an

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91368] for loss or diminution of CD19 expression involves tumor cells undergoing switching 
from the lymphoid to the myeloid lineage with a resultant population with myeloid markers and 
features that clonally relates to the parental B cell leukemia(31).
1.2.[ADDRESS_91369] in the development of 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_83823] B-ALL cell surface molecules.  CD22 is a 130 kD sialic 
acid binding transmembrane glycoprotein, which belongs to the Siglec superfamily.  Signaling 
via CD22 mediates inhibitory signals on B cell receptor signaling via immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based inhibitory motifs, which are essential for maintenance of B cell tolerance(34-36).  CD22 
expression is restricted to cells of the B lineage. It is expressed on the surface of mature B cells, 
but is not expressed on pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells(37, 38).  The vast majority of B-
lineage malignancies express CD22 including B-ALL and B cell NHL(39-45). 
Several therapeutics targeting CD22 have been studied in clinical trials with some success.  An 
unconjugated CD22 mAb (Eptratuzumab), mediated modest clinical activity against B-ALL 
alone or when combined with chemotherapy in single arm studies(46-48).  CD22 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83824], leading to development of CD22 antibody drug 
conjugates and immunotoxins. Inotuzumab, an CD22 mAb conjugated to calicheamicin, 
mediated complete responses in 81% of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL(49). 
Moxetumumab, an anti-CD22 genetically linked to pseudomonas exotoxin mediated clinical 
activity in hairy cell leukemia(50) and B-ALL(51), but benefits were transient due to the agent’s 
short half-life, and substantial immunogenicity, which precluded repetitive cycles. 90Y-
conjugated epratuzumab mediated complete responses in 3 of 17 B-ALL patients treated, but this 
was associated with associated with pancytopenia due to radiotoxicity.(48)
Our group sought to develop a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD22. A variety of binding 
domains, hinge regions and costimulatory domains were compared for efficacy based upon 
killing of cell lines in vitro and the capacity to eradicate human B-ALL xenografts in 
immunodeficient mice.  The lead candidate incorporates the fully human scFv m971, which 
recognizes a membrane proximal epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]22(41),(52);. Among other therapeutics targeting 
CD22 currently or previously in clinical trials, none have utilized this binding domain. The lead 
candidate also has a very short hinge region, and incorporates the TCR zeta signaling domain 
and the 4-1BB endodomain, which was selected based upon superior functionality compared to 
the CD28 endodomain(24). 
Clinical testing of this first chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD22 is under study at the 
Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in children and young 
adults with B-ALL. Results from the first sixteen patients treated are encouraging.  The first dose 
level tested of 3 x 105/kg was chosen to be lower than the current standard CD19-CAR dosing 
because this was a first in human study.  Six patients received this dose with one experiencing an 
MRD negative CR.  A second patient demonstrated signs of clinical activity as evidenced by a 
substantial reduction in circulating blasts, but the patient subsequently developed rapid disease 
progression and did not achieve a CR. At the second dose level, 1 x 106/kg, [ADDRESS_91370] negative CR.  Each of the remissions induced at the 1 x 106 dose level 
were associated with persistent CD22-CAR T cells in the peripheral blood. One of the patients

grade [ADDRESS_91372] since been treated at dose level 2 (1 x 106/kg) 
to further explore activity and safety.  Nine patients (56%) achieved a complete remission, with 8 
out of 10 responders (80%) receiving dose levels ≥  1 x 106 CD22 CAR/kg. Of the sixteen 
patients enrolled, nine had CD19 neg/dim B-ALL as a result of previous CD19 directed 
immunotherapy, and six of these patients achieved complete remission to CD22-CAR. Updated 
results of this CD22 CAR trial were recently published upon. [ADDRESS_91373] been treated to 
date, with 50/58 (86.2%) of patients having had CRS. Of the 57 infused patients evaluable for

From this small series, we conclude that the CD22-CAR shows many characteristics that are 
similar to the CD19-CAR.  Response occurs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83826] 28 days and correlates with CD22-
CAR expansion.  Cytokine release syndrome did occur, but the maximal severity was Grade 2.

observed minimal neurotoxicity (Grade 1) in two patients, all of which was reversible.  Two 
patients experienced grade [ADDRESS_91375] been observed in a few of the relapsed patients. One notable example is being seen, 
following CD22 directed antibody therapy (inotuzumab), where several patients have emerged 
with partial loss of CD22 on leukemia blasts after this therapy. Similarly, following anti-CD22 
CAR therapy, one patient, at the 6-month restaging evaluation revealed a decrease in CD22 site 
density from over 10,000 sites/cell prior to CD22-CAR therapy, to approximately 1000 sites/cell 
at relapse in the presence of circulating anti-CD22 CAR T-cells (see Figure 1, Patient #8). 
Another patient, known to be CD19 negative at the time of CD22-CAR infusion, developed 
relapsed leukemia at [ADDRESS_91376]-CD22 CAR therapy that was partially positive for both CD19 
and CD22 (see Figure 1, Patient #9). Another patient who was known to be CD19 negative prior 
to CD22 CAR therapy and had received inotuzumab prior to receiving her CD22 CAR T cells, 
had a bimodal CD22 population noted in her peripheral blood flow with 89% of blasts

time. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], at 1-month post CD22 CAR therapy, she had a complete MRD negative

restaging visit, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high level of circulating CD22 CAR T cells, she relapsed with CD19-
/CD22- ALL (see Figure 1, Patient #15). Additionally, another patient who was previously 
refractory to blinatumomab and CD19 CAR, attained a complete remission but had a decrease in 
CD22 site density, from approximately 3,[ADDRESS_91377] 
infusion, CD22 site density of less than 500 sites/cell at 1 month (see Figure 1, Patient #11). The 
mechanism for CD22 surface expression alteration is unknown at this time, however constant 
CAR immune pressure as seen in CD19-CAR treated patients may contribute to this phenomena. 
Figure 1: CD22 Site Density with CD22-CAR T Cell Therapy
In summary, the reported clinical trial experience using CAR-T cells for management of B cell 
malignancies and the toxicity profile, supports use of this treatment strategy for children and 
young adults with no alternative curative options.  We believe the lower CRS and neurologic 
toxicity rates observed using 4-1BB costimulation along with evidence that 4-1BB provides 
persistent CAR-T expression with durable responses supports the use of 4-1BB costimulation in 
our CAR19/CD22 construct.
1.2.6 Development of a Bi-specific CD19/CD22-CAR for B-cell Malignancies
Sequential treatment with CD19-CAR followed by [CONTACT_398]22-CAR reserved for patients who 
develop CD19 neg/dim resistance provides one approach to immune targeting of B-ALL.  
However, there is concern that a similar loss of CD22 expression might also occur as a result of 
an immune response directed solely toward one target.  Furthermore, we noted that one patient 
treated with CD22-CAR developed recurrence at [ADDRESS_91378] of an scFv targeting 
singular CD-22, we incorporate scFvs identical to those incorporated into the original CD19-
CAR (fmc63) and the CD22-CAR described above (m971), Figure 2.

The anti-leukemia activity of bispecific loop CAR T cells was established and compared to 
CARs targeting the CD19 and CD22 antigens. Lentiviral vectors containing supernatants were 
generated for the CD19, CD22, and bispecific CAR constructs and T cells were transduced to 
express respective CARs. Negative controls using mock (non-transduced) T cells were cultured 
and activated in parallel. We then tested in vivo CAR cytotoxicity.  NSG immunodeficient mice 
were injected with the NALM6 leukemia cell line that has been permanently transfected to 
express the luciferase gene (termed NALM6-GL, gift of S. Grupp and D. Barret, Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83828]).  NALM6-GL leukemia growth within a xenograft model can be 
detected by [CONTACT_83896] a sensitive CCD camera that can measure photons produced 
by [CONTACT_83897]. On day 3, 
upon establishment of detectable leukemia, mice were injected with CAR T cells transduced with 
either CD19, CD22, bispecific loop CAR, or control. The bispecific loop CAR had comparable 
activity in xenografts compared to CD19-CARs and CD22-CARs (Figure 3).  This bivalent, 
bispecific CAR has the advantage of being able to recognize CD19+CD22+ cells, as well as 
CD19+CD22– and CD19–CD22+ cells.
CML cell line K562 was artificially transduced with CD19 or CD22 or both to express the target 
antigens. K562 cells served as the negative control. 1E5 CAR T cells were washed 3 times and 
then co-incubated with 1E5 target cells in RPMI media at 370C. After 14 hours, culture 
supernatant was harvested and the production of the cytokines was measured with ELISA kits.

animals. On day 3, each mouse group was injected with 3 x 106 CAR T cells transduced with 
either CD19, CD22, Bispecific, or control. Mice were re-imaged weekly and equivalent anti-

Additional testing was performed pre-clinically to determine if the bispecific loop CAR had 
activity against CD19 dim populations. After treatment with blinatumomab, a patient relapsed 
with a CD19low and CD19high leukemia. A patient derived xenograft model (PDX) was created 
with this leukemia phenotype. At day 0, [ADDRESS_91379] CD19 directed immunotherapy relapse.

day 9 with 3 x 106 CAR T cells of bispecific loop CAR or non-transduced T cells. The bispecific 
loop CAR was able to eradicate PDX sample and mice remained disease free up to 49 days 
(Figure 6).

Bispecific Loop CAR T cells.
Other strategies that could provide a dual-targeting strategy include either 1. Co-transduction of 
both CARs into one T cell or 2. Co-infusion strategy by [CONTACT_83900]-CD19 CAR and anti-
CD22 CAR T cells would be simultaneously infused. Both were considered as alternative 
approaches to the currently proposed bi-specific CAR strategy. In regards to the first strategy of 
co-transduction, although a reasonable concept, preclinical studies performed in the Fry lab 
(POB, NCI) demonstrate that this approach leads to a much lower transduction efficiency than 
desired and is not a clinically feasible approach at this time. (Figure 7, Personal communication- 
Fry lab).

expression of CD19 and CD22 CAR, which displays as a diagonal plot.
In regards to a co-infusion model (with either simultaneous or sequential infusion of anti-CD19 
and anti-CD22 directed CAR cells), several concerns emerge.  First, a sequential infusion 
approach, which may be preferred to avoid cumulative infusion related toxicity, is ineffective in 
vivo, as demonstrated below (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Effectiveness of CAR Therapy Administration Options
NSG mice were challenged with 1E6 of NALM6 leukemia on day 0. On 3 day, mice in group 4 to 7 
received 3E6 of CAR+ T cells. Mice in group 1 and group 2 received sequential treatment with 1E6 CD19 
or CD22 CAR+ T cells on day 3 and 3E6 CAR+ T cells of the other CAR on day 7. Mice in group [ADDRESS_91382] implications in the clinical 
setting with cumulative toxicity of two different CAR cell expansions—but certainly could be 
explored further. The co-transduction model, shown above, while effective is notably being given 
at much higher doses to achieve this efficacy and is not yet a clinically feasible strategy.
Thus, in proceeding forward with a dual-targeted approach, to explore the safety of a single CAR 
with dual targeting capabilities avoids concern for cumulative toxicity and demonstrates in vivo 
clinical activity. 
1.3 PRODUCTION OF CD19/CD22  CAR EXPRESSING T CELLS
This protocol will test the safety and activity of the bi-specific CD19/CD22-CAR in patients with 
relapsed, refractory B cell malignancies.  Major elements of the treatment regimen, including the 
processing of the cells, the lymphodepleting preparative regimen and dose escalation scheme 
will closely mimic that clinical development of CD19-CAR and CD22-CARs.  Briefly, fresh or

cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected via apheresis will be enriched for T 
cells using a CD4/CD8 immunomagnetic bead enrichment.  They will then be activated by [CONTACT_3252]-
culture with immunomagnetic particles expressing anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb. One day 
following activation, replication incompetent lentiviral vector particles containing the 
CD19/CD22.BB.z construct will be added to the culture for transduction.  Cells will be incubated 
for minimum of 9 days with IL-2 (200IU/mL) then harvested and administered fresh or frozen 
for subsequent infusion. PI [INVESTIGATOR_83829] 12.  Cells will be required 
to meet standard release criteria including transduction efficiency based off of protein-L flow

replication competent lentivirus.  CAR T cell products are manufactured on the CliniMACS 
Prodigy (Miltenyi Biotec), an automated cell processing device designed for closed-system, 
GMP-compliant manufacturing of cell therapy products.  Manufacturing unit operations on the 
Prodigy are carried out in validated closed-system, presterilized, single-use disposable sets to 
prevent contamination and cross-contamination.  All procedures will take place using good 
manufacturing process guidelines
1.4 SAFETY C ONSIDERATIONS FOR BISPECIFIC CD19/CD22 CAR THERAPY
1.4.[ADDRESS_91383] been used in the prior anti-CD19 CAR and anti-CD22 
CAR protocols conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) of the NCI. Such a 
preparative regimen is designed to decrease the number of endogenous T cells, including T 
regulatory cells that may otherwise suppress CAR T cell cytotoxicity, and to induce increased 
availability of homeostatic cytokines thereby [CONTACT_83902] T cells. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is 
myelosuppression, however myelosuppressive effects are expected to be transient using the 
doses proposed. Other toxicities including fever, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, anorexia, 
edema, skin rashes, myalgias, headache, agitation, and fatigue should be easily managed with 
appropriate supportive care. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in about 20% of patients who 
receive cyclophosphamide but is unlikely given the relatively low dose administered in this trial 
and given that mesna will be used prophylactically as a uroprotective agent. Tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS) following fludarabine and cyclophosphamide administration can occur in 
patients with advanced bulky disease.  To prevent this, patients will be prescribed allopurinol and 
appropriately hydrated with close monitoring for the development of TLS. Finally, opportunistic 
infections (protozoan, viral, fungal, and bacterial) have been observed post-fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide, especially in heavily pre-treated individuals. Patients will receive appropriate 
antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g., Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis) during treatment and for a 
minimum of 6 months following treatment.
1.4.2 Risk of Autoimmunity 
Autoimmune toxicity is a risk of adoptive cell therapy trials for cancer and can occur if the 
transferred populations recognize the target antigen on normal tissues.  Thus far, on-target, off-
tumor toxicity of both CD19-CAR and CD22-CAR T cells has been restricted to B cell aplasia, 
which can be managed with immunoglobulin replacement therapy.  Given that the CD19/CD22-
23
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91384] already been tested in clinical trials, it is 
unlikely that unexpected autoimmune toxicity will occur, but patients will be monitored closely 
for the occurrence of unexpected toxicity and if it is observed, appropriate supportive care and 
modification to the clinical trial will be instituted.
1.4.3 Risks of Gene Therapy 
Risks of gene therapy include insertional mutagenesis or emergence of replication-competent 
lentivirus (RCL). While insertional mutagenesis is theoretically possible using retroviral vectors, 
this has only been observed in the setting of infants treated for X-SCID using retroviral vector-
mediated gene transfer into CD34+ bone marrow stem cells. In the case of retroviral or lentiviral 
vector-mediated gene transfer into mature T-cells, there has been no evidence of long-term 
toxicities associated with these procedures since the first NCI sponsored gene transfer study in 
1989. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_83830] T-cells is a safe procedure, continued follow-up of all 
gene therapy patients will be performed as required. The proposed protocol follows all current 
FDA guidelines regarding testing and follow up of patients receiving gene transduced cells. 
Similarly, the viral vectors used have been engineered to minimize the risk of emergence of 
replication competent lentivirus, but patients will be monitored according to Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee guidelines for several years following receipt of this therapy and in the case 
of the development of second malignancy, all efforts will be made to determine whether 
replication competent retrovirus has emerged. 
Of note, [ADDRESS_91385] been collected and will be stored and tested if 
clinically indicated at a future date. (Note: Testing removed with protocol revisions in September 
2022.)
1.4.4 Risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome occurs in the setting of a variety of immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_83831]. The clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], now 
described by [CONTACT_83903], is essentially indistinguishable from infection/sepsis, with fever being 
the hallmark sign. The pathophysiology is related to excess cytokine levels, released either 
directly from the adoptively transferred cells or indirectly induced by [CONTACT_83904].  
Severe cytokine release syndrome can be associated with signs and symptoms of macrophage 
activation syndrome and hemophagocytic histiocytosis.  Grading and management of CRS in this 
protocol will follow the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_83905] [ADDRESS_91386], formerly known as American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) 
(54) which includes diligent supportive care and search for infection, with immunosuppression 
using anti-IL6R mAbs, IL6 mAbs,  and/or corticosteroids reserved for more severe cases.  Using 
such a risk-adapted system for management of CRS has diminished morbidity and mortality 
associated with this syndrome. (See Appendix D )
24
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91387] not been undertaken and therefore the true effectiveness of corticosteroids 
for management of severe neurotoxicity remains unclear.
Furthermore, we postulate that the risk of fatal or very severe neurotoxicity may be reduced with 
a 4-1BB based on the experience thus far that suggests that 4-1BB costimulatory domain-based 
CARS do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_83832] a CD28 costimulatory domain. 
Indeed, lethal neurotoxicity has rarely been reported using a CAR incorporating a 4-1BB 
costimulatory domain. The CAR utilized in this study will incorporate a 4-1BB costimulatory 
domain.
Patients will be monitored carefully for neurotoxicity throughout this study (See section 3.12 for 
additional details). Additionally, we will also have prospective neurologic evaluations performed 
on this protocol to provide additional input and insight into the treatment and management of the 
patients who do develop neurotoxicity.  All patients will be treated prophylactically with 
levetiracetam (Keppra), unless contraindicated, and patients with significant neurotoxicity will 
be monitored closely and treated aggressively as outlined in section 4.7. Prospective 
neurocognitive testing will only be performed in patients with isolated CNS disease (see section 
1.5.5; updated with protocol revisions in September 2022).
1.4.6 Risk of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and Hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLA)/ macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)
DIC and HLH/MAS are known complications of CAR therapy,(55, 56) the underlying etiology 
of which is unclear, but believed to be due to an inflammatory response related to CAR Therapy. 
DIC can present as asymptomatic lab findings but can be more severe and present with signs of 
clinical bleeding. Understanding the pathophysiology of DIC is being further explored as an 
exploratory analysis (see section 1.1.3) and the early clinical experience with DIC on this 
protocol suggests that it is a self-resolving process that can be ameliorated with use of steroids. 
Similarly, HLH/MAS—which can manifest as a constellation of symptoms including fever, 
elevated ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, pancytopenia and hepatic function abnormalities may 
also self-resolve or can be treated with immunosuppressive agents (steroids, chemotherapy, 
Anakinra are a few examples)(57). HLH/MAS may also present with features of coagulopathy, 
so it is currently unclear if the DIC is a manifestation of HLH/MAS, but certainly all of these 
appear to be linked to the CAR-T cell induced inflammatory milieu. Patients treated on this 
protocol will be closely monitored for these findings as they are clinically relevant and may 
require intervention to reduce risks.

The persistence of minimal residual disease is a poor prognostic factor in pediatric patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recent use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has shown that 
MRD testing using this technique is more sensitive at detecting low levels of leukemia in patient 
samples, as compared to the gold standards of multi-channel flow cytometry (MFC) or allele-
specific oligonucleotide (ASO) PCR amplification(58). Flow cytometry typi[INVESTIGATOR_83833] [ADDRESS_91389] monitoring using next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine if this provides a more 
precise way of detecting low levels of leukemia (on the order of 1 cell in 106) that could be used 
predictively for relapse(59-61). Adding this testing to our current CD19/CD22 protocol can yield 
information on very low levels of MRD in our patients and help us prospectively and 
retrospectively analyze data acquired for these patients after CAR therapy.
1.[ADDRESS_91390] 
recent advances in cancer therapy involve the development of new immune stimulating agents 
designed to target T-cells to cancer cells and initiated cell death signaling pathways. However, 
limitations to this type of immunotherapy include lack of tumor specificity, insufficient T-cell 
recruitment/numbers, and the existence of endogenous immunosuppressive agents which 
significantly attenuate or altogether block T-cell activity.
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) expressing T-cells is a new therapy wherein a patient’s own 
T-cells are harvested and subsequently genetically modified in order to target cell surface 
antigens on specific cancer cells. In addition to their specificity, these CAR T-cells can be 
modified to be highly proliferative and possess the ability to negate immunosuppressive 
mechanisms making them ideal agents against highly aggressive cancers.
Specific to this study, bivalent CARs expressing both CD19 and CD22 will be utilized in order 
to avoid the immune escape that occurs when only a single antigen is targeted.
1.5.1 Clinical Trial Update on CD19/CD22 CAR T cells
As of September 2022, 26 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 2 
patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)have been treated on this study across three 
different dose levels and the results of the ALL cohort are described below. 
Fifteen (58%) of those with ALL developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with 3 (11.5%) 
having ≥ grade 3 CRS and all were effectively treated with supportive care, and some patients 
required administration of tocilizumab and/or steroids. Additionally, of the 26 patients treated, 
only 2 experienced neurotoxicity (grade 3) which was reversible with systemic steroids and 
intrathecal hydrocortisone. 
Importantly, 17/[ADDRESS_91391] profile and is associated with anti-leukemia response(62).

1.5.2 Dose Escalation
The experience to date with CD19 CAR and the POB NCI experience thus far with CD22-CAR 
trials is that dose level 1 x 106 transduced CAR T cells/kg is an effective dose. Given that this is 
a new CAR construct, our proposal is to start as a lower dose level at 3 x 105 transduced CAR T 
cells/kg. 
1.5.3 Rationale for Amendment, version date 01/11/2020
Based on the experience to date (n=11), this CAR T-cell construct is well-tolerated but at the 
current dose levels being utilized, we are seeing limited expansion, persistence and efficacy. 
Although initial dose escalation was planned using our prior CAR T-cell experiences, to further 
explore the functionality of this construct, we would like to add an additional dose level on this 
trial.  For several CD19 CAR-T cell constructs, including the FDA approved construct, early 
CAR-T cell expansion and prolonged B-cell aplasia > 6 months was associated with complete 
responses and long-term CAR persistence and response. Thus, we propose to add an additional 
dose level, DL 4: 1 x 107 transduced T cells/kg.
Thus far, no subject has experienced DLT at any dose level and cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS) has been limited [DL1 (3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (n=4); DL2: 1 x 106 transduced T 
cells/kg (n=4); DL3: 3 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (n=3)] and only 2 of 11 subjects has had  > 
grade 2 CRS, both of whom had full recovery. 
We hypothesize that a higher dose level could safely be administered with a potential to optimize 
CAR T-cell persistence and efficacy and that this dose level can be adequately manufactured. 
Additional dose-escalations are not planned due to concerns for dosing feasibility.
In CD19 CAR treated patients, disease burden correlated with toxicity profile and severity of 
CRS; patients with higher disease burden had higher grade CRS(18, 19, 63). Thus, we have had 
minimal clinically significant cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at DL1-DL3, with only 2/11 
patients treated having > grade 2 CRS.

both of whom had full recovery.
Thus, based on the response rate at dose level 3, and limited toxicity profile, we will use dose 
level 3 in the expansion phase of the trial.
Additional changes in this amendment include:
•Increasing the age limit to 35: The current adolescent and young adult (AYA) definition 
used by [CONTACT_6812] (and widely accepted in the oncology community) includes patients up 
to 39 years of age. We will target an age <35 years old as many young adults are 
relapsing with B cell malignancies, that are biologically/ genetically similar to pediatric B 
cell malignancies, and may be amenable to treatment with CAR T-cell therapy, however 
are not eligible to receive the FDA approved product which is currently limited to those < 
[ADDRESS_91397] treated patients up to 35. The 
pediatric oncology branch has expertise in treating AYA patients with refractory 
malignancies and has gained significant experience and comfort in treating this young 
adult population with CAR T-cell therapy. 
•Addition of an option to administer oral mesna and oral hydration for patients receiving 
outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The option to give oral supportive care 
(hydration and mesna) is considered standard of care and a well-established practice in 
the Children’s Oncology Group Consortium Supportive Care Guidelines.  
•Increasing the time from donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to enrollment/treatment on 
study with CAR T cells due to a recent incident in a patient where the patient received 
DLI [ADDRESS_91398]-disease (GVHD). The 
GVHD is primarily attributable to DLI, however, it is possible that CAR T-cells could 
have contributed to triggering the GVHD event.

1.5.5 Rationale for Amendment, version date 05/17/2021
[IP_ADDRESS] Modify Dosing Calculation Practices in Obese Patients
Based on our ongoing efforts in CAR T-cell therapy in children and young adults, and both the 
1) recent increase in the upper age limit and 2) consideration of an non-responding obese patient 
recently treated on a parallel CAR T-cell trial (and review of our own data), we have made the 
decision to revise our current protocol guidance for dosing in obesity. 
To date, there are no well-established guidelines for CAR T-cell dosing in obesity, and more 
importantly, there has been no clear evidence for increased toxicity with CAR T-cells based on 
obesity, however, dose-dependent responses and anti-leukemia efficacy has been well-
established by [CONTACT_83907].  Our current practice (established in 2012) incorporates 
dosing on a per kg/basis with dosing/weight adjustments for obesity for a BMI > 30. However, in 
review of our practices and national obesity metrics, we believe that this guideline warrants 
revision. 
Based on both institutional and national practices, consideration of CAR T-cell dosing 
limitations, and to more appropriately account for pediatric and adult obesity, we will be making 
the following changes: 
•Maximum cell dosing will be capped at 100 kg weight (currently there is no cap on 
weight)
•Cell dose adjustments for obesity will be made for BMI > 35
oPractical weight (as per our current protocol) will be utilized for dose-adjustments in 
obesity
oIBW for pediatric patients will be used for pediatric based dosing and obesity 
considerations (this was previously missing in our protocol)
By [CONTACT_20998] a dose cap, based on weight, incorporating pediatric IBW considerations and setting 
dose adjustment parameters for a BMI > 35, we believe these changes will be safe, account for 
CAR T-cell dosing feasibility and also optimize dosing in obese patients.
[IP_ADDRESS] Utilization of ASTST consensus criteria for CRS grading
Protocol will be clarified to only use ASTCT consensus criteria (54) for CRS for grading. Prior 
Lee will not be used and any CRS grading per Lee (22) in the initial cohort of patients will be 
reconciled and re-graded per ASTCT. This will allow for harmonization of CRS grading across 
constructs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Inclusion of patients with isolated CNS disease and/or CNS3 disease
With experience in [ADDRESS_91399] developed reversible, grade 3 
immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicty syndrome (ICANS) and no subjects experienced 
irreversible ICANS (i.e. cerebral edema). In comparison to both institutional(20) and 
extramural(63-65) experience with the anti-CD19(19, 66) and anti-CD22 CAR(53, 67), the 
neurotoxicity profile of this particular CAR appears to be well tolerated. To date, [ADDRESS_91400] enrolled with active CNS disease (2 patients with flow cytometric CNS 
disease and 1 patient with CNS2 disease), and all subjects tolerated the infusion without any 
severe ICANS. Additionally, anti-leukemia activity in the CNS was seen and CAR T cell 
trafficking to the CSF space has been demonstrated, with a median %CAR T cells at day 28 of

1.1% (range:0-49.7%) Based on the experience to date on this current protocol, the POB’s prior 
experience with treatment and management of patients with active CNS involvement by [CONTACT_4623] 
(CD19 CAR, 12-C-0112), (CD22 CAR, 15-C-0029), incorporation of prospective neuro-
cognitive testing and knowledge of trafficking of CAR cells to the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], we are 
proposing to allow for the inclusion of patients with isolated CNS disease and/or CNS3 disease 
at dose level 3 (3 x 106 CAR T cells/kg) to explore toxicity and response.
[IP_ADDRESS] Allow for reinfusion of CAR T cells in patients with loss of B-cell aplasia and/or loss of 
CAR T cell persistence
Although CD19 and CD22 CAR T cells have a high response rate in children and young adults 
with R/R B-ALL, 40-50% of patients relapse post CAR infusion(18, 53, 63, 68, 69). B-cell 
aplasia is a surrogate marker of ongoing CAR T cell activity and persistence, and some studies 
have demonstrated that early loss of B-cell aplasia, generally defined < [ADDRESS_91401] infusion, 
can be useful in predicting a patients’ risk of CD19+ relapse(63, 68)(Pulsipher, data presented at 
TCT virtual meeting 2021). Indeed, one study demonstrated that loss of B-cell aplasia adversely 
affected the risk of CD19+ relapse, with a hazard ratio 34 (95% CI, 2.1-552; p=0.01). Loss of 
CAR persistence has also been correlated with relapse(63). Reinfusion of CAR T cells has been a 
strategy to try and maintain more durable remissions, with some demonstrated success(68, 70). 
Indeed, there is an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of administration of 
tisagenlecleucel reinfusion in patients who experience loss of B-cell aplasia 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])( 71). Additionally, in our current and previous POB CAR T cell trials (CD19 
and CD22), we have demonstrated safety in reinfusing patients who relapse post-initial infusion. 
Thus, based on the experience to date, we are proposing to allow for reinfusion of CD19/CD22 
CAR T cells in patients with loss of B-cell aplasia, and/or loss of CAR T cells as measured by 
[CONTACT_4133] (defined in section 3.11). Patients will receive the same dose level of CAR T 
cells as their initial infusion, and will receive increased lymphodepleting chemotherapy as 
outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS]. In cases where a subject is reinfused for loss of CAR T cells or loss of 
B-cell aplasia (e.g without evidence of relapsed, active disease), we will monitor duration of 
engraftment of CAR T cells and/or recurrence of B-cell aplasia as a separate event as time from 
the reinfusion. These subjects will continue to have duration of leukemia/lymphoma response 
captured from the time of initial infusion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Increase the age limit to be consistent with other POB CAR trials and with current 
adolescent and young adult (AYA) definition
The age limited has been increased to 39 to keep consistent with other POB CAR trials and be 
consistent with current AYA definition which includes patients up to 39 years of age.
1.5.6 Rationale for Amendment, version date (09/16/2022)
[IP_ADDRESS] Addition of exploratory objectives
Additional exploratory objectives evaluating the microbiome and metabolism have been added. 
Please see section 1.7.9 and 1.7.10 for further information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of prospective neurocognitive testing in all patients, with the exception 
of patients with isolated CNS disease. 
The rationale for removal of neurocognitive testing is that this exploratory endpoint has been 
completed and recently published (62). In summary, in the 20 patients treated and included in the

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91402] scored from patients, 132 (90.4%) paired test scores were stable or improved 
over time. Additionally, comparison of mean scores on neurocognitive measures pre- and post-
infusion demonstrated stable or improved mean scores in all patients. 
As of September 2022, we have seen minimal neurotoxicity, and will continue to closely monitor 
all subjects for neurotoxicity with appropriate evaluations and interventions in place. See 
Appendix B 2:  Neurotoxicity Assessments Calendar for revised neurologic evaluations.  
1.5.7 Rationale for Amendment (05/08/2023)
1.) Addition of exploratory objective evaluating the role for siltuximab in management of 
CRS.
Please see section 1.7.11 for further details.
2.) Addition of alternate lymphodepletion regimen due to a national shortage of fludarabine.
Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are the most commonly used lymphodepletive preparative 
regimens used prior to CAR T-cell infusion. As of May 2022, fludarabine has been reported to 
be in short supply across the [LOCATION_002]. In the event that fludarabine is not available or there 
is limited supply, we propose to use pentostatin and cyclophosphamide as lymphodepletion prior 
to CAR T-cell infusion. 
Pentostatin is a purine analog that is noted to have lymphocyte-depleting properties(72-76).  
Pentostatin has previously been shown to deplete lymphocytes including multiple T-cell subsets 
within a week of administration(77).  The combination of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide has 
previously been shown to be safe when used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)(72, 
76). One patient was treated with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide prior to administration of 
autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells(78),  The transferred T cells proliferated vigorously and 
persisted at high levels for several months(78), The patient obtained a prolonged complete 
remission(78). This group also utilized pentostatin/cyclophosphamide as one of 3 different 
lymphodepletion regimens prior to CD19 CAR T-cell infusion in 14 patients with CLL and 
reported that 8/14 patients responded, although there is no detailed information regarding  those 
who received pentostatin(79).  Pentostatin has been safely used after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation to treat graft-versus-host disease(75).  Pentostatin is generally thought to cause 
less myelosuppression relative to lymphocyte depletion when compared to other agents such as 
fludarabine(72, 74, 76).   Pentostatin synergizes with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide to 
cause lymphocyte depletion in mice, and pentostatin has also been shown to suppress T cell 
function in T cells that are not depleted(74, 80). Recently published work out of NIH by 
[CONTACT_83908]/cyclophosphamide was a well tolerated reduced 
intensity conditioning regimen for pediatric transplant patients with primary 
immunodeficiencies, and that patients did not exhibit increase in infections and had low 
incidence of organ toxicity(81). 
We propose to utilize a lower dose of pentostatin of 2mg/m2/dose as this dose was used in 
patients with hairy cell leukemia whom were deemed high risk patients (those who had 
infections or had myelosuppression at presentation)(82) and most patients who will enroll on this 
trial have myelosuppression due to prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This modest dose to the current

Receptor (CAR) T Cells in Adults with Recurrent or Refractory CD19/CD22-expressing B Cell 
Malignancies” (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_83834], MD), information regarding any toxicity will be shared and 
may similarly inform dose escalation safety data on this study for the initial treatment of 
pediatric patients on this trial. Pediatric patients will only be treated after at least 1 patient ≥  18 
years of age or older will undergo investigational cellular therapy without DLT (observed for 28 
days after infusion) prior to treating a pediatric patient (< 18 years of age).  
1.7 CORRELATIVE STUDIES BACKGROUND
CAR T cell therapy targeting a single tumor associated antigen has mediated striking remissions 
in B cell leukemia and lymphoma. The clinical experience to date has demonstrated that anti-
leukemic effects are associated with CAR T cell expansion(19),(83) and that sustained remission 
is associated with CAR T cell persistence(84). In patients who have relapsed in the presence of 
persistent singular CD19 specific or CD22 specific CAR T cells, relapse has often been 
characterized by [CONTACT_398]19 dim/negative or CD22 dim/negative phenotypes respectively. The 
complex interplay of tumor, T cell and intrinsic CAR properties that influence these outcomes 
are not well understood. We aim to utilize this safety study as an opportunity to collect 
correlative data that will permit extensive study of both the B cell and T cell compartment prior 
to and following CAR T cell therapy.  We aim to integrate multi-dimensional technologies to 
permit complex analyses of the apheresis product, the CAR T cell product pre-infusion and in 
vivo expanded CAR T cells following antigen encounter. We additionally aim to investigate 
properties of B cell tumors that render them susceptible to CAR T cell cytotoxicity and study 
physiologic and malignant B cell remodeling under the pressure of multi-targeted CAR therapy.
1.7.[ADDRESS_91404] causes of T 
cell loss following CD19/22-CAR T cell therapy.  First, in a subset of patients, there is poor 
CAR T cell expansion following infusion of a product that appears to meet appropriate release 
criteria.  We hypothesize that such products can be identified by [CONTACT_83909].  To explore the potential to identify 
such products a priori, we will analyze apheresis samples and manufactured products to 
enumerate the frequency of naïve, T stem cell memory, T central memory and T effective 
memory subsets.  We will also analyze apheresis and manufactured products for the presence of 
markers of T cell exhaustion including PD-1, Tim3 and LAG-3. Phenotypes will be correlated 
with the degree of expansion following CAR T cell infusion.  
Second, we hypothesize that a subset of patients will undergo efficient early T cell expansion but 
will demonstrate loss of CAR-T cell persistence associated with the acquisition of a terminally 
differentiated phenotype and/or characteristics of T cell exhaustion.  To test this, we will

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91405] of Persistent CD19/22 Immune Pressure on Malignant and Normal B Cell 
Differentiation
CD19 and CD22 are acquired during the process of normal and malignant B cell differentiation.  
Persistent immune based pressure targeting these two antigens has the potential to induce 
profound changes on both normal and malignant B cell differentiation.  In this study, we will use 
mass cytometry, flow cytometry, exome sequencing, RNAsequencing and ATAC-Seq to monitor 
changes in the normal and malignant B cell differentiation in the presence of persistent CAR T 
cells targeting these antigens.  We will explore whether this dual targeted therapeutic is capable 
of inducing loss of either or both antigens in malignant cells and whether such antigen loss B-
ALL cells is associated with a particular differentiation state, a particular genotype and/or are 
associated with increased or diminished fitness as evidenced by [CONTACT_83910], or where 
possible growth patterns ex vivo .  Similar analyses will focus on patients with remission 
marrows, analyzing whether normal B cell development can proceed in the absence of CD19 
and/or CD22 subpopulations.  This will provide a novel opportunity to characterize the impact of 
CD19 and/or CD22 loss on normal lymphoid and/or myeloid cells development.
1.7.3 Utility of minimal residual disease assessment
A reliable biomarker that detects disease before it is evident clinically or on imaging offers 
potential to improve long-term disease control and survival. Necrosis and apoptosis of 
lymphoma cells lead to release of tumor DNA in blood circulation(85), DNA fragments in the 
blood plasma of cancer patients: quantitations and evidence for their origin from apoptotic and 
necrotic cells(85). Next-generation sequencing and high-throughput technology can non-
invasively detect and quantify the circulating free DNA (cfDNA)(86). The VDJ immunoglobulin 
genes contain unique sequences that are markers of clonality(87). These clonal markers can be 
used to assess MRD after the treatment and have been shown to prognostic value in DLBCL 
post-treatment surveillance( 86) and other lymphoid malignancies(88),(89).
The role of MRD testing and cfDNA assessment in patients treated with CAR-T cells has not 
been well studied. In this study, we will correlate cfDNA assessment with marrow flow 
cytometry to identify the timing of relapse identification using these two approaches.

1.7.4 Explore the level CD19/CD22 surface expression and CD19/CD22 site density on 
leukemic blasts and correlate with clinical response to CAR-T cells
Based on preliminary experience in anti-CD22 and anti-CD19 CAR therapy, there does appear to 
be a threshold for CD19/CD22 antigen expression that is needed in order to effectively target 
leukemic blasts. In this study, CD19/CD22 expression and site density at baseline and at the first 
restaging will be performed as an optional evaluation, when samples are available, and evaluated 
at the National Cancer Institute (Flow Cytometry Lab: [CONTACT_83982]-Stevenson) where 
there is the expertise and ability to characterize CD19, and particularly CD22 expression. In 
parallel, exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (Shern lab POB) will be performed to analyze 
the correlation in observed changes at the protein level with genetic and transcriptional changes 
at the antigenic locus.
1.7.[ADDRESS_91406] opposing roles. For instance, it is responsible for 
vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, anticoagulant, and procoagulant proteins and when damage occurs 
to the endothelial cell, the delicate balance can be disrupted(90). Few complex cases of 
hematologic diathesis have been seen in patients treated with CAR T cell therapy. By [CONTACT_83911], platelet activation, and fibrinolysis 
inhibitors, we will be able to study if certain biomarkers can play a role in predicting which 
patients treated with CAR T cells will have thrombotic or micro-thrombotic disease. Some of 
these tests have been shown to be predictive of thrombotic events in other patient populations. 
For instance, in cases of veno-occlusive disease, hepatic venous endothelial dysfunction is 
thought to be an inciting event that causes thrombosis, with low levels of activated protein C, and 
increased secretion of PAI-1 contributing to thrombosis(91). Additionally, prothrombin fragment 
1+2 along with D-dimer was shown to be increased in patients with venous thromboembolisms 
versus those without (P<0.001)(92). Furthermore, there is recent evidence that endothelial 
activation may be involved in the toxicity profile(93), particularly neurotoxicity and that this 
may bear resemblance to HUS/TTP pathophysiology. These research studies can potentially 
yield important information that can have therapeutic implications for our patients and enhance 
our understanding of the mechanism related to CAR or cytokine mediated hematologic toxicities.
1.7.[ADDRESS_91407] CRS Consensus 
Grading COMPLETED
In an effort to standardize comparability in toxicity profiles across various CAR constructs and 
targets, there has been a recently established working group which has published consensus 
guidelines on the grading of CRS(54). Prior to this effort, there were multiple CRS grading 
criteria that were used, that make it difficult to determine comparability. At the NCI, we have 
always used the initial criteria that were developed and published by [CONTACT_83912], in 
collaboration, with other institutes. However, to more uniformly inform the field, we will now 
grade CRS by [CONTACT_83913], which will be put in our follow-up manuscript. 
These new guidelines will be used in conjunction with our current treatment algorithm which 
have been well established based on our experience to date. All patients on this trial to date have 
had both Lee and ASTCT CRS grading performed.

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91408] characteristics that may be associated with 
clinical outcomes (e.g., CAR T-cell persistence, toxicity and/or efficacy) 
With significant interpatient heterogeneity and realization of the impact of manufacturing 
changes on CAR T-cell related outcomes—including toxicity, efficacy and CAR T-cell 
persistence, this aim is to retrospectively evaluate apheresis and CAR T-cell product 
characteristics. Remaining products that are not used for clinical purposes will be retrospectively 
and prospectively analyzed utilizing multifactorial analysis to evaluate characteristic of the 
product that may correlate with outcomes. Analysis will be primarily performed in the Taylor 
Lab (POB), and in the CCE. Data will be reviewed in the context of clinical outcomes.
1.7.8 To explore CAR T-cell expansion by T-cell subsets and immunophenotypic evaluation of 
markers of T-cell activation and/or exhaustion
Characterization of the immunophenotype of CAR T-cell expansion will be informative to 
correlate with CAR T-cell persistence and/or toxicity and has not been well explored. We will 
incorporate systematic analysis of CAR T-cell profiling to look at characteristics of the CAR T-
cell, including T-cell subsets and immunophenotypic profiling to correlate with clinical 
outcomes.
1.7.9 Gut Microbiome Assessment of Patients Undergoing CAR-T Cell Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83835], or community of microorganisms that are found in the intestines, is 
implicated in the etiology, progression and response to treatment in several different disease 
processes including obesity, inflammatory diseases and cancer(94). Specifically in cancer, the 
gut microbiome has a role in: 1) tumor initiation and progression, both through a direct effect on 
tumor cells and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system; 2) determining a 
response to cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83836]; and, 3) therapy, with 
modulation of the microbiome being able to potentiate the effect of certain immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_83837](95, 96). There is currently minimal human data regarding the role of the gut 
microbiome in CAR T cell therapy. Murine models show microbial short chain fatty acids 
improve anti-tumor activity of specific CAR T cells and that modulation of the microbiome may 
produce an increased anti-tumor effect(97, 98). One adult study (unpublished) showed an 
enrichment in certain gut bacterial taxa correlating with clinical response and toxicity, and there 
have been no pediatric studies looking at the role of the microbiome. 
Within this current CAR T cell treatment protocol, we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_83838] T cell therapy at the NIH Clinical Center through stool 
collection to assess how the gut microbiome may be associated with a) cytokine release 
syndrome, b) neurotoxicity, c) clinical response, and d) infection. Results of this study may help 
give a more complete understanding of response and complications of CAR T cell therapy and 
possibly identify microbiome therapeutic targets to improve response rates and decrease 
complications. We plan on collecting stool samples pre lymphodepleting (LD) chemo, post LD 
and pre-CAR-T cell infusion (optional) as well as post- timing differing with and without an 
occurrence of CRS as well as with any relevant clinical event. The goal of this exploratory 
objective is to evaluate the gut microbiome in patients receiving CAR-T therapy and correlate 
with cytokine release, neurotoxicity, infection, antibiotic use, and clinical response.

Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91409] decade, growing evidence has accumulated to show the importance of metabolism 
on immune responses(99). Metabolomic analysis also emerged as a major tool in the field of 
immunotherapy and immunopathology. Metabolomic profiles integrate host and microbiota-
derived metabolites as well as xenobiotics or nutrients factors and have been associated with 
high impacts on checkpoint inhibitor therapy, graft versus host disease, and auto-immune 
diseases(100-102). Preclinical studies on CAR-T cells highlighted the important relationship 
between T-cell metabolic fitness, microenvironment metabolites levels and anti-tumor 
function(103, 104). Importantly, the question of how metabolite levels influence efficacy and 
toxicity in pediatric patients treated with CAR-T cell therapy remains unanswered. 
This study will measure metabolite levels in patient plasma/urine metabolites levels as a function 
of CAR-T cell therapy in a targeted and untargeted manner, with the goal of defining profiles 
associated with efficacy (complete response, duration of response, overall survival), toxicity 
(cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome), CAR expansion and persistence. Targeted 
analysis will focus on redox balance (ascorbate, NAD(H), FAD(H), glutathione), amino-acids 
(arginine, tryptophane, glutamine, methionine), nucleoacids (ATP, adenosine), TCA cycle 
metabolites, hepcidin, Acteyl-CoA and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. To this end, peripheral blood and urine samples 
will be obtained from patients at the indicated time points pre- and post-CAR-T cell therapy. All 
samples will be prepared under the direction of [CONTACT_83983] and will then be evaluated for 
the metabolites indicated above. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate how metabolite levels 
influence efficacy of CAR-T cells, and toxicity in pediatric patients treated with CAR-T cell 
therapy. 
1.7.[ADDRESS_91410] commonly seen toxicity in CAR T-cell therapy, and it occurs as a result of non-
specific immune activation, which is closely related to pro-inflammatory cytokines, in specific 
IL-6. In the global registration trial using tisagenlecleucel, tocilizumab (an IL-[ADDRESS_91411]) was administered in 39% of patients, and it was noted to reverse CRS, and did not 
affect clinical efficacy, namely CAR T-cell expansion, complete remission rates, or persistence 
of CAR T-cells( 63).  Tocilizumab received FDA approval in 2017 for treatment of CAR T-cell 
related CRS(105). However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that neurotoxicity or ICANS may 
worsen or can develop after toclilizumab administration due to transient rise in serum IL6 that 
results in decreased clearance via endocytosis by [CONTACT_83914]6R(22, 106-109). Indeed 
patients treated on our CD19-28z CAR trial who received tocilizumab had significantly elevated 
levels of CSF IL-6 on D28 as compared to those that did not receive tocilizumab and a pre-
clinical model in a rhesus macque demonstrated that IV tocilizumab had poor CNS penetration 
(107, 108).  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, an international shortage of tocilizumab prompted medical 
providers to use alternative agents such as siltuximab, to treat COVID-19 and demonstrated that 
siltuximab was well tolerated and an effective alternate that reduced CRS associated 
inflammation and COVID-19 mortality(110-112).  In an effort to find additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83839] T-cell toxicity profiles, several ongoing studies are now evaluating the use of 
siltuximab, an IL-[ADDRESS_91412] that directly binds free IL-6, for prevention or treatment of CRS or

ICANS ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Recently presented data demonstrated that 5/6 patients 
who received siltuximab for CRS had resolution of CRS of 1 hour (range 1-13 hrs) from first 
siltuximab infusion, and only 1 patient required rescue tocilizumab. Additionally, 3/4 patients 
with ICANS had resolution of ICANS with siltuximab and corticosteroid treatment( 113).  
Siltuximab will be used as first line CRS management in both pediatric and adult participants 
treated with CD19/CD22 CAR T cells. Dosing is based on the FDA approved dose for adults 
which is 11mg/kg. 
Based on the limited experience with use of siltuximab in pediatric patients receiving CAR T-
cells, this dose appears to be well-tolerated with potential for benefit in the management of CRS, 
particularly in the setting of neurotoxicity. Specifically, on the multisite CAR T cell trial 
targeting GD2 for patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), [ADDRESS_91413] received siltuximab at 11mg/kg (2 of whom 
received siltuximab at the NIH CC) for CRS without notable side effects (PI: [CONTACT_5263], personal 
communication). On several phase I/II CAR T cell studies treating pediatric and young adult 
patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, physicians at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83840]. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83841] 11 mg/kg 
without notable complications (PIs: Grupp, Talleur, personal communication). 
On this current trial, 19/23 patients treated at the current dose level (3x10^6 transduced CAR T-
cells/kg) have achieved complete remissions. Six patients (26%) treated at this dose level 
experienced ≥ grade [ADDRESS_91414] line therapy for CRS. Additionally, 
3 patients experienced grade 3 ICANS, 2 of whom received tocilizumab  prior to the 
development of ICANS. All patients recovered from acute CRS and ICANS toxicities. 
Given the established safety profile of this CD19/CD22 CAR construct, the opportunity to 
prospectively study additional IL6 directed agents, including those which may have the potential 
to decrease rates of neurotoxicity (as siltuximab directly binds IL6, theoretically decreasing the 
ability of high levels of IL6 to cross the blood brain barrier) serves to expand the arsenal of 
medications which can be used to treat CRS. A treatment algorithm has been developed whereby 
[CONTACT_83915]/or steroids will be employed if participants continue to 
have worsening or refractory CRS/ICANS after siltuximab administration (see Figure 9 in 
protocol), to prevent more severe complications. Treatment will be as per Appendix D : 
Guidelines for Grading and Management of Suspected Cytokine Release Syndrome, Figure 9.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a single-site phase I study in pediatric and young adult participants with CD19+CD22+ 
expressing B cell hematologic malignancies who have relapsed or refractory disease after at least 
one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. All participants enrolled on this trial have 
been deemed incurable by [CONTACT_83925][INVESTIGATOR_014]. Autologous PBMC will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_83926]19/CD22-CAR lentiviral vector. Cryopreserved PBMC 
stored from participation in other institutional cell therapy or cell collection studies may be used 
to generate the cellular product on this study as long as they meet the criteria described in the 
IND.  
The first participant treated in each cohort will be evaluated for [ADDRESS_91425] been used safely in pediatric participants receiving the CD22 CAR T cells and CD19 
CAR T cells. The preparative regimen cyclophosphamide and fludarabine has been used 
successfully in many CAR clinical trials with acceptable toxicity profile.
Participants will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_83891]19/CD22-CAR T cells. Participants will be 
evaluated sequentially after treatment for toxicity, antitumor effects and for persistence of CAR 
in blood samples and functionality of transduced T cells. Additional blood and bone marrow 
samples will be collected to complete correlative study analysis.
Initially participants will receive 3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) as outlined in section 3.7.  
If no adults have received this dose prior to initiating enrollment on this study, at least 1 
participant ≥ 18 years of age or older will undergo investigational cellular therapy without DLT 
(observed for 28 days after infusion) prior to treating pediatric participant, as per section 3.7.  If 
2/6 participants experience DLT at dose level 1, dose -1 will be explored (1 x 105 transduced T 
cells/kg (± 20%)) as described in section 3.7.  The MTD, or highest cell dose studied if MTD is 
not reached, will be expanded in two groups (children and young adults who have previously 
received CAR T cells versus those that are CAR T cell-naïve) for a total of 12 evaluable 
participants in each group to further explore the safety, feasibility and clinical response activity.
With a limited dose escalation and/or de-escalation if needed, utilizing a 3+[ADDRESS_91426] a very limited dose escalation to 3 x 106/kg. 
Based on the data from the first 11 participants treated on study, at the three current dose levels, 
we propose adding an additional dose level, DL 4: 1 x 107 transduced T cells/kg, to explore due 
to limited expansion and limited persistence of CAR T cells with favorable toxicity profile. 
Additionally, participants that have received previous CAR therapy are eligible to enroll on trial, 
however, based on our experience to date on this trial and others, participants may have limited 
responses to subsequent infusions with CAR-T therapy, especially when the same antigen is 
targeted.

Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91427] targeting CD19/CD22, our plan is to enroll participants in 
two groups: CAR naïve and CAR pretreated as toxicity profile and response rates may be 
different between these two groups. Additionally, based on our experiences to date, we have 
utilized intensified lymphodepletion as a strategy to reduce the likelihood of immune mediated 
rejection, and potentially improve response rate in participants who have had prior CAR T-cell 
exposure, and this strategy will be utilized for the CAR pretreated cohort. This intensified 
lymphodepletion has been well tolerated and represent a moderate increase above our standard 
dosing. Starting at dose level 4, participants will be enrolled in separate cohorts based on prior 
treatment. 
3.[ADDRESS_91428] been 
cryopreserved in DTM-CC for a different cell therapy or cell collection study and meet the 
requirements for this study, they may be used to generate CD19/CD22-CAR T cells on this 
study.
A target cell number extrapolated based upon the expected expansion and planned cell dose of 
transduced T cells/kg will be collected. Citrate anticoagulant may be used in subjects according 
to institutional SOPs. For subjects, less than [ADDRESS_91429]: Autologous T cells cultured with interleukin-2; transduced with lentiviral 
vector (CD19/CD22.BB.z) expressing CD19/22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (Anti-CD19/CD22 
CAR); following Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide 
Cell therapy production will be conducted according to the DTM-CCE SOPs and must meet the 
requirements for a GMP facility.  Fresh or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) (depending on the timing of apheresis relative to cell culture, participant condition and 
scheduling availability) will be enriched for T cells using a CD4/CD8 immunomagnetic bead 
enrichment.  They will then be activated by [CONTACT_3252]-culture with immunomagnetic particles 
expressing anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb. One day following activation, replication incompetent 
lentiviral vector particles containing the CD19/CD22.BB.z construct will be added to the culture 
for transduction.  Cells will be incubated for approximately [ADDRESS_91430] 
release criteria including transduction efficiency ≥10%, T cell content ≥70%, sterility and 
minimum levels of LPS as well as no evidence for replication competent lentivirus.  All 
procedures will take place using good manufacturing process guidelines.
The release criteria will be based upon analyses for each dose of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and 
will include:

with active leukemia, [ADDRESS_91433]’s clinical condition, should a 
subject develop evidence of disease progression after enrollment, or require intermittent doses of 
low-dose chemotherapy to maintain disease stabilization or prevent disease progression, but 
before initiation of protocol specified lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the subject may be treated 
with disease-directed standard of care (SOC) (i.e., non-investigational) chemotherapy as 
clinically indicated and initiation of protocol-specified lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be 
delayed. Participants may receive interim SOC therapy either with their local physician or at 
NIH.  If the participant receives therapy with his/her local physician, neither the therapy nor the 
AEs from this therapy will be recorded or reported on this protocol (except as part of prior 
history at baseline) as this information is external to the study.  If the participant chooses to 
receive interim SOC therapy at NIH, the participant will be enrolled to protocol 04-C-[ADDRESS_91434] of Care and Interventions protocol and the therapy and associated AEs will be reported 
on protocol 04-C-0165.

(with the exclusion of steroids and hydroxyurea where there is no washout.)
For all participants that have received any form of SOC interim therapy, the following labs will 
be repeated prior to starting lymphodepleting chemo: CBC, chemistries including sodium, 
potassium, chloride, total CO2, creatinine, glucose, urea nitrogen, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, total bilirubin, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH),uric acid, ferritin, and 
triglycerides. These labs can be collected as baseline labs prior to starting lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy.
Also, per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], the participant may have repeat disease evaluations performed (method 
determined by [CONTACT_4317]’ type and location of disease) in order to proceed with 
lymphodepleting therapy and planned CAR infusion. For participants who only receive 
maintenance like-ALL therapy, as defined in protocol section [IP_ADDRESS], or steroids for the purpose 
of disease stabilization or to prevent disease progression, restaging evaluation will only be 
performed if clinically indicated per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Baseline data will be collected.  Data 
regarding the interim SOC therapy will be captured in prior therapy CRFs, but no AEs will be 
collected or reported for this protocol until the participant initiates study therapy.

progressive disease) after enrollment and either before or after lymphodepleting therapy, the 
subject will be treated for their condition as clinically indicated and administration of anti-

[ADDRESS_91437] the option of receiving the cells at a 
later point once the condition has resolved, but these participants will not be evaluable for 
toxicity and efficacy and will be replaced in the accrual numbers.
3.6 DOSE LIMITING TOXICITY (DLT) / TREATMENT LIMITING TOXICTY (TLT)
Adverse events that are considered disease-related (not suspected of relationship to CD19/CD22-
CAR T cells) will not be considered dose-limiting toxicities. Only those AEs suspected to be 
related to pre-infusion chemotherapy and/or CD19/CD22-CAR T cells (any component of the 
treatment regimen) will be used in the definition of DLT/TLT. As the dose escalation portion of 
the study has completed, Treatment-limiting toxicities will now be captured during the dose 
expansion phase. Toxicities occurring after initiation of the chemotherapy preparative regimen 
but prior to CD19/CD22-CAR T cell infusion, will primarily be attributable to the chemotherapy 
administration or disease, if not extraneous causes. After cell infusion, toxicities will be 
evaluated for temporal and causal relationship to chemotherapy versus cell infusion. Some 
symptoms may overlap, and attribution will not be clearly definable, in which case, toxicities 
48
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
will be attributed as possibly related to both preparative regimen and cell infusion. Toxicities 
will be attributed to the T cells if: 1) they were NOT present before T cell infusion; OR 2) they 
increase in Grade in temporal association with the T cell infusion; AND 3) they are not clearly 
explained by [CONTACT_1604]. Participants who are fully assessable are those that have completed 
the non-myeloablative preparative regimen and received the CD19/CD22-CAR T cell infusion. 
DLT/TLT will only be attributed to the preparative regimen if it prevents infusion of 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.
The definition of DLT/TLT in these studies uses NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE v5).
3.6.1 Definition of DLT/TLT 
Adverse events that are at least possibly related to the CD19/CD22-CAR T cells with onset 
within the first 28 days following cell infusion will be considered DLT/TLTs according to the 
following criteria or exceptions: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological Toxicity: 
Subjects with normal, Grade 1 or Grade 2 Hematologic Parameters at baseline (independent of 
transfusion) and cytopenias NOT due to Bone Marrow Involvement by [CONTACT_83927] 
•Any Grade 4 hematological toxicity (i.e., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with the 
exception of lymphopenia) lasting greater than 30 days will be considered a DLT/TLT. 
Lymphocyte count and subsets will not be considered in the definition of DLT/TLT. 
Subjects with abnormal blood counts (Grades 1 through 4) at baseline due to bone marrow 
involvement by [CONTACT_4623] 
•These subjects will be considered non-evaluable for hematologic DLT but evaluable for 
all other aspects of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Hematological Toxicity:
•Any grade [ADDRESS_91438] possibly related to research or IND, with exclusion 
of transient, laboratory abnormalities without clinical consequence, will be

The MTD is a dose level immediately below the level at which the enrollment is stopped due to 
DLTs, as explained specifically below:
•If more than one subject in the first three subjects included in a dose level experience 
DLT as defined above, MTD will have been exceeded.
•If DLT develops in one of the 3 subjects included in a cohort, the cohort will be then 
expanded up to six:
•If [ADDRESS_91439] been 
exceeded.

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91440] been exceeded and the cohort 
will be evaluated for response.  If < [ADDRESS_91441] participant at 
this dose level.
If MTD is exceeded at any dose level, three subjects will be added to the immediate lower dose 
level, unless it has been previously expanded to six. If less than 2 of 6 subjects develop DLT at 
that level, it will be defined as the MTD.
3.7 DOSE ESCALATION
Cell dose will be body weight-based up to 100kg. All participants > 100kg, with a BMI <35, will 
be cell dosed at 100kg. All participants with BMI greater than [ADDRESS_91442] doses calculated 
using practical body weight (PBW) (see Appendix E for calculation), with dosing also capped at 
100kg.
Initially 3 to 6 participants will receive 3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%).  If this dose has 
been deemed to be safe in adults (1 adult participant has received this dose without DLT) 
pediatric participants may be enrolled and treated.  If no adults have received this dose (or 
subsequent dose levels) prior to initiating enrollment at the specified dose level on this study, at 
least 1 participant ≥ 18 years of age or older will undergo investigational cellular therapy without 
DLT (observed for 28 days after infusion) prior to treating a pediatric participant.  A four (4) 
week (28 days) safety assessment period will follow regimen completion (defined as infusion of 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells) of the first participant in the first cohort (and subsequent cohorts if 
needed). Subsequent participants in that dose cohort and subsequent cohorts may be treated after 
a one week (7 day) safety assessment period.  Four weeks (28 days) must elapse after completion 
of cell infusion in the final participant in each cohort to allow for safety assessment of the dose 
cohort and response determination before treating participants on the next dose cohort level, if 
escalation is needed.  
In addition, at the discretion of the principal investigator, an additional 1-2 participants may be 
enrolled at a single dose level to obtain information on efficacy and safety provided that no more 
than 1 participant at that dose level has experienced a DLT.
If < 3 out of 6 participants demonstrate an objective response (CR or PR) at Dose Level 1, AND 
< 2 out of 6 participants experiencing DLT, the dose will be escalated to Dose Level 2: 1 x 106 
transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) in subsequent participants.  Safety, including enrollment 
staggering and efficacy will again be assessed as described above for Dose Level 1.  If needed, 
the dose may be escalated to Dose Level 3, then 4 should previous dose levels prove to be safe 
but not efficacious.
Dose Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of CD19/anti-CD22-CAR T cells
Level -1 1 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Level 1 3 x 105 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)

Dose Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of CD19/anti-CD22-CAR T cells
Level 2 1 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Level 3 3 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Level 4 1 x 107 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
If cell growth limitations preclude administration of the number of cells targeted for the assigned 
cohort level, a second or subsequent culture may be initiated and the participant can receive 
interim standard therapy as per protocol section 3.[ADDRESS_91443] failures. If a DLT 
occurs in an additional participant (beyond the first 3 enrolled) entered at a lower dose due to cell 
growth limitations, accrual will continue at the previously planned dose level for subsequent 
participants. If a minimum of 3x105/kg CD19/CD22-CAR-transduced T cells cannot be obtained 
for infusion (or 1 x 105/kg if dose level -1 is enrolling), the participant will still receive the cell 
infusion, as the effective dose of cells is not well defined, and the participant will be evaluable 
for feasibility but not analyzed for MTD, although toxicities will be assessed and reported 
separately. If the third dose level is completed without DLT and without clinical response, 
consideration may be given to adding additional dose cohorts in a protocol amendment. After 
treatment of the first [ADDRESS_91444] 3 dose levels, without any DLT, and limited 
clinical response, we propose adding an additional dose level, (DL 4: 1 x 107 transduced T 
cells/kg).
If cell growth limitations preclude administration of the number of cells targeted for the assigned 
dose level in 3 participants (out of 6) in a dose level, that dose will be considered not feasible as 
there will be inadequate number of participants in that dose level to evaluate safety.  Enrollment 
to that dose, and any higher doses will cease.  This will be considered the ‘highest cell dose’ 
studied and will be the dose level that will be studied further in the expansion cohort.
3.8 DOSE EXPANSION COHORT
To gain further experience with the safety, feasibility and clinical activity of the CD19/CD22 
CAR T cells in this participant population and to determine if there are differences in the 
feasibility related to manufacturing or administering CD19/CD22-CAR T cells in children and 
young adults who have previously received CAR T cells versus those that are CAR T cell-naive, 
the MTD (or highest cell dose studied) will be expanded in two groups of subjects to a total of 
15-30 participants in each expansion cohort (i.e., will include those subjects treated at MTD 
during the dose escalation phase). If 50% or more of the participants experience a clinical 
response (best overall response), this therapeutic regimen will be of sufficient efficacy to warrant 
additional study.

3.9.3 Supportive Care Measures
[IP_ADDRESS] Mesna
Mesna will be administered per institutional/national standards on days when cyclophosphamide 
is administered.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Inpatient Mesna
Mesna will be administered at a dose that equals 60% of the daily cyclophosphamide dose by 
[CONTACT_83928]. Mesna will be prepared in 5% 
dextrose (or other composition appropriate for the clinical situation) and will be infused over 9 
hours starting concurrently with the cyclophosphamide.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_91448] dose: All participants will receive the first dose of mesna IV given concurrently with the 
cyclophosphamide, at a dose that is 20% of the cyclophosphamide dose. IV Mesna will be 
prepared in 5% dextrose (or other composition appropriate for the clinical situation). 
Subsequent doses: The second and third doses of mesna can be given either IV or orally (note:  
the oral mesna dose is twice the IV mesna dose).
Subsequent IV mesna :  Each dose will be 20% of the cyclophosphamide dose, given at 4 and 8 
hours after the start of cyclophosphamide (for a total daily mesna dose equal to 60% of the daily 
cyclophosphamide dose).
Subsequent oral mesna:  Participants able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the last two bolus 
doses orally. Each oral mesna dose will be 40% of the cyclophosphamide dose, given at hours 2 
54
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
and 6 after the start of cyclophosphamide (for a total daily mesna dose equal to 100% of the daily 
cyclophosphamide dose.) Oral mesna solution is 100 mg/mL and should be diluted prior to 
administration to improve palatability. Participants will receive instructions from pharmacy 
describing how to dilute mesna for consumption in the outpatient setting (e.g. dilute each dose in 
1 ounce of water, carbonated beverages, fruit juice, milk, etc.). Participants who vomit within 2 
hours after taking oral mesna should repeat the dose or receive IV mesna instead. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-emetics
Routine anti-emetic prophylaxis and treatment should be employed. Corticosteroids may not be 
used (except for physiologic replacement as outlined in section  [IP_ADDRESS], or in IT chemotherapy 
as outlined in section 4.1). 
3.10 CD19/CD22-CAR T CELL INFUSION – DAY  [ADDRESS_91449] meet the following criteria in order for cells to be infused (based on labs obtained 
within 1 day of cell infusion):
•CD19/CD22-CAR T cells must have met release criteria (section 3.3)
•Subject has no evidence of hemodynamic instability
•Subject has not developed a new requirement for supplemental oxygen therapy
•Subject has not developed symptoms concerning for new, systemic infection or condition 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_83851]
•Liver transaminase (ALT and AST) < [ADDRESS_91450] based on age- and laboratory specific 
normal ranges
•There is no evidence of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction, uncontrolled, 
significant tumor lysis syndrome, serum creatinine >[ADDRESS_91451], and no acute neurological 
toxicity > grade 1 (with the exception of peripheral sensory neuropathy).
Should an event not meet these criteria immediately prior to receiving CD19/CD22-CAR T cell, 
the cell infusion must be delayed until the event resolves.  If the CD19/CD22-CAR T cell 
infusion is delayed >2 weeks, conditioning chemotherapy MAY be repeated, unless investigator 
deems this unnecessary. In addition to the above criteria, special considerations should be made 
prior to cell infusion if the subjects’ temperature is ≥ 38.[ADDRESS_91452]-Cell Infusion: 
Participants may be admitted for cell infusion to NIH in accordance with CC and nursing 
policies. Participants will be monitored a minimum of twice weekly until Day [ADDRESS_91453] twice weekly 
evaluations until completion of Day 28 (+/- 4 days) restaging evaluations unless participant does 
not show signs of cytokine release syndrome or CAR expansion. 
55
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
3.10.3 Pre-medications 
Participants will receive the following medications prior to cell infusion (it is recommended that 
these pre-medications be given 15-90 minutes prior to the cell infusion, but they may be 
administered up to 4 hours prior to the infusion): 
Diphenhydramine 0.5 - 1 mg/kg/dose (maximum 50 mg/dose) PO or IV over 10-15 minutes; 
Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum 650 mg/dose) PO. Premedications may be omitted 
based on clinical conditions at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_83852].  
3.10.4 Cell Administration
Cells are delivered to the participant care unit by a staff member from the institutions’ Cell 
Processing Service. Prior to infusion, the cell product identity label is double-checked by [CONTACT_83929] (MD or RN), an identification of the product and documentation of 
administration are entered in the participant’s chart, as is done for blood banking protocols. 
The cells are to be infused intravenously (IV) over 5-20 minutes via syringe(s).
For cryopreserved cells, the cellular product will be thawed and administered IV immediately at 
a rate of approximately 10-15 ml/min or as tolerated based on volume status and/or DMSO 
toxicity. Do not exceed [ADDRESS_91454] per kg body weight (if 10% DMSO) or [ADDRESS_91455] per kg body weight (if 5% DMSO) so that per 24-hour period total DMSO administered 
is less than 1 mL/kg/day. 
3.10.5 Required Monitoring During Cell Infusion
Monitoring will include vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) prior 
to infusion, at the end of the infusion, every 15 minutes (± 5 min) after the end of the infusion X 
2, every 30 minutes (±10 min) after the end of the infusion X 2. Vital signs may be evaluated 
more frequently if clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Supplemental oxygen will be available at the bedside 
If an allergic or other acute reaction occurs, studies appropriate for investigation of a transfusion 
reaction will be performed (urinalysis, CBC, Coombs test). Acute reactions will be treated 
according to institutional standards of care.
3.11 OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL DOSE(S) OF CD19/CD22-CAR  T CELLS
On the day cells are infused, 90% of any remaining cells that have been produced above and 
beyond the number of cells needed for a subject’s dose level will be cryopreserved using 
standard techniques. 10% of the remaining cells will be used for research. Subjects will have the 
option for additional infusions of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells (including preparative chemotherapy 
regimen, toxicity assessment and research blood sampling) if the following criteria are met:
3.11.1 Eligibility Criteria for Subsequent Cell Infusions

•Evaluable disease recurs;
•If participant has loss of B cell aplasia defined by [CONTACT_83930]19+ > 50/mcL 
and rising in the peripheral blood (2 timepoints needed), and/or 1% CD19+

neurological toxicity > grade 1 (with the exception of peripheral sensory neuropathy).
3.11.[ADDRESS_91466] cell infusion will not be eligible to receive 
additional cell infusions unless IRB and FDA approval is granted on a case by [CONTACT_413].
3.11.3 Additional Antineoplastic and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Participants may receive additional antineoplastic and lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to 
the reinfusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells. See section 3.9.2 for lymphodepletion dosing.
57
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Intensified Lymphodepletion
Given the historically limited response with second or subsequent infusions, which is believed to 
be due to an anti-CAR immune mediated rejection of the infused CAR-T cells that develops after 
the first infusion, in subjects who meet the above eligibility criteria for subsequent infusion and 
who have evidence for either a) limited CAR-T cell expansion with the first infusion; b) rapid 
loss of CAR-T cells suggesting limited persistence; c) loss of B cell aplasia as defined above; d) 
incomplete response where a reinfusion to improve upon the initial response could be 
considered; incorporation of an intensified lymphodepleting regimen consisting of 4 days of 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose (days -5, -4, -3, -2) and 2 days of cyclophosphamide 600 
mg/m2/dose (days -3, -2) may be utilized along with the same initial dose of CAR-T cells 
infused. All subjects who receive subsequent infusion must meet LD initiation criteria as per 
section 3.11.1. 
Based on institutional experience with a similar regimen on the POB Anti-CD22CAR protocol 
15-C-0029, this regimen is well tolerated in the setting of CAR-T cell therapy. The goal of the 
intensified regimen would be used to reduce the likelihood of immune rejection of the infused 
CAR-T cells and improve the response. As per section [IP_ADDRESS].5, all toxicities will be monitored 
and if two or more participants develop unexpected grade [ADDRESS_91467] will be thawed and administered IV immediately (as 
per institutional guidelines) at a rate of approximately 10-15 ml/min or as tolerated based on 
volume status and/or DMSO toxicity. Do not exceed [ADDRESS_91468] per kg body weight (if 
10% DMSO) or [ADDRESS_91469] per kg body weight (if 5% DMSO) so that per 24-hour period 
total DMSO administered is less than 1 mL/kg/day.
[IP_ADDRESS] Post Infusion Monitoring
Any subject who receives subsequent infusions of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells will NOT be 
evaluable for TLT purposes of this study as they will be beyond the 28-day observation period 
for TLTs after their first cell infusion.  However post-infusion monitoring will be the same as for 
the 1st infusion and all toxicities, including secondary reactions, will be recorded and reported.  
If two or more participants develop Grade 4 toxicity at any time following the second 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cell infusion that is felt to be possibly, probably or likely related to the 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells, then reinfusions will be paused pending discussion with the FDA and 
IRB regarding continuing reinfusions as part of the experimental regimen.
3.[ADDRESS_91470] CAR T-cell therapy and are being monitored for 
long-term response and CAR persistence, there are well-established parameters suggestive of 
impending relapse. These metrics include a) resurgence of normal precursor B-cells 
(hematogones); b) resolution of B-cell aplasia; c) loss of CAR T-cell persistence and/or d) 
detection of minimal residual disease.  
In these circumstances, participants may have the option to receive a reinfusion or standard 
chemotherapy to maintain remission and prevent relapse, while remaining on study. This 
“maintenance” approach to remission induction is well-established in the treatment of acute 
58
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91471] low-dose ALL directed maintenance-type 
chemotherapy regimens (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, oral methotrexate, steroids and vincristine, or 
for instance utilization of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in Ph+ ALL, amongst other standard low-
dose options). All regimens will be captured and recorded. Decisions regarding utilization of 
specific standard chemotherapeutic agents will be based on prior exposure and toxicity profile. 
If the participant chooses to receive relapse prevention therapy, the participant will be enrolled to 
protocol 04-C-0165 Oncology Care & Interventions.
Participants will be taken off-protocol as per section 3.16 if there is clear progressive disease or 
initiation of alternative therapy for treatment of disease progression, with exception for those 
participants who will be moving towards a subsequent infusion.
3.13 NEUROLOGIC AND NEUROCOGNITIVE EVALUATION
A neurologic assessment (Appendix H) will be performed as feasible, at least twice on study, 
before preparative regimen and after cell infusion (Day 28 ± 4 days) to monitor prospectively for 
signs of neurotoxicity; additional timepoints may be added per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] (e.g. for those 
participants who experience cytokine release syndrome, a timepoint at the onset and resolution of 
CRS may be indicated). 
Only for those with isolated CNS disease: Additionally, a brief battery of cognitive tests 
evaluating memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functions (less than one hour to 
complete) will be administered to participants prior to anti-CD19/CD22-CAR T cell infusion and 
at timepoints given in section 15.2.2.  These tests will only be administered to subjects who 
speak English or Spanish. A parent/adult observer (or adult participant if the parent/adult 
observer is not available) also will be asked to complete a Background Information Form (about 
5 minutes to complete) and a brief neuro-symptom checklist assessing the severity and duration 
of any neurologic symptoms over the past week (about 2 minutes to complete) (Appendix H). 
The neuro-symptom checklist can be administered to parent/adult observers (or adult 
participants) who do not speak English using an interpreter. Administration of the test and neuro-
symptom checklist will be optional during reinfusion. Neuro cognitive evaluations should ideally 
be performed prior to initiation of seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (Keppra). See 
Appendix H for more details.
A repeat cognitive evaluation (Appendix H) will be administered at approximately [ADDRESS_91472] cell infusion (if participant returns for follow up visit) (only in participants with isolated 
CNS disease).

3.19.1 Criteria for removal from protocol therapy
Participants will be taken off treatment (and followed until off-study criteria are met) for the 
following:
•Treatment limiting toxicity (TLT) due to preparative regimen toxicity that precludes cell 
infusion.
•Treatment limiting toxicity (TLT) due to cell infusion (unless criteria are met for a 
reinfusion per section 3.11). The definition of TLT is in section 3.6.1.
•Grade 3 autoimmunity that involves vital organs (heart, kidneys, brain, eye, liver, colon, 
adrenal gland, lungs).
•Grade 3 or 4 toxicity due to cell infusion (reaction to cellular product or infusion 
reaction) that is not reversible to a grade 2 or less within 8 hours with acetaminophen 
and/or diphenhydramine as outlined in section 3.6.1, the participant will not generally 
have the option of receiving a reinfusion of cells (unless exception is granted by [CONTACT_83932]). 
•General or specific changes in the participant’s condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment on this study in the judgment of the investigator.
•Progressive disease (unless criteria are met for a reinfusion per section 3.11).

study visit:
•The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 12 
weeks and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, an IRB approved certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_62542]’s medical record or study file.
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
4.1 CONCURRENT THERAPY FOR EXTRAMEDULLARY LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA OR CNS LYMPHOMA: 
Participants must be in CNS remission or have CNS-[ADDRESS_91479] triple intrathecal (TIT)-
chemotherapy regimen based on clinical contraindications.
4.1.2 Dose
Intrathecal chemotherapy will be dosed by [CONTACT_83933], (for 
example, the following):
62
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
Age (years) MTX (mg) HDC (mg) ARA-C (mg) Volume (ml)
3-8 12 12 24 8
>9 15 15 30 10
MTX – methotrexate; HDC – Hydrocortisone; ARA-C – cytarabine
Any combination of therapy as clinically indicated may be administered at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_83852]’s discretion. 
4.1.3 Administration
Administration should be performed according to institutional guidelines/SOP: Delivery should 
be isovolumetric (ml CSF out = ml drug in) via lumbar puncture (LP) in the lateral decubitus 
position. Participants should remain in prone or Trendelburg position for [ADDRESS_91480] LP to 
facilitate drug circulation throughout the CNS.
[IP_ADDRESS] History of CNS involvement post cell infusion guidelines
Intrathecal chemotherapy will NOT be administered in any participant who develops neurologic 
toxicity until at least 2 weeks after complete resolution. (exception: intrathecal hydrocortisone 
may be administered as indicated for treatment of severe neurotoxicity or intrathecal therapy 
may be administer for progressive CNS leukemia)
4.1.4 Leucovorin
Leucovorin may be given as 10 mg/m2/dose (rounded up to the nearest 5 mg increment to a 
maximum dose of 15 mg) PO or IV x 2 doses, 24 hours and 30 hours after intrathecal 
methotrexate.
4.2 INFECTION P ROPHYLAXIS
Dosing of pediatric participants for infection prophylaxis will be in accordance with NIH 
Clinical Center Blood & Marrow Transplant Consortium guidelines 
(http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/bmt/clinicalcare/guidelines.shtml ). Additional suggested guidelines are 
provided in Appendix J. 
Special Statement about IVIG:  Since B cell antigen-targeted immunotherapy has been 
demonstrated in other studies to also eliminate normal B cells. For this reason, it is 
recommended that serum IgG levels be monitored before cell infusion and every 3-6 weeks after 
infusion (not required). If IgG < 500, IVIG will be administered at a dose of 500 mg/kg with the 
appropriate pre-medications and per institutional guidelines as clinically indicated.
4.[ADDRESS_91481] risk are those with high disease burden (e.g. bulky disease) and 
high cell turnover (e.g. elevated uric acid, LDH).
4.3.1 Regimen 
Subjects deemed to be at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome should begin allopurinol according to 
institutional standards SOP (for example: at a dose of approximately 100 mg/m2/dose p.o. TID 
(maximum dose 200 mg TID)). This should be started at least [ADDRESS_91482] dose of 
63
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
the preparative regimen and continued until disease burden is reduced (e.g. peripheral blasts 
clear) or it is apparent that no tumor lysis has developed.
Additional suggested monitoring and supportive care for subjects deemed to be at high risk of 
tumor lysis syndrome: 
•Hydration: Starting at least [ADDRESS_91483] 24 hours after cell infusion, IV fluids should be administered at a rate of 90-
120 ml/m2/hour (1.5 – 2 times maintenance) to maintain urine specific gravity <1.010 and 
normal urine output. Potassium should be avoided. Then IV+PO should continue at 
90/m2/hour (1.5 times maintenance) until disease burden is reduced (e.g. peripheral blasts 
clear) or it is apparent that no tumor lysis has developed after at least 72 hours
•For subjects judged to be at high risk for uric acid nephropathy, consider the use of 
rasburicase rather than allopurinol. 
For subjects with renal insufficiency, consult Nephrology. 
4.[ADDRESS_91484] SUPPORT
Using daily CBC’s as a guide, the participant will receive platelets and packed red blood cells 
(PRBC’s) as needed. Attempts will be made to keep Hb >8.0 gm/dl, and plts >10,000/mm3. All 
blood products with the exception of the lymphocyte product will be irradiated. Leukocyte filters 
will be utilized for all blood and platelet transfusions to decrease sensitization to transfused 
WBC’s and decrease the risk of CMV infection.
In participants with symptomatic coagulopathy, attempts will be made to keep platelets 
>50,000/mm3 and fibrinogen  the lower limit of normal. 
4.[ADDRESS_91485] 1 day prior to CAR 
T-cell infusion.
4.6 CYTOKINE R ELEASE SYNDROME
Grading and management of CRS in this protocol will follow the guidelines in Appendix D , 
Table 3, which includes diligent supportive care and search for infection, with 
immunosuppression using anti-IL6R mAbs and/or corticosteroids reserved for more severe 
cases.
4.7 NEUROLOGIC TOXICITY 
Participants will be monitored closely with neurologic checks with vital sign according to 
institutional standards during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Levetiracetam (Keppra) or alternative seizure 
prophylaxis will be started anytime prior to CAR cell infusion in participants with CNS disease, 
for those at high-risk for neurotoxicity, or in those who have had a prior history of seizures, as 
per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Adults will receive [ADDRESS_91486] 
guidelines to a maximum of 2 gm BID; Children will initiate levetiracetam at 20 mg/kg in 2 
divided doses (10 mg/kg BID). If levetiracetam is contraindicated, an alternative anti-seizure 
regimen may be used after discussion with the protocol team. The daily dose may be increased in 
consultation with neurology in the setting of neurotoxicity. Participants with significant 
64
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
neurotoxicity may be treated with corticosteroids. Subjects will start levetiracetam at any time 
prior to the cell infusion and will be maintained on levetiracetam through the period of cytokine 
release syndrome. Levetiracetam may be discontinued by [CONTACT_83934] 21 (or after the 
resolution of CRS, whichever is later), or sooner if clinically indicated.

5.1 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH
Note: Platforms and procedures may be adjusted based upon current technology and/or 
collaborations in place at the time of actual analyses
5.1.1 Overall goal of study correlatives 
To explore secondary and exploratory objectives on this protocol and better understand the T cell 
and tumor properties that influence CAR T cell efficacy and persistence and permit disease 
relapse and also explore the depth of treatment response and explore multiple aspects of the 
toxicity profile. 
5.1.2 Specific Aims
•Assess the impact of T cell subset composition as delineated using flow cytometry, mass 
cytometry and ATAC-Seq on CAR T cell expansion and persistence 
•Use exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (Shern lab POB) to analyze the correlation 
in observed changes in antigen expression at the protein level with genetic and 
transcriptional changes at the antigenic locus. Sample collection, storage and testing will 
be performed on subjects who have consented to protocol 10-C-0086 “Comprehensive 
Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of a Repository for Related 
Biological Studies”.
•Where possible, use TCR sequencing to fate map cells contained in the apheresis of 
manufactured product to persistent CD19/22-CAR T cells as an exploratory aim to 
identify subsets with a greater likelihood of T cell persistence in the setting of adoptive 
cell therapy. Sample collection, storage and testing will be performed on subjects who 
have consented to protocol 10-C-0086 “Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid 
Tumors and Establishment of a Repository for Related Biological Studies”.
•Characterize antigen expression on relapsed B-ALL and B cell lymphoma following 
multi-specific CAR-mediated targeting
•Utilize the CAR-mediated arrest of B cell maturation to gain insight on physiologic and 
pathophysiologic B cell development, maturation arrest and alternative survival pathways 
in normal and malignant B cells. 
•Explore the level CD19/CD22 surface expression and CD19/CD22 site density on 
leukemic blasts, when feasible and correlate with clinical response to CAR-T cells

•To explore CAR T-cell product characteristics that may be associated with clinical       
outcomes (e.g., CAR T-cell persistence, toxicity and/or efficacy)
•To explore CAR T-cell expansion by T-cell subsets and immunophenotypic evaluation of 
markers of T-cell activation and/or exhaustion
5.1.[ADDRESS_91488]
•Selected participant’s samples (e.g. participants who have persistent CAR cells in the 
blood, and who appear MRD negative by [CONTACT_4133]) will have bone marrow 
samples sent to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation to undergo analysis by [INVESTIGATOR_79714]-
based detection of MRD. This testing will generally be performed for research purposes 
and results will not be available in real-time. In certain circumstances, these samples may 
be sent for clinical monitoring also.   
5.1.4 Hematology studies
•Hematology studies will include standard clinical laboratory studies, including PT/PTT, 
fibrinogen, D-Dimer, peripheral blood smear, and complement studies.

clinically significant DIC include: 
•Additional studies specifically for the evaluation of hemolytic uremic syndrome and/or 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and or MAS/HLH, including sMAC, and other 
complement studies, as well as ferritin and soluble IL2R.
5.1.6 Gut Microbiome (optional)
Stool samples may be obtained as outlined in Appendix I: Biospecimen Collection Schedule and 
Forms and used for gut microbiome evaluation. Analyses may include the following: 
•Microbiome sequencing (including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing, and potential evaluation of the resistome, virome, and parasitome).
•Fecal flow (sorting and 16S and/or shotgun sequencing of IgA bound organisms, which is 
an indication of pathogenicity).
•Lipocalin, fecal caprotectin and α-1-anti-trypsin levels (to evaluate mucosal inflammation 
and malabsorption).
•Metabolomics (to evaluate intestinal metabolomic profiles, and when combined with 
microbiome/metagenomic studies, may suggest some functional role for candidate 
microbes of interest).
•Measurement of secreted IgA and antimicrobial peptides.
•Culturing/PCR for specific organisms.
•Stool proteomics.
•Use of stool samples in mouse models. 
•Storage for future research.
•Blood and urine for host responses in microbiome assessment.

Peripheral blood and urine samples may be collected as outlined in Appendix I   to analyze 
NAD(H), FAD(H), glutathione), amino-acids (arginine, tryptophane, glutamine, methionine), 
nucleoacids (ATP, adenosine), TCA cycle metabolites, hepcidin, Acteyl-CoA and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].
5.1.8 Sample Collection Schedule
The samples to be collected and schedule for sample collection is detailed in Appendix I . In 
addition, Appendix I  contains the sample information for submitting CD22 surface expression 
to the NCI for FACS analysis.
5.2 MONITORING GENE THERAPY TRIALS: PERSISTENCE,  AND RCL, AND TOXICITY
The Federal Drug Administration requires monitoring of all participants who have received CAR 
therapy products. Participant’s peripheral blood samples need to be obtained and undergo 
analysis for persistence and RCL PCR including detection of p24 antigen and reverse 
transcriptase activity Product Enhanced Reverse Transcriptase [PERT]). Persistence will be 
performed by [CONTACT_83935]. RCL PCR 
testing will be performed at the Indiana University Vector Production Facility (IU VPF). For the 
purposes of this protocol, this will be considered gene-therapy follow-up.
Participants will be co-enrolled on NIH protocol 15-C-0028:  Follow-up Evaluation for Gene-
Therapy Related Delayed Adverse Events after Participation in Pediatric Oncology Branch 
Clinical Trials. Participants will have blood samples collected prior to cell infusion (at baseline) 
for RCL PCR. After infusion of CAR cells, participants will have all subsequent gene therapy 
monitoring (persistence, RCL and toxicity) completed as directed by [CONTACT_990] 15-C-0028. 
Note: All previously collected samples collected for RCL testing of participants on this protocol 
with this amendment (09/16/2022) will be stored at NCI-Frederick and only tested as clinically 
indicated (e.g., development of a new cancer thought to be related to therapy with CD19/22 CAR 
Tcells). If testing is required, samples will be shipped to Indiana University Vector Production 
Facility for testing.
5.3 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required. 
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that 
are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below. 
The study will remain open so long as sample or data analysis continues.  Samples will be stored 
until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued 
use, at which time they will be destroyed. 
If the participant withdraws consent the participants data will be excluded from future 
distributions, but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be 
able to be retrieved.

5.3.1 Sample Data Collection
All samples sent to the Biospecimen Processing Core (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered 
and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to 
Labmatrix limited to defined BPC personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. 
Installation of Labmatrix is limited to specified computers. These computers all have a password 
restricted login screen.
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to participants without Labmatrix access. Data will be recorded for each sample, as 
appropriate (e.g., participant ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, 
dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location). Participant demographics associated 
with the Clinical Center participant number are provided in the system. For each sample, there 
are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions 
on the ward, etc.).
5.3.2 Sample storage and Destruction
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -80C 
according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite in the CPP and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the CPP. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_83853] a manner consistent with IRB approval.
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting 
the rights to use the material. 
If, at any time, a participant withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing 
samples to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this 
request, the samples will be destroyed or returned to the participant, if so requested. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_83854] a deviation. Reporting will be per the 
requirements of section 7.2.
Sample barcodes are linked to participant demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
Labmatrix. It is critical that the sample remains linked to participant information such as race, 
age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to 
correlate genotype with these variables.

7.5 NIH REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
7.5.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team 
The clinical research team will meet weekly when participants are being actively treated on the 
trial to discuss each participant. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior participants. 
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in 
section 7.2.[ADDRESS_91493] or supervise 
the investigation and provide appropriate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the 
research staff.  
7.5.2 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)
This protocol will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_83941] 
(SMC). Initial review will occur as soon as possible after the annual NIH Intramural IRB 
continuing review date. Subsequently, each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the 
quarterly meeting schedule permits or more frequently as may be required by [CONTACT_83942]. For initial and subsequent reviews, protocols will not be 
reviewed if there is no accrual within the review period. 
The SMC review will focus on unexpected protocol-specific safety issues that are identified 
during the conduct of the clinical trial.
Written outcome letters will be generated in response to the monitoring activities and submitted 
to the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74837], CCR, NCI.

treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)).
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death,
•A life-threatening adverse event (see section 8.1.3)
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83855]/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
oA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105]-medical reasons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62488]) is not considered a serious adverse 
event. 
oEmergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking 
medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.
•Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32).

occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution.
SAEs will be:
•Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not 
related to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as 
the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator.

Following the assessment of the SAE by [CONTACT_62554], other supporting documentation of the event 
may be requested by [CONTACT_62555].
8.4 WAIVER OF EXPEDITED REPORTING TO CCR
Expected SAEs, occurring between Day 0 and Day 28, that will not require expedited reporting 
include: 
•Grade 1 and 2 CRS events
•Grade 3 CRS events that do not resolve to Grade 2 in 72 hours (about 3 days)
•Inpatient admission/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83856]. 
•ICU transfer for evaluation and treatment of CRS 
CRS will be graded per [ADDRESS_91498], see section 15.4.
As participants are increasingly and more routinely treated as outpatients for CAR T-cell 
therapy, inpatient admissions with fever are expected and anticipated events. Similarly, the event 
of a simple transfer to the ICU to optimize management and provide more careful monitoring, in 
and of itself, is also not unexpected.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a safety report of all grade 3‐[ADDRESS_91499] 6 months period should be highlighted. The report 
should be sent to [EMAIL_1230]. 
The Sponsor might request case summaries for those events if, upon review, the Sponsor 
determines that an aggregate safety report is required (21CFR312.32(c)(1)(iv)).
8.5 SAFETY R EPORTING CRITERIA TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATORS
Reporting will be per the collaborative agreement.
8.6 REPORTING PREGNANCY 
All required pregnancy reports/follow-up to OSRO will be submitted to: 
[EMAIL_1230] and to the CCR PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528].  Forms and instructions 
can be found https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Forms+and+Instructions. 
8.6.1 Maternal  exposure
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of

than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become known,
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2) should be reported as 
SAEs. 
The outcome of all pregnancies should be followed up and documented.
8.6.2 Paternal exposure
Male participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and 
for 4 months after the study therapy.
Pregnancy of the participant’s partner is not considered to be an AE. The outcome of all 
pregnancies occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_91500] dose should, if 
possible, be followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the opportunity to 
participate in an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP pregnancy registry 
study) to provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety reporting purposes.
8.[ADDRESS_91501] and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_91502] annually in a summary format.
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.

9 CLINICAL MONITORING PLAN
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects’ protection. This is done through 
independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:
•Informed consent process
•Eligibility confirmation
•Drug administration and accountability
•Adverse events monitoring
•Response assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
•that the rights of the participants are protected; 
•that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
•the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.
OSRO SROS Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. The first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study site(s). 
Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or 
follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring reports 
78
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, coordinating 
center (if applicable), and the Sponsor regulatory file.
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR Protocol 
Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as applicable per 
institutional and IRB guidance.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS
10.1.1 Primary Objective
Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR engineered 
T cells that can be feasibly produced to meet established release specifications in children and 
young adults with B cell ALL or lymphoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine 
conditioning regimen.  
In addition to evaluating up to [ADDRESS_91503] number of cells for safety evaluation at that dose level. 
10.1.2 Secondary Objective 
Evaluate whether CD19/CD22-CAR T cells can mediate clinical activity in children and young 
adults with B-ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma.
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE D ETERMINATION
10.2.1 Sample size related to safety endpoint
The primary objectives of this study are safety and feasibility.  Three to 6 participants will be 
enrolled in three dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The study will allow for 
up to 3 participants to be replaced in each of the dose cohorts 1 through 3 (9 additional 
participants) due to inability to achieve target doses, for a maximum of 27 participants. Up to 2 
extra participants may be enrolled on a single dose level, per amendment, version date 
06/10/2019. Prior to amendment, version date 01/11/2020, 4 participants had been enrolled on 
dose level 1 and 4 had been enrolled on dose level 2; participants are currently enrolling onto 
dose level 3, and with allowance for replacement of participants, up to 9 participants may be 
enrolled on dose level 3. Beginning with amendment, version date 01/11/2020, participants will 
enroll in two cohorts based on their prior CAR-T and/or transplant experience (CAR naïve or 
CAR pre-treated with an interim transplant; previous CAR-T treatment with no interim 
transplant). As a result, dose level 4 will contain up to 18 total participants (2 cohorts with up to 
9 participants per cohort). Thus, up to 4+4+9+18=35 participants may enroll in the 4 dose levels 
during dose escalation.  In addition, the study will allow for 6 total inevaluable participants 
(participants enrolled but who cannot receive cells, either due to physical deterioration or 
withdrawn consent during cell growth). Thus, 35 + 6 + 2 (2 extra participants by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_9106], 
per amendment, version date 06/10/2019) yields a maximum of 43 participants who will be 
enrolled to determine MTD and feasible dose. If dose level 4 exceeds DLT, future participants 
will be enrolled into lower dose levels but into the two separate strata. 
79
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
The endpoint for Safety of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells is evidenced by [CONTACT_83945] (DLTs) (i.e. laboratory abnormalities, changes in vital signs, and 
changes in physical examination) following chemotherapy preparative regimen and infusion of 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells, recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5 at three dose levels until the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) is determined.  If Dose level 3 can be feasibly manufactured and is administered in up to 
6 participants without evidence of DLT or efficacy, consideration will be given to amending the 
trial to examine higher dose levels.
The dose escalation procedure follows a 3+[ADDRESS_91504] will be reached without observing any DLT. Safety 
monitoring will continue throughout the study in the expanded cohort of up to 30 participants in 
each expansion group at the final MTD (or highest dose tested).
After determining the MTD, an expansion cohort will enroll initially 15 participants at the MTD 
(or maximal dose studied) in two cohorts (one cohort will be CAR naïve or CAR pre-treated with 
an interim transplant ,and the other cohort will be those who have received prior CAR T-cells 
without an interval transplant), including up to 6  from each of the two the dose escalation 
cohorts treated at DL4, if applicable, to further define safety, persistence, efficacy and duration 
of response.  If sufficient responses occur, the two cohorts may be expanded to 30 participants 
per cohort.
Up to 12 participants will be enrolled at the MTD for cohort 2c isolated CNS disease. For 
participants with isolated CNS disease, they will be evaluated at the current dose, dose level 3 
(3x106 cells/kg) in order to explore toxicity and response. Initially 6 eligible participants will be 
enrolled and if 0/[ADDRESS_91505] any other type of TLT, then this 
cohort will be expanded to 12 total participants, provided that no more than 4 participants 
cumulatively experience any TLT, in order to further describe the toxicity of the participants.
10.2.2 Sample Size Related to Feasibility Endpoint
Feasibility will be defined as the successful manufacturing of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells that 
meet established release criteria to satisfy the targeted dose level.  Although we anticipate 
reaching the targeted cell dose during manufacture, feasibility of manufacturing cells remains a 
primary objective in this participant population.  Participants will be enrolled on a given dose 
level until adequate participants are enrolled to produce the correct number of cells for safety 
evaluation at that dose level. Specifically, dose escalation will proceed as long as [ADDRESS_91506]. If cell growth limitations preclude administration of the targeted 
cohort cell dose, the participant will receive as many cells as possible, and be considered part of 
the lower dose cohort. If a minimum of 1.0 x105 CD19/CD22-CAR-transduced T cells per kg 
cannot be obtained for infusion, the participant may be treated but will not be evaluable for 
80
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91507] adequate 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells produced (that meet COA for infusion), accrual to that dose level will 
stop and the dose escalation phase of the study will also end, since the upper 90% one-sided 
confidence interval about 3/6 is 79.9%; thus, it would be unlikely that the true feasibility rate is 
80% or greater for a given, which would be desirable. The evaluation of participants in the 
expansion cohort will take place using the highest dose level at which feasibility, as well as 
safety, was identified. In the expansion cohorts, the fraction which are able to manufacture the 
targeted dose level will also be monitored and beginning with the 6th participant in an expansion 
cohort, if at any point fewer than half of the enrolled participants are able to manufacture an 
acceptable level of cells, the accrual to the expansion cohort will end.
Thus, 4 + 4 + 9 + 18 + 6 + 2 + 30 + 30 +12 =115 + 25 (screen failures) + (10 inevaluable) = 150 
is the accrual ceiling. The actual maximum enrolled may be reduced by [CONTACT_8622] 6 + 6 if both 
cohorts at DL4 enroll 6 evaluable participants api[INVESTIGATOR_83857], which instead yields a maximum of 128 participants who may be enrolled under 
those circumstances.
Given the number of participants seeking out adoptive cell therapy trials the rate limiting factor 
at this time is the time and labor-intensive nature of manufacturing the CD19/CD22-CAR T 
cells.  We anticipate enrollment of 2-[ADDRESS_91508] of reporting AEs by [CONTACT_83946]. Feasibility will be determined by [CONTACT_83947]19/CD22-
CAR T cells have been produced .
10.4.[ADDRESS_91509] of tabulations of grades of toxicity 
by [CONTACT_50803].
10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints include feasibility and to evaluate whether CD19/CD22-CAR T cells 
can mediate clinical activity in children and young adults with B-ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or 
lymphoma.  For evaluation of feasibility, the number of participants which can successfully 
manufacture the targeted dose number will be determined. For efficacy in ALL and lymphoma 
participants, this will be evaluated in two groups of participants, those who have previously 
received CAR therapy and those that are CAR naïve. Efficacy will be important in determining if 
a phase 2 study is warranted.  
81
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
The toxicity data for isolated CNS cohort will be summarized in a descriptive manner, and the 
response rate will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval.
A futility analysis will be conducted when 15 participants at the MTD in each group (2a and 2b) 
have reached the 28 day bone marrow assessment (for lymphoma the efficacy will be determined 
at [ADDRESS_91510] in lymphomatous disease), 
and if [ADDRESS_91511] a CR, further enrollment to that group in the study will stop, 
and the 80% upper confidence limit will be formed.  This fraction will have an upper one-sided 
80% confidence limit of 0.48, which is below the desired 50% and thus would justify stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_83858]. Assuming no futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], no failure of manufacturing the required 
doses, and no DLT observed, the study will reach a maximum size of 30 participants treated at 
dose 3 in each group, and confidence intervals will be formed. With 0 DLT out of 30 
participants, based on the one-sided upper Confidence Limits, we can rule out true DLT rates as 
high as 6%, 8% and 10% with 80%, 90% and 95% confidence (respectively).
The precision of estimate of the probability of dichotomous outcomes (as measured by 90% half-
widths of two-sided 90% confidence intervals) relating to evidence for efficacy is no worse than 
0.17, under the above conditions.
Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed by [CONTACT_42376]. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be measured from the start of the preparative regimen until 
the documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Overall survival (OS) will be determined as the time from the start of the preparative regimen 
until death.
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
All participants who receive experimental treatment (non-myeloablative chemotherapy and 
CD19/CD22-CAR T cell infusion) will be analyzed for safety and efficacy.
Subjects not treated for any reason will be included in the disposition tabulation but will be 
excluded from the safety and efficacy analysis.
The safety and tolerability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cell regimen will be assessed by:
•Suspected adverse events, and
•Suspected serious adverse events
As evidenced by:
•Changes in clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, etc.).
•Changes in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_12876]).
•Changes in physical exams. Signs and symptoms assessed may require additional testing 
as clinically indicated such as ECG, PFT, radiographic studies, etc.
•Participant reported signs and symptoms
Safety data will be analyzed per standard methods and interpreted descriptively for each dose 
cohort. Safety data will be summarized for each dose cohort separately and for all dose cohorts 
combined. Adverse events will be assessed using the CTCAE version 5 for type and severity of 
82
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
event. Serious Adverse Events will be summarized for each dose cohort and for all dose cohorts 
combined. Reasons for discontinuation of study therapy will be tabulated.
Laboratory testing includes hematology, serology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. Baseline 
laboratory testing will be those results obtained prior to initiating the nonmyeloablative 
chemotherapy regimen.  The study will utilize local lab for all clinical laboratory testing. 
Laboratory data will be tabulated based on the following result class.
•Normal: result is within the local lab normal range
•Abnormal: result is either higher or lower than the normal range
All abnormal values will be assessed for clinical significance; clinical significance will be 
captured in the case report form. 
Vital signs collected immediately prior to receiving study drug will be the baseline vital signs. 
Observed vital sign values and change from baseline in vital signs at each visit will be 
summarized without formal statistical testing.
Vital sign result may also be tabulated based on the following result class.
•Normal: result is within the normal range
•Abnormal: result is either higher or lower than the normal range
All abnormal values will be assessed for clinical significance; clinical significance will be 
captured in the case report form. Number and percent of subjects within each result class will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_83948].
Findings of physical examinations will be tabulated by [CONTACT_83949].
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
General demographic and clinical characteristics will be reported for the participants evaluated in 
the study.
10.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses
A futility analysis will be conducted when 15 participants at the MTD in each group (or highest 
dose studied) have reached the 28 day PET imaging and/or bone marrow assessment, and if [ADDRESS_91512] a CR, further enrollment to that group in the study will stop, with the 
upper 80% Confidence Limit of 0.476 not reaching the 0.48 minimum overall response rate 
expected for the "competing" treatment with active therapy such as autologous HCT for 
chemotherapy responsive participants of 40%.

[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Analysis of Cognitive Testing Data
Brief cognitive evaluations will be conducted pre- and post-infusion to assess any changes that 
might be related to the CD19/CD22 CAR treatment.  These cognitive evaluations will consist of 
brief tests of verbal and visual memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functions.  In 
addition, we will ask one parent or adult observer (e.g., adult sibling, spouse, other close relative 
with the participant) to complete a questionnaire evaluating the participant’s daily executive skills

T Related Neurotoxicity). 
To analyze the data for the secondary cognitive objective, paired t-tests will be used to examine 
the change in scores between the baseline and post-infusion evaluation to determine if the change 
is significantly different from zero. For the exploratory cognitive objectives, analysis of variance 
with repeated measures will be used to examine change in scores between the baseline and the 
follow-up evaluations.  In addition, correlations or analyses of variance will be computed to 
examine the relationship between cognitive scores and cytokine levels.
Note: As of this amendment 09/16/2022, neurocognitive testing will be limited to participants with 
isolated CNS disease.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistence of CD19/CD22-CAR T Cell Analyses
•Measure persistence of adoptively-transferred CD19/CD22-CAR-transduced T cells in the 
blood and, where possible, the bone marrow and CSF of participants.
Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], and CSF will be collected when available and separately 
analyzed for the presence of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells. The percentage of all CD3+ cells in a 
sample that are positive by [CONTACT_83950]19/CD22-CAR containing T cells will be 
analyzed and reported as time from T cell infusion.

groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria. To date, there is no 
information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or disease response would be 
expected in one group compared to another. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a 
representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck between 
participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to 
potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender 
and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate 
to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded, or a follow-up study may be 
written to investigate those differences more fully.
Pregnant individuals are excluded from this study because the study agents have the potential for 
teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In addition, because there is an unknown but potential risk 
for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study agents, 
nursing should be discontinued.
11.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
The age range of participants eligible for this trial is greater than or equal to 3 years of age but 
less than or equal to 39 years of age. Physicians, nurses, and multidisciplinary support teams of 
the POB, NCI and Clinical Center will provide participant care. The staff of the POB has 
expertise in the management of children with complex oncologic disorders and complications of 
therapy. Full pediatric support and subspecialty services are available at the NIH Clinical Center.

compromise their ability to share in the benefits of the research.  All subjects ≥ age 18 will be 
offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care and assign a substitute 
decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research 
Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the 
event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. 
Capacity to consent will be evaluated by [CONTACT_83951](s).  For adults,

Please see section 11.6.1 for consent procedure.   
11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The experimental treatment has a chance to provide clinical benefit though this is unknown. The 
risks in the investigational portion of this treatment are detailed in section 1.4. The goal of this 
study is to improve upon the number of participants who may benefit from adoptive cell therapy 
by [CONTACT_83952]’ own transduced T-cells without the need to identify anti-tumor T-cells 
uniquely from each participant as was required in many cancer therapy protocols. The success of 
this effort cannot be predicted at this time. Because all participants in this protocol have B cell 
malignancies without curative options and limited life expectancies the potential benefit is 
thought to outweigh the potential risks. It is anticipated that this study will provide scientific 
information relevant to tumor immunotherapy.
11.4.1 Risks of CD19/CD22-CAR T Cells
Although the risk profile of CD19/CD22-CAR T Cells cannot be completely known at this time, 
the risks can be anticipated based on extensive experience with CD19-CAR T cell infusions and 
the POB NCI experience with CD22-CAR T cell infusions.  The potential significant risks are 
described in section 1.4.  The risk profile of CD19 CAR cells is well established as multiple 
groups have tested CD19 CAR T cells in leukemia and lymphoma. Results from a number of the 
trials have been published with response rates of 70-90% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia being 
reported in the majority of studies.  The majority of AEs reported as treatment-related have been 
reversible and grade [ADDRESS_91517] been considered treatment 
related, include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), visual hallucinations, neurological toxicity 
including confusion, dysphasia, hallucinations and death. One epi[INVESTIGATOR_83860], and grade [ADDRESS_91518] expertise to 
adequately manage side effects, including in pediatric apheresis subjects. The potential risks of 
apheresis in this trial are as follows:
86
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91519] common side effects of apheresis are pain and bruising at IV sites. A central 
venous catheter may be required. Possible side effects include pain, bleeding, bruising, 
infection, thrombosis, vascular perforation, and risks associated with the sedation used 
for placement.
2. During apheresis, mild side effects from citrate anticoagulant are common and include 
chills, numbness and tingling ("pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]"), anxiety, muscle cramps, and nausea. 
More serious side effects due to citrate-induced hypocalcemia are uncommon and include 
low blood pressure, seizures, weakness, and tetany. Citrate reactions rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83861]. Prophylactic IV CaCl 2 and MgSO 4 
infusions may be administered to donors deemed to be at high risk of citrate toxicity. 
Risks of parenteral calcium and magnesium include extravasation necrosis and 
cardiovascular effects including bradycardia and blood pressure changes. However, side 
effects are unlikely given the low rate of infusion and use of large bore catheters for 
apheresis.
3. Transient mild thrombocytopenia is common after apheresis, but bleeding is unlikely.
4. Dilutional anemia occurs during apheresis, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. 
5. Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, 
fainting. 
11.4.3 Risks of the preparative regimen and supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83862]-known toxicity profiles. Refer to section 12 for summary of toxicities.
11.4.4 Risk of Blood Sampling
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. Up 
to 94 mLs of blood may be collected at any given timepoint, and up to 448 mLs of blood may be 
collected in any given 8-week period as this is necessary for participant’s safety. For pediatric 
participants, the amount of blood drawn for research purposes from pediatric participants (those 
under 18 years of age) will not exceed these limits nor exceed 5 mL/kg in a single day, and 9.5 
mL/kg over an 8 week period.
11.4.5 Risk of Urine and Stool Collection
There is no physical risk associated with urine or stool collection.
11.4.6 Electrocardiogram (EKG) and Echocardiogram
Side effects of EKG are skin irritation where EKG electrodes are placed. Side effects of an 
echocardiogram are discomfort from the transducer being firmly placed against the chest.
11.4.7 Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)
These tests are safe and side effects are unlikely, but may include brief light headedness or slight 
soreness of the chest.
11.4.8 Bone Marrow Biopsy
Bone marrow biopsy is minimally invasive and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a very safe procedure. Usually the 
hipbone is numbed with anesthesia. Using a needle, the solid and liquid portion of bone marrow 
87
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
is taken out. This procedure causes some pain. Very rarely, infection or bleeding may occur at 
the needle site.
11.4.9 Lumbar Puncture
Risks of lumbar puncture include pain at the site where the needle goes,  in and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_83863], and headache.  There is a small risk of infection or bleeding.
11.4.10 Risk of Central Venous Catheter (CVC)
Risks include bleeding, bruising, blood clot or infection at the site where the catheter is put in.  
In rare cases, placing a CVC has resulted in collapse of a lung.  If this happens, the lung would 
be quickly re-inflated using a tube put into your chest. Sometimes catheters may become infected 
or clogged. If this happens the catheter may need to be replaced. The CVC will be flushed once a 
day to prevent it from becoming clogged. The nursing staff will show you how to do this 
yourself when you return home.
11.4.[ADDRESS_91520] an MRI scan if a participant has pacemakers or other implanted 
electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips 
on the wall of a large artery), metal prostheses (including metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart valves, and 
cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, tattoos, an implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel 
fragments. Welders and metal workers may have small metal fragments in the eye. Participants 
will be screened for these conditions before having any MRI scan.  Participants who have a 
question about metal in their body, should inform the staff. Participants will be asked to 
complete an MRI screening form before each MRI scan. 
In addition, all magnetic objects (like watches, coins, jewelry, and credit cards) must be removed 
before entering the MRI scan room.
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with back 
problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the 
scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing loss. 
Everyone having a research MRI scan will be fitted with hearing protection. If the hearing 
protection comes loose during the scan, participants should let staff know right away.
There are no known long-term risks of MRI scans.
11.4.13 Risks of gadolinium enhanced MRI 
Mild symptoms from gadolinium infusion occur in fewer than 1% of those who receive it and 
usually go away quickly.  Mild symptoms may include coldness in the arm during the injection, a 
metallic taste, headache, and nausea.  In an extremely small number, fewer than one in 300,[ADDRESS_91521] been reported including shortness of breath, wheezing, 
hives, and lowering of blood pressure. A participant should not receive gadolinium if they 
88
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91522] called 
“nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)”.  This condition always involves the skin and can also 
involve the muscles, joints and internal organs.  NSF has resulted in a very small number of 
deaths.  A blood test of the kidney function may be done within the month before an MRI scan 
with gadolinium contrast. Participants will not receive gadolinium for a research MRI scan if 
their kidney function is below the safe level. 
Most of the gadolinium contrast leaves the body in the urine.  However, the FDA has issued a 
safety alert that indicates small amounts of gadolinium may remain in the body for months to 
years.  The long-term effects of the retained gadolinium are not unknown.  Some types of 
gadolinium contrast drugs are less likely to remain in the body than others.  In this study, we will 
use the gadolinium contrast drugs that are less likely to remain in the body. In this study, we will 
use the gadolinium contrast drugs that are less likely to remain in the body, whenever possible. 
Additional information called a “Medication Guide” will be given to all participants.  Upon 
request, staff will give participants individual information about retained gadolinium that is seen 
on their studies.
11.4.[ADDRESS_91523]
The radiation risks of the PET/CT, and  CT scans are discussed below.  In addition to radiation 
risks, these scans that employ contrast may cause allergic reactions, injection site reactions 
abdominal discomfort and fainting. MRIs carry no radiation risks, but are contraindicated in 
subjects with metal in their bodies. In subjects that receive gadolinium contrast with MRIs, 
allergic reactions, injection site reactions and kidney damage may occur. 
An IV line may need to be inserted for administration of the contrast agent or anesthetic, which 
may cause pain at the site where the IV is placed and there is a small risk of bruising or infection.
11.4.[ADDRESS_91524] 
scans and five PET/CT scans performed (inclusive of screening and treatment) a year. Subjects 
undergoing CT scans and PET/CT scans will be exposed up to 11.5 rem annually. This amount 
of radiation is greater than the NIH Radiation Guidelines of 0.5 rem per year for participants less 
than 18 years old. This level of exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
11.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Participants will be monitored frequently as both inpatients and outpatients and side effects will 
be treated promptly. These measures will help to mitigate the potential risks observed with the 
preparative chemotherapy regimen and the cell administration. Prophylactic levetiracetam will 
be administered to all participants with close monitoring in the event neurologic toxicity occurs.  
The enrollment profile and dose escalation rules will help to ensure that participants are not 
exposed to unacceptable risk as a safe dose level is determined. 
Participants on this study may directly benefit from participation. It is anticipated that this study 
will provide scientific information relevant to tumor immunotherapy. Participation of adult

11.6 CONSENT AND ASSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated 
study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent and consent for telehealth visits, when required, 
may take place in person or remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms 
used in compliance with policies, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated 
study investigator and with the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in 
person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and 
participant/consent designee, when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult 
room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of 
the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if 
needed. 
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579]. When required, witness signature [CONTACT_83980]. 
Manual (non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_83981] a manual signature [CONTACT_62582], this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:
•Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or, 
•iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_62496] (if remote consent); the same 
screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the subject will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse.

11.6.2 Consent Process for Minors
Consent will be obtained from parent(s)/guardians of minor children as described in section 11.6.
Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_83953]’s parent(s) or guardian, the child will be 
included in all discussions about the trial and age-appropriate language will be used to describe 
the procedures and tests involved in this study, along with the risks, discomforts and benefits of 
participation. The assent process will take place in conjunction with consent; therefore, in person 
and remote assent are permitted under the same circumstances as in person and remote consent. 
Verbal assent will be obtained as appropriate for children ages > 7. Children under the age of 18, 
but who are age 12 or older will be asked to sign an age appropriate assent form if available in 
the participant’s language; otherwise, the appropriate line on the adult consent document (in the 
minor participant’s language) may be used. Children under the age of [ADDRESS_91526] the cognitive ability to fully understand 
the nature of research. The consent/assent process will be documented in the child’s medical 
record, including the assessment of the child’s ability to provide assent (verbal) as applicable.  
11.6.[ADDRESS_91527] reaches age 18, continued participation (including ongoing interactions 
with the subject or continued analysis of identifiable data) will require that consent be obtained 
from the now adult with the standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective 
informed consent has been obtained. We request waiver of informed consent for those 
individuals who become lost to follow up or who have been taken off study prior to reaching the 
age of majority.
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d):
•The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.
oAnalysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to 
subjects.
•The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.
oRetention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects. 
•The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.
oConsidering the length of time between the minor’s last contact [CONTACT_83954], it will likely be very difficult to locate them 
again.  A significant reduction in the number of samples analyzed is likely to 
impact the quality of the research. 
•Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation.
oWe only request a waiver of consent for those subjects who have been lost to 
follow-up or who have been taken off study prior to reaching the age of majority.

activities are only intended to determine suitability for screening for participation in research 
protocols.  These activities could not practicably be carried out without the wavier as central 
recruiting services, utilized in the NIH Clinical Center, perform pre-screening activities for 
multiple studies and obtaining consent for each one is beyond their resources.  The subjects will 
be provided with additional pertinent information after participation as they will be informed 
whether or not they are eligible to sign a consent for additional screening.

13 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
13.1 CD19/CD22-CAR T CELLS 
The cells will be manufactured in the NIH DTM CCE according to cGMP practices.
Fresh or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (depending on the timing of 
apheresis relative to cell culture, patient condition and scheduling availability) will be enriched for 
T cells using a CD4/CD8 immunomagnetic bead enrichment in DTM CCE.  They will then be 
activated by [CONTACT_3252]-culture with immunomagnetic particles expressing anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb. 
One day following activation, replication incompetent lentiviral vector particles containing the 
CD19/CD22.BB.z construct will be added to the culture for transduction.  Cells will be incubated 
for approximately [ADDRESS_91533] release criteria including transduction efficiency 
≥10%, T cell content ≥70%, sterility and minimum levels of LPS as well as no evidence for 
replication competent lentivirus.  All procedures will take place using good manufacturing process 
guidelines.
13.1.1 How Supplied
CD19/CD22-CAR T cells will be generated from autologous PBMC.  The replication 
incompetent, bi-specific CD19/CD22-CAR lentiviral vector is manufactured by [CONTACT_83958]. 
 Cells meeting the release criteria will be made available fresh or frozen on the day of cell 
infusion, along with a complete COA.

13.2 FLUDARABINE
13.2.1 Description
(Please refer to package insert for complete product information) Fludarabine phosphate is a 
synthetic purine nucleoside that differs from physiologic nucleosides in that the sugar moiety is 
arabinose instead of ribose or deoxyribose. Fludarabine is a purine antagonist antimetabolite. 
13.2.2 How Supplied 
Fludarabine will be purchased by [CONTACT_83959]. 
Fludarabine Phosphate is supplied in a 25 mg/I mL vial as an intravenous solution in a 50 mg 
vial or as a 50 mg vial as a fludarabine phosphate powder in the form of a white, lyophilized 
solid cake. 
13.2.3 Stability 
Following reconstitution with 2 mL of sterile water for injection to a concentration of 25 mg/ml, 
the solution has a pH of 7.7. The fludarabine powder is stable for at least 18 months at 2-80C; 
when reconstituted, fludarabine is stable for at least 16 days at room temperature. Because no 
preservative is present, reconstituted fludarabine will typi[INVESTIGATOR_74844] 8 hours. 
Specialized references should be consulted for specific compatibility information. Fludarabine is 
dephosphorylated in serum, transported intracellularly and converted to the nucleotide 
fludarabine triphosphate; this 2-fluoro-ara-ATP molecule is thought to be required for the drug’s 
cytotoxic effects. Fludarabine inhibits DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase, DNA 
primase, and may interfere with chain elongation, and RNA and protein synthesis.
13.2.[ADDRESS_91535] vials should be stored refrigerated (2-8C).
13.2.5 Administration 
Fludarabine concentrate is further diluted to a concentration between 0.04 and 1 mg/ml and is 
administered as an IV infusion in an appropriate solution over 30 minutes. To prevent undue 
toxicity the dose will be based on BSA (25 mg/m2/dose or 30 mg/m2/dose). Please see section 
3.9.2 for daily dose modifications in light if fludarabine national drug shortages. Cumulative 
dosing will not change thus toxicity profile should not change. 
13.2.6 Toxicities 
At doses of 25 mg/m2/day or 30 mg/m2/dose for 3 days (Please see section 3.9.2 for daily dose 
modifications in light if fludarabine national drug shortages. Cumulative dosing will not change 
thus toxicity profile should not change), the primary side effect is myelosuppression; however, 
thrombocytopenia is responsible for most cases of severe and life-threatening hematologic 
toxicity. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine. 
Hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or more courses of fludarabine with or without a 
prior history of a positive Coomb’s test; fatal hemolytic anemia has been reported. In addition, 
bone marrow fibrosis has been observed after fludarabine therapy. Other common adverse 
effects include malaise, fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and weakness. 
Irreversible and potentially fatal central nervous system toxicity in the form of progressive 
encephalopathy, blindness, and coma is only rarely observed at the currently administered doses 
95
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024

weakness, pain, malaise, fatigue, paresthesia, visual or hearing disturbances, and sleep disorders. 
Adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_83864], dyspnea, allergic or idiopathic 
interstitial pneumonitis. Tumor lysis syndrome has been rarely observed in fludarabine treatment 
of CLL. 
13.3 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 
(Refer to FDA-approved package insert for complete product information)
13.3.[ADDRESS_91536]-derivative alkylating agent. Following conversion to 
active metabolites in the liver, cyclophosphamide functions as an alkylating agent; the drug also 
possesses potent immunosuppressive activity. The serum half-life after IV administration ranges 
from 3-12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the serum for up to 72 hours 
after administration. 
13.3.2 How Supplied 
Cyclophosphamide will be obtained from commercially available sources by [CONTACT_83960].
13.3.3 Stability 
Following reconstitution as directed with sterile water for injection, cyclophosphamide is stable 
for 24 hours at room temperature or 6 days when kept at 2-80C. 
13.3.4 Administration 
It will be diluted in an appropriate solution and infused over one hour. The dose will be based on 
the participant’s body weight, as specified in section [IP_ADDRESS].
13.3.5 Toxicities 
Hematologic toxicity occurring with cyclophosphamide usually includes leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, rash and alopecia occur, especially after 
high-dose cyclophosphamide; fever, bone marrow failure, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, 
infertility, and mucosal and oral ulceration have been reported. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis 
occurs in about 20% of patients; severity can range from microscopic hematuria to extensive 
cystitis with bladder fibrosis. Although the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis associated with 
cyclophosphamide appears to be lower than that associated with ifosfamide, mesna (sodium 2-
mercaptoethanesulfonate) has been used prophylactically as a uroprotective agent in patients 
receiving cyclophosphamide. Prophylactic mesna is not effective in preventing hemorrhagic 
cystitis in all patients. Patients who receive high dose cyclophosphamide may develop interstitial 
pulmonary fibrosis, which can be fatal. Hyperuricemia due to rapid cellular destruction may 
occur, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancy. Hyperuricemia may be minimized 
by [CONTACT_74918], alkalinization of the urine, and/or administration of allopurinol. If 
allopurinol is administered, patients should be watched closely for cyclophosphamide toxicity 
(due to allopurinal induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes). At high doses, cyclophosphamide 
can result in a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; hyponatremia with 
progressive weight gain without edema occurs. At high doses, cyclophosphamide can result in

Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91537] occurred from diffuse hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis and from a 
syndrome of acute myopericarditis; in such cases, congestive heart failure may occur within a 
few days of the first dose. Other consequences of cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity include 
arrhythmias, potentially irreversible cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. Other reported adverse 
effects of cyclophosphamide include headache, dizziness, and myxedema; faintness, facial 
flushing, and diaphoresis have occurred following IV administration. Mesna (sodium 2-
mercaptoethanesulphonate; given by [CONTACT_51215]) is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound that can 
chemically interact with urotoxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide (acrolein and 4-
hydroxycyclophosphamide) to decrease the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis. 
Also, the alcohol content of cyclophosphamide injection should be taken into account when 
given to pediatric participants.

[IP_ADDRESS] Methotrexate
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Source and Pharmacology
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and 
immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate 
reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, 
subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent 
immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Toxicity
The following toxicities may occur when given intrathecally: occasional headache, dizziness, 
tiredness, blurred vision or loss of balance for a few hours. Up to 15% of children may develop 
neurological changes including changes in level of consciousness, abnormal movements or 
confusion, very rarely leukoencephalopathy. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Formulation and Stability
Methotrexate Sodium Injection USP is available for single use only in 20 mg and 1 gram vials, 
and will be diluted according to TIT in section 4.1. Dilutions should be used within 24 hours if

15.2 APPENDIX B: STUDY CALENDARS
Subjects will have clinical evaluations completed per the following guidelines with the exception noted below:
Exception #1
•If during the first restaging evaluation, the subject experiences no response (i.e., progressive disease) and no ongoing toxicity 
then no further clinical evaluations or follow-up is required. Participants will be followed for gene-therapy follow-up only (see 
section 5.2).  
Note:
•Once a participant develops PD or goes on to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including, but not limited to hematopoietic stem cell transplant), 
participants will be followed for Gene therapy follow-up ONLY (see section  5.2). It will include evaluations for persistence of 
Anti-CD19/22 CAR T-cells in blood samples, detection of RCL and long-term follow-up for toxicity assessment. This follow-
up will be performed as dictated in NIH protocol 15-C-0028.

15.4 APPENDIX D: GUIDELINES FOR GRADING AND MANAGEMENT OF SUSPECTED CYTOKINE 
RELEASE SYNDROME
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): Administration of CAR T cell immunotherapy is often 
complicated by [CONTACT_83969] 1-[ADDRESS_91554] toxicity to occur.
The protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_83871].
CRS Grading: Grading will be based on the [ADDRESS_91555] CRS Consensus Guidelines ( Table 2:  
CRS Grading as per ASTCT Consensus Guidelines with Generalized Management Approach)( 54, 
114); with more specific guidelines provided in Table 3.
Table 2:  CRS Grading as per ASTCT Consensus Guidelines with Generalized 
Management Approach

vasopressinRequiring multiple 
vasopressors (excluding 
vasopressin)
And/or
Hypoxia NoneRequiring low-flow

nasal cannula‡, 
facemask, 
nonrebreather mask, or 
Venturi maskRequiring positive 
pressure (eg, CPAP, 
BiPAP, intubation and 
mechanical ventilation)
⁎Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C not attributable to any other cause. In participants who have CRS then receive 
antipyretics or anticytokine therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS 
severity. In this case, CRS grading is driven by [CONTACT_13199]/or hypoxia.
†CRS grade is determined by [CONTACT_13200]: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, 
a participant with temperature of 39.5°C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and hypoxia requiring low-flow nasal cannula 
is classified as grade 3 CRS. ‡Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤6 L/minute. Low flow also includes 
blow-by [CONTACT_13201], sometimes used in pediatrics. High-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 
L/minute. ^Intubation may be indicated in participants who have a degree of neurotoxicity where there is concern for their 
ability to maintain a patent airway. This may occur either in the setting of CRS or after CRS has resolved. The decision for 
intubation should not be captured as a grade [ADDRESS_91556] alone or for a procedure is not, by [CONTACT_108], 
grade 4 CRS. 
**The definition of “High dose” vasopressors requires > 3 hours of any of the following: norepi[INVESTIGATOR_83872] > 20 
mcg/kg/min; dopamine monotherapy > 10 mcg/kg/min; phenylephrine monotherapy > 200 mcg/kg/min; epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]

Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, 2024
Treatment Guidelines: These guidelines aim to prevent grade 3 CRS  in participants treated with 
CD19/22CART with exception of allowance of low-dose pressor support, which may be used to 
prevent excessive fluid bolus administration and volume overload, which can exacerbate 
pulmonary edema in the setting of capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946].  
These guidelines may require modification based on each participant’s specific clinical 
circumstances. Failure to follow these guidelines exactly is not considered a protocol deviation. 
Treatment will be based on optimal medical management and does not necessarily correlate with 
CRS grade. 
**The impact of tocilizumab, siltuximab, and/or steroids or other immunosuppressive agents 
have not been studied in this protocol, utilizing this CAR construct for this participant 
population. Thus, the indication for use of tocilizumab, siltuxuimab, or other interventions for 
CRS will be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_83873].**
As of Amendment 5/08/2023, we will prioritize using siltuximab as first line CRS therapy for 
participants who require treatment for CRS see Figure 9.

15.5 APPENDIX E: CALCULATION OF WEIGHT FOR CELL DOSE CALCULATION IN M ORBIDLY 
OBESE PARTICIPANTS
Formulation for deriving the weight to be used in targeting cell doses in morbidly obese 
participants.
1.Definition Obesity is defined as a BMI > 30. For the purposes of this protocol, dose 
adjustments using practical body weight will be considered for those who have class 2 
obesity or a BMI >35. Dose cap will be implemented at 100kg, even if participants do not 
meet class 2 obesity definitions.
BMI = wgt (kg) / [hgt (M)][ADDRESS_91558], published formula: 
Ideal body weight (IBW) Definitions
IBW (adult male, age >20) 50 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet 
IBW (adult female), age >20) 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet 
IBW (pediatrics, age 2-20) 50th percentile weight based on CDC growth curves 
3.Calculation of the “practical weight.” 
Calculate the midway point, halfway between the actual and ideal body weights (ie the 
average of the two numbers). This is the "practical weight" that may be used in calculating 
the targeted cell dose for participants who have a BMI >35. 
4.Example:
Participant’s actual weight = 120 kg. 
Participant’ s actual height 173 cm = 69 in
BMI = 40
IBW formula = 50 + 2.3(9) = 70.[ADDRESS_91559] point between 70.0 and 120 = 95 kg.
The weight we would use in targeting cell dose is 95 kg. 
1 dose by [CONTACT_83971]: 
•IBW + 50%(Weight-IBW)
•Practical body weight = (IDW + actual BW)/2
2 Formula
IBW (male participants) 
➢52 kg + 1.9 kg/inch above 5 feet
➢50 kg + 2.39 (height in inches – 60)
IBW (female participants)
•49 kg + 1.7 kg/inch above 5 feet

Neurotoxicity Treatment Guidelines (suggested guidelines only)
Neurotoxicity Treatment*
Grade 1: - Supportive care
Grade 2: - Neurology Consult 
- Vigilant supportive care
- Consider brain imaging with MRI 
- Consider corticosteroids first (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV q6hrs, methylprednisolone 1mg/kg BID)
Grade 3: - As above with Grade 2
- Consider ICU transfer
- Consider EEG and/or CSF evaluations as clinically indicated
- Monitor with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry
- Consider IT dexamethasone or hydrocortisone. 
Grade 4: - As above with Grade 3
- Consider corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1g/day x 3 doses, followed by a rapid taper consisting of 250 
mg BID x 2 days, 125 mg BID x 2 days and then 60 mg BID x 2 days) 
*CRS should be treated as per the standard guidelines for treatment of systemic CRS, which may include utilization of tocilizumab, 
siltuximab, and/or steroids. Guidelines for treatment of neurotoxicity is intended to augment treatment of underlying systemic CRS or 
for additional treatment of neurotoxicity that extends beyond other systemic manifestations of CRS. Please note that signs and 
symptoms of neurotoxicity may be delayed from onset of initial signs of CRS and vigilant care is needed to identify and optimize 
treatment of neurotoxicity.

checklist at each required time point when possible.  If a parent/observer is not available at baseline or 
follow-up evaluation, the adult participant can complete the checklist at these time points, but a 
parent/observer should complete it at the Day 10 (± 4 days) time point if at all possible. An interpreter can 
be used to administer the NSC to subjects who do not speak English if needed.  
• We estimate that this test battery takes < [ADDRESS_91566] (1-2 minutes) and background form (5 minutes) while the participant is being 
tested but an adult participant can complete these forms if no parent/observer is available.

•  Some measures may not be administered if the participant does not appear to understand the task or 
becomes frustrated, is extremely fatigued, is ill (e.g., nauseous), or has physical (e.g., motor, vision) 
difficulties. This will not be considered a deviation.
CogState Computerized Test Battery (when available)
CogState is an approximately 20-minute computerizeda battery for children and adults ages 4 - 
90 years, which includes tasks tappi[INVESTIGATOR_83881], attention and vigilance, learning and 
memory, working memory and executive functions (Maruff et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_83882]., 2009).  
This measure was designed for repeated assessments over a short time period with virtually no 
practice effects in adults and children due to multiple forms (Falleti et al., 2006; Mollica et al., 
2005).  Age-based standard scores (mean = 100, SD 10) are computed for each task based on a 
normative sample of several hundred individuals.  CogState has strong construct validity, 
minimal practice effects, and good stability.  It was designed to be language independent in order 
to ensure the validity of the tests in a cross-cultural setting (e.g., Bangirana et al., 2009; Boivin et 
al., 2010; Cairney, Clough, Jaragba & Maruff, 2007; Dingwall & Cairney, 2010; Dingwall, 
Maruff, Frederisckon & Cairney, 2011; Lewis et al., 2010).  Further, CogState has been used in 
numerous pediatric, as well as adult, oncology clinical trials.  
Detection Task: This subtest of the CogState takes [ADDRESS_91567] in the center of the 
screen flips over.
Identification Task: This task takes [ADDRESS_91568] is red and No when it is black.
One Back Task: The One Back Memory task takes approximately [ADDRESS_91569] Learning Task: This task takes [ADDRESS_91570] responds by [CONTACT_21953]. 
Continuous Paired Associate Learning Task: The Continuous Paired Associate Learning task 
is a measure of visual associate memory, which takes approximately 5-7 minutes to 
134
Abbreviated Title: CD19/CD22 T-cell in Peds
Version Date: November 19, [ADDRESS_91571] to learn the locations of a 
number of amoeba-like shapes on the computer screen.  This task consists of a single 
amoeboid shape displayed in the center of the screen surrounded by a number of blue-filled 
circles.  Beneath all but two of the blue-filled circles are amoeboid shapes, one of which 
matches the central display; the two remaining circles are distractors.  In the exposure phase 
of the task all of the to-be-remembered pattern-location associations are presented on the 
computer screen simultaneously.  After a five-second delay, a pattern is shown in the central 
location and this signals that the subject should touch the location in the periphery that 
contains the same pattern.  This process continues until the participant has acknowledged all 
of the pattern-location associations.  The learning phase begins with the same task display 
presented during the exposure phase except that now all of the peripheral locations are shown 
as filled circles.  One of the patterns presented in the exposure phase is presented in the 
center location.  With the presentation of this pattern, the subject is required to select the 
peripheral location where an identical pattern is hidden beneath the circle. This process 
continues until the correct location of each pattern is found.  Finding the correct location for 
all patterns in the set is defined as a learning trial.  There are six learning trials. The software 
records each move as an error or as a correct move.
Groton Maze Learning Test: The Groton Maze Learning task is a measure of problem solving 
and reasoning and takes approximately 5-[ADDRESS_91572] is hidden among these 100 possible locations.  Each 
box represents move locations, and the grid refers to the box array (i.e., 10 x 10).  Subjects 
are required to find the hidden pathway guided by [CONTACT_83973].  These are: do not move 
diagonally, do not move more than one box (i.e., do not jump), do not move back on the 
pathway, and return to the last correct location after an error.  At each step only the most 
recently selected box is shown.  Feedback is given with visual and auditory cues (green 
check marks and red crosses) to indicate whether the selected box is correct or incorrect.  The 
head of path, or the last correct location, flashes with a green check when two errors are 
made in succession (failing to return errors). There are [ADDRESS_91573] move.

Neuro-symptom checklist
The Neuro-symptom checklist, which consists of neurologic symptoms previously observed in 
participants experiencing cytokine release syndrome, was developed specifically for studies 
assessing neurotoxicity of CAR T cell therapy.  It assesses the severity (mild, moderate, severe) 
and duration (<24 hours, 24-48 hours, and >48 hours) of symptoms, including fever, visual and 
auditory hallucinations, responsiveness to commands, disorientation, depressed mood, pain, and 
fatigue.  The caregiver of the participant is asked to complete the checklist based on their 
observations in the past two weeks; if the caregiver is not available, the adult participant can 
complete the checklist. If possible, the same person(s) should complete the checklist at each 
evaluation.

15.10 APPENDIX J: SUGGESTED INFECTION PROPHYLAXIS G UIDELINES
These are suggested guidelines only (not mandated) and should be applied only after discussion 
with the protocol and modified as needed based on individual needs.
CD19/CD22 CAR T Cell Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
For ANC < 500 (afebrile)
 
Fever
**If concern for Zosyn/penicillin allergy consider Meropenum. If anaphylaxis to 
penicillin, consult allergy in advance and plan for aztreonam/vancomycin
After resolution of fever 
without an identified infectious 
source and ANC < 500
Discontinuation of 
Anti-bacterial prophylaxisLevofloxacin
prophylaxis
Switch to IV Zosyn**
Stop LevofloxacinBroaden coverage (i.e., mero) or 
add aminoglycoside
Resume Levofloxacin
Prophylaxis. 
Discontinue IV 
antibiotics
Discontinue levofloxacin prophylaxis when: 
1. ANC > 250 without active infection after CRS, or
2. Day 28 if patient is outpatient and well, and
3. Consider G-CSF starting at day 28 (or as clinically 
indicated) if ANC < 250If stableIf concern for resistance or hemodynamic 
instability/other clinical concerns

Antibacterial Prophylaxis
1.) When ANC < 500, will initiate Levofloxacin prophylaxis
a. >40KG, Dose 500 mg Q 24 hours
b. 20-40KG, 250-375 mg Q24 hours
c. < 20KG, Dose 10mg/kg Q 24 hours
2.) If participant has fever on Levofloxacin
a. Routine surveillance blood cultures
b. Change antibiotics to IV Zosyn (may be modified based on participant specific 
antimicrobial resistance or allergy)
i. Adult Dosing: 4.5g Q 6 hrs
ii. Pediatric Dosing (< 40 kg): 100 mg/kg of pi[INVESTIGATOR_83888] q6h
c. Stop Levofloxacin
d. In the setting of penicillin/Zosyn allergy, start with IV Meropenum
i. Adult and pediatric dosing: 20 mg/kg Q 8, max dose of 1 gram Q 8 hrs
ii. If history of true anaphylaxis to Penicillins, please consider 
aztreonam/vancomycin and discuss with allergy consult in advance of 
starting meropenum. For such participants, implementation of 
levofloxacin prophylaxis will be discussed on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
3.) In the setting of suspected resistance, hemodynamic instability or clinical exam findings
a. Consider addition of an aminoglycoside or broadening coverage 
4.) When participant defervesces and is clinically stable without an active infection, and has 
ANC < 500
a. Consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_83889]
b. Add prophylactic Levofloxacin
5.) Consider discontinuing Levofloxacin prophylaxis at Day 28 if participant is outpatient, 
well-appearing, and/or when ANC >250 AND participant is clinically stable without any 
evidence for ongoing inflammation or CRS. Continue Levofloxacin as clinically 
indicated if ANC<250 and trial a dose of filgrastim. 
Antifungal Prophylaxis
1.) Micafungin 
a. >50 KG, Dose 50 mg IV daily
b. < 50 KG, Dose 1 mg/kg IV daily
2.) Posaconazole
a. 13 years and older: Delayed release tablets: Day 1: 300 mg tab BID, then 300 
mg daily 
b. <13 yo or less than 40 kg: Oral Suspension: 4 mg/kg/dose TID, >13 years old: 
max 200 mg TID
c. <13 yo or 25- 40 kg: Delayed release tablets 200 mg Q12 followed by 200 mg 
day

Antiviral Prophylaxis
1.) HSV prophylaxis with Acyclovir/Valtrex if + HSV titers
a.Acyclovir: 20mg/kg PO BID (max dose 800 mg BID)
PCP Prophylaxis
1.) Bactrim   Pentamidine (300mg inhaled q month) prior to CAR T cell infusion
2.) For participants that cannot do inhaled pentamidine (e.g. younger participant): 
Pentamidine may be given at 4 mg/kg (max 300 mg) intravenously once a month.

B1. PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL  
 
The overall goal of this study is to open up the promising treatment of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS), which has been shown to be effective against seizures in patients wi th surface 
neocortical foci, to a much larger population of patients with mesial temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  (MTLE)  
and other forms of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393156], who are not currently considered good rTMS candidates.  
 
We hypothesize that rTMS can modulate the hyp erexcitable state in patients with deep seizure foci by 
[CONTACT_393188]. In this study we aim 1) to map the functional 
connectivity of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393157] m esial 
temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]; and 2) to perform a randomized controlled assessment of repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols applied to specific neocortical targets in mesial temporal 
lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  The methods used in this study will incl ude magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of the 
brain, electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) . 
 
Our proposal, if successful, would open up this promising treatment to the large population of patients 
with MTLE, who are not cu rrently considered good rTMS candidates.  
 
 
 
B2. SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY  
Overview  
 
Neuromodulation with rTMS has been effective in seizure patients with cortical foci

location, and selection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_58804] . 1,2,[ADDRESS_493385] targeting of TMS, can dramatically benefit from repeated 
sessions of low -frequency (0.5 Hz or 1 Hz) rTMS, with striking improvem ents in seizure and IED

Cortical targets for TMS can be identified based on connectivity imaging in a model epi[INVESTIGATOR_393160] ( PNH ) offers an 
opportunity to study epi[INVESTIGATOR_393161] -
characterized and often genetically determined disorder that leads to seizures after a  latency of [ADDRESS_493388] recently identified altered physiological responsiveness in the cerebral cortex of patients with 
PNH; these changes appear to be specifically limited to cortical regions that have aberrant connectivity 
to deep reg ions of gray matter he terotopia. The nature of these functional abnormalities, which are 
characterized by [CONTACT_393189] -pulse TMS, is most consistent with cortical 
hyperexcitability, and supports the hypothesis that aberrant connectivity leads to epi[INVESTIGATOR_393162].  
 
There is clinical precedent for using rTMS to modulate networks involving deep gray matter  
Currently, rTMS is approved for therapeutic usage in patients with medically refractory depression. 
Specifically, tar geting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with rTMS over repeated sessions 
can decrease symptoms and signs of depression in those who have not been helped sufficiently by 
[CONTACT_6589]. The neurobiological basis of this effect is thought potentially to rest on the known 
connectivity between the DLPFC and other gray matter regions (including the deep subgenual cortex 
of the cingulate gyrus, for example) in networks important for mood regulation . 10.[ADDRESS_493389] on

A. Study Design – Overview, Methods, Procedures  
 
Overview  
 
The overall goal of this study is to open up the promising treatment of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS), which has been shown to be eff ective against seizures in patients with surface 
neocortical foci, to a much larger population of patients with mesial temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (MTLE) 
and other forms of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393156], who are not currently considered good rTMS candidates.  
We plan  to recruit thirty subjects with MTLE from our Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393163].  Subjects will undergo a series of noninvasive investigations, including 
high-resolution brain MRI , EEG,  and rTMS.  We plan to obtain b lood oxygenation level -dependent 
(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance (MR) images in [ADDRESS_493390] a controlled assessment 
of two different rTMS protocols applied to specific cortical targets (deriv ed from connectivity imaging 
results) in the 30 patients with medically refractory MTLE. We will randomize subjects into three 
treatment groups: In Group  1, we will target low -frequency rTMS to cortical regions that are highly 
correlated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393164].  In Group 2, we will target high -frequency rTMS to cortical 
regions that are highly anti -correlated with the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_393165]. Group 3 will receive sham rTMS 
as a control intervention.  At 12 -week follow -up, outcome  measures will be seizure frequ ency 
(primary) and interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_393166] (IED) frequency (secondary).   All subjects will have 
EEG recordings prior to the first TMS session, after the last session, and at [ADDRESS_493391], the MRI will be 
performed  in one 1 -hour session on one day , the EEGs will be performed in three 1 -hour session on 
three separate days (pre -rTMS, post -rTMS and 12 weeks after rTMS)  and rTMS will occur over ten 
daily [ADDRESS_493392] Enrollment  
We will recruit 30 subjects from our Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393167].  The patients may be initially informed on of several ways:  
- The investigator will briefly explain this study to them, and ask  if they would like to 
hear more about it. 
- The potential subject may be approached at the time of a clinic app ointment. At that 
time, the investigator may briefly explain the study. 
- The potential subject may receive a telephone call from an investigator on this study.  
At the time of the telephone call, the investigator may briefly explain the study.

In either case, a “voided copy” of the consent form will be ma iled to the potential subject, or 
hand ed to them in person if possible. This will allow adequate time to read the consent form in 
detail, record questions, and consider the option of enrollment. 
 
At the time of consent, randomization will occur based on order of enrollment into the study using a 
computer -generated randomization table.  Subjects will be randomized into thr ee treatment groups. In 
Group 1, we will target continuous low frequency rTMS (1 Hz, at 95% resting motor threshold 
(RMT), over ten daily 30 -minute sessions) to cortical regions that are highly correlated with the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_393165]. In Group 2, we will tar get high -frequency rTMS (10 Hz, 110% RMT, over ten 
daily 30 -minute sessions ) to cortical regions that are highly anti -correlated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393168]. Group 3 will receive sham TMS as a control intervention (using a sham coil over a highly 
correlated  cortical region , over ten daily 30 -minute sessions ). 
 
Subjects will be blinded to their treatment group assignment. Subjects and family members or 
caregivers will be asked to maintain diaries of all seizures and possible adverse effects, which will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_393190].  
 
1. MRI scanning and data analysis (One hour to complete, on one day)  
 
After subjects have been randomized, they will undergo brain connectivity imaging. We will obtain 
BOLD functional MRI i n [ADDRESS_493393]. This will allow us to selectively identify regions of relevant 
correlation to the MTL that fall within easily accessible areas for rTMS based on our technical 
experience (including most of the fr ontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortex, while avoiding the 
frontopolar and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_393169]). Subject time: 1 hour.  
 
2. Baseline seizure diary (12 w eeks)  
Subjects will keep a baseline seizure diary for [ADDRESS_493394] time: 12 weeks.  
 
3. Pre-rTMS EEG  (One hour to complete, on one day)  
EEG  recordin g of interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_393166] (IED)  frequency will occur prior to first TMS 
session. Subject time: 1 hour.  
 
4. Experimental Design for rTMS ( On average one and a half hours  to complete, on  ten consecutive 
weekdays ) 
We will conduct a controlled ass essment of two different rTMS protocols applied to specific cortical  
targets (derived from connectivity imaging results) in the [ADDRESS_493395] time: 
1.5 hours per rTMS session.  10 rTMS sessions.

Additional Follow -Up Analyses  
At 12 -week follow -up after the second rTMS protocol, the primary outcome measure will be seizure 
frequency and the secondary outco me measure will be IED frequency.  B oth of  those measur es will be 
compared both to the pre -rTMS  baseline and to the measures following the initial rTMS protocol.  
Subjects will be blinded to their group assignment, as will the investigator who reviews seizure diaries 
and determines IED frequency on  EEG. Adverse events will be tracked closely throughout the study 
protocol.  
 
 
Details of methods to be used  
 
Brain image acquisition  
Thirty subjects with MTLE will be imaged on a dedicated research 3.0 -Tesla magnet (General Electric 
Signa VH/i, GE Healthc are, Waukesha, WI) with a commercial head coil.  High resolution structural 
whole -brain images will be acquired using a T1 -weighted sequence with 128 slices per slab, a 256 x 
256 matrix, a field of view (FOV) of 256 mm, a slice thickness of 1.33 mm with 0. 63 mm interslice 
gap, repetition time (TR) of 2530 ms, inversion time of 1100 ms, echo time (TE) of 3.[ADDRESS_493405] quietly (acquisition tim e 6.4 min), using an echo -planar sequence sensitive to BOLD 
contrast with TR 6000 ms, TE 30 ms, FOV 256 mm, voxel size 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 mm, and flip angle 90 
degrees.  
 
rTMS protocol  
Stimulation will be performed with a Nexstim eXimia TMS stimulator with re al-time MRI 
neuronavigation (Nexstim NBS software version 3.2.1, Nexstim Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) and a figure -
of-eight coil (mean diameter 59 mm, outer diameter 70 mm). Resting motor threshold (RMT) will be 
determined via surface electromyography recorded using pre -gelled disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes, 
with the active electrode over the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle, the reference electrode over 
the metacarpophalangeal joint, and the ground electrode over the wrist. RMT will be conventionally 
define d as the minimum stimulus intensity that elicits a motor evoked potential of at least [ADDRESS_493406] five out of ten trials. Low -frequency rTMS will employ a 1 -Hz, 95% RMT protocol for 30 -
minute sessions delivered once each day over ten consecutive week days. High -frequency rTMS will 
employ a 10 -Hz, 110% RMT protocol delivered similarly over ten days. Sham TMS will employ a 
specially fabricated coil that provides no magnetic stimulation but has a similar appearance and creates 
an auditory artifact that mi mics TMS, and will be targeted toward a highly correlated cortical target.  
 
EEG analysis  
EEG will be recorded using a 60 -channel TMS -compatible system (eXimia EEG, Nexstim Ltd, 
Helsinki, Finland). EEG signals will be referenced to an additional electrode o n the forehead, filtered 
(0.1 – 500 Hz) and sampled at [ADDRESS_493407] 60 minutes in du ration, and subjects will be kept awake to control for the effects of

B. Statistical Considerations  
 
Sample Size Justification:   
 
Our expected statistical analyses will be based on intention to treat and will include an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with  the factors Group (low -frequency vs. high -frequency vs. sham) and Time 
(baseline vs. follow -up) with repeated measures on time, to assess both seizure frequency (primary 
outcome) and IED frequency (secondary outcome). If indicated, post hoc analyses, corr ected for 
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method, will be performed. Based on results from the two 
most directly relevant rTMS epi[INVESTIGATOR_393171]5,4, we estimate the effect size of a 
potential decrease in mean seizure frequency at  56%. To achieve 80% power, with a statistical 
threshold of α < 0.05 and three equal treatment groups, the total sample size needed would be 27 
subjects12, so we plan to enroll 30 subjects.   
 
According to the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_219589], temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_393172] 60% of all 
patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_393173] 80% of all patients with temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  MTLE  
is the most common form of refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_393174].  At BIDMC, there 
are more than [ADDRESS_493409]. This will allow us to selectively identify regions of 
relevant correlation to the MTL that fall within easily accessible areas for rTMS based on our 
technical experience ( including most of the frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortex, while 
avoiding the frontopolar and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_393175]).  
 
We expect to demonstrate path ological connectivity involving the MTL and specific cortical regions; 
this will be a major step in understanding MTLE pathogenesis and in defining targets for stimulation. 
We will use an in -house functional connectivity software toolbox for analysis, as w e have done for our 
Preliminary Data. Briefly, our steps include realigning, normalizing, and coregistering functional 
images, followed by [CONTACT_393191]. Band -pass filtering and smoothing 
will be applied, and possible confounders removed. A population -based map of MTL connectivity 
(derived from normal individuals), with rTMS -accessible regions removed, will be used as a seed 
network to create color -coded functional connectivity maps identifying rTMS -accessible areas of 
significant correlation and anti -correlation to the average BOLD time -series within the MTL network,

cortical targets (derived from connectivity imaging results) in the 30 patients with medically refractory 
MTLE. The cohort will be randomized into three treatment groups. In Group 1, we will target 
continuous low frequency rTMS (1 Hz, at 95% resting mot or threshold (RMT), over ten daily 30 -
minute sessions) to cortical regions that are highly correlated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393165]. In Group 2, 
we will target high -frequency rTMS (10 Hz, 110% RMT, 10 daily sessions) to cortical regions that are 
highly anti -correlated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393165]. Group 3 will receive sham TMS as a control 
intervention (using a sham coil over a highly correlated cortical region). At [ADDRESS_493411] shown seizure 
frequency reductions in the 53 -80% range, durable over at least eight weeks of follow -up, and IED 
frequency reductions in the 14 -66% range. 4,[ADDRESS_493412] -
rTMS, as well as at the end of the follow -up period, will allow for an estimation of immediate and 
delayed/durable effects on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_393176]. We expect our results to prove the 
principle that patients with deep seiz ure foci can be safely treated by [CONTACT_393192] (high - or low -frequency) is optimal 
for MTLE.  
 
Our analysis following the second rTMS protocol, in those subjects who participate in that portion of 
the study, will provide further evidence of the relative efficacy of the two rTMS protocols in 
downmodulating cortical excitability.  
 
Brain image acquisition  
Anatomical and functional connectivity MR images will be acquired using a dedi cated research 3.0 - 
Tesla magnet (General Electric Signa VH/i, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with a commercial head 
coil. Highresolution structural whole -brain images will be acquired using a T1 -weighted sequence 
with 128 slices per slab, a 256 x 256 matrix , a field of view (FOV) of 256 mm, a slice thickness of

software13 as a discrete region of cortex that demonstrates significant connectivity to the MTLE 
network seed, based on the analyses derived above. Targets will then be transferred directly into the 
TMS neuronavigation software f or visualization during the stimulation paradigm.  
 
rTMS protocol  
Stimulation will be performed with a Nexstim eXimia TMS stimulator with real -time MRI 
neuronavigation (Nexstim NBS software version 3.2.1, Nexstim Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) and a figure -
of-eight coil (mean diameter 59 mm, outer diameter 70 mm). Resting motor threshold (RMT) will be 
determined via surface electromyography recorded using pre -gelled disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes, 
with the active electrode over the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) m uscle, the reference electrode over 
the metacarpophalangeal joint, and the ground electrode over the wrist. RMT will be conventionally 
defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that elicits a motor evoked potential of at least [ADDRESS_493417] five out of  ten trials. Low -frequency rTMS will employ a 1 -Hz, 95% RMT protocol for 30 -
minute sessions delivered once each day over ten consecutive weekdays. High -frequency rTMS will 
employ a 10 -Hz, 110% RMT protocol delivered similarly over ten days. Sham TMS will e mploy a 
specially fabricated coil that provides no magnetic stimulation but has a similar appearance and creates 
an auditory artifact that mimics TMS, and will be targeted toward a highly correlated cortical target.  
 
EEG analysis  
EEG will be recorded using  a 60-channel TMS -compatible system (eXimia EEG, Nexstim Ltd,

(0.1 – 500 Hz) and sampled at [ADDRESS_493418] -certified in clinical

If investigators deem necessary, urine pregnancy testing may be performed before enrollment in the 
study.  
 
The planned enrollmen t demographics for our study are derived from the demographic 
representation of the Greater [LOCATION_011] area (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000), from which the 
majority of our human subjects will be drawn.  We thus expect to enroll approximately 10% 
Hispanic or Latino subjects and 90% non -Hispanic/Latino.  Among racial categories, we expect to 
enroll approximately 75% white subjects, 10% black or African -American, and <5% each American 
Indian/Alaska native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. No sex/gender or 
racial/ethnic groups will be excluded from this study.  
 
Our subject selection criteria are based purely on age (18 -64); diagnosis of MTLE; and 
nonfulfillment of specific exclusion criteria. MTLE appears to be evenly distributed across 
racial /ethnic lines.  One of our exclusion criteria is pregnancy (due to lack of definitive information 
on fetal safety in MRI), but we do not believe this will independently affect the sex/gender 
composition of our enrolled subjects in any significant way.  
 
We will recruit subjects from our Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393167].  Randomization will occur based on order of enrollment into the study using a computer -
generated randomization table. Subjects will be blinded to thei r treatment group assignment. Subjects 
and family members or caregivers will be asked to maintain diaries of all seizures and possible adverse 
effects, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_393190]. All subjects 
will prov ide written informed consent in accordance with research protocols that will be approved by 
[CONTACT_393193].  
 
  
 
 
B4. POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
 
We do not necessarily expect this study to yield direct benefit s to the participating subjects.  However, 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be effective against seizures in 
patients with surface neocortical foci; therefore, there is a possibility that a larger population of 
patients  with mesial temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_393179] a result of treatment of rTMS.  Additionally, a thorough 
understanding of when and how to treat with rTMS would lead to improved t reatment options.

B5. POSSIBLE RISKS AND ANALYSIS OF RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
Possible Risks  
 
Brain imaging  
 
There are no known or foreseeable risks or side effects associated with conventional MRI except to those 
people who have electrically, magneticall y, or mechanically activated implants (such as cardiac 
pacemakers) or to those who have clips on blood vessels in their brain.  Subjects will therefore be 
screened very carefully to exclude the possibility that they have any such devices and/or implants an d 
will be excluded from participation if they do.  We will employ our institution’s standard research MRI 
safety questionnaire in advance of enrollment.  
 
There are no known additional risks associated with functional MRI.  Both the conventional and 
functio nal MRI systems have been approved by [CONTACT_393194].  The Center for Biomedical Imaging’s usual safety guidelines 
concerning MRI will be in place at all times.  
 
MRI might be uncomfortable  if subjects are prone to claustrophobia, do not like to lie still for a period of 
time, or do not like banging or beepi[INVESTIGATOR_393180].  The investigator will explain the procedure and if 
potential subjects express any doubt about these issues, they will not be  included in the study.  
Investigators will remain in continual verbal contact [CONTACT_393195]; if subjects 
indicate that they feel uncomfortable during the scan, they can activate the emergency button and can be 
taken out of the sca nner at any time.   
 
Scalp EEG Recording  
 
Routine EEG is performed by [CONTACT_393196] a standard removable adhesive.  
In our experimental protocol, Ag -Ag/Cl scalp electrodes that are TMS -compatible and have been used 
extensively in h uman subjects14 will be employed.  On rare occasions patients may have an irritative 
scalp reaction to the electrodes or adhesive, but this is very uncommon, and would result in 
discontinuation of the test if necessary.  No electrical current is passed thr ough the electrodes, and the 
recording of cortical potentials occurs painlessly without the need for any particular effort on the 
subjects’ part other than quiet rest.  No activation procedures, such as intermittent photic stimulation 
or hyperventilation, will be used.   Our institution’s usual clinical safety guidelines concerning scalp 
EEG recording will be in place at all times.  
 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation  
 
TMS has been used in a growing number of laboratories worldwide since 1984.  A series of ad verse 
events have been identified.  Guidelines for the safe use of rTMS were published in [ADDRESS_493421] International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation held in June 1996 in B ethesda, Maryland.  At this workshop, a 
revised table for maximum single rTMS train duration, depending on rTMS frequency and intensity, for 
the safe application of rTMS, was agreed upon.15 The proposed study uses rTMS parameters well within 
these safety g uidelines.  However, the following side effects require mention: 
 
1.  Up to 20 -40% of individuals undergoing TMS experience headaches or neck pain, which are

7/2/[ADDRESS_493422]’s hearing protection fell out and resulted in permanent hearing loss during 
a 1Hz rTMS session at 120% of the motor threshold.  The authors were using a special TMS 
coil called the H -coil in which the subject’s head  is inside a large helmet. However, the authors 
claimed that the loudness of the H -Coil they were using was not different from other coils .[ADDRESS_493423] the subjects, we will take the following precautions:  
a. Advise subjects of t he risk of permanent hearing loss if an earplug should loosen, become 
detached, or fall out.  
b. Advise subjects that they should immediately report to the investigator any loosening or 
detachment of an earplug during TMS.  
c. Inform subjects that investigators wi ll immediately stop TMS if the subject reports or if an 
investigator observes that an earplug has loosened or has fallen out.  
d. Prompt referral for auditory assessment of all individuals who complain of hearing loss, 
tinnitus, or aural fullness following com pletion of TMS.  
 
3. The risk of seizure during TMS is a well -studied one.  In normal subjects, it is an extremely rare 
occurrence.  Repetitive TMS can induce a seizure in the absence of pre -existing brain lesions, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], or other seizure risk factors, both  in patients and healthy subjects. From the several 
thousands of studies that have used TMS to date, a total of [ADDRESS_493424] been reported, of 
which 9 cases occurred after the 1998 safety guidelines. Based on the available data, the 
reported risk of seizu res is less than 1 in 1000 for repetitive TMS.  In individuals with a known 
history of seizures, the occurrence of a seizure temporally proximate to TMS is very uncommon; 
the overall rate of any seizure associated with single - and paired -pulse TMS in those  with known 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_393181] 0.8 -1.8%, and the risk if no changes were made in anticonvulsant medications is 
only 0.0 -0.4%.  Similarly, even with rTMS in patients with known epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], the crude risk of 
seizures associated with TMS was about 1.4%, and almos t all seizures were identical to those 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_393182], making it unclear whether seizures were causally related 
to the TMS or not.[ADDRESS_493425] ever 
been reported in association with TMS.  
4. Syncope can occur due to anxiety and psycho -physical discomfort during testing and treatment 
with TMS. This is reported less than seizure ac tivity but the true number may be higher due to 
underreporting.  Subjects will be monitored for feeling any signs or symptoms of a pending 
syncopal event (i.e. feeling “dizzy, lightheaded or going to pass out”).  TMS will immediately 
be stopped and the sub ject will be assisted.  
5. TMS could induce short -term changes in memory, attention, and other cognitive functions.  This 
is a theoretical risk, as none of the safety studies conducted has found such side effects. 
However, because the understanding of brain c onnectivity in the population of patients with 
PNH is limited, the risk for these patients in particular is not clear.

medically refractory depression or bipolar dis order who received rTMS.  This seems to be a rare 
complication (incidence <0.15% of patients), and individuals with a current diagnosis of a mood 
disorder will be excluded from this study.  
7. The possibility of dental pain during rTMS has been reported.  This  potential adverse effect 
would occur during the stimulation itself.  Subjects will be asked to report any such discomfort 
immediately to the investigator, who would terminate the stimulation session.  The subject will 
be encouraged to seek a dental evalua tion, since this is a very rare occurrence but may point to 
the presence of a cavity that may require care.  This adverse effect is not expected to lead to any 
lasting problems or complications.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
 
As described above, no significant  health risks are expected from the neuroimaging procedures in this 
study.  Standard research MRI safety procedures in place at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will 
be used, including safety questionnaires prior to scanning (asking about surgeries, me tal implants, 
shrapnel, etc.).   
 
Multiple safety precautions are in place for the TMS portion of the study, including the design of the 
stimulation protocol in a way that is well within guidelines for rTMS safety, is consistent with prior 
studies that hav e demonstrated safety in a population of patients with refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] .[ADDRESS_493427] who has been trained in 
the safe and efficient administration of TMS and in basic life support  and in the recognition and 
treatment of seizures, syncope, and other neurological and medical emergencies.  A fully equipped 
and regularly checked “crash cart” is available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for potential 
emergencies.  This emergency  equipment also includes oxygen supply, IV line supplies, and 
emergency medications in the event of a convulsion.   Subjects will be monitored in detail during 
and after delivery of TMS, using an approach drawn directly from suggested guidelines.  
 
Confide ntiality will be preserved at all times, using standard HIPAA -compliant clinical measures 
already in place at the institution.  As described above, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177591]’s research assistant will be 
aware of individual subject identities and have access to co de number assignments.     
 
The PI, a board -certified neurologist and clinical neurophysiologist, will be responsible for the 
patient’s medical welfare should any unexpected adverse events occur during these research 
activities, and will intervene as appro priate.  
 
Risk-Benefit Analysis  
 
Given the limited foreseeable risks described above, the procedures to be put in place to protect against 
these risks, and the potential benefits to the subjects and others as described above, the risk/benefit ratio 
is accep table for subjects.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
All adverse effects , regardless of attribution to study procedures,  will be collected from the start of the 
experimental protocol to the end of study participation , using standard adverse event forms.  Subje cts 
will be asked in an open -ended way about the presence of any adverse events; intensity will be graded

for each adverse event; and the likelihood that the event is or is not related to study participation will be 
noted.  
 
A data safety monitoring board,  comprising three investigators with expertise in the field, experience in 
conduct of human subject research and statistical knowledge, independence from the direct management 
of this study, and freedom from conflict of interest or commitment, will be appo inted by [CONTACT_978].  A 
chairperson will be appointed and will be responsible for overseeing the meetings, developi[INVESTIGATOR_393183], and summarizing the meeting.  The chairperson will be the contact [CONTACT_100092].  
 
The DSMB will meet prior to the enrollment  of the first subject to review the research protocol, informed 
consent documents and plans for safety and data monitoring of the study.  The DSMB will determine the 
risks and benefits to research subjects, protection and safety of the subjects and offer s uggestions for 
improving the study design.  In addition, the Board will reach agreement on the data that will be required 
for review.  Determination of the schedule of future meetings, appointment of the chair and voting 
members, who receives minutes, and the signing of conflict of interest statements will occur during pre -
enrollment meeting.  The pre -enrollment Board meeting may result in modification of the safety plan 
provided in the CCI application.  If the DSMP is changed at the first meeting of the Bo ard, the new plan 
will be submitted to the BIDMC Committee on Clinical Investigations (CCI).  
 
The DSMB will meet at least annually, and may decide to meet more frequently if necessary.  The 
chairperson may call ad hoc meetings depending on safety or effica cy concerns.  Meetings may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_393197] e -mail at the request of Board members.  The DSMB will review 
interim data to detect evidence of efficacy or adverse effects to determine if the trial should continue as 
originally designed,  should be changed or should be stopped based on the data.  The DSMB will evaluate 
the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality/completeness, recruitment goals, 
protocol adherence, accrual and retention of participants and othe r factors that may affect the study 
outcome. The DSMB will protect confidentiality of the study participants, trial data and results of the 
monitoring.  
 
Specifically, at each meeting, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_393184] a t 
the pre -enrollment meeting. The Board may then, according to a plan determined at the pre -enrollment 
meeting, review the following:   
a. determine adherence to treatment plan  
b. review interim analysis, if applicable, and determine specific data to be 
analyzed  
c. evaluate end point/stop point rules  
d. review protocol violations and deviations to assess adequacy of study

Minutes from the meeting will be m aintained. The investigator will not be present for at least part of 
this meeting.  Following the Board meeting, a report will be provided to the investigator, the BIDMC 
CCI, and if necessary, study participants.  The report will indicate whether the study  should continue 
as originally designed, whether the study should be modified to protect patient safety or whether the 
study should be terminated.  
 
All records regarding this research project will be stored in the locked office of the PI, in the 
Comprehen sive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393185].  The data will be stored on paper and on secure compu ters 
protected with passwords. The subjects’ identity will not be disclosed in publications or presentations.  
The records of the research project are open only to authoriz ed monitors from the BIDMC CCI, the 
DSMB, and the FDA.  All applicable local regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of adverse 
events will be followed during this study.  
 
 
B6. RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Recruitment  
 
We will recruit subj ects from our Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393167].  The patients may be initially informed on of several ways:  
- The investigator will briefly explain this study to them, and ask  if they would like to 
hear more about it. 
- The potential subject may be approached at the time of a clinic app ointment. At that 
time, the investigator may briefly explain the study. 
- The potential subject will receive a telephone call from an investigator on this study. 
In either case, a “voided copy” of the consent form will be ma iled to the potential subject, or 
hand ed to them in person if possible, prior to meeting for informed consent. This will allow 
adequate time to read the consent form in detail, record questions, and consider the option of 
enrollment. 
 
Consent  
 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_393198]. Those potential subjects who 
do not express interest in the study will be thanked and no further recruitment efforts will be pursued.  
For those who do express int erest in the study, they will be given a copy of the consent form. The 
study procedure, risks and benefits, and alternatives will be explained by [CONTACT_393199],  and subjects will be encouraged to ask questions and discuss any concerns. The 
Investigator  will then obtain informed consent and each subject will be given a copy of the signed 
informed consent form.  Potential subjects will be reminded that participation in the study is 
completely voluntary and that they are free to terminate the study at any time, and that the Principal

phone or to be contact[CONTACT_6811] a different number or at a later time, their preferences will be 
accommodated.  The information collected during recruitment will be limited only to the minimum 
amoun t of data necessary, namely to confirm that the subjects actually are eligible for the study 
according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The consent process will occur in person in a private 
examination room with the door closed in a secure clinical ar ea. 
 
 Physical Setting  
 
Recruitment and consent will occur at the Comprehensive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393186] (PI’s location).  
 
MRI scanning and TMS experiments will be performed at the Berenson -Allen Center for Noninvasive 
Brain Stimulation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  
 
Data analysis will occur at BIDMC (PI’s location), and the Berenson -Allen Center for Noninvasive 
Brain Stimulation at BIDMC (la boratory of Mouhsin Shafi, MD, PhD (Co -investigator). For data 
analysis, im aging datasets will be transferred either in person to the collaborating sites or 
electronically using secure Web -based file transfer protocols  
 
 
B8. DATA SECURITY  
 
Data obtained from out experiments will be assigned specific identifying code numbers so t hat they 
can be processed, analyzed, and reported without direct access to subjects’ identities.  Only the 
following individuals at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center need to know individual subject 
identities, and will have access to the code number ass ignments: the PI [INVESTIGATOR_227067]’s research assistant.  
Electronic data containing PHI will be kept on a secure server behind the BIDMC firewall.

 PART I – REPORT OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS  
 
1. General Introduction  
Overview of disorder studied, and current treatments  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) is an insult to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_223637] a change, either temporary or 
permanent, in its normal motor, sensory, and/or autonomic function.  It is estimated that the 
annual incidence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI), not including tho se who die at the scene of the 
accident, is approximately [ADDRESS_889827] injury increased from 28.7 years in the 1970’s  to [ADDRESS_889828]; those with paraplegia have lesions in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Since 2005, the most frequent neurologic category at discharge of persons reported 
to the database is incomplete tetraplegia (40.8%), followed by [CONTACT_659946] a (21.6%), 
incomplete paraplegia (21.4%) and complete tetraplegia (15.8%). Less than 1% of persons 
experienced complete neurologic recovery by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_2345] (National Spi[INVESTIGATOR_659926], 2012).   
 
Previous Work  
In a study published in Nature by [CONTACT_659947], et al tetraplegic participants were implanted with a 
96-channel microelectrode array in the cortex. Movement intentions from neural activity were 
decoded from the microelectrodes and used by [CONTACT_659948] a 
robotic arm by [CONTACT_659949].   The microelectrode a rray is a multichannel, high -density, device 
that allows neural recordings from large populations of neurons. Over the past two decades, this 
patented microelectrode array te chnology has underg one numerous refinements and repeated 
validations i n a variety of species (humans, monkeys, birds, rodents, felines, fish) and 
 Version: 7/16/2019

 preparations (in vitro and in vivo). This effort delivered a prove n and well -documented method 
to obtain stable and long -term neu ral recordings of action potentials (spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988]) and field potential s 
in brain and peripheral -nerve tissue. Because the array can be wired to various connector types, 
researchers can choose a connector that is optimal for chronic (l ong-term) or acute (short -term) 
recordings from small to large participants  as well as from slice and cell culture preparations  
(Blackrock Microsystems) . 
 
Battelle , (a private nonprofit  applied science and technology development company 
headquartered in Columbus, Ohio ) was directly involved with the Hochberg study referenced, 
and specifically developed the dec oding algorithms used in four of the participants (Bouton 
2009 ), and has now developed a technology called “Neural Bridge” to link neural decoding to 
neurostimulation (Bouton 2011 , Bouton et al, 2016, Sharma et al, 2016) .  Specifically, Battelle 
has develo ped a technology that decode s brain activity for imagined movements and then 
transforms the data into neuromuscular stimulation patterns to evoke the limb movement  that 
was imagined .  This technology in effect creates a ‘neural bridge /by[CONTACT_6476] ’ or ‘virtual spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]’ 
to by[CONTACT_659950].  This technology can target specific muscles in the 
forearm, for example, to allow wrist and hand/finger movements based on the decoded brain 
activity in the participant’s motor cortex.  The objective of the study proposed in this submission 
is to allow reanimation of a paralyzed limb under complete voluntary control of the participant.  
This will be a significant step towards the artificial spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]  / nervous system with potential 
applic ations beyond spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], including stroke and motor neuron disease. See  Figure 1 
for an overall system diagram  and neuromuscular sleeve and glove components of the system . 
The Neuroport device is a (510(k) K070272, K090957)  cleared  device manufactured by 
[CONTACT_659951] (Salt Lake, Utah) and the Neuromuscular Stimulator System is a n 
investigational  device developed by [CONTACT_223648] (Columbus, Ohio) that has been reviewed by a 
registered IRB and has been used  with human participant s with no related adverse effects  
reported .  (See the Device Description section for further details.)

Study Rationale  
This study will extend the previous work in neural decoding and allow the investigators to better 
understand how the human nervous system can be augmented or bridged when trauma or disease 
has occurred  which decouples the nervous system from the voluntary control of muscles . 

 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 8 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 Previous work allowed participants to imagine various limb movements and control a computer 
cursor or other devices (Bouton 2009 ).  The key extension in this study is to allow participants 
with tetraplegia to regain voluntary control of a paralyzed limb. The system will use re -coding 
algorithms to first decode brain activity in the motor cortex and then re -encode the signals for 
high definition stimulation  of the sel ected muscles .  “Neural bridging ”, as it is termed,  involves 
signal monitoring  (in the nervous system  with a Neuroport microelectrode array ), decoding of 
the information present, and then re-encoding appropriate stimulation  signals  for non-invasive 
inserti on in another location in the nervous system , in this case directly to the muscles of interest .  
The insertion of signals back into the nervous s ystem will be achieved through a  non-invasive 
function neuromuscular stimulation system  (NMES) (Bouton et al 20 12).  The NMES will be in 
the form of a cuff /array or a sleeve consisting of a flexible circuit that has  electrodes of 12mm 
diameter.  In the case of the sleeve, the cuff and electrodes are housed in a spandex fabric. A 
non-toxic FDA -approved conductive lo tion form s the interface between the electrodes and the 
skin allowing stimulation of small and large muscles in the arm and hand to evoke a wide variety 
of movements. The optional glove (Figure 1, b and c) connects to the sleeve and provides 
information back to the system about the position of the hand and arm in sp ace, as well as the 
flexion and extension of the fingers and wrist. The glove does not provide stimulation and is for 
positional information gathering only.   
 
Neurostimulation  systems have been developed to restore functional movement in chronic 
paralysis  population. The approach that provides the most functional multidimensional 
movement control utilizes a combination of a brain -computer interface (BCI) with implanted 
cortical sensors.  However, to date, human applications of implanted BCI technology have  been 
limited to assistive technologies such as power chairs or robotic arms. An implanted BCI 
neuroprosthetic system designed to produce functional upper limb movement was only recently 
tested in an animal.  
 
The system described in this study is unique i n that the BCI system translates intended action 
into human motion. Unlike the animal study previously referenced where the functional 
movement was generated through an implanted functional electrical stimulation system, this 
study will deliver surface sti mulation through the NMES .

performed over 2,[ADDRESS_889830] injury rehabilitation program within the Department of 
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation  ( PM&R ). The PM&R program at OSU  is nationally 
recognized as a preeminent rehabilitation program. [CONTACT_659974] is the Chair of PM&R and a 
study co -investigator.  
 
Battelle has extensive experience in developi[INVESTIGATOR_659927]  (Bouton 2009 ).  Battelle has also developed 
training methods to enhance the ability of participants  to evoke targeted neural activity in the 
primary motor cortex  for various imagined arm and hand movements.  Battelle has also tested 
the study components (cuff, sleeve, conductive lotion and stimulator system) in a Battelle IRB -
approved Study (Battelle IRB 0466 ) without adverse effects or complications.

 range of 100 -800 kΩ (at 1kHz) and are capable of recording single and multi -unit action 
potentials with signal -to-noise ratios of up to [ADDRESS_889837] touching the patient elsewhere (skin to

and hand/finger movements. Encoding al gorithms will use the calibration data and the decoded 
data to create the appropriate spatial and temporal stimulation patterns to evoke imagined 
movements.  
 
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889839] less than 4 hours (including setup time).  The first [ADDRESS_889840]  the cortical 
implant  removed via a second procedure.  
 
The participant(s) will recei ve haptic feedback above the level of their injury during motor tasks 
to enhance their motor performance. Haptic feedback simply provides a skin sensation (e.g. 
vibration), is well characterized in the literature (Shull & Damian, 2015), and is a well -studi ed 
and safe stimulus carrying no significant increase in risk. The apparatus will be electrically 
isolated from the participant. The participants currently receive electrical skin stimulation for 
feedback I the study. Haptic feedback is a non -electrical sa fer means of providing even more 
meaningful sensory information to enhance motor capability.  
 
During this phase  of the study a virtual reality headset  may be used  to provide visualizations of 
imagined movements. If the virtual reality headset is not used, the virtual environment will be 
displayed on a screen. On occasion, the virtual reality headset may show the participant 
incongruent movements , that is,  movements  different from reality, to study the participant’s 
sense of agency. This reanimation study offers a unique opportunity to study the neural 
mechanisms of motor awareness, such as sense of agency or movement intentions. Agency is the 
sense that we control t he actions of our own body (Gallagher, 2000; Jeannerod, 2003) and is a 
fundamental aspect of the experience of self. In this study, normal efferent and afferent 
sensorimotor information is replaced by [CONTACT_659952], 
respectivel y. Congruent and incongruent visual feedback presented via virtual reality may 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 15 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 provide important information about the  fundamental  mechanisms of self -awareness.  The 
importance of showing both congruent (the VR representation looks the same as the intended 
movement) and incongruent (the VR representation shows different movement than the 
participant’s intended movement, is important in understanding whether or not the participant is 
self-aware of the movements he is making with his paralyzed limb. This type of VR experiment 
is currently being done with the participant (i.e. showing congruent and incongruent 
movements), but on a flat screen which is a less immersive and less engaging environment. The 
addition of the device may remove some bias of the participa nt being able to see his limb, which 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_659928], but is never completely out of view.  
 
Use of VR will advance our current “screen -limited” understanding of the reasons that influence 
ownership or control a person with tetraplegia m ay have over a hand or limb they cannot feel.  It 
is anticipated  that improving visualization and subjective feeling of movement during training 
will enhance training efficiency  and make it easier for participants to move their limbs . We will 
explore whether brain -computer interface training using  virtual reality  decreases training time 
compared to standard (non -VR) training protocols . 
 
A brain machine interface is expected to function at all times, interpreting brain activity and 
producing mov ements. One way our brain limits the production of activity from neural activity 
in the motor cortex is by [CONTACT_659953]. Therefore the brain machine interface should be able to underst and different brain 
states and adjust its function appropriately. Currently we have very limited knowledge about the 
activity of motor cortex during sleep in primates. Some have suggested that the activity of 
neurons during certain parts of the sleep cycle  may be related to motor learning. EEG/EMG 
recordings and intraco rtical data from our participants  will allows us to better understand the 
relationship between brain activity and motor output during various stages of sleep.  
 
Addi tional to the weekly test s essions, the participant  will be admitted to The Ohio State Wexner 
Medical Center  for overnight  sleep evaluation s. We will ask the participant  to perform a variety 
of motor tasks. Those will be similar to the ones that the participant  performe d during the 
recording sessions. While the participant  is performing th e motor tasks we will record EMG  
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889841] s, and TMS procedures  as they did during the baseline phase.  
 
3.2.5 Study Specific Procedures  
 
Neuropsychological T ests 
Neuropsychological tests are  useful to us to help categorize whether there are minimum 
neuropsych ological  criteria for successful patient selection and  to determine safety (i.e., whether 
the procedure carries risk of decline in neuropsych ological  function post -explant).  
Neuropsycholo gical tests  will include but not limited to:  
• Motor -Free Visual Perception Test (MVPT -3) 
• Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS -III) 
• Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS -III) 
• Delis – Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS)  
 
Neurophysiological Recordings  
The neuroph ysiological recording and evaluations will include Electromyography (EMG)/Nerve 
Conduction Studies (NCS), Electroencephalography (EEG) EEG, Quantitative EEG (QEEG), 
and evoked response assessments involving the Event -related Potential (ERPs) and steady sta te 
sensory evoked potentials (SSEP). These studies are non -invasive and are routinely performed in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_659929], PM&R  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_236750] s. These 
studies will be performed at various times and will involve spo ntaneous recordings as well as 
recordings linked to decision making paradigms as well as auditory, tactile and visual non -
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 17 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 invasive stimuli. These evaluations may also be performed in conjunction with intraoperative 
microelectrode recording and stimulation.  
 
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a routine physiological measure of cerebral function that has 
been used to evaluate TBI as well as to prognosticate survival and global outcome after TBI. 
Quantitative EEG (QEEG) methods evaluate brain functions and task s pecific EEG changes that 
can provide information about patterns of brain activity related to attention, learning and 
behavior. QEEG results in the same patient before and following cortical array  implantation will 
allow changes in brain function to been quantified. Event -related potentials (ERPs) reflect 
processing that involves selective attention, memory, comprehension and other types of 
cognitive activity in the brain. ERP provides a non -invasi ve method of studying cognitive 
processes in both normal and pathological states. Comparing recordings before, during, and 
following cortical array  implantation will allow changes in cognitive activity to be quantified. 
P300 is an ERP elicited by [CONTACT_659954]. The characteristics of the P300 have been  used as 
metrics of cognitive function.  Steady state evoked potentials to periodic stimuli and 
somatosensory evoked potentials can be used to quantify and characterize the strength of sensory 
signals that rea ch the brain for processing. This information is critical for phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_659930], evaluating the somatosensory 
contribution to motor ERPs and intracortical motor unit activity, and d etermining whether 
plasticity changes sensory tract inflow between pre - and post -implant conditions.  
 
Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) evaluate peripheral sensory and 
motor nerve pathway integrity, which can be lost to different de grees by [CONTACT_659955][INVESTIGATOR_1828].  EMG  of the patient’s limbs will be collected pre - and 
post-implant and during decoding/stimulation to quantify and characterize the strength of 
voluntary motor signals that reach limb muscles. This information is critical for phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_659931], evaluating voluntary 
vs. brain -machine interface stimulated motor patterns that can be elicited, and determining 
whether study participation is associated with plasticity changes in motor tract outflow from 
brain through the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) will be collect ed pre and post-
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889842] injury.  
 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  
We are collecting pre -implantation fMRI in order to localize the neural representations of 
movements of the upper limb, wrist, hand, a nd/or fingers. This information will be combined 
with anatomical information, clinical judgment , and intraoperative stimulation and recording to 
select the cortical  implant  placement site.  After explantation surgery, we will be collecting fMRI 
to determine  if training and use of the Neural Bridging System  has resulted in any change in the 
locations of neural representations of movements of the upper limb, wrist, hand, a nd/or fingers. 
In both pre -implantation and post -explantation fMRI sessions, we will ask the participant to 
complete a task with visual and/or auditory stimuli designed to evoke neural representations of 
the movements of interest.  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  
To comple ment the f MRI motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_659932] -surgical 
implant location planning and post -explant evaluation of motor cortex plasticity, we will also 
include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pre -implant and post -explant to map the  hand 
and arm area of the motor cortex. TMS is a non -invasive brain stimulation method that delivers a 
magnetic pulse through the surface of the skull to the motor cortex. This induces a depolarization 
of neurons in the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735], which results i n a twitch of peripheral limb muscles 
innervated by [CONTACT_659956]. This modality is commonly used clinically as an alternative to 
fMRI for pre -surgical motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_659933]. It is used 
experimentally to investigate  corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_659934], e.g., 
after stroke. Potential risks include seizures (2%, mostly among patients who were  previously 
known to have seizures) and headache.  Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_659935]/arm area with MRI -navigated TMS 
in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_659936] 3 purposes: 1) it validates the cortical motor maps 
obtained through fMRI; 2) it distinguishes the sectors of cortical motor maps that are capable of 
controlling voluntary motion through the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_659937]; and 3) it allows for quantification of plasticity, or 
change in sectors of motor maps that are capable of controlling voluntary motion through the 
corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_659938] r explant.  
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 19 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
  
We will perform TMS pre -implant (baseline, phase I) and post -explant (follow -up, phase IV). 
We will deliver navigated TMS based on the patient’s brain MRI scans to stereotactically 
identify and target near the “hand knob” of the primary motor c ortex on the central sulcus. 
Recording EMG electrodes will be placed on the skin surface above the most distal upper limb 
motor groups under voluntary control by [CONTACT_102], as defined by [CONTACT_7416] -implant EMG study, 
as well as the extensor digitorum commun is (EDC) and the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). We 
will find motor threshold, defined as the lowest stimulation intensity that produces a motor 
evoked potential, or EMG twitch response, of [ADDRESS_889843] 50% of trials. We will start at an intensity of about 35% of stimulator output, adjust 
intensity up if needed until we are able to see twitch responses, then use a staircase method to 
adjust intensity up/down to find the motor threshold. The staircase will lower stimulation 
intensity 1 -2% for trials with an EMG peak -to-peak response >500 uV or increase the intensity 
1-2% for trials with EMG responses <100 uV.  
Using the 110% of the MT intensity defined in the previous step, we will determine the spatial 
extent of t he upper limb cortical motor map by [CONTACT_659957] a grid overlaying the central 
sulcus, precentral gyrus, postcentral sulcus and precentral sulcus and reporting locations with 
motor evoked potentials (MEPs).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_889844] data will be reported continuously, including all seriou s and non -serious adverse 
effects, as well as effects related to the surgical procedure and device -related.   
 
Primary a nd Secondary Outcomes  
The primary outcome measure of this study is the achievement of v oluntary movement of the 
upper extremity.  Based on previous neural decoding that has been demonstr ated in humans 
(Bouton  2009) , it is expected that many of the following movements will be recognizable and 
classifiable in the motor cortex and can be achieved physically through the multichannel 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 20 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 stimulator : wrist flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction; forearm pronation/supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810]; 
flexion and extension of fingers.   
The targeted primary and secondary outcomes are therefore as follows:  
• Primary outcome - consistent and repetitive voluntary movement in t he targeted muscle 
groups  
• Secondary outcome - consistent movement in the targeted muscle groups that is functional 
(manipulate or pi[INVESTIGATOR_223642])

The surgical risks for implantation are the same as for any intracranial craniotomy, image guided 
procedures and implantable  device such as a deep brain stimulator or a motor cortex stimulator 
procedure. This includes hemorrhages (intraparenchymal, subdura l or epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116]), 
paralysis, coma and/ or death, stroke, leaking of fluid surrounding the brain, seizures, infection, 
allergic reaction, temporary or permanent neurological complications, confusion or attention 
problems , pain at the surgery sites an d headaches.  
Training and ther apeutic sessions involving BCI regulated functional electrical stimulation will 
need to be monitored for autonomic dysreflexia signs and symptoms.  
As with any muscle stimulator, there can be a risk of excessive current and sk in irritation or 
burns.  The stimulator in the Neural Bridging System , however, limits the average output current 
density to less than 2mA/cm2 at the skin and the average power density to less than 0.25W/cm2 
to provide safe levels and avoid tissue damage. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223643] -in safety limits, current and 
power density could exceed FDA guidelines if electrodes lift off the skin. This has the potential 
to cause causing minor irritation or first degree burns locally. The research investigator will 
monitor frequently during test sessions for wrinkles and misalignment of the sleeve, and any 
signs of electric shock, skin irritation, and/or burns.  
 
The sleeve materia l itself is spandex, with registration marks printed on it. The material itself has 
been formally tested for biocompatibility , both in vitro and in vivo , prior to printing and 
laundering. The printed, laundered sleeve was tested in Battelle ’s IRB -approved Able -bodied 
study for up to 8 hours, with and without  similar nontoxic  conductive lotion. No adver se skin

 reactions were observed . The investigator, who will already be monitoring frequently for signs of 
irritation from electric shock, will also monitor fo r signs of allergic skin reaction.  
 
 
When using virtual reality (VR) systems, there is the risk of feeling nauseous, disoriented or 
dizzy, similar to sensations of motion sickness. About [ADDRESS_889845] 
a risk of seizures, similar to the risk of having a seizure while watching TV. Showing 
incongruent movements on the virtual reality headset may cause confusion  or frustration . The 
researchers will monitor participants closely for signs or symptoms of confusion that may occur.  
 
The study Sponsor -investigator  and co -investigators will be responsible for the evaluation, 
monitoring, and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event 
(AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this clinical in vestigation.  The study 
participants will be evaluated for any possible AEs from the time written study informed consent 
is obtained until study closure or the subject exits the study.   
• Any normal expected postoperative complaints or symptoms, unless the e vent involves a 
clinically significant change in a patient’s severity or duration of symptoms, or that 
requires clinical intervention other than the  ordinary postoperative care. The following 
are some expected postoperative outcomes that may occur:  headache, autonomic 
dysreflexia, incision pain, nausea, vomiting, low grade fever, dizziness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
nervousness, insomnia, constipation, urinary retention, confusion, etc.  
• Any pre -existing condition unless a worsening of that condition in terms of nature, 
severity, or frequency develops.  
• Medical or surgical procedure unrelated to the clinical protocol (i.e., dental or cosmetic 
procedure)  
• Technical observation or a device events that does not result in a medically undesirable 
situation for the subje ct  
 
4.1.1 Safety Endpoints  
The study safety endpoints will include a characterization of all adverse events (AE) for all 
participants , including those related to the implant surgical procedure, the implantable device, 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 22 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 and stimulation of patients with tetr aplegia.  In addition, these safety profile elements will be 
compared across the various phases of the study. Furthermore, patients with clinically significant 
complications related to surgery (hemorrhage, stroke, infection) will not undergo implantation o r 
further participation in the study.  
Participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any point, in addition, the study 
investigators may decide to conclude a patient’s participation in the study for the following 
medical reasons:  
• Onset  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002];  
• Significant  decrement  in neurological  exam;  
• Development  of serious  adverse  events,  physical  or psychological,  including  
negative  behavioral  symptoms,  major  depression,  or suicidal  ideation;  
• Intra - or extra -cranial  infection  unresponsive  to antibiotic  treatment;  
• Serious  infection  around the  percutaneous  connector  unresponsive  to 
antibiotic  treatment;  
• Development  of intracranial  hematoma  requiring  evacuation;  and 
• Need  for urgent  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRl)  of any kind (brain  or body).  
 
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event that is fatal or life -threatening, permanently 
disabling, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in significant disability, congenital 
anomaly, or birth defect  (OSU IRB Policy v 12/19/16) .  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_889846] ( UADE) is defined as  any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused  by, or associated with the  device 
[and/or stimulation therapy ] if that effect, problem, or death  that was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application  (including a 
supplementary plan or application),  or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants  (21 CFR 812.3 (s)). 
Any UADE will result in an evaluation of that effect  as soon as is possible , and will then be 
reported to the IRB within 10 days (OSU IRB policy v 12/19/16) and to the FDA within 10 
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889847] (s). [21 CFR 
812.46(b), 812.150(a)(1), 812.150(b)(1) ] 
 
Device Malfunction  
A device malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or other 
performance as intended.  Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for 
the device.  The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device 
is labeled or marketed (21 CFR 803.3 (k)).  
 
4.1.4 Documentati on of Adverse Events  
All AEs from the time the study informed consent is signed through the time of device 
explantation will be recorded as AEs on the study adverse event log; each event being 
documented separately.  Any adverse event occurring after this  time and is considered related to 
the device or therapy by [CONTACT_54421] I nvestigator will be reported.  AEs and SAEs will be 
followed until:  
• AE is resolved and has returned to normal/baseline or has stabilized  
• Subject has withdrawn from the study  
• AE is judged by [CONTACT_223653]  
• Study closure  at which time, the responsibility for following any ongoing AEs will be 
transferred to the incoming clinical care team.  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_659939].  All non -serious adverse events will be reported to the FDA and to The Ohio State 
University Institutional Review Board (IRB) during the annual reporting period.  
 
Relatedness will be determined for all event s accor ding to the following criteria:  
• Definite ly related : The event is resolved by [CONTACT_659958] .  
• Probabl y related : The event resolves upon discontinuing stimulation and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s current clinical state  or any other cause . 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 24 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 • Possibl y related : The event was likely caused by [CONTACT_423]’s current clinical state, , 
however, the effect o f stimulation cannot be ruled out . 
• Unlikely related:  The event  did not occur temporally to stimulation and can be  explained 
by [CONTACT_423]’s current clinical state or any other cause . 
• Unrelated : The event is explained by [CONTACT_423]’s current clinical state or  any other 
cause . 
 
For purposes of determination of a UADE the following categories will be considered related: 
“definitely related” and “probably related”.  
 
4.1.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs  reported during the protocol defined reporting period per section 4.1.4 will be: 
• Evaluated for their relatedness per section 4.1.4 ; 
• Reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee ;  
• Included in the IRB Continuing Review ; and  
• Included in the FDA Annual Rep ort. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_889848] a great deal of expertise with the management of 
tetraplegic patients and with craniotomies. The surgical team has over 1 6 years of experience 
with deep brain stimulation  implants with over 1600 DBS implants for various indications. The 
study inclusion/exclusion criteria have been developed to select those who would most likely 
benefit from this study as well as excluding those with higher risks. Study participants will be  
monitored after surgical implantation in neurosurgical and physiological monitoring units with 
personnel experienced in the care of complex neurosurgical participants and monitoring 
neurological status . In the case of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] (CSF) leakage or pain, patients will be managed 
per the standard clinical practice. In case of infection that is not responsive to antibiotic treatment  
or allergic reaction to the implanted device, the device will be explanted.   
 
Upon completion of the study, participants will have the entire cortical implant system surgically 
removed . The procedure for removing the device is similar to those of the implant procedure. 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 25 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
 Risks for removal are similar to insertion: infection, bleeding,  need for further surgery, and 
seizures.  
 
Post-surgical removal the participants will be asked to come for post -surgery follow up 
appointments to remove stitches/ sutures and wound caring.  
 
Risks are minimized in all of the non -surgical procedures includin g blood drawing and the 
neuroimaging procedures by [CONTACT_659959].  
 
Participants may also terminate from the study if they wish at any time. Study participants may 
also wish to discontinue partic ipation for any reason. Cortical implant systems will also be 
removed if the participant/representative asks for removal. Participants  who prematurely 
withdraw from the study due to an adverse event will be followed (e.g. telephone contact, and/or 
follow -up visits, etc.) until resolution of the event. In addition, a designated investigator will 
have access to treatment status at all times and provide that information to appropriate medical 
personnel in the event of medical emergencies. Risks to confidential ity are negligible in this 
protocol, since participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], or by [CONTACT_659960], in any 
summary reports or publications. CRFs will be maintained in locked files and password -
protected databases behind the Ohio State Universi ty Wexner Medical Center firewall. Data and 
safety monitoring activities for this study will continue until all participants  have completed their 
participation in the study.

system. The sleeve provides a less operator -dependent, more convenient application and removal 
of the electrode cuff. The electrodes and circuitry ar e otherwise identical to the cuff.  
 
This reanimation study offers a unique opportunity to study the neural mechanisms of motor 
awareness, such as sense of agency or movement intentions. Agency is the sense that we control 
the actions of our own body (Gall agher, 2000; Jeannerod, 2003) and is a fundamental aspect of 
the experience of self. In this study, normal efferent and afferent sensorimotor information is 
replaced by [CONTACT_659952], respectively. Congruent and 
incongruent vis ual feedback presented via virtual reality may provide important information 
about the  fundamental  mechanisms of self -awareness.  This is clinically relevant to developi[INVESTIGATOR_659940]’ body 
image. In addition, we will study whether using virtual reality (VR) can provide a more efficient 
way to train motor cortex neural decoders.  
 
 
4.5 Device Description  
The Neural Bridging System  (as shown in Figure 2) is comprised of a Blackrock Microsystems 
Neuroport device , a personal computer  (PC)  which runs the re -coding algorithm, and a non-
invasive Neuromuscular Stimulator.  The Neuromuscular Stimulator has been revie wed and 
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889852] been demonstrated (Bouton and Annetta 2012).   
 
The Neuromuscular Stimulator , designed by [CONTACT_659961],  is a non -significant risk 
investigational device;  however it is included in this submission  for completeness  (since the two 
devices will be used together  in the study ).  In addition, note the Neural Bridging System will be 
used in support of an IDE study to demonstrate proof -of-concept in a clinical environment. As 
such, the results from this IDE study will be used to determine feasibility of the product concept 
and will not be used to support a regulatory clearance or approval submission.    
 
4.5.1 Clinical Safety  
Safety risk management for the Battelle BCI -NMES (updated and inclusive of VR device) was 
performed in accordance with Battelle Process and Product Development SOP 65, Safety Risk 
Management Procedure, which complies with the requirements of ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2007 , Medical 
devices – Application of risk management to medical devices.   A safety risk management plan 
was put in place, and potential hazards associated with the use of the device were identified.   The 
risks of the identified hazards were evaluated against the risk acceptability criteria documented 
in the plan, and controls identified for risks that exceeded the acceptability thresholds . The 
identified risk controls were incorporated into the product design or clinical trial pr otocol, as 
appropriate.  A summary of the analysis is included below.  
Hazard Analysis Summary  (Without VR Device)

 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889858] Analysis Summary (With VR Device) : 
An analysis was conducted by [CONTACT_659965]-NMES (D8208 -051). The risks of a dding the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to the NBS 
may increase the risk of electrical shock, however, due to  the design of the NBS, the risk is not 
perceived to be significantly increased over wearing the headset  without the NBS.

 Figure 4. Block diagram of the virtual reality headset used with the Neural Briding System  
 
Risks Associated with the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Device Alone:  
• Seizures (1 in 4000 people)  
• Electrical shock  
• Repetitive stress injury such as muscle, joint, or skin pain  
• Eye discomfort, e ye muscle twitching, visual problems  
• Dizziness  
• Skin irritation  
 
Risks associated with VR use will be mitigated by [CONTACT_659966], exclusion of patients 
with history of seizure or pacemaker, electrical isolation from the Neural Bridging System, and 
periodic device monitoring by [CONTACT_659967]. The VR device has 

 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889859] flexion will be provided  (after a short delay) . 
 
The Neuroport device will continuously monitor neural activity, passing the data to the re -coding 
algorithms running in Matlab (Natick, MA) on the PC.  These algorithms will first decode the 
neural data ( as was done  in the BrainGate study) , and then  will provide  the spatial and temporal 
stimulation patterns required to the subject  to achieve the imagined movement . The spatial and 
temporal stimula tion patterns for each subject will be different due to differences in anatomy, but 
will be determined during a ‘calibration’ session to map the various electrodes to the desired 
movements.  
 
Once the neural activity resulting from an imagined movement is r ecognized and re -coded to 
determine the appropriate stimulation patterns, the stimulation pattern commands are sent to the 
Neuromuscular Stimulator via a USB connection (that is electrically isolated).  The 
Neuromuscular Stimulator will then activate the a ppropriate electrodes in the  NMES to evoke 
the desired movement.  Furthermore, t he Blackrock Neuroport device  is electrically isolated from 
mains power to the patient.  In addition, the Neuromuscular Stimulator is electrically isolated 
from mains power and earth ground and is compliant with the applicable patient and touch 
leakage currents in accordance with IEC6 0601 -1:2005.  Therefore, the two Neural Bridging 
subsystems that are in contact [CONTACT_659968].   
 
4.5.3 Stimulation Parameters  
The stimulation parameters of the Neuromuscular Stimulator are as follows :  
 
 Maximum peak current is 20mA  with a maximum pulse width of 0.5ms . 
 Version: 7/16/2019  
Page 34 of 41 Reanimation_Tetraplegia_Protocol_  
  
 Maximum pulse frequency is 50 pulses per second.  
 
 Nominal output voltage is 2 00V ± 10%  with maximum output of 300V . 
 
 Maximum average current density  is 2 mA/cm2 at the NMES    
 electrode surface.  
 
 Maximum average power density is 0.25 W/cm2 at the NMES   
electrode surface.

 6. Device Sales Information  
This study is an investigator/sponsor initiated  study utilizing commercially available devices for 
an unapproved indication.  Study participants will not be charged for the device during the study, 
 Version: 7/16/[ADDRESS_889868] of this study does not 
involve  the sale or commercialization of the therapeutic use of the devices.  
 
7. Device Labeling  
Caution: Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_659971].  
Blackrock Microsystems Neuroport device is  a commercially available device  being  used outside 
its FDA -approved indications for use  (it is being used greater than 30 days) . The array used in 
the Neuroport  system has been successfully used in study participants well beyond 30 days , as 
for example, 1000 days in the Braingate study (Simeral  et al, 2011) . This investigational system 
in conjunction with the Battelle Neuromuscular Stimulator or its package will be labeled with the 
following information: the name [CONTACT_29773], packer, or distributor 
(in accordance with 801.1), the quantity of contents, if appropriate, and the following statement: 
"CAUTION --Investigational device. Limit ed by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to 
investigational use."   In addition, the  label will describe all relevant contraindications, hazards, 
adverse effects, interfering substances or devices, warnings, and precautions.  The labeling of the 
device will not represent that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being 
investigated.  
 
These  devices will be treated as investigational -use devices since they are being used outside of 
approved indications and labeling.  Information on each d evice used in the study will be 
documented, and device accountability for each device used will be maintained. Only approved 
investigators will implant devices in participants participating in this study.  
 
8. Device Location  
The study is based at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.  The Neuromuscular 
Stimulation device is external and will be taken off study participants after each session.

 INTRODUCTION  
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an increasingly common disorder characterized by a pathological increase in upper airway resistance experienced during sleep that ranges from benign snoring to its most severe form of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized 
by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_128949] a result of 
intermittent periods of hypoxemia, and arousals. Studies have demonstrated that OSA leads to 
profound sleep fragmentation, disturbance of the autonomic nervous system, insulin resistance, 
increased systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and subsequent vascular endothelial dysfunction. These physiologic  changes cause significant morbidity; OSA is an independent risk 
factor for wide ranging adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction), metabolic disorders (insulin insensitivity, diabetes), 
neurolog ical (dementia), motor vehicle accidents, and mood disorders.
1-5  
 
The ANNETM Sleep system has been validated as a diagnostic aid for moderate to severe OSA 
in a multi -center, open- label clinical study with n=225 subjects. Subjects wore PSG and ANNE 
Sleep concurrently for one supervised night at a sleep center. Both PSG and ANNE Sleep data 
were manually scored by 3 blinded registered polysomnography technicians. If AHI values determined by [CONTACT_941] 3 scorers exhibited great than 15% variation, a board- certified Sleep 
Medicine physician reviewed the raw data independently per AASM guidelines to account for 
interscorer variability. The results of the study indicate that ANNE Sleep is sufficiently accurate 
as an aid to diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA with sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 
98% respectively.

5.2 RECRUITMENT METHODS  
 
Identifying potential participants will be through the Electronic Data  Warehouse (EDW) and 
through the use of study flyers and recruitment materials. The EDW at Northwestern is updated 
daily. An algorithm can be set up based on the eligibility criteria of the trial to identify potential 
participants that have met enrollment criteria. Data gathered in the EDW request will include 
Name, contact [CONTACT_3031] (address, email and/or phone), Date of Birth, MRN, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128956](s), and if applicable, date that a HST or PS GG is ordered. The EDW request may exclude 
people based on the exclusion criteria. The use of the EDW will be used exclusively for 
recruitment purposes and no data from the warehouse will be added to the study data set for 
research analysis. The use of study  flyers or advertisements will also be shared with potential 
study subjects who will be given contact [CONTACT_128982].  
 
6. STUDY INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE:  
ANNE™ Sleep system  
Sibel’s ANNE™ Sleep system includes two skin- mounted, bio-integrated sensors to record vital 
signs, a wireless charger, a wireless charger adaptor, single- use chest adhesives , single -use 
finger adhesives, and a mobile device with a mobile  software application that enables  data 
recording for  download for further analysis.  
 
Heart rate (HR), snore, chest movement, and body position are recorded from the ANNE™ Chest 
sensor.  Blood oxygenation (SpO 2), peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), and pulse rate  are 
recorded from the ANNE™ Limb sensor. PAT is indicative of vasoconstriction, which can serve 
as a proxy for respi[INVESTIGATOR_128957] a component of home sleep testing.   
 
The first sensor (chest unit) located on the chest contains a 3 -axis gyroscope and 3- axis 
accelerometer, Bluetooth Low Energy System -on-Chip (SoC), a Lithium -Polymer battery, power 
management component, an analog front- end component, passive electrodes for 
electrocardiogram (ECG) . 
 The second sensor (limb unit) located on the finger of a patient contains Bluetooth Low Energy SoC, a Lithium -Polymer battery, power management solution, low -power microcontroller, an 
analog front -end component, pulse oximeter (SpO2) . 
 The chest sensor is placed on the body via a single -use ches t adhesive. Both adhesives  will be 
removed and discarded after one use. The limb sensor is held in place by a single- use finger 
adhesive, which is removed and discarded after one use, then replaced with a new  finger 
adhesive.

9. SCORING  
 
9.1 ANNETM Sleep Scoring 
The data from ANNETM will be reviewed and scored for respi[INVESTIGATOR_128960] (3 ) 
registered polysomnography technicians (RPSGT) who are blinded to the scoring of the HST, 
and represent scorers in clinical practice in AASM accredited sleep disorder centers. An 
average will be taken of the three scores. In order to minimize interscorer variability, the 
technicians will have >85% concordance . To ensure quality and reproducibility, a board certified 
sleep medicine physician who is blinded to the experimental condition will review all raw HST 
data. If AHI determined from ANNETM Sleep exhibits greater than 15 % difference between three 
RPSGTs, a board- certified sleep medicine physician will provide the final determination of the 
AHI for ANNE Sleep . 
 
Scoring of ANNETM Sleep data will follow guidelines established by [CONTACT_128988] (v2.6)6. Sleep scoring 
includes the following variables: total sleep time (T ST= the total amount of sleep time scored 
during the total recording time in minutes). The scoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_128961].  
 
T
he ANNETM Sleep will be scored similarly with the system’s onboard sensors as an alternative 
hypopnea and apnea sensor via PAT. The definition of mild, moderate, or severe obstructive 
sleep apnea is based on AHI.  
 AHI < 5: Normal  
 AHI ≥ 5 – <15: Mild  
 AHI ≥15 – <30: Moderate  
 A HI ≥ 30: Severe  
 
The AHI calculated from ANNETM Sleep will be considered an estimation of AHI, coined as AHI.  
 
An apnea event is defined as:

HRP -593 / v03162021  
  A drop in peak signal excursion by ≥ 90% of pre -event baseline for ≥ 10 seconds using an 
oronasal thermal signal, PAP device flow, or an alternative apnea sensor.  
 No requirement for a desaturation or an arousal  
 
Hypopnea will be defined by:  
 The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre- event baseline using nasal pressure 
(diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative hypopnea sensor 
(diagnostic study)  
 The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds  
 There is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre- event baseline and/or the event is 
associated with an arousal  
 
The scoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_128962]. Apnea- hypopnea index will be used to determine the presence and 
severity of sleep apnea (AHI= apneas + hypopneas *60/TRT).  
 
The accuracy (sum of the number of  t rue positives and true negatives divided by [CONTACT_128989], true negatives, false positives, and false negatives ), sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive val ue of the ANNE ™ Sleep to detect 
moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea will be compared to outputs from WatchPAT ONE . 
A Bland -Altman plot will be gerenated with 95% confidence to intervals to assess agreement.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_145566] 30, the large amount of within- person data provides high 
statistical power for all planned analyses, allowing this data set to answer all proposed questions while minimizing study costs and any risk to patients.  
 
 
10.2 Apnea- hypopnea index (AHI)  and oxygen desaturation index (ODI)  
 
1. AHI will be calculated in ranges of  15 – 30 apnea/hypopnea events per hour for moderate 
OSA and ≥30 apnea/hypopnea events per hour for severe OSA.  Continuous variables of 
AHIs during threefour -night study will be summarized using tables of descriptive 
statistics.  The AHIs with variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_637].   
2. D iagnostic outcomes will be tabulated and compared for ANNE Sleep vs WatchPAT ONE.  
3. Patient preference will be elicited via psychometric surveys for comfort and usability comparing ANNE and WatchPAT ONE.

 4. The oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the hourly average number of desaturation 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], will also be calculated.  
 
10.3  Exploratory measurements for research purposes 
 Additional statistical analyses will be performed to compare outputs of AHI between the 
different systems. Specifically, these analyses include:
 
 
 
1. Linear regression to establish correlation between AHI determined by [CONTACT_128990].   Bland- Altman plots will be created to establish bias 
and 95% confidence intervals of agreement between AHI determined by [CONTACT_128991].  
2. Summary statistics of the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the classification of the severity of OSA (normal, mild, moderate,  and severe OSA) determined by [CONTACT_128992].  
3. Accuracy analysis between AHI determined by [CONTACT_128993].  
4. Descriptive analysis of patients’ characteristics and assessments (e.g. sleep diary) before and after study procedures. Patient characteristics include age, gender, ethnicity, race, 
height, weight, baseline vital signs, relevant medical and surgical co -morbidities will be 
abstracted from the medical record or by [CONTACT_128994].  
5. The listings, specifically adverse events and major protocol deviations, will be ordered by [CONTACT_1130].  
      
11. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESE ARCH ACTIVITIES

3.1 Data Flow Overview  
The high -level data flow is shown below (Figure 4). After the patient has received the ANNE 
Sleep system and successfully finished their sleep night data collection, the data is downloaded from the sensors and automatically uploaded to the ANNE Sleep Hub. In the ANNE Sleep Hub, the data collected from the ANNE sensors are processed and converted into an EDF format file 
so that it can be consumed by [CONTACT_129001]. After the dataset has been scored, the scored data is transferred back to the ANNE  Sleep Hub for sleep 
report generation. The report generated can then be reviewed by a Healthcare Professional (HCP) to aid in the evaluation of sleep- related breathing disorders.

3.2 Detecting Sleep Disordered Breathing Events with ANNE Sleep System  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (Apnea epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) are caused either by [CONTACT_129006]’t send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. During the apnea epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], sympathetic 
activation causes vasoconstriction and acceleration of the heart rate. This results in attenuation 
of the PAT signals. PAT amplitude may vary due to reasons other than apnea events such as 
periodic lim b movements or spontaneous arousals. This section described the steps necessary 
to differentiate the true respi[INVESTIGATOR_128977].

HRP -593 / v03162021  
  
 
When scoring for sleep -disordered breathing (SDB) events, the first step is to see if the area 
that is being analyzed has (1) motion artifact or (2) body position change. If there are any of the 
two signals, do not  continue on to see if it is an SDB event.   
Next, look at the Accel Vertical and Accel Horizontal signal for chest movement reduction. If 
the amplitude of both signals drops by 90% or more for more than 10 seconds, it is categorized 
as an SDB event. If one or both signals does not look as below, move to analyze the attenuation 
of the PAT signal. Label the event as an SDB regardless of the limb sensor output.  
 
 
Figure 15: Chest Movement Reduction Example  
 
If there are motion artifacts in between the chest movement reduction, do not grade the signal 
as SDB. An example of it is shown below. This is usually created as part of changing the body position and should be disregarded.

Figure 16: Motion Artifact example  
After analyzing the two accelerometer signals and concluding that there is no chest movement 
reduction,   proceed to analyze attenuation of the PAT signal, heart rate increase, and SpO2 
drop. PAT attenuation can be easily identified by [CONTACT_129007]. Also, 
heart rate should increase by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_145578] 3% within [ADDRESS_145579] has no snoring but there is snoring before that point, label the event as SDB.

 3.3.[ADDRESS_145580] Example  
The following is an example of a snapshot that contains large movements. Any events under or 
between big motion artifacts should not be labeled as SDB. Continuous motion artifacts often 
relate to the patient being awake or switching body position. With large motion affecting signal 
quality, the associating vital signs may be invalid.

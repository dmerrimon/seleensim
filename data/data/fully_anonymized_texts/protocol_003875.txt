  1.0 Objectives  
Adolescent depression is a prevalent and debilitating disorder that places youth at risk for suicidality, other psychiatric diagnoses, and functional impairment both during adolescence and into adulthood. There are a number of effective treatments; however , 30-50% of adolescents who receive these treatments do not 
respond. To improve response rates, practice parameters recommend routine systematic symptom assessment over the course of treatment to inform decisions regarding whether to switch or augment trea tment. Unfortunately, routine 
symptom assessment in usual care for adolescent depression is extremely rare. In addition, for psychotherapy, which is the most frequent treatment for adolescent depression, there are currently no guidelines to direct therapis ts regarding how to 
use those symptom assessments to guide subsequent treatment decisions. Addressing this critical knowledge gap requires identifying (1) what symptoms or patient characteristics to assess, (2) when to administer those assessments, and (3)  
what subsequent treatment to provide, based on those assessments. Adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) provide algorithms for guiding treatment decision making. These algorithms are based on patient characteristics and outcomes collected during the course  of therapy, and they provide guidelines regarding 
when, how, and for whom midcourse changes in the treatment approach should be initiated. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two ATSs  for adolescent depression. The ATSs include delivery of an evidence -based 
psychotherapy for adolescent depression (interpersonal psychotherapy, IPT -A), 
systematic symptom monitoring, and an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -derived algorithm that 
specifies whether, when, and how to augment IPT -A. Two hundred depres sed 
adolescents (age 12 -18) will be recruited to participate in a 16 -week sequential 
multiple assignment randomized trial ( SMART ) conducted in outpatient  
community mental health clinic s (PrairieCare Medical Group  and Minnesota 
Mental Health Clinics) . Adolescents will be randomized to the IPT -A ATS 
condition (N=134) or the community clinic’s usual care (UC) (N=66). The aims of this  study are to:  
• Evaluate the effectiveness of the ATSs as compared to UC.  
• Evaluate ado lescents’ interpersonal functioning as a treatment target of IPT -A 
• Evaluate moderators of initial treatment and treatment augmentation 
strategies.  
• Conduct a n implementation -focused process evaluation to identify barriers 
and facilitators that influenced AT S implementation.  
• Examine genetic variants , gene expression, and DNA methylation signatures 
in relationship to treatment response and symptoms

  The Public Health Problem of Adolescent Depression:    
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in adolescents,1 with 
approximately 20% of adolescents experiencing a depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_666148].

adulthood. 8,9 Accordingly, the development of effective strategies for treating 
adolescent depression has significant implications for health and well -being both 
during adolescence and into adulthood.  
  
Improving Outcomes and Clinical Practice by [CONTACT_666240][INVESTIGATOR_666149] T reatment 
Strategies : 
There are now a number of evidence -based treatments for adolescent depression 
including psychotherapy, antidepressant medication, and their combination.[ADDRESS_899672] “well -established” empi[INVESTIGATOR_666150]: interpersonal 
psychotherapy (IPT -A) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[ADDRESS_899673] demonstrated efficacy,12-16 and fluoxetine 
and escitalopram (both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs) have approval by [CONTACT_666241]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_666151], approximately 30- 50% of adolescents who 
receive th ese treatments do not respond.
17,[ADDRESS_899674] shown that routine assessment improves treatment outcomes 
compared to no assessment conditions.20-26 Importantly, progress monitoring can 
be easily implemented in community practice by [CONTACT_666242]’ 
electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs can be programmed to alert clinicians to administer an assessment at a specified time point, the assessment data can be entered directly into the EMR, and the EMR can be programmed with the algorithms that guide subsequent treatment recommendations. This creates a user -
friendly data -based decision suppor t system that provides feedback on treatment 
progress and guides treatment planning.
27 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_666152], routine symptom assessment in usual care for adolescent depression is extremely rare.
28 A recent review of EMRs from 3 
large health care systems found that only 32% of depressed adolescents had 
documentation of symptom monitoring following the initial intake.[ADDRESS_899675] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666153]. As a consequence, if clinicians do decide to switch or augment treatment, they may do 
PROTOCOL TITLE: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for 
Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899676] or other burdens.  
 Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a guideline to inform treatment planning requires evaluating (1) what 
symptoms or patient characteristics to assess, (2) when to administer those 
assessments, and (3) what subsequent treatment to provide, based on those assessments. Adaptive treatment strategies  (ATSs) provide algorithms for guiding 
treatment decision making. These algorithms  are based on patient characteristics 
and outcomes collected during the treatment process, and they provide guidelines 
regarding when, how, and for whom midcourse changes in the treatment approach 
should be initiated. They can, for example, operationalize when to determine that a patient is not likely to respond if a treatment strategy is continued, what the next treatment should be, and at what dose or intensity. The development of evidence -
based ATSs for adolescent depression not only has the potential to significantly 
improve treatment outcomes, but can also increase the efficiency and cost 
effectiveness of treatment by [CONTACT_666243].  
 
ATSs are developed and evaluated within the context of sequential m ultiple 
assignment randomized trials (SMARTs).
29-[ADDRESS_899677] restrictive among available empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -based 
treatments.
32 “Least restrictive” refers to all restrictions on the patient’s life and 
resources, including cost, physical effects of the treatment, and interference in the patient’s lifestyle. Treatments that are more restrictive (but potentially more effective) are reserved for patients who do not respond to the initi al treatment. In 
this way, a stepped- care approach aims to achieve a positive treatment outcome 
with as little treatment as possible, which maximizes clinical benefits, minimizes burdens, and leads to more efficient and cost effective service delivery. Ste pped-
care models have demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness in improving a variety of outcomes,
33-35 including youth depression.36  
 
Stage 1 Treatment:  
We propose two ATSs that begin with psychotherapy. Psychotherapy does not 
carry a risk of adverse physical side effects, it i s the most frequent treatment for 
adolescent depression,28 and many families report a preference for psychotherapy 
over medication.37-39 The psychotherapy provided will be interpers onal 
psychotherapy for depressed adolescents (IPT -A).40 IPT-A aims to address a key 
mechanism in the development and resolution of adolescent depression:

the Systems for Social Processes in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) 
matrix).41-[ADDRESS_899678] 
closely relat ed to the onset or maintenance of the adolescent’s depression. IPT- A 
has strong empi[INVESTIGATOR_666154]-world settings.
17,44,[ADDRESS_899679] Press, 
and online training in IPT- A is also recently available via the Society of Clinical 
Child & Adolescent Psychology website ( www.effectivechildtherapy.com ), thus 
significantly increasing the feasibility of uptake of this intervention in community settings.  
 The Adaptive Treatment Algorithm: Using data from a previous clinical trial of IPT -A, we examined whether there 
were early indicators of IPT -A treatment response that could be used to guide 
decisions regarding whether and when to intensify or augment treatment. We found that depressed adolescents who begin treatment with IPT- A can be 
classified as likely or not likely to respond to a full course of IPT-A (12 sessions delivered over 16 weeks) at week 4 and at week 8 of treatment (Preliminary Study 1).
49 At week 4, a cutoff of a 20% reduction in symptoms on the Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression (HRSD)[ADDRESS_899680]- treatment (week 16). At week 8, a 
40% reduction in symptoms was required to predict week 16 response. The HRSD has demonstrated feasibility and reliability in community settings.
50 It 
provides standardized feedback to clinicians and decreases idiosyncrasies that occur when clinicians make treatment decisions without use of a standardized measure.  
 Stage 2 Treatments : 
For insufficient responders to IPT-A, we propose to test two approaches to intensifying treatment during stage 2: the addition of an SSRI and more intensive IPT-A (delivered twice per week). Five studies have examined the efficacy of a 
combination of psychotherapy and medication in comparison to psychotherapy alone and/or medication alone.
18,51-[ADDRESS_899681] also found that psychotherapy delivered on a twice a week basis is

Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899682] insurance panels will 
permit billing for twice per week sessions. Given many families’ preference for 
psychotherapy over medication,37-39 intensifying the therapy rather than adding an 
SSRI may yield more promising results because it is a more patient- centered 
treatment approach for some families. Attending therapy twice per week does add additional burden to families; however, it is time limited (4 weeks), and in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Preliminary Study 2), we developed some strategies for increasing motivation and problem-solving obstacles, which resulted in good session attendance.  To summarize, there are two ATSs embedded in our trial design:  
 
ATS 1 :  Psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_666155] -A.
17,40,[ADDRESS_899683] a 20% reduction in depressive symptoms, continue IPT- A. If at 
week 8, the adolescent has shown at least a 40% reduction in symptoms, continue IPT-A (12 sessions total). If the adolescent has not shown a sufficient reduction at 
week [ADDRESS_899684] to add an SSRI and continue weekly IPT- A sessions (12 sessions total).  
 ATS 2 :  Psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_666155] -A.
17,40,[ADDRESS_899685] a 20% reduction in depressive symptoms, continue IPT- A. If at 
week 8, the adolescent has shown at least a 40% reduction in symptoms, continue IPT-A (12 sessions total). If the adolescent has not shown a sufficient reduction at 
week 4 or week 8, increase dose of IPT -A by [CONTACT_666244] a week for 
4 weeks; then return to weekly IPT- A (16 sessions to tal). 
 Further Refinement of the ATSs, Including Evaluation of Treatment Target Engagement: In this study, we are hypothesizing that our adaptive treatment algorithm, based on change in depression at weeks [ADDRESS_899686] that incorporating assessment of other patient characteristics, in addition to depressive symptoms, into the decision of whether and how to change treatment will likely increase the response rates further. NIMH’s new focus on experimental therapeutics is highly relevant here.

whose purported mechanism of action is improvements in interpersonal relationships, we can examine degree of improvement in adolescents’ interpersonal relationships during stage 1 (i.e. degree of target engagement) , as a 
PROTOCOL TITLE: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for 
Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899689], we can evaluate, among the insufficient responders who did not demonstrate target engagement, the comparative effectiveness of intensifying psychotherapeutic work on interpersonal skills to attempt to better engage the treatment target versus adding a different treatment approach (SS RI) that will address a different treatment target. The advantage of 
the SMART design is that stage 2 treatment assignment is not confounded with the tailoring variable (due to randomization), making inference on the effect of tailoring treatment less pron e to bias.  
 In addition to measures of IPT- A target engagement, we will also explore 
additional moderators of stage 2 treatments for insufficient responders to further refine the ATSs. The moderators selected represent previously identified predictors of IPT-A specifically or treatment for depression generally, and 
include: patient treatment preference,
62,63  expectation of treatment outcome,64 
sociotropy (a personality trait representing the deg ree to which one’s self -concept 
and well -being are dependent on the how things are going in one’s 
relationships),65 depression severity,17 comorbid diagnoses,66 and stage 1 
treatment attendance.67  
 
Genetic and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666156]:  
The causality of mood disorders is complex and involves the interplay between genetic predisposition and non-genetic biological, psychological, and social factors. Studies have shown that mood disorders such as major depressive disorder are highly heritable, with genetic factors contributing 31- 42% of disease 
risk.
[ADDRESS_899690] also focused on identifying pharmacogenetic predictors of drug response which would aid in therapeutic and dosing selection currently performed in ‘trial and error’ approaches. Earlier studies utilizing a hypothesis-driven, candidate gene study design to assess the relationship between genetics and SSRI treatment response in patients with depression focused on genes of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, monoaminergic, neurotrophic and hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis systems: COMT ,
69,[ADDRESS_899691] also investigated multiple pharmacokinetic markers, namely three cytochrome P450 (CYP) hepatic enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, involved in SSRI metabolism. Previous studies have shown that genetic differences in CYP2C19 and CYP2D6  have been associated with differing serum 
concentrations of SSRIs such as escitalopram as well as treatment response.

Implementation : 
The primary aim of this study is to validate the algorithm that is the basis of the adaptive treatment strategies proposed in this project. We have designed the ATSs to maximize the potential for implementation in community practice by 1) using an intervention that is easily accessible to professionals, 2) basing our treatment algorithms on an as sessment measure that is free and available for public use, and 
3) automating the treatment algorithm in a user -friendly web-based program. In 
addition, we propose to integrate some components of implementation research into our effectiveness study to inform and facilitate future dissemination and implementation of these ATSs into broad clinical practice. Following Curran et al,
94 we will follow a hybrid type I effectiveness- implementation design that tests 
the effects of the ATSs on clinical outcomes, while also observing and gathering information on implementation. Hybrid type I studies focus on process evaluations of barriers and facilitators to uptake/adoption efforts, and on identifying tools and training that would facilitate future implementation. Information is collecte d not only from patients and providers, but also from 
clinical and organizational leaders who would be responsible for rolling out the clinical intervention. Our process evaluation is informed primarily by [CONTACT_39505]-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adopti on, Implementation and 
Maintenance).
95,96 Reach refers to how many eligible patients agree to the 
intervention. Effectiveness evaluates the intervention’s clinical outcomes. Adoption refers to the decision of the leadership and staff at the targeted settings to implement the intervention. Implementation refers to whether the intervention is implemented with high fidelity and consistency, as well as the cost of the intervention. Maintenance (not assessed in this study) refers to whether the clinical intervention is sustained after implementation support is withdrawn. We also include two elements from the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework: (1) Evidence: the extent to which providers and staff believe there is research evidence, as well as a clinical need for the new intervention, and (2) Context: provider and staff perception of the organization’s leadership culture, staff culture, leadership feedback, readiness to change, and resources to support to new intervention. The results of the process evaluation will be used to inform future implementation efforts.

  or “not likely to respond” by [CONTACT_5638] a 16- week cou rse of IPT -A. [ADDRESS_899696] of IPT-A versus treatment as usual in school-
based health clinics were randomized to receive 12 sessions of IPT- A delivered 
over 16 weeks.17 The HRSD99 was administered by [CONTACT_666245] 4, 
8, 12, and 16. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified week [ADDRESS_899697]- treatment (week 16) 
response (week 4: AUC=.78, p=.01; week 8: AUC=.81, p=.00). At week 4, a cutoff of 20% reduction in HRSD from baseline represented the best combined sensitivity (72.7%) and specificity (71.4%) for predicting post- treatment response. 
At week 8, a cutoff of 40% reduction in HRSD from baseline represented the best combined sensitivity (72.7%) and specificity (83.3%).   
2. A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_666161] 4 ATSs Beginning with IPT-A (Gunlicks- Stoessel et al., 
2016).
38 These data support the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy 
of the two proposed ATSs. Forty adolescents with a depression diagnosis enrolled in a 16-week SMART, with an initial treatment plan of 12 sessions of IPT- A. 
Adolescents were randomized to a week 4 or a week 8 decision point for identifying potential non- responders.  Adolescents who were classified as 
sufficient responders (> 20% reduction in HRSD
99 at week 4 or > 40% reduction 
in HRSD at week 8) continued the initial treatment plan of 12 IPT- A sessions. 
Adolescents who were classified as insu fficient responders were randomized a 
second time to the addition of fluoxetine (FLX) or an additional 4 IPT- A sessions 
scheduled twice a week (increase from 12 to 16 sessions). The SMART study procedures and ATSs were feasible and acceptable to families and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].

adherence = 3.30 on scale of 1 to 4).  
 
c. ATS Acceptability. Adolescents’ and parents’ treatment satisfaction (CSQ -8) was 
high (adolescents: M = 27.2, SD = 3.9; pare nts: M = 27.0, SD = 4.0).   
 
d. Parents’ and Adolescents’ Attitudes Regarding Medication and More Intensive 
Therapy.  These data support (1) parents’ preferences for a stepped -care model of 
treatment that begins with therapy only, and (2) parents’ preference for 
augmenting treatment for insufficient responders by [CONTACT_666246] -A.  
Prior to treatment, adolescents and parents reported their attitudes regarding the 
possible type of change to the treatment plan for insufficient responders. They 
also r eported their attitudes right after they were informed of the change to 
treatment and at week 16. Prior to treatment, many parents reported negative 
attitudes regarding adding medication (37% neg, 33% neu, 30% pos) and were more positive about the possibil ity of increasing the dose of IPT -A (70% pos, 
22% neu, 7% neg). Among parents of insufficient responders who were 
randomized to add medication, most parents reported feeling negative about 
adding medication right after they were informed of the change (60%  neg, 20% 
neu, 20% pos). By [CONTACT_447] -treatment, 50% felt positive, 25% felt negative, and 25% 
felt neutral. All parents of adolescents randomized to increased IPT -A felt 
positively about the change both right after they were informed of the change and 
post-treatment. Most adolescents reported feeling positive about both treatment 
augmentation strategies at both pre -treatment (add meds: 46% pos, 31% neu, 23% 
neg; increase IPT -A: 54% pos, 23% neu, 23% neg) and post -treatment (add meds: 
71% pos, 14% neu, 14% neg; increase IPT -A: 80% pos, 20% neu, 0% neg).  
 
e. Treatment Outcomes. It  was better to begin assessing for insufficient response and

depressed adolescents participated in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_666165]. Treatment involved 24 hour s of CBT 
skills training for youth and 12 hours of CBT information/support for parents 
delivered in groups over six weeks. Out of 24 days delivered over six weeks, 
adolescents attended at high rates (mean 18.7 days or 78%; median 20 days or 
83%) with a majority of parents attending the information parent groups. Fidelity 
indicators of program delivery derived from intermittent live research technician observations showed acceptable to high levels of fidelity (teen skills: adherence 82%, quality of delivery 85%; parent skills: adherence 70%, quality 98%). Adolescents demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms  (pre-treatment BASC -2:

Description:  
Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT -A).40 IPT-A is an  
evidence -based intervention that aims  to decrease depressive symptoms by 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_666166]. It 
addresses  one or more of four interpersonal problem areas: grief, role disputes, 
role transitions, and interpersonal deficits. The primary treatment techniques in IPT-A include emotion identification/expression, linking interpersonal events to 
mood, communication analysis, communication skill building, decision analysis, role playing, and assignment of interpersonal experiments (i.e. homework). In 
clinical trials, depressed adolescents treated with IPT -A demonstr ated fewer 
depressive symptoms and better psychosocial functioning post- treatment than 
adolescents in control conditions.

Study Design:  
Two hundred adolescents who present for treatment for depression at community 
mental health clinics (PrairieCare and Minnesota Mental Health Clinics) will be recruited to participate in a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART ; see Figure 1) . Subjects will be initially randomized using a 2:[ADDRESS_899704] who are 
insufficient responders at week 4 or 8 will be re-randomized using a 1:[ADDRESS_899705] r andomization

compliant web application (Research Electronic Data Capture; REDCap). 
REDCap will be programmed to calculate the percent change in HRSD from week 1 to week 4, and from week 1 to week 8, as well as the algorithm for specifying the stage 2 treatment decision. If the adolescent has demonstrated < 20% reduction on the HRSD at week 4, REDCap will trigger the randomized stage 2 treatment: increase dose of IPT -A or add SSRI. If the adolescent has 
demonstrated > 20% reduction in depression on the HRSD at week 4, REDCap 
will trigger the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666174] 12 IPT -A 
sessions. If an adolescent who was a week 4 sufficient responder continues to be a week 8 sufficient responder (> 40% reduction in depression on the HRSD), 
REDCap will trigger the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666174] 1 2 IPT -
A sessions. If an adolescent who was a week 4 sufficient responder becomes a week 8 insufficient responder (< 40% reduction in depression on the HRSD), REDCap will trigger the randomized stage 2 treatment: increase dose of IPT -A or 
add SSRI. If an adolescent misses the week 4 or week 8 session, the HRSD will be completed at  the next attended session and the decision regarding stage 2 treatment will occur at that session. Adolescents randomized to increase IPT -A 
will receive an additional four IPT-A sessions scheduled twice a week ( 16 
sessions total). Adolescents randomized to add SSRI will be referred to a psychopharmacologist to start an SSRI in addition to completing the remainder of their 12 IPT- A sessions.  
 
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) . Adolescents randomized to 
receive an SSRI at stage [ADDRESS_899707] already employed by [CONTACT_666248]. Psychopharmacologists will be psychiatrists and/or psychiatric nurse practitioners. They will receive training in the medication protocol from co-investigator, Kathryn Cullen, MD. [CONTACT_383951] will also provide quarterly consultation. Fluoxetine will be the first choice SSRI. Escitalopram will be the second choice. The psychopharmacologist may choose to select escitalopram first if clinically indicated when there is a previous history of intolerance to fluoxetine, based on family history or preference, and inability to achieve an adequate fluoxetine dose. Citalopram, fluvoxami ne, and sertraline may also be selected first 
if clinically indicated, as above. The medication management protocol will follow standard clinical practices. Prior to initiation of the SSRI, all female patients will be asked, “Is it possible that you could be pregnant?” and “ Have you recently or 
are you currently having any unprotected sex?”. If a female patient endorses either of these questions, they will be counseled on the risks of taking an SSRI and encouraged to practice safe sex practices. If the patient believes that she may be pregnant, she will be instructed to take a pregnancy test before beginning

  No individual results will be shared with participants or others (e.g., participants’ 
primary care physicians).  
 
8.0 Study Duration  
• Duration anticipated for an individual participa nt’s participation in the 
study: 36 weeks 
• Duration anticipated t o enroll all study participants: 4 years 
• Duration anticipated to complete all study procedures and data analysis: 5 
years  
9.0 Study Population  
Adolescent Inclusion Criteria:  
1) Male and female adolescents (ages 12 -18)  
2) meet DSM -V criteria for a primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 
Persistent Depressive Disorder, or Depressive Disorder NEC (based on the K-
SADS118);  
3) demonstrate symptoms of depression (CDRS-R104 > 36); and 
4) demonstrate impairment in functioning (CGAS114 < 65) during a baseline 
evaluation conducted by [CONTACT_476400].  
Adolescent Exclusion Criteria:  
1) Non  English-speaking 
2) M eet criteria for bipolar disorder, psychosis, anorexia nervosa (other eating 
disorders will be included), substance use disorder (substance use will be 
included), autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual disability disorder (based on school placement information).  
3) Depressed adolescents who are actively suicidal with a plan and/or intent who 
are assessed to need a higher level of care than outpatient treatment due to safety risk will be referred for appropriate level of stabilization (inpatient, partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], intensive outpatient). Once stabilized, the adolescent can be re-evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study.  
4) Adolescents will be excluded if they are already receiving treatment for 
depression or if they are taking medication for a psychiatric diagnosis other than ADHD. Adolescents with comorbid ADHD who are on a stable dose of stimulant 
medication (> 3 months) will be eligible.  Interested families with adolescents 
currently taking psychiatric medication may, if desired, undergo a medication 
washout process to participate in the study. With the approval and oversight of their prescribing clinician, adolescents may choose to stop their medication. The prescribing clinician will determine with the families  how to best wean off the 
medication. After 2 weeks completely off the medication, adolescents may be re-

  considered for study eligibility. If the adolescent is taking fluoxetine, the required washout period will be 3 weeks rather than 2 weeks. 
 
Parent/Caregiver Inclusion Criteria:  
1) Parent/caregiver of an adolescent enrolled in the study  
Parent/Caregiver Exclusion Criteria:  
1) Non English- speaking  
 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666182]: 
 
1) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666183]: 
 1) Treatment providers, other clinic staff, and members of the leadership team at PrairieCare and Minnesota Mental Health Clinics  
 
Screening:  
Prairi eCare has two screening pathways:  
(1) Prair ieCare offers free psychiatric needs assessments for families who are 
unsure if they are in need of services or are unsure what level of service is needed 
(e.g. outpatient, partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], inpatient).
 If the clinician determines that 
the adolescent has a depression diagnosis and outpatient level of care is appropriate , the clinician will provide information about the study to the 
adolescent and parents.  
(2) Some families call PrairieCare’s outpatient clinic directly to initiate outpatient 
services. If families’ initial call with an intake coordinator is regarding an 
adolescent aged 12- 18 years, the intake coordinator will inform the families that 
they can schedule a screening appointment with the University of Minnesota team to obtain a diagnostic evaluation and, if eligible, hear about participation in the study as an option.  
Minnesota Mental Health Clinics has two screening pathways:  
(1) Families who call the clinics to initiate outpatient services speak with an 
intake coordinator to schedule an appointment. If families’ initial call with an 
PROTOCOL TITLE: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for 
Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/2023 
  
 Page 29 of 66
  intake coordinator is regar ding an adolescent aged 12- 18 years, the intake 
coordinator will provide information about the study to the family.  
(2) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666184] a family with an adolescent (age 12 -18) 
for an intake and/or ongoing therapy can provide information about the study to 
the family.  
Additional screening pathway for both sites:  
Some families will be directed to the study through recruitment sources other than 
PrairieCare and Minnesota Mental Health Clinics. Families who are referred from 
other  organizations that serve youth (e.g., pediatric clinics) will complete a 
permission to contact [CONTACT_666252], indicating 
parents’ permission to be contact[CONTACT_136501]. Parents  may either (a) 
participate in a structu red telephone screen with study staff that asks about mood, 
medical history, and current and prior treatment. If a parent completes the phone 
screen and the adolescent appears eligible, they will be asked to meet with an 
independent evaluator (IE) to learn more about the study, provide consent/assent, 
and complete the baseline assessments to determine eligibility.  Or (b) schedule an 
in-person screening appointment with the University of Minnesota team to obtain 
a diagnostic evaluation and, if eligible, hear  about participation in the study as an 
option.  
If the parent opts to schedule the screening appointment, parent and adolescent 
will complete screening consent/assent forms. They will then complete the “assessment of current symptoms” in the screening module of the K -SADS -PL, as 
well as any supplements that may determine eligibility/ineligibility if symptoms 
are endorsed during the screening module (affective, psychotic, substance use, 
eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders supplements). Parent and 
adolescent will also complete the CDRS -R, C-GAS, and C -SSRS, as well as the 
Brief Screen Additional Information form. If parent and adolescent are deemed eligible, study staff will describe the study. If the family is interested in participating in the s tudy, study staff will proceed to schedule them for the 
Baseline visit to complete the study consent and remaining Baseline measures. If 
families are ineligible  or are eligible and decide not to participate in the study, 
they will be referred to services at PrairieCare, Minnesota Mental Health Clinics, 
or other services. Based on the needs of patients and availability of providers, 
some families will be directed to study treatment options outside of PrairieCare and Minnesota Mental Health Clinics.  
Reassessm ent of eligibility if there is a delay in starting treatment:  
If there is a  > 2 week, but < 6 week delay between the eligibility evaluation and 
starting treatment, the following measures will be re -administered to re -assess 
eligibility and re -establish baseline scores, as the measures only capture 
symptoms in the previous 1- 2 weeks: CDRS -R, BDI -II, CGI.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for 
Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/2023 
  
 Page 30 of 66
  If there is a > 6 week delay between the eligibility evaluation and starting treatment, all baseline measures will be re- administered.  
If an adolescent is found to be ineligible at re -assessment, referrals to PrairieCare, 
Minnesota Mental Health Clinics, or other services will be made, as described 
above.  
 
 
10.0 Vulnerable Populations  
☒ Children 
☐ Pregnant women/Fetuses/Neonates  
☐ Prisoners  
☒ Adults lacking capacity to consent and/or adults with diminished 
capacity to consent, including, but not limited to, those with acute 
medical conditions, psychiatric disorders, neurologic disorders, developmental disorders, and behavioral disorders  
☐ Approached for participation in research during a stressful situation such 
as emergency room setting, childbirth (labor), etc. 
☐ Disadvantaged in the distribution of social goods and services such as 
income, housing, or healthcare  
☐ Serious health condition for which there are no satisfactory standard 
treatments  
☐ Fear of negative consequences for not participating in the research (e.g. 
institutionalization, deportation, disclosure of stigmatizing behavior)  
☐ Any other circumstance/dynamic that could increase vulnerability to 
coercion or exploitation that might influence consent to research or 
decision to continue in research  
☐ Undervalued or disenfranchised social group  
☐ Members of the military  
☐ Non -English speakers  
☐ Those unable to read (illiterate)  
☐ Employees of the researcher  
☐ Students of the researcher  
☐ None of the above  
Adults lacking capacity to consent and/or adults with diminished capacity to consent:  
The study sample includes adolescents up through 18 years of age. The sample consists solely of adolescents because adolescence has been identified as a critical 
period for the treatment of depression, given that it is characterized by a significant rise in the rates of depressive symptoms and diagnoses.

purposes and will not be given or sold to any other company. Greenphire will not 
receive any information about participants’  health status es or the study in which 
they are participating.  
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
Withdrawal Circumstances: Five conditions that may lead to a decision to 
terminate treatment prematurely are: (a) the adolescent’s primary problem changes during treatment in a way that warrants changes in t reatment priority 
(e.g., adolescent begins to use dangerous drugs); (b) parent and/or adolescent request a change of treatment focus or approach; (c) evidence of a deterioration with treatment; (d) evidence of a non -response to treatment  at week 8 or week 12 
evaluation time points ; or (e) evidence of serious suicide risk.  
An Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) will provide independent clinical consultation to the study team and treating clinicians, particularly in situations where there are concerns about the appropriateness of the subject continuing in the trial in the assigned arm of the treatment studies : 1) a suicide attempt, 2) serious 
suicidal ideation (with a plan) and refusal to contract for safety, 3) psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 4) possible need for psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 5) significant worsening of depressive or other clinical symptoms (CDRS -R > 76 or CGI 
improvement score > 5), 6) a non- response to treatment (CGI improvement score 
= 4 at week 8 or week 12), and 6) the need for alternative trea tment outside of 
PROTOCOL TITLE: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for 
Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899723] requires treatment 
outside of study protocols or if the treatment provided in the study is contraindicated . 
Participants will not be withdrawn from the study assessments unless they 
withdraw consent or unless the ISM deems that continued participation in the assessments is causing harm to the participant.  
Withdrawal Procedures: Participants who are withdrawn from the study treatment 
will be referred for alternative treatment at PraireCare, Minnesota Mental Health Clinics, or in an alternative community setting. Participants can continue to participate in the assessment procedures if they continue to provide consent/assent and the ISM deems participants safe to continue in the assessments. Data from the medical record regarding ongoing treatment (as described above in Section 5 above) will continue to be collected unless the parent withdraws consent.  
Termination Procedures: Participants and the treating providers will be informed 
of termination within 24 hours following ISM review. Data will continue to be used after termination.  
 
14.0 Risks to Participants  
Foreseeable Risks : (1) D uring the assessments, subjects (adolescents  and parents) 
could become upset, angry, or sad when completing the assessments. (2) During the interventions, feelings could arise that are upsetting to the participating individuals ( adolescents  and parents) and could lead to temporary feelings of 
anger, sadness, or being upset. (3) Adolescents could experience suicidal ideation or a deterioration with treatment. (4) Adolescents randomized to receive SSRI treatment could experience adverse effects of medications. While SSRIs are generall y well tolerated, side effects do occur. The most commonly reported side 
effects are: nausea, tremor, overstimulation, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is also some indication that some children treated with antidepressant medications are at elevated risk for suicidal ideation and 
behavior.
134 (5) Risk of identifying adolescent abuse/ maltreatment during an 
assessment or treatment se ssion. Risks 2-[ADDRESS_899724] Risk:     
Risk of becoming upset during the assessment. All clinical measures will be 
conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_375361], trained IEs. The IEs will be master’s level clinicians. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_666188], Kristina Reigstad, PsyD, LP, will provide 
detailed training and supervision to the IEs in the administration of all measures. In the instance of any adolescent or parent becoming upset when completing any

Risk of becoming upset during the intervention. UC and IPT- A therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666189] (LPCC, LICSW, LP) currently employed by [CONTACT_666259] . Pharmacotherapy will be 
delivered by [CONTACT_666260] (child psychiatrists and nurse practitioners) also already employed by [CONTACT_666259] . 
Treatment providers will handle all clinical issues in the way they are generally handled at PrairieCare or Minnesota Mental Health Clinics . At PrairieCare, the 
Chief Psychotherapy Officer and the Chief Medical  Officer will oversee the 
services by [CONTACT_666261]. At Minnesota Mental Health Clinics, oversight will be provided by [CONTACT_666262]. Furthermore, additional strategies will be implemented to minimize risk to research subjects. First, the IPT-A therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666190]. Second, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_666191]-risk.  
 
Risk of suicide or deterioration with treatment . Rescue procedures wi ll follow the 
standard suicide prevention procedures as outlined in the AACAP Practice Parameters on Suicidal Behavior,
135 including risk assessment, identification and 
modification of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32895], and contracting for safety. All study staff will be trained to follow these parameters. Subjects will be educated about depression and signs of suicidal crisis. Subjects will rece ive PrairieCare’s or Minnesota Mental 
Health Clinic’s [ADDRESS_899726] to suicidality on a frequent and regular basis (during treatment sessions and IE -administered assessments). Subjects who show 
deterioration in depression, mania, psychosis, or level of suicidality will be 
monitored closely. Subjects who are at risk may need to be psychiatrically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the treatment provider or IE is concerned about current suicide risk, the provider will  follow the procedures that are consistent with the standard suicide 
prevention procedures as outlined in the AACAP Practice Parameters on Suicidal Behavior. The provider or IE will discuss these cases with the clinic leadership at the respective clinics , as well as the PI.  Based on the information from various 
sources, the provider, PI, and clinic leadership at the respective sites  will evaluate 
suicide risk and decide what level of care is sufficient. Subjects will be referred for

  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666192]: a) h is/her condition is unstable -as manifested by [CONTACT_666263] a safety plan, psychosis, mania, rapid cycling or mixed 
state; and b) there is a lack of sufficient environmental support and structure to guarantee the subject’s sa fety.  
 
For adolescents who are assessed to be safe to go home and are not referred for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a safety plan will be established in collaboration with the subject and parents. The safety plan will include the adolescent’s/parent’s commitment to utilize a list of strategies that can help keep the adolescent safe in a suicidal crisis. The strategies will be individualized to each adolescent. The adolescent’s safety plan will inclu de: (a) strategies that the adolescent can employ with the help of 
others (adult that the adolescent can contact), and (b) strategies that the adolescent can use by [CONTACT_12552]/herself without the help of others (emotion regulation skills). The parent’s safety plan will include strategies that the parent can use to keep the adolescent safe. The parent’s safety plan will also include calling 911 or going to the Emergency Room should any safety concerns arise, and will include procedures for limiting the adolescent’s access to means of self -harm (e.g., 
medications, knives).   Also, as described in Section 13, an ISM will provide independent clinical consultation to the study team and treating clinicians, particularly in situations where there are concerns about the ap propriateness of the subject continuing in the 
trial in the assigned arm of the treatment study. The adolescent will be removed from the study treatment if the ISM deems that the subject requires treatment outside of study protocols or if the treatment provided in the study is contraindicated.  
       
Risk of side effects with SSRIs . While SSRIs are generally well tolerated, side 
effects do occur. Safety of the medication treatment will be monitored closely. The psychopharmacologists will be able to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cullen with any concerns or questions. The psychopharmacologists will review with families the following potential SSRI -related adverse events:  gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, pain, 
diarrhea, and constipation) (frequency: 4- 29%), dizziness (frequ ency 2 -11%), 
allergic reactions (frequency: rare) , increased anxiety or irritability(frequency: 3-
15%), increased activation/restlessness (frequency: 2%), sleep changes (increased or decreased) (frequency: 5 -30%) , sexual side effects (frequency: 1 -11%), 
appetite changes (increased or decreased) (frequency: 4 -17%), unusual thoughts 
(frequency: rare) , sweating (frequency: 2 -9%), fatigue (frequency: 5 -17%), 
suicidal ideation/attempts/and or behaviors (frequency: 4%). In addition to these issues, th e psychopharmacologists will make the adolescents and their families 
aware of the Food and Drug Administration advisory that the use of antidepressants like the SSRIs may lead to suicidal thinking/attempts in depressed youths and that the FDA has placed product warning label with information highlighting the need for close observation for worsening of depression and the

Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899727] a 24 hour on- call service for urgent 
matters that develop outside of regular business hours.   To monitor potential risks, clinicians will carefully assess for any significant changes in mood, thinking, behaviors, physical symptoms, and suicidality, especially early in treatment. In the event  of minor side effects (e.g., mild 
headaches), the medication may be maintained at the current dose levels or reduced. If any adverse medication reactions do occur, the medication will be withdrawn and clinical staff will follow the patient closely until the adverse reaction remits. Also, if a patient shows a worsening of symptoms, including suicidality,  or develops exclusionary criteria described above, rescue procedures 
described above will be implemented and the patient will be evaluated by [CONTACT_666264].   
Risk of identifying adolescent abuse/ maltreatment . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Reigstad will 
provide training to the project staff in requirements and procedures for following up on and collecting information about child maltreatment. In any case where the possibility of maltreatment arises, the project staff involved will collect the information and will immediately confer with the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48107]. Reigstad, and 
mandated reporter requirements will be followed closely. The research team will also discuss these cases.  
 
Risk of loss of confidentiality . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_666193], and will reiterate this point as opportunities arise in handling of such material. All interviews and therapy sessions will take place in private rooms. All off- site communication 
between research staff and participants will occur by [CONTACT_666265]’s email encryption system to ensure security. At two points in the study participants will be given the option to request that the research team does not send encrypted emails using the University encryption system using a request form for communication via unencrypted email. The first opportunity to request unencrypted email communication will occur at first contact [CONTACT_666266]. The second opportunity will occur during the consent meeting. Both opportunities have unencrypted email authorization forms collected via REDCap for electronic signatures. This form will disclose risks of communicating via 
unencrypted email and will require a participant signature [CONTACT_666279]. Participants will also be given the option to request that the research team uses text messaging to schedule and confirm appointments using a consent for text message correspondence form. This form will disclose risks of and parameters for communicating via text message and will also require a participant signature [CONTACT_666280]: An Adaptive Algorithm -Based Approach to Treatment for

Disclosure of health risk behaviors by [CONTACT_469753] .
  All subjects will be 
informed during the consent process that their infor mation will be kept strictly 
confidential unless information is revealed suggesting that the subject or someone 
else is in danger (e.g., prostitution, IV drug use, child abuse (see below), suicidality, homicidality). Prior to eliciting this information, the child will be fully informed that the clinician may need to report such information. Before parents will be made aware of this information, our procedure will be to first talk with the child and explain what information will be disclosed to parents.   
Reporting of child abuse .
  Because information relating to abuse will be assessed (an 
item in the PTSD section of the K -SADS -PL),118, participants will be informed of 
the need to report child abuse prior to eliciting this information. All staff will follow 
federal and state child abuse reporting requirements.   
Reproduction Risks: The impact of SSRIs on fetuses is currently unclear. Prior to 
initiation of the SSRI, all female patients will be asked  by [CONTACT_666269], “Is it possible that you could be pregnant?” and “Have you recently or are you currently having any unprotected sex?” If a female patient 
endorses either of these questions, they will be counseled on the risks of taking an SSRI and encouraged to practice safe sex practices. If the patient believes she may be pregnant, she will be instructed to take a pregnancy test before beginning medication. If a patient is pregnant, medication management will not be initiated. If a female adolescent who is taking an SSRI becomes pregnant over the course of the trial, her psychopharmacologist will provide council on the potential risks and benefits of continuing the medication. If the patient and psychopharmacologist decide to discontinue the medication, the patient can continue to receive IPT- A 
and continue to participate in the study assessments. 
Risks to Others: N/A 
 
15.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
Potential Benefits: The benefit of participation in this study is receiving an active treatment (IPT -A with or without an SSRI or UC). IPT -A is an evidence- based

Adolescent Depression  
VERSION DATE: 09/05/[ADDRESS_899730] community settings. T he 
participants  that ar e randomized to the treatment condition that includes IPT- A 
will be getting access to an evidence- based treat ment that is not currently 
available at PrairieCare or Minnesota Mental Health Clinics.  
 
16.0 Data Management  
Data Analysis Plan: The proposed trial de sign of adaptive interventions is similar 
to a factorial design.31,136-138 All analyses will be by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat.  
Aim 1. Hypotheses 1a and 1b: We will compare the average 16 -week change in 
depressive symptoms (CDRS-R) and interpersonal functioning between 
adolescents compliant with ATS1 (cells 1 and 3) and UC (cell 4) and between adolescents compliant with ATS2 (cells 1 and 2) and UC (cell 4) using weighted t-tests. Secondary analyses will compare these groups using weighted regression adjusting for baseline characteristics such as age, gender, and depression severity. The measure of interpersonal functioning will be constructed from a latent fac tor 
analysis of changes in IPPA, IC, and parent-adolescent conflict behaviors. Note that the (unweighted) sample mean of adolescents in cells 1 and 2 contains an underrepresentation from adolescents with an insufficient response (compared to the population in which all adolescents followed ATS1) because half of the insufficient responders are re-randomized into subgroup [ADDRESS_899731] for this underrepresentation by [CONTACT_666270] 2.
139-141  
Hypothesis 1c : Incremental cost -effectiveness ratios between the two contrast 
pairs (ATS1 vs. UC and ATS2 vs. UC) will be calculated from the weighted mean scores for the change in costs and QALYs, and adjusted mean scores, based on weighted regression analysis (weights described above). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for uncertainty in the parameters. Bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_666207]- effectiveness 
scatter plots and cost -effectiveness acceptability curves. Followi ng the [ADDRESS_899732] Inventory will be provided.  
Aim 2 : We will fit a linear regression model for change in depressive symptoms 
including a term for 4-week change in interpersonal functioning, first- stage 
treatment, and other confounders of the mediator- outcome rel ationship and a 
model for change in relationship functioning with first- stage treatment and other 
covariates as predictors. The controlled direct effect can be estimated using the regression coefficient for first -line treatment in the adjusted outcome mode l and 
the indirect effect can be estimated as the product of the coefficient for first -line 
treatment in the outcome and mediator models.

 Page 43 of 66
  Aim 3: We will first test the effect of baseline relationship functioning as a 
moderator of stage 1 treatment (IPT -A vs. UC) by [CONTACT_6486] a regression model for 
16-week change in depression symptoms with baseline relationship functioning 
and an interaction between stage [ADDRESS_899733] of 4 -week change in relationship 
functioning and other possible covariates listed in the assessment section as moderators of second- stage treatment assignment, we will fit a regression model 
for change in depressive symptoms among insufficient responders among those initially randomized to IPT -A and include a term for 4- week change in 
relationship functioning and other covariates, second stage treatment (increased IPT-A vs. SSRI), and their interaction.  
 
Secondary Analyses : In addition to modeling the change in depressive symptoms 
at [ADDRESS_899734] models (growth curve models) 
to model the depressive symptoms over time (up to 36 weeks) within each of the 2 embedded ATSs.  Importantly, the data collected as part of t his trial will also 
permit us to explore how to tailor the interventions based on an individual’s characteristics, such as age, depression severity, or interpersonal functioning through the use of Q- and A -learning.
143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153 
 Aim 4 : Descriptive results regarding subject consent and the demographics for 
those who consented and declined will be reported as percentages. Chi-square tests will compare the proportion of subjects consented based on diagnostic and demographic characteristics. Adolescents’, parents’, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ attitudes regarding the ATSs will be reported as mean scores and standard deviations on the CSQ -8 and ATA. Clinic staff members’ attitudes regarding the evidence for 
the ATSs and the clinics’ organizational readiness will be reported as mean scores and standard deviations on the ORCA Evidence and Context scales. Research team members will independently read transcripts of the treatment provider and leadership interview s and Research Team Observational Log, meet to discuss 
observed themes, and code the transcripts and logs.
[ADDRESS_899735] will be collapsed into categories that will yield descriptive overarching themes. Coding will be conducted using Atlas.ti qualitative software. 
Genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_666208]: 
We will use the Illumina PsychChip which contains the relevant candidate genes for study. [CONTACT_666284] has experience with this array

  (GoldenHelix SVS) to generate permutation- adjusted gene -based p- values from 
models containing relevant covariates . In order to assess methylation across the 
entire genome, this study will use the Infinium MethylationEPIC Array which quantitatively measures DNA  methylation at 850K sites across the genome. 
Samples from subjects receiving the differe nt treatments will be  evenly 
distributed across the arrays to minimize batch effects. Two non- study controls 
will be placed on each  array for QA/WC. The variables of interest are % 
methylation calculated from the ratio of a methylated probe  relative to the  sum of 
methylated and unmethylated probes ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully 
methylated).  After obtaining % DNA methylation data, we will filter out low 
quality samples and probes based on call rates and  QC parameters provided by [CONTACT_13989]. Additionally, as we have done in previous studies, we will remove  
probes that may cross -hybridize to multiple genomic regions, as well as probes 
that contain common SNPs  (MAF≥0.01) .
[ADDRESS_899737] approach .159 Cell- composition effects will be 
controlled for using established bioinformatic methods .160 Association studies will 
examine mean methylation across specific regulatory regions for  each candidate 
gene covered by [CONTACT_666271] y in relation to treatment response status.  
Analyses of SNP and methyla tion predictors define response categorically  
according to the HRSD assessment at week 4 (non -responders show < 20% 
improvement) or week 8 (non- responders show <40% improvement). Geneti cally 
defined race (PCA), sex, and age  will be included in all models as we have done 
previously.158,161 Covariates to be included in analysis include current m edications  
which may influence methylation, particularly mood stabilizers,162 sex, and 
smoking status.163 Univariate assessments of intervention  type ( ATS1, ATS2, and 
UC), evidence of early trauma, lifetime trauma load, depressive symptoms, 
substance use exposures, medication utilization (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, 
antipsychotics, etc) will be  examined to determine whether these variables require 
inclusion into our statistical models. Based on logistic regression models  
identifying significant predictors of clinical improvement, we may also  create 
propensity scores which will be used as covariates  in the analyses. We will 
compare %  methylation at the pre -treatment time point in those who went on  to 
respond versus those who did not, using analysis of covariance. Secondary analyses will examine HRSD and CDRS -R scores  over multiple time points using 
mixed regression models  (growth curve models) to examine the effect of % 
baseline methylation on symptom levels over time (baseline, wk4, wk 8, wk16, 
wk32). Intercept and slopes will be fitted as random terms in the  models of 
intraindividual change. We will be testing for a  significant interaction between % 
baseline methylation and  symptom change over time . We will use mixed 
regression models to examine the relationship between changes in HRSD and CDRS -R scores  with % methylation changes longitudinally to ide ntify  whether 
change in methylation is  correlated with HRSD and CDRS -R change scores.  We 
will examine methylation changes from baseline  to 8wks  and 16wks  in relation to 
responder status. We will first identify methylation changes that occur in

esponders but not non

esponders. Finally we will model % baseline methylation 
as a continuous outcome in relation to HRSD and CDRS -R scores across multiple 
time points. We will apply an unsupervised clustering approach to identify 
self-or
ganizing maps164 defining clusters of individuals with similar trajectories  
over time . Using the identified clusters, we will test for markers with baseline 
methylation level specific to these groups. Genes associated with response will be evaluated for pathway enrichment via Gene Ontology, as well as representation in biological network clusters with  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis IPA® (QIAGEN 
Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) for enrichment of regulatory pathways. For HPA
-a
xis, inflammation, and neuroendocrine pathways implicated 
a priori, we will test specifically for over enrichment in those pathways using a hypergeometric distribution test. 
Power Analysis: The proposed trial is powered for a comparison of average change in depressive symptoms (Hypothesis 1a) and interpersonal functioning 
(Hypothesis 1b) between ATS1 & UC and ATS2 & UC. The power calculation 
for Hypotheses 1a and 1b is similar to a standard two- arm intervention trial with 
subject or case weights due to over- or under -sampling certain subgroups.165,166 
Table 2 gives the power for Hypotheses 1a and 1b assuming a total sample size of 200 and 2:[ADDRESS_899738] size (ES) (Cohen’s d) between the ATSs beginning with IPT-A and UC. We consider an ES of 0.[ADDRESS_899739]; previous studies of IPT-A alone versus non- adaptive 
treatment as usual demonstrated similar ESs and we believe that similar ESs will be obtained comparing the ATSs with UC (which may be adaptive).
[ADDRESS_899740] demonstrated that approximately 50% of subjects will be responders and we demonstrate that adequate power is achieved across a range of plausible proportion of responders to IPT- A. 
Although the trial was powered to test the hypotheses for the primary aim, we demonstrate that we have adequate power to test for mediators (Hypothesis 2) and moderators of the first -line treatment effect (Hypothesis 3a) under plausible 
scenarios. Dietz et al. found that approximately 55% of the eff ect of family -based 
IPT-A on depressive symptoms was mediated by [CONTACT_666272].
167 If we assume that 4 week chan ges in interpersonal functioning 
mediates between 30 -50% of the total effect, we will have between 78% and 
99.5% power to detect a significant indirect effect. For ease of power estimates, we dichotomized the moderator (e.g. interpersonal functioning) into two groups with ~50% of the population in each group. If the overall effect size between those randomized initially to IPT -A versus UC is between 0.[ADDRESS_899741] 75%-95% power to detect a significant interaction effect 
between first -line treatment and interpersonal functioning assuming a two-sided 
Wald -type test using a 90% significance level. Treating interpersonal functioning 
as a continuous covariate would increase the power to detect a significant interaction.

Assessment of participant comfort will occur on an ongoing basis; research staff will ask the youth how they are feeling and if they are comfortable with starting/continuing a study activity. Parents and children will be given the opportunity to separately discuss concerns or responses to questions with research staff. Since we are working with minors, we will inform participants and their parent(s) that we are required to report if the subject is a danger to themselves or others or if they report child abuse/neglect. 
Access to Participants: Accessing the participant’s medical record to obtain 
information regarding treatment history will be d escribed in the consent form 
signed by [CONTACT_2299]. Participants will be informed that they may withdraw this consent at any time.  
20.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
Compensation for Research -Related Injury: The following statement is included 
in the consent form: “In the event that this research activity results in an injury, treatment will be available, including first aid, emergency treatment and follow -
up care as n eeded. Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary manner, to 
you or your insurance company. If you think that you have suffered a research related injury let the study physicians know right away.”

21.0 Consent Process  
Consent Process (when consent will be obtained) for Adolescents and Parents: 
Potential participants who learn about the study from PrairieCare or Minnesota Mental Health Clinic staff will call University of Minnesota research staff to express interest in p articipating in the study. Research staff will also directly 
contact [CONTACT_666274] a Permission to Contact [CONTACT_982]. The researchers will schedule an appointment for the consent process to occur.  
For participants recruited via PrairieCare, Minnesota Mental Health Clinics, or 
referred from partnering organizations who opt to schedule a screening 
appointment: Families will schedule a brief screening assessment to confirm 
eligibility. Prior to completing this screening, parents and adolescents will complete “consent/assent to screen” forms indicating their willingness to participate in the screening process. Upon the completion of the screening process, eligible participants interested in the study will schedule a subsequent baseline as sessment; at the baseline appointment, the study team will conduct 
informed consent for participation in the study.

  For participants self -referred or participants referred that opt out of the scheduled 
screening option:  Families will complete a “consent to contact [CONTACT_982]” which will 
be faxed to the research team, indicating parents’ permission to be contact[CONTACT_627764]. Potential participants may also call University of Minnesota research staff to express interest in participating in the study. Paren ts will 
participate in a structured telephone screen with study staff that asks about mood, medical history, and current and prior treatment. If the adolescent appears eligible on the phone screen, they will be asked to meet with an independent evaluator (IE) to learn more about the study, provide consent/assent, and complete the baseline assessments to determine eligibility.  
Only members of the University of Minnesota research team will conduct the informed consent. During the consent meeting, the study wi ll be explained; the 
consent forms will be reviewed in detail; any questions will be answered; and ability to understand will be assessed. Research staff will reiterate that the participants’ agreeing or declining to participate will have no bearing on the ir care 
at their chosen mental health clinic. Consent and assent forms will be signed if the parent and adolescent choose to participate. For participants who are not able to come to the University of Minnesota or are unable to do a home visit, the consent procedure will be conducted via a secure web -conferencing platform (Zoom). A 
member of the research team will review the consent form over Zoom and a copy will be available to participant via REDCap to electronically sign.  
Consent Process for Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666225]: Clinic staff at PrairieCare 
or Minnesota Mental Health Clinics will be informed about participation in the study by [CONTACT_666275]’s leadership team. Clinic staff who are interested in participating will contact [CONTACT_666276]. Only members of the University of Minnesota research team will conduct the informed consent. During the consent meeting, the study will be explained; the consent forms will be  reviewed in detail; 
any questions will be answer ed; and ability to understand will be assessed. 
Research staff will reiterate that the participants’ agreeing or declining to participate will have no bearing on their employment at their clinic. Consent forms will be  signed if the individual chooses to participate.

and their parent or guardian will include both consent and assent processes. Only one parent will be required to give consent. Research staff may accept signed  
consent from legal guardians if they provide documentation of their authority to  
consent to the youth’s general medical ca re. Assent will be required for all  
adolescents younger than 18 years of age. Youth assent will be documented by 
[CONTACT_666277].  
 
Cognitively Impaired Adults , or adults with fluctuating or diminished capacity to 
consent:  
• For adolescents 18 years of age, research staff conducting the consent 
meeting will administer the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool 
for Clinical Research (MacCAT -CR) to assess capacity to consent.  
• During study visits, the independent evaluators conduct semi -
structured interview assessments of depression symptoms and 
psychosocial functioning. If during these assessments, they observe 
responses or behavior that suggest impaired competence, they will 
ensure that a qualified staff administer the MacCAT -CR to deter mine 
if capacity to consent has changed and requires permission from the 
legally authorized representative in order to continue participation in 
the study. The legally authorized representative will be notified and 
permission will be sought with the main s tudy consent form  if the 
LAR has not already provided consent . The LAR will be involved in 
the entire consent process each time capacity to consent is re-evaluated.  
• Participants that are 18 years old or older during study participation 
will be asked to document their wishes regarding future study 
participation in the event that their capacity to consent fluctuates. 
Documentation will be part of the participant’s consent records for reference, but the legally authorized representative’s permission is stil l 
required in the event that the participant does not have capacity to consent. 
• To avoid seeking consent during periods of greater than normal impairment, we are not enrolling participants during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. We are also not enrolling adolescents who are actively suicidal with a 
plan and/or intent who are assessed to need a higher level of care than outpatient treatment. Once stabilized, the adolescent can be re-
evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study.

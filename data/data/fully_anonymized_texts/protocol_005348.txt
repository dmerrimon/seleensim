Study Phase:  3 
Indication: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)  
Study Name:  [CONTACT_471941] E xercise Tolerance Evaluation of O mecamtiv Mecarbil Related to 
Increased Contractility in Heart Failure (METEORIC -HF) 
 
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil  (OM) compared with 
placebo on exercise capacity as determined by [CONTACT_471900] (CPET) 
following 20 weeks of treatment with OM or placebo  
Secondary Objective:  
• To evaluate the effect of treatment with OM compared with placebo on daily act ivity as 
determined by [CONTACT_471901]: 
• To evaluate the relationships between exercise capacity (determined by [CONTACT_208203]), daily 
activity (determined by [CONTACT_91152]), and symptoms (determined by [CONTACT_400121] [ KCCQ]) 
Safety Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of OM compared with placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_471902]: 
• Change in peak oxygen uptake ( pVO
2) on CPET from baseline to Week 20 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Change in total workload during CPET from baseline to Week 20  
• Change in ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO 2 slope) during CPET from baseline to Week  20 
• Change in the average daily activity units measured over a 2- week period from baseline 
to Week 18- 20 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• Change from baseline to Week 20 in oxygen uptake efficiency slope (VO 2/logVE slope), 
ventilatory threshold (by [CONTACT_941] V- slope method), VO 2 recovery kinetics, percent predicted 
pVO 2, circulatory power (VO 2 × systolic blood pressure [BP]), and exercise duration  
• Change from baseline in the average daily activity units at Week 6- 8 and at Week  12-14 
• Change from baseline in the KCCQ Total Symptom Score and its sub- domains from 
baseline to Week [ADDRESS_604847]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil

Safety Endpoint: 
• Subject incidence of reported adverse events and serious adverse events.  
Major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events will be adjudicated by a clinical events 
committee (CEC), including: all -cause death, CV death, major cardiac ischemic events 
(myocardial infarction, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929], percutaneous coronary 
intervention and coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]), heart failure (HF) events and stroke.  
Study Design: 
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, parallel group, multicenter study  in 
subjects with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Approximately 270 eligible 
subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either OM or placebo, respectively. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] ( RER ) on the baseline 
CPET (<1.15, ≥1.15) and persistent atrial fibrillation  at screening  (Y/N). The number of patients 
with persistent atrial fibrillation at screening will be capped at approximately 20%  and patients 
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be excluded. Investigational product (IP)  will be started at 
25 mg orally (PO) twice a day (BID), titrated based on the Week [ADDRESS_604848] cannot complete the Week 20 CPET as planned due to COVID -19, 
those subjects may continue on IP until the visit can be completed for up to an additional 12 weeks (total of up to 32 weeks on IP) , and only after approval from  the medical monitor . 
Additionally, the investigator should attempt to complete the Week 20 visit with the CPET as 
close as safely possible to the originally planned date (Appendix  D). All subjects will be managed 
with standard of care (SoC)  HF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471874].

220. Significant adverse finding (e.g., exercise- induced early ischemic changes, abnormal 
decrease in BP [systolic BP falls by [CONTACT_726] 10 mmHg], unexpected arrhythmia or other serious finding) during CPET at screening that precludes safe participation in the study, per investigator  
221. Chronotropic incompetence (including inadequate pacemaker rate response) during 
CPET at screening, defined as a maximum heart rate <55% of the maximum predicted 
heart rate  
Prior investigational studies  
222. Previous or current participation in a study of OM  
223. Currently participating in another investigational device or drug study, or received an 
investigat ional device or drug <  1 month (or 5  half-lives for drugs,  whichever is longer ) 
prior to screening. Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are 
not permitted.  
Pregnancy  
224. Male subject with a female partner of childbearing potential  and not willing to inform his 
partner of his participation in this clinical study.  
225. Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or is planning to become pregnant or planning to breastfeed during treatment with IP (OM or placebo) or within [ADDRESS_604855] of childbearing potential who does not practice true sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated by [CONTACT_471905]) AND not wil ling to inform her partner of her 
participation in this clinical study or use 2 acceptable methods of effective birth control during treatment with IP (OM or placebo) and for an additional [ADDRESS_604856] or her sole male partner has had a surgical 
contraceptive method (bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion or vasectomy with medical assessment of surgical success), additional contraceptive methods are not required.  
• A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she has had a 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_471875]. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in t he postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state 
in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy 
(HRT). However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_604857]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date:  [ADDRESS_604858] discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postm enopausal 
status before study enrollment.  
• Two acceptable methods of effective birth control include the following options:  
− intrauterine device (IUD) and a barrier method with spermicide, IUD and a hormonal birth control method, hormonal birth control method and a barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS) and a 
barrier method with spermicide,  
− 2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method except a female condom) and the female partner must also use spermicide (a male and female condom may not be used together due to the risk of tearing)  
• Hormonal methods of birth control include oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable. Barrier methods of birth control include diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male or female condom with spermicide, 
and contraceptive sponge with spermicide. If spermicide is not commercially 
available in the local country/region a barrier method without spermicide is acceptable.  
− Note: If additional medications  (including SoC HF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) are given during 
treatment, the investigator is to review the prescribing information/summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for all concomitant therapy, as they may alter the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require an increase in the number of contraceptive methods and/or length of time that contraception is to be utilized after the last dose of protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
The investigator is to discuss these changes with the study subject.  
Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria at their Initial Screening Visit  may be rescreened 
(see Section 7.2.3) . If a subject fails screening due to disruptions in study conduct because of 
COVID -19, then an additional rescreening may be included (one Initial S creening  visit and up to 
two re- screenings in this instance only). This must also be approved by [CONTACT_471906].  Rescreened  subjects must first be registered as screen failed in the 
interactive web response system ( IWRS ) and subsequently registered as rescreened. Subjects 
will maintain the originally assigned subject identification number. For rescreening, a new ICF  
must be signed. Rescreened subjects will repeat all screening procedures . 
Investigational Product Dosage and Administration: 
OM or placebo will be administered PO BID (approximately 12 ± 3 hours apart) in the morning 
and evening and can be taken under fasted or fed conditions. Subjects randomized to OM will 
initiate administration at 25 mg BID. Blood samples will be collected at study visits on Weeks 2, 6, and 20 from all subjects to determine the predose OM plasma concentration. The results will be blinded to investigators, Cytokinetics and study subjects. For subjects randomized to OM, the 
Week 2 predose OM plasma concentration (steady -state for the initial 25 mg BID dose) will guide 
a dose adjustment at Week 4, as below, and subjects will continue the adjusted OM dose for the 
remainder of the study ( Appendix  B). For subjects who are randomized to placebo, identical 
blood samples will be collected to maintain study blinding. A new IP  supply will be provided to all 
subjects per protocol, regardless of randomized treatment group and result of the OM plasma 
concent ration assessment, to maintain the blind.  
If normal site procedures are disrupted due to COVID -19, sites may need to institute alternate 
means of IP dispensing
. Sites may provide IP to the patient either directly at the study site or 
have IP shipped to the  patient if permitted locally and approved by [CONTACT_1034].

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
For subjects randomized to OM, the predose plasma concentration at Week 2 will guide the dose 
adjustment at the Week 4 visit as follows:  
• Subjects with plasma concentration < 200 ng/mL will have t heir dose increased to 
50 mg  BID. 
• Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 200 and < 300 ng/mL will have their dose increased to 37.5 mg BID.  
• Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 300 and < 1000 ng/mL will maintain their dose of 
25 mg BID.  
• Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL will start administration of 
placebo BID. 
Study Duration for Subjects: 
After signing the ICF, subjects should be randomized within [ADDRESS_604859] 
due to COVID -19 only after approval by [CONTACT_7195]  (Appendix  D) and follow -up is [ADDRESS_604860]’s Week [ADDRESS_604861] dose of IP, whichever is later . 
Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size Calculation: Assuming a difference in change from baseline in pVO
2 of 
1.0 mL/kg/min for OM compared to placebo, a standard deviation ( SD) of 2.5 mL/kg/min in 
subjects receiving OM and 2.0 mL/kg/min in subjects recei ving placebo, and 15% of subjects 
missing change from baseline data of the primary endpoint , a sample size of 270 subjects 
(approximately 180 randomized to OM and 90 randomized to placebo) provides 90% power to 
detect the difference in pVO 2 change from baseline to Week 20 with a 2- sided type I error of 0.05.  
Cytokinetics  will periodically assess in a blinded fashion the overall pooled SD  and missing data 
rate for the change from baseline in pVO 2 at Week 20. Shortly before enrollment reaches 270 
subjects, if  the pooled SD or missing data rate of all patients is larger than expected,  if a 
significant amount of subjects (>10%) completed the Week 20 CPET beyond the initially planned 
Week 20 window as a result of COVID -19, or if the total number of Week 20 CPET data points in 
subjects with important protocol deviations (per Protocol Amendment 1) due to COVID -19 is > 
10% of the total number of randomized subjects, then a one- time consideration may  be given to 
increasing the sample size up to  a maximum of  400 randomized patients , in order to maintain 
90% power to detect a difference in pVO 2 of 1.0  mL/kg/min. 
Unless specified otherwise, efficacy analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), 
which includes all randomized subjects who receive at leas t one dose of randomized study 
medication, by [CONTACT_21964]. The primary analysis is to test the null hypothesis that there is no treatment difference in the change from baseline in pVO
2 at Week 20 between 
subjects  randomized to placebo and those randomized to OM  in the FAS during the placebo-
controlled double- blind treatment. As will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan, the analysis 
will be performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  model which will include terms of 
treatment,  baseline  pVO 2, RER randomization strat um (< 1.15, ≥  1.15),  persistent atrial fibrillation 
(Y/N), age, sex , and baseline hemoglobin level. The safety analyses will be performed on the 
safety analysis set, which includes all dosed subjects.

1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary  
• To evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil  (OM) compared with 
placebo on exercise capacity as determined by [CONTACT_471900] 
(CPET) following 20 weeks of treatment with OM or placebo  
1.2 Secondary  
• To evaluate the effect of treatment with OM compared with placebo on daily activity as determined by [CONTACT_91152]  
1.3 Exploratory  
• To evaluate the relationships between exercise capacity (determined by [CONTACT_208203]), 
daily activity (determined by [CONTACT_91152]), and symptoms (determined by [CONTACT_110615] [KCCQ]) 
1.4 Safety  
• To eva luate the safety and tolerability of OM compared with placebo, as 
measured by [CONTACT_471908]  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
Heart failure ( HF) affects over [ADDRESS_604877] 
the heart ( Hilfiker -Kleiner et al, 2006 ). Symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, increased need to 
rest, low energy , and difficulty in walking or climbing,  correlate with lower quality of l ife 
and higher mortality risk ( Heo, 2008 ; Flynn,  2009 ; Malhotra,  2016 ; Swank , 2012).  
Exercise intolerance, typi[INVESTIGATOR_471876], is the 
predominant chronic symptom of HF and often the first symptom that prompts patients to 
seek medical care. Assessment of exercise capacity in daily life is widely used to classify the severity of HF, for example the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional classification. These 
assessments are  highly prognostic of long- term outcomes. Even small improvements in 
exercise capacity as measured by [CONTACT_471909] ( Swank , 
2012).  
Few therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471877]. For example, the effect of carvedilol on exercise capacity has been studied in heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction ( HFrEF) with no improvement seen following 12 months of therapy 
(Australia/New Zealand Heart Failure Research Collaborative Group, 1997). Currently, 
Product: Omecamtiv Mecarbil

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
only angiotensin- converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) have product labels that describe 
a positive effect on exercise capacity in patients with HFrEF.  
This study will  test the  hypothesis that improving cardiac function with the cardiac 
myosin activator, OM, a drug therapy that directly increases myocardial contractility, will  
improve exercise tolerance.  
2.[ADDRESS_604878] Background  
The molecular formula of OM is C 20H24FN 5O3·2HCl·H 2O and the chemical structure is 
provided in Figure  1. 
Figure 1 . Chemical Structure of Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
 
OM (CK -1827452) is a novel small molecule classified as a cardiac myosin activator that 
increases cardiac contractility by [CONTACT_471910], the force -generating motor protein of the cardiac 
sarcomere, without increasing cardiac myocyte intracellular calcium ( Malik  et al, 2011 ). 
OM stabilizes the lever arm of myosin in a primed position prior to contraction, increasing the number of myosin molecules able to bind actin and generate force when systole starts ( Planelles -Herrero , 2017 ). OM increases the left ventricular systolic 
ejection time without changing the velocity of contraction (dP/dt) or increasing the heart rate. Additionally, in p reclinical models, left ventricular filling pressures, left atrial 
pressures, and total peripheral vascular resistance decreased, providing evidence that prolongation of systolic ejection time  and increased systolic function can favorably 
impact the hemodynamics that drive HF symptoms. The salutary effects of OM were achieved without noticeable effect upon myocardial oxygen uptake, blood pressure (BP), 
or coronary blood flow ( Shen et al, 2010; Malik et al, 2011).  
2.2.1  Clinical Experience  
OM has been evaluated in 10 phase 1 studies (Studies CY  1011, CY  1013, CY  1015, 
CY 1016, CY  1111, CY  1211 [20120255], 20080676, 20090229, 20090727, and 
20150134), 4 phase 2a studies in subjects with chronic HF (Studies CY  1121, CY  1221, 
CY 1124, and CY  1021), [ADDRESS_604879]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
 Date:  30 June 2021  Page 20 of 87

HFrEF (Study 20100754), and 2 phase 2b studies in subjects with HFrEF 
(Studies  20110151 and 20120227). In these studies, the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of OM were evaluated with intravenous (IV) 
infusions up to 72 hours and oral dosing up to 20  weeks.  Information on these studies is 
in the Investigator Brochure. A phase 3 study, Study 20110203 (GALACTIC -HF), was 
ongoing  at the start of CY  [ADDRESS_604880] of care (SoC) therapy.  Study 20110203 is now complete and an overview of 
the results can be found in Section 2.3. 
2.2.2  Phase 3 Outcomes Study  in Patients with Heart  Failure 
The clinical program includes the  ongoing Phase 3 study (Study 20110203 , 
GALACTICHF ; EudraCT number 2016 -002299- 28), a double- blind , randomized, 
placebo- controlled, multi -center study to assess the efficacy and safety of OM on 
mortality and morbidity in subjects with HFrEF. The primary objective is to evaluate the 
effect of treatment with OM compared with placebo on the time to cardiovascular (CV) death or first HF event, whichever occurs first, in subjects with chronic HFrEF receiving SoC therapy. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of OM on time to CV death; time to HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; time to all -cause death; and change  in patient -reported 
outcomes. The study is event -driven and will conclude when approximately [ADDRESS_604881] occurred. 8256 eligible subjects are  randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either OM or placebo. The OM dosing regimen is a PK based titration scheme.  
All subjects were  managed with SoC  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471878]. Approximately 25% or more of the total planned enrollment include subjects who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471879]. An external independent  Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC ) formally reviews the accumulating data from this study to ensure 
there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects and conducts interim analyses for futility and efficacy.  
2.2.3  Dose Selection for Phase 3  
The OM dosing regimen selected for this study is identical to that in Study  20110203 and 
is a PK based titration scheme with  three dose levels  based on subjects’ OM plasma 
concentration at Week  2. All subjects will receive 25 mg orally (PO) twice a day ( BID) at 
the initiation of treatment. At study visit Week 2 (PK steady -state for initial dose), a 
predose PK sample will be collected. At Week 4, subjects with Week [ADDRESS_604882]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
 Date:  30 June 2021  Page 21 of 87 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
plasma concentrations < 200 ng/mL will have their dose increased to 50 mg BID; 
subjects with Week 2 predose plasma concentrations ≥  200 and <  300 ng/mL will have 
their dose increased to 37.5 mg BID, subjects with Week 2 predose plasma concentrations ≥  300 ng/mL and <  1000 ng/mL will maintain a 25 mg BID dosing 
regimen, and subjects wit h plasma concentration ≥  1000 ng/mL will stop OM and start 
administration of placebo BID. All dose adjustments will be done in blinded fashion.  
PK-based dose adjustment in this study will be used to attain effective steady state 
concentrations while maintaining OM plasma concentrations <  1000  ng/mL. Please refer 
to Appendix  B for further information on dose adjustment.  
Refer to the Investigator’s  Brochur e for additional information related to the physical, 
chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s) of OM.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
 The following benefit -risk assessment supports the conduct of this clinical study. 
Reference should be made to the Investigator’s Brochure for further data on OM.  
2.3.1  Benefits  
The primary evidence of potential benefit in subjects with chronic HF comes from Study.  
20110203 (GALACTIC- HF) which was  a Phase [ADDRESS_604883]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
 Date:  30 June 2021  Page 22 of 87 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
Mortality and morbidity for patients with symptomatic HF remains high with half of the 
patients dying within 4 years, and in patients with severe disease, more than half dying within 1 year (Swedberg et al, 2005). The findings in Study [ADDRESS_604884] that OM 
improves cardiac function leading  to decreases in cardiac volumes and NT- proBNP. 
Decreases in cardiac volumes and NT -proBNP are correlated with improvements in 
clinical outcomes (Kramer et al, 2010; Zile et al, 2016). Thus, the data from Study  20110151 are supportive of a potential clinical benefit of OM on clinical outcomes. 
A phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study (Study 20110203) in [ADDRESS_604885] been observed in healthy subjects and patients 
with HF, and are identified risks of OM. Excessive exposure to OM may result in 
prolongation of the systolic ejection time to an extent that reduces diastolic coronary blood flow. The reduced coronary blood flow could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_471880]. Signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia or infarction can include but are not limited to electrocardiographic changes consistent with myocardial ischemia (ST-segment depression), angina, chest or throat tightness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_471881]/or 
tachycardia, lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, dyspnea, premature ventricular contractions, and troponin elevation.  
Steps have been taken to mitigate the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction to 
subjects during the study. These include a PK -based dose adjustment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_471882] 2b study 2011015 1, and verified in the Phase 3 study 20110203)  in patients with 
chronic HF) employed in this trial (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Appendix  B for details of the 
PK-based dose adjustment) .; the utilization of an oral modified release formulation; and

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
educating investigators on how to minimize the risk by [CONTACT_471911], providing 
information about myocardial ischemia and infarction symptoms and actions that sh ould 
be taken in the events that such symptoms are experienced, and providing administration instructions for OM to reduce the risk of excessive exposure. Safety assessments include adverse event monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical 
examination,  vital signs, and clinical chemistry including assessments for myocardial 
injury. In addition, an independent and external data monitoring committee has been 
established to monitor safety and tolerability.  
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
The primary hypothesis is that  when added to SoC, OM is superior to placebo in 
improving exercise capacity  in subjects with chronic HFrEF and is well tolerated . An 
additional hypothesis is that OM increases daily activity, compared to placebo. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, parallel group, multicenter  study 
in subjects with H FrEF. Approximately 270 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 
ratio to receive either OM or placebo, respectively . Randomization will be stratified 
based on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] ( RER) achieved during the baseline CPET 
(<1.15, ≥1.15)  and persistent atrial fibrillation  at screening (Y/N). The number of patients 
with persistent atrial fibrillation  at screening  will be capped at approximately 20%  and 
patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be excluded. OM will be started at [ADDRESS_604886] cannot complete the Week 20 CPET as planned due to COVID -19, 
those subjects may continue on IP until the visit can be completed for up to an additional 12 weeks (total of up to 32 weeks on IP), and only after approval from the medical 
monitor. Additionally, the investigator should attempt to complete the Week 20 visit with 
the CPET as close as safely possible to the originally planned date ( Appendix  D). All 
subjects should be managed with maximally tolerated SoC  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471883].  
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol 
synopsis section.  
The s tudy endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_604887]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil

3.2 Number of Sites  
Approximately  90 sites globally will participate in this study.  
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects.” 
Approximately [ADDRESS_604888] deviation (SD) for the change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO 2) at 
Week  20 (Section 10.2). 
3.4 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced.  
3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), subjects should be randomized within [ADDRESS_604889] the Week  20 visit, there may be 
instances , and only after approval from the medical monitor,  when subjects may remain 
on IP for up to 32 weeks (please refer to  Appendix  D for guidance).  In this instance, the 
maximum study duration will be [ADDRESS_604890] has discontinued prematurely from the study or withdrawn consent. An early termination visit will be performed for subjects that discontinue prematurely from the study.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion: The primary completion is the date when the last subject is 
assessed or receives an intervention for the collection of the primary endpoint  (i.e., last 
subject Week 20 visit), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the 
study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated.

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
End of Study: The end of study  (EOS)  is when the last subject has completed the EOS  
assessments (i.e., last subject last visit). If th e study concludes prior to the time point 
originally planned in the protocol (i.e., early termination of the study), then the EOS  will 
be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation 
in the study . 
3.6 Study Organization  
The study organization will include an independent DMC, steering committee ( SC), 
clinical events committee (CEC)  and CPET core laboratory . 
An external independent DMC will be established to formally review the accumulating data from this study to ensure t here is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects. 
The independent DMC members will have access to treatment assignments and subject 
level data from the clinical trial database. 
A SC will contribute to trial design, implementation, data analysis, and communication of 
trial results and will consist of experts external to Cytokinetics who are qualified by [CONTACT_471912]. The responsibilities of th e SC are 
described in an S C charter.  
An external independent CEC  blinded to treatment assignment will adjudicate all major 
CV adverse events using standardized definitions, including all- cause death, CV death, 
major cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929], percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]), HF  events and 
stroke.  
An external independent CPET core laboratory blinded to treatment assignment will assess all CPET data and determine the final results to be used for subject eligibility and study endpoints. The CPET core laboratory will also qualify study sites. 
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes l imited information about the potential candidate (e.g., date of 
screening). Before any study -specific activit y/procedure, the appropriate written informed

Pregnancy  
224. Male subject with a female partner of childbearing potential and not willing to 
inform his partner of his participation in this clinical study.  
225. Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or i s planning to become 
pregnant or planning to breastfeed during treatment with investigational product (IP; OM or placebo) or within [ADDRESS_604897] of childbearing potential who does not practice true sexual

2 acceptable methods of effective birth control during treatment with IP (OM 
or placebo) and for an additional [ADDRESS_604898] or her sole male partner has had a surgical contraceptive method 
(bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion or vasectomy with medical assessment of 
surgical success), additional contraceptive methods are not required.  
• A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_471875]. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for

discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before 
study enrollment.  
• Two acceptable methods of effective birth control include the fol lowing 
options:  
− intrauterine device (IUD) and a barrier method with spermicide, IUD and a hormonal birth control method, hormonal birth control method and a barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine hormonal -releasing system 
(IUS) and a barrier method with spermicide,  
− 2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method except a female condom) and the female partner must also use spermicide (a male and female condom may not be used together due to the risk of 
tearing)  
• Hormonal methods of birth control include oral, intravaginal, transdermal, 
injectable, or implantable. Barrier methods of birth control include diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male or female 
condom with spermicide, and contraceptive sponge with spermicide. If 
spermicide is not commercially available in the local country/region a 
barrier method without spermicide is acceptable. 
− Note: If additional medications (including SoC HF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) are given 
during treatment, the investigator is to review the prescribing 
information/summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for all 
concomitant therapy, as they may alter the contraceptive requirements. 
These additional medications may require an increase in the number of 
contraceptive methods and/or length of time that contraception is to be 
utilized after the last dose of protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The 
investigator is to discuss these changes with the study subject. 
Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria on the first screening attempt may be 
rescreened once (a sec ond rescreening is permitted after approval from the Medical 
Monitor and only in the case of disruptions to study conduct due to COVID -19), for the 
study ( Section  7.2.3 ). Rescreen subjects must first be registered as screen failed in the 
interactive web response system (IWRS) and subsequently registered as rescreened. 
Subjects will maintain the originally assigned subject identification number. For 
rescreening, a new ICF must be signed. Rescreened subjects who are re- consented will 
repeat all screening procedures.  
5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedur es, 
Cytokinetics requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/independent 
ethics committee (IRB/IEC)  approval of the protocol, ICF , and all other subject 
Product: Omecamtiv Mecarbil  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
 Date:  30 June 2021  Page 30 of 87 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2). All subjects 
must personally sign and date the ICF before commencement of study -specific 
activities/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator receives all confirmatory 
laboratory and CPET screening data, determines  that the subject has met all eligibility 
criteria , and the subject is randomized in the IWRS. Randomization should occur during 
the Day [ADDRESS_604901]’s 
medical record and in/on the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at

subject identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_8784]. This number will be used to 
identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that sub ject. 
Up to 6 weeks is allowed for screening and subjects can be re -tested if necessary within 
that 6- week timeframe as detailed in Section 7.2.2 . The time between the CPET at the 
pre-randomization visit and/or  randomization will be not more than [ADDRESS_604902] screening may be rescreened once (a second rescreening is permitted after approval f rom the Medical Monitor in the 
case of disruptions to study conduct due to COVID -19), for the study (see Section 7.2.3 ). 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.  
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Subjects who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups , OM or placebo,  in a double- blind manner. Approximately 
270 eligible subjects  (which could increase up to 400 subjects [see Section 10.2])  will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either OM or placebo, respectively.  
Randomization will be stratified based on the RER on the baseline CPET (<  1.15, 
≥ 1.15) and persistent atrial fibrillation (Y/N). The number of patients with persistent  atrial 
fibrillation will be capped at approximately 20%. Subjects can only be randomized once for this study.

5.[ADDRESS_604904]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study. Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
Whenever safe and appropriate, t he investigator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_471915]’s  treatment assignment . Otherwise  they 
must do so within one working day after the event.  
Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual for a description regarding how investigators will access 
treatment information via the IWRS , in the event that there is a need to break the blind.  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
6.[ADDRESS_604905]  
The IPs used in this study are: OM and matching placebo.  
The Pharmacy  Manual, a document external to this protocol, contains detailed 
information regarding the storage, preparation, destruction, and administration of OM and placebo.  
6.[ADDRESS_604906]  
6.2.1  OM and Placebo  
OM and placebo will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_21931]. or designee. OM 
and placebo will be presented as identical tablets. Tablets will be packaged in 14- count 
blisters. Further details regarding IP storage condition, dispensation, packaging, labeling, and accounting procedures are outlined in the Pharmacy  Manual . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
IP will be administered PO  BID (approximately 12 ± 3 hours apart) in the morning and 
evening by [CONTACT_471916]. IP must  be 
swallowed whole (not chewed, crushed, or split) and taken with water as instructed in the Pharmacy  Manual. Each morning and evening administration should be taken at 
approximately the same time of day. If IP cannot be taken or has not been taken within approximately 12 ± [ADDRESS_604907] recent previous dose, the dose should be 
missed and the next dose should be taken at the regular time. On study visit days, the 
time of the dose may be shifted if needed ( see Pharmacy Manual) .

Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
 Date:  [ADDRESS_604908]’s eCRF. 
Subjects randomized to OM will initiate administration at 25 mg BID  in a blinded manner . 
The dose will be adjusted for some subjects based on the OM concentration in predose 
blood samples ( Appendix  B), which will be collected for all subjects. If either the Week  2 
or Week 6 visit plasma OM concentration is missed, subjects randomized to active 
treatment will be maintained/returned to their starting dose (OM 25 mg BID).  
The results will be blinded to investigators. A new IP supply will be provided to all subject s for the purpose of dose adjustment regardless of randomized treatment group 
and outcome of the PK assessment in order to maintain the blind.  
Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo throughout the study and will perform  all protocol procedures in order to maintain the blind for the treatment group 
allocation and IP dose. Subjects should continue to take IP through the morning of the Week [ADDRESS_604909] IP shipped to the patient if permitted locally and approved by [CONTACT_1034].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage Adjustments and Missed Doses  
All subjects will have predose blood samples to assess OM concentration collected at 
Week  [ADDRESS_604910] the PK results of the previous 
adjustment. OM concentration will also be assessed at Week 20, but not as part of the 
PK-based dose adjustment approach (see below) . If there are restrictions related to 
COVID -19, please refer to A ppendix  D for guidance.  
All subjects will discontinue IP after the Week [ADDRESS_604911]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil

CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
in time for the dose adjustment  at Week 8 , subjects randomized to OM will be assigned 
to the lower dosage regimen (25 mg BID).    
In instances where a subject cannot complete the Week [ADDRESS_604912] may continue on IP for up to an additional 12 weeks ( up to  a 
total of 32 weeks on study drug), and only after approval from  the medical monitor . 
Additionally, the investigator should attempt to complete the Week 20 visit with the CPET as close as safely possible to the originally planned date. Only in this case, 
unscheduled visits will be done at 4 -week intervals (i.e. , tempor ally occurring at Weeks 
20, 24, and 28) until the CPET is performed (designated “Week 20 Visit”) to assess vital status, signs and symptoms of ACS, concomitant medications, adverse events, and any interval (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], medication changes) events. These visits may be conducted remotely/via telephone (see Section 7.2.6 ). The IWRS will dispense an 
additional 4 weeks of IP at each visit.  
Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo throughout the study but will 
undergo identical PK and resupply procedures. 
If IP cannot be taken or has not been taken within approximately 12 ±  [ADDRESS_604913] recent previous dose, the dose should be missed and the next dose should be 
taken at the regular time . On study visit days, the time of the dose may be shifted if 
needed (see Pharmacy Manual) . Subjects who have missed multiple doses of IP should 
be encouraged to resume BID dosing at the regular  times, with no extra doses.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rules for Withholding, Restarting and Permanent Discontinuation  
If IP has been discontinued, it may be restarted if the investigator deems it safe and appropriate to do so and the subject and Medical Monitor agree. IP may not  be restarted 
in this study if the subject has experienced:  
• a suspected allergic reaction to IP  
• certain types of hepatotoxicity (see Section 6.3) 
• acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction regardless of relatedness to IP  
• an acute cardiac ischemic event (e .g., unstable angina) suspected to be related 
to IP (as determined after IP has been discontinued and the event has resolved)  
• pregnancy / lactation  
A direct relationship has been observed between the plasma concentrations of OM and 
increases in systolic ejection time, stroke volume, and left ventricular function 
(Cleland  et al, 2011 ; Teerlink et al, 2011 ). Excessive exposure to OM may result in s igns

and symptoms of myocardial ischemia or infarction (e.g., increases in heart rate, 
dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, chest discomfort or pain, ST- segment 
depression/elevation on ECG, and/or elevations in troponin I or T). No antidote to OM 
currently exists. In the event of an overdose, health care providers should be vigilant for signs and symptom s of myocardial ischemia. Standard medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471886].  
If a subject experiences clinical signs or symptoms consistent with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction, the subject should receive immediate medical attention according to the institution’s usual SoC, and the IP administration should be withheld. Serial cardiac ischemic markers and ECGs should be analyzed locally. Results from local laboratory assessment of troponins  (I or T), creatine kinase- MB ( CK-MB), and BNP or 
NT-proBNP should be recorded in the eCRF. A central laboratory PK sample, t roponin I , 
CK-MB, and NT- proBNP should be collected in all subjects experiencing such events as 
close as possible to the event and the time last IP was taken. The results of the PK 
assessment, when present, will routinely remain blinded to investigators, Cytokineti cs, 
and study subjects unless the PK is ≥ 1000 ng/mL (other than at Week  4 or Week  8 
where subjects are automatically downtitrated as described in Appendix  B), in which 
case the investigator  and Cytokinetics will be unblinded and the subject is removed from 
IP. The DMC, however, will receive unblinded PK data . Cytokinetics should be notified of 
suspected acute myocardial ischemia or infarction immediately and no later than [ADDRESS_604914], investigator, and the Medical Monitor . 
• When restarting after ischemic events not suspected to be related to IP, 
subjects initiate OM 25 mg BID or placebo BID, according to initial 
randomized allocation, and will not further titrate the dose.  
• Subjects reinitiating IP after withholding for reasons other than cardiac 
ischemic events will restart OM or placebo, according to initial randomized 
allocation, on the same IP dose as established before the event.

7.2.8  Description of Study Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent  
All subjects must sign and personally date the IRB/IEC approved ICF before any study -
specific procedures are performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Demographic Data  
Demographic data including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to 
study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical History  
The investigator or designee will collect a complete medical and surgical history that started prior to enrollment through the screening visit. Medical history will include 
information on the subject’s concurrent medical conditions  and significant prior 
conditions . Record all findings on the medical history eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
The following measurements must be performed: systolic/diastolic BP, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
heart rate and oxygen saturation. Use of an automated oscillometric device for BP 
measurement is preferred and recommended. BP will be recorded in both of the

Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: [ADDRESS_604936]’s arms unless a concomitant condition favors the use of a particular arm. The 
arm with the higher systolic reading will be used for eligibility determination. The appropriate size cuff should be used. The subject’s pulse should be measured f or 
30 seconds and the number multiplied by 2 to obtain heart rate. Heart rate and BP 
should be measured three times and averaged (mean) to determine eligibility during 
screening. Oxygen saturation will be obtained once at screening and the measurement 
can be repeated  once  if the previous reading is outside of the eligibility range. The 
repeat oxygen saturation  measure should be taken at least [ADDRESS_604937] should be the same that is used throughout the study and documented on the vital signs  eCRF.  
All measurements of vital signs will be entered into the vital signs eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination  
A focused physical examination will be conducted as per SoC. Breast, genital, and rectal 
examinations are not required unless specific evaluation is warranted. Physical examination findings should be recorded on the appropriate e CRF (e.g., medical history, 
adverse event).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Height and Weight  
Height , in centimeters , should be measured without shoes  and at screening only . 
Weight , in kilograms , should be measured without shoes.
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing  
All subjects will undergo CPET with gas -exchange analysis and the methodology will be 
standardized across all participating sites, as described in the CPET m anual. Testing will 
include continuous ECG monitoring by [CONTACT_471921]. Cycle ergometry will be the preferred modality for exercise test ing. For CPET laboratories that do not perform cycle ergometry, 
treadmill exercise testing is an acceptable alternative. Exercise protocols for both modalities will be provided in the CPET manual. Subjects must use the same testing modality for all exercise tests during the study. Whenever possible, CPET should be

administered by [CONTACT_471922][INVESTIGATOR_471893] (including KCCQ, NYHA class, ACS signs and symptoms, vital signs, ECG, blood sa mpling, IP administration). 
Patients naïve to exercise protocols (bicycle, treadmill, and measurement of oxygen consumption) will be familiarized with the technique during screening.  
All CPET testing will be symptom -limited and subjects will be strongly encouraged to 
achieve maximal exertion and a RER ≥ 1.15. The reason(s) for termination of sub-
maximal exercise tests will be documented. A test will be identified as being maximal effort if the RER is ≥  1.15, however subjects will still be eligible for the study as long as 
they achieve an RER ≥  1.05 on the pre -randomization CPET.  
The Week 20 CPET should be performed at approximately the same time of day (e.g., morning, mid- day, afternoon) as the baseline CPET, at a consistent time after the 
last dose of beta blocker and IP. Whenever possible, subjects should perform exercise testing between three and ten hours after taking beta blocking agents.  
If a life -threatening arrhythmia, early ischemia, severe hypotension or other serious 
finding is identified by [CONTACT_471923], the subject will be asked to stop the exercise test, and his/her physicians will be notified of the results. If the subject is performing the pre- randomization test, s/he will not be randomized to the study. Enrolled 
subjects who have a non -life-threatening event or finding that stops the test can resume 
testing when it is safe to do so and after appropriate treatment, per the investigator. 
All study sites must be qualified by [CONTACT_471924]. To qualify, sites will perform an exercise test on two healthy adults and submit them for core laboratory review. Centers may be required to submit additional 
normal exercise tests during the conduct of the study for review by [CONTACT_471925]. Centers may be qualified based on exercise tests recently reviewed by [CONTACT_471926].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram  
Subject must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a rested and calm state for at least  [ADDRESS_604938]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: [ADDRESS_604939] include the following measurements: QRS, 
QT, QTc, RR, and PR intervals, and assessment of cardiac rhythm.  
At each time point at which triplicate ECGs are required (Day 1, Week 2, Week 6, and Week 20 visits), 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2  minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be 
completed in less than 4 minutes. The visits prior to randomization (i.e.,  the sc reening) 
and pre -randomization only require a single replicate ECG. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_471894] . Once signed, 
the original ECG tracing will be retained with the subject’s source documents.  
Further detail about the equipment provided and its use for this study will be provided in an ECG Manual distributed to the sites before start of enrollment.  Digital ECGs will be 
submitted to the Central Core Laboratory for analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Therapy  
For all concomitant medications (see Section 6.4), investigators must document whether 
therapy was being taken at any time point during the study . 
The dosage of concomitant medications will be recorded. If a subject is not taking beta 
blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNi, or MRA, or taking doses below those recommended by [CONTACT_13144], investigators should record the reason  in the eCRF . 
Initiation of nonpharmacological treatments for HF (e.g., implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy ) and coronary revascularization will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Subjects will be asked to complete the KCCQ questionnaire in a quiet place prior to the 
medical consultation and prior to undergoing any tests and procedures to avoid biasing 
their response to the questionnaire. Site staff will be asked to check the questionnaire for 
completeness before the subject leaves the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . If the subject is unable to 
complete a visit in -person due to COVID -19 at Week  8, the KCCQ may be completed 
over the telephone and documented as “assessed by [CONTACT_756]” in the source 
documentation.  At Week  14, the KCCQ will be assessed by [CONTACT_756].

7.3 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention. Biomarker development can be useful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_53391],  guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity. 
Cytokinetics may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to OM.  
Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development at the times indicated in Table [ADDRESS_604945] consents to the optional pharmacogenetic 
portion of this study, DNA analyses may be performed. These optional pharmacogenet ic 
analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44809]. The goals of the optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investiga tion of OM  
and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to OM. No 
additional samples are collected for this part of the study . For subjects who consent to 
this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted. 
7.[ADDRESS_604946] ruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects. This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study. This can also include, 
but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and 
analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that i s assigned to 
the samples for the study. Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.  
Product: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: [ADDRESS_604947], Cytokinetics (or designee) can do 
additional testing on remaining samples (i.e., residual and back -up) to investigate and 
better understand HF, the dose response and/or prediction of response to OM, and 
characterize aspects of the molecule (e.g., mechanism of action/target, metabolites). 
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but  are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study. Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_604948]’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the ICF . 
The subject retains the rig ht to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947]. Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to provide Cytokinetics  with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_352510] . 
Cytokinetics is  the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropr iate (e.g., the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type 
no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]). If a commercial product is developed from this research project, Cytokinetics owns the commercial product. The subject has no 
comme rcial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample. See Section 11.[ADDRESS_604949] confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP 
and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471895]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: [ADDRESS_604950] the option for continuation according to the 
Schedule of Asses sments  (Table 2 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and 
adverse events. Subjects who have discontinued IP  and/or protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471896]. Whenever safe and feasible it is imperative that subjects remain on- study to ensure safety surveillance 
and/or collection of outcome data. The investigator must document the level of follow -up 
that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] . 
Withdrawal of consent for follow -up should be accompanied by [CONTACT_471927]. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -patient 
contact [CONTACT_6492] -up (e.g., medical records checks). Subjects requesting withdrawal should 
be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow -up will jeopardize the public health 
value of the study.  
Subjects who discontinue IP or withdraw  from the study  should be asked explicitly about 
the contribution of possible adverse events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited should be documented.  
The subject will  withdraw consent  in writing . If the subject or the subject’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site will document and sign the reason for the 
subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. The informed consent for the study will note that althoug h a subject is free to leave the study and stop taking study medication, 
the investigators hope the patient will remain available for follow -up status evaluations.  
For subjects who have withdrawn consent for further follow -up, investigators will 
review public records as permitted by [CONTACT_471928].  
8.2 Investigator or Cytokinetics Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or Cytokinetics  can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from IP and/or 
other protocol  required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures, or the study as a whole at any 
time prior to study completion.

9.[ADDRESS_604952]’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition. 
Worsening indicates that the pre -existin g medical condition or underlying disease 
(e.g.,  diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected. A pre- existi ng condition that has not worsened more than

anticipated (i.e., more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an 
intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event . 
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be  
removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative,  requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884], refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_604953] one of the 
following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (e.g., overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix A  for 
DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_471929] , 
or [ADDRESS_604954] administration of IP, whichever is later, are recorded in the  
Adverse Event eCRF. Adverse events considered related to study procedures 
(e.g.,  Week -2 CPET) and /or serious adverse events that occur during the screening 
period ( after signing of the ICF  until randomization) are also reported.  Serious adverse 
events are also reported on an SAE Report Form, per Section [IP_ADDRESS]  below.  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• Severity (and/or toxicity per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0),  
• Assessment of relatedness to IP or study procedure,  
• Action taken with the IP.  
It is not acceptable for the investigator to submit  photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records in lieu of completion of an SAE Report Form or Adverse Event eCRF page. If 
specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the medical 
records. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will 
be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_471897] e mail or 
facsimile number as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  below.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs,  
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious  adverse 
event.  
The adverse event grading scale used in this study is  CTCAE , described in Appendix A. 
Because severity (i.e. , the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale)  differs from the 
regulatory criteria for serious adverse events, if adverse events correspond to a grade [ADDRESS_604955]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: 30 June 2021  Page 60 of 87 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
“life-threatening” CTCAE grading scale criteria (e.g. , laboratory abnormality reported as 
grade 4 without manifestation of life- threatening status), it will be left to the investigator’s 
judgment to report the abnormalities as serious adverse events. For any adverse event 
that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the event’s severity status must be recorded in the subject’s medical record. The investigator must assess whether 
the adverse event is possibly related to IP. This re lationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization,  
reversibility , or return to baseline. 
For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigator must document in the 
medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse event and 
has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the  
investigator has minimal information to include on the initial SAE Report  Form, as per 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . However, it is  very important that the investigator always make an 
assessment of causality for  every event when reporting  the serious adverse event data . 
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_17963], in light of follow -up information 
received, and send a follow -up SAE R eport Form with the updated causality 
assessment. 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporti ng requirements.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_471930]  /safety follow -up visit, or [ADDRESS_604956] administration of IP, 
whichever is later,  are reported immediately (no later than  24 hours) following the 
investigator’s knowledge. 
The investigator must update the eCRF page as appropriate.  
All seriou s adverse events must be reported on an SAE Report Formvia one of the 
following contact [CONTACT_41528]:  
Email:  [EMAIL_9063]  
Facsimile:  +1 (650) 745- [ADDRESS_604957] via SAE email or facsimile 
(as per above) immediately and no later  than 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -
required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based on relationship to IP. 
If the EDC system is unavailable to the site staff and an SAE Report form has been sent 
to Cytokinetics, the site will enter the serious event dat a into the  eCRF as soon as it 
becomes available.  The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is 
possibly related to any study -mandated activity or procedure. This relationship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure?” 
The investigator is expected to follow all reported serious adverse events until 
stabilization , reversibility , or return to baseline.

To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_352510] (or designee) before submission to regulatory 
authorities. Investigators will receive blinded notification of related serious adverse 
events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
Cytokinetics (or designee) will report safety issues and suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as required to regulatory authorities and IECs. Cytokinetics (or designee) will report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to investigators/institutions, and IRBs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice  
(GCP) . 
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Cytokinetics  or designee, in 
accordance with local procedures and statutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental  
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by

serious adverse event as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the investigator will provide a copy of any post -mortem  findings including histopathology, 
if available , to Cytokinetics upon request . 
New information relating  to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
reported to Cytokinetics  immediately and no later than  24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the new information (as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The 
investigator may be asked to provide additional follow up information, which may include a discharge summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about

9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of  Pregnancy Information  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becom es 
pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_604960] be submitted to Cytokinetics immediately and no 
later than 24 hours following the investigator’s learning of a subject’s pregnancy. (Note: 
Sites are not required to provide any information on the Initial Pregnancy Mother Authorization and Questionnaire that violates the country or region’ s loca l privacy laws).  
The Initial Pregnancy Mother Authorization and Questionnaire and any additional source 
documents must be submitted using the instructions for SAE report submission/ contact 
[CONTACT_35659] [IP_ADDRESS] . 
After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy  and 
infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who becomes pregnant while taking protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 5 days after the end 
of treatment with IP. This information will be forwarded to Cytokinetics. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth of the child (if applicable).  
Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to Cytokinetics immediately and no later than 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event, regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or developmental delay on an infant, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. Note that an elective termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation or maternal complication is generally not considered an adverse event, but still must be reported to Cytokinetics .

If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (e.g., female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event. 
Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to the IP by [CONTACT_471932] , and no later than 24 hours , following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event  on an SAE Report Form,  as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . While 
the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study subjects, 
he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating  in the study  will 
discontinue IP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant or Were 
Pregnant at the Time of Enrollment  
In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional [ADDRESS_604961] may continue receiving treatment; however, he must use barrier method (i.e., condom) during sexual intercourse to avoid further fetal exposure. After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_246532]. The information will be recorded on the Initial Pregnancy Mother Authorization and Questionnaire. The worksheet must be submitted to Cytokinetics immediately and no later than 24 hours following  the site’s awareness of the pregnancy.

• Change from baseline in the KCCQ Total Symptom Score and its sub- domains 
from baseline to Week  20 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Endpoint  
• Subject incidence of reported adverse events and serious adverse events.  
Major adverse CV events will be adjudicated by a CEC, including: all -cause 
death, CV death, major cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929], percutaneous coronary intervention and 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]), HF events and stroke.  
10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analysis Set  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all 
randomized subjects  who receive at least one dose of randomized IP , by [CONTACT_321169]. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment 
group assignment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set  
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set (SAS), which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of IP on study. Unless otherwise 
specified, for safety analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized 
treatment group assignment with the following exception: if a subject receives treatment 
throughout the study that is different than the randomized treatment  group assignment, 
then the subject will be grouped by [CONTACT_69860].  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
Baseline covariates include the randomization stratification factor s of the RER on the 
baseline CPET (<1.15, ≥1.15) and persistent atrial fibrillation (Y/N)  as well as age, sex, 
and hemoglobin level  and any additional factors as described in the statistical analysis 
plan ( SAP), which have the potential to impact pVO 2 measures . 
Prespecified subgroups for the analysis include, but are not limited to:  
• stratification factor RER on baseline CPET (<1.15, ≥1.15)  
• stratification factor persistent atrial fibrillation (Y/N)  
• age (<  65 years, ≥  65 years)

• Change in heart rate (resting to peak) on baseline CPET (≤ median, > median)  
The final list of prespecified subgroups for the analysis will be detailed in the SAP. 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Assuming a difference in change from baseline of pVO 2 of 1.0 mL/kg/min for OM versus 
placebo, an SD of 2.5 mL/kg/min for OM subjects  and 2.0 mL/kg/min ( Lewis, 2017) for 
placebo, and 15% of subjects missing change from baseline data, 270 subjects 
(approximately 180 randomized to OM and 90 randomized to placebo) provides 90% 
power to detect the  difference in pVO 2 change from baseline to Week 20 with a 2 -sided 
type I error of 0.05.  Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 
OM or placebo, respectively. The 2:1 ratio was selected based on the expected difference in SD between the placebo and active arms, because the SD in the change in pVO
2 increases as the exercise capacity increases ( Ismail, 2013). Randomization will be 
stratified based on the RER on the baseline CPET (<1.15, ≥1.15) and persistent atrial fibrillation at screening (Y/N). The number of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation at 
screening will be capped at approximately 20%. A treatment difference in pVO
2 of 
1.0 mL/kg/min is considered clinically meaningful ( Lewis, 2016; Tucker, 2018; 
Kitzman,  2011).  
During the study, Cytokinetics  will periodically assess in a blinded fashion the aggregate 
pooled missing data rate and overall pooled SD for the change from baseline in pVO [ADDRESS_604964] from COVID -19 on the 
assessment of the primary endpoint, for example if 20% of randomized subjects ar e 
missing change in pVO 2 at Week 20, >10% of subjects completed the Week  20 CPET 
beyond the initially planned Week  20 window as a result of COVID -19, or the overall 
pooled SD is >  2.5 mL/kg/min,  then the sponsor may consider increasing the sample

The maximum number of randomized subjects will be 400.  
10.[ADDRESS_604965] access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded. Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded except as specified (e.g., S ection 5.2 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Interi m Analyses  
This study is running concurrently to Study 20110203 (GALACTIC -HF), an international, 
phase 3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of OM on mortality and 
morbidity in subjects with chronic HFrEF . If Study  20110203 completes  (last patient last 
visit) or interim results become available (i.e., planned interim analyses yield new 
information) prior to the completion of this study, the sponsor may instruct the 
Independent Statistical contract research organization ( CRO)  to perform a single interim 
analysis for review by [CONTACT_471933]/benefit profile for 
subjects . At this interim assessment, the DMC may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_471898] a two- sided p-value is ≤  alpha of 0.0001 following the H aybittle -Peto 
approach (Haybittle  et al, 1971; Peto et al, 1976 ). The DMC may also recommend to 
stop the study due to futility if the conditional power is <  0.10. The DMC is to make a 
recommendation to stop or continue the study using their collective judgment and the totality of evidence available.  
The ECG data in this study are being collected to evaluate the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on the QT interval. In the event this study is not yet complete at the time Study  [ADDRESS_604966]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)

Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including the number of observations (n), mean, SD  or standard error, median, the first quartile and 
third quartile, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percent of subjects.  
All deaths, HF events, major cardiac ischemic adverse events (myocardial infarction, 
unstable angina hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and coronary revascularization), and strokes will be 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_471934], using standardized definitions  in a blinded manner . The

CEC is external to  Cytokinetics  and primarily comprises both academic clinical 
physicians (to include cardiologists) and medical reviewers trained on the clinical trial 
protocol, the CEC charter, and CEC processes. The chairman of the CEC is responsible for overseeing the operations in conformance with the CEC charter and for supervising the flow of data between the sponsor/data management and the CEC. Committee 
members are qualified in the appropriate subspecialty and free of conflict of interest. The 
CEC is blinded to treatment allocation and reviews events according to prespecified 
criteria defined in the CEC charter.  
An HF event is defined as presentation of the patient for an urgent, unscheduled clinic/office/ emerg ency department  visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], with a primary diagnosis 
of HF, where the patient exhibits new or worsening symptoms of HF on presentation, has objective evidence of new or worsening HF, and receives initiation or intensification of treatment  specifically for HF ( Hicks et al, 2015 ). Changes to oral diuretic therapy do 
not qualify as initiation or intensification of treatment.  
10.5.2  Multiplicity Adjustments 
The null hypothesis for the primary and secondary efficacy variables in the FAS will be tested  in the following pre- specified order using a closed testing procedure. This 
procedure will maintain the family -wise error rate at 5% for all hypotheses tested in a 
confirmatory sense.  
Step 1.  The null hypothesis that there is no treatment difference betw een OM and 
placebo in the primary efficacy variable in the FAS will be tested at the 5% significance level. If this hypothesis is rejected, testing will proceed to Step 2; otherwise stop.  
Step 2.  The null hypothesis of no treatment difference between OM  and placebo in the 
secondary endpoint of change in total workload  during CPET from baseline to Week  20 
in the FAS will be tested at the 5% significance level. If this hypothesis is rejected, testing will proceed to Step 3; otherwise stop.  
Step 3.  The null hypothesis of no treatment difference between OM  and placebo in the 
secondary endpoint of change in ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO
2 slope)  during CPET 
from baseline to Week 20 in the FAS will be tested at the 5% significance level. If this 
hypothesis is rejected, testing will proceed to Step 4; otherwise stop.  
Step 4.  The null hypothesis of no treatment difference between OM  and placebo in the 
secondary endpoint of change in the average daily activity units measured over a two-

significance level.  
10.5.[ADDRESS_604968] the null hypothesis that there is no treatment difference in the change from 
baseline in pVO 2 at Week 20 between patients in the FAS randomized to placebo and 
those randomized to OM  during the placebo -controlled double- blind treatment. The 
primary analysis will be performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model  
which will include terms of treatment, baseline pVO 2, baseline RER randomization strata 
(<1.15, ≥1.15), persistent atrial fibrillation (Y/N), age, sex , and baseline hemoglobin 
level.  Least square mean difference between the two treatment groups and standard 
errors will be provided. Hypothetically, the OM treatment arm may have fewer 
intercurrent events of death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471899], based on the intended mechanism of action of OM, and these events may preclude CPET at Week 
20. Other intercurrent events such as other CV adverse events and non -CV adverse 
events (e.g., orthopedic injury  , COVID -19 symptoms ) that could preclude a CPET test 
might not be related to OM and in this case the missing data due to these events are 
likely to be missing at random.  The distribution of missing CPET data at Week [ADDRESS_604969]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)

measure on treatment during the placebo- controlled double- blind treatment. The 
supportive analysis will use the same ANCOVA model as the primary analysis described above.  
As a sensitivity  analysi s for the primary analysis , the ANCOVA model will be repeated 
with missing data imputed as if the OM subjects were in the placebo arm.  
10.5.4  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The analysis method for secondary CPET efficacy endpoints will be the same for the 
primary e fficacy endpoint. The non- CPET secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a 
repeated measures mixed model with terms such as treatment, baseline values, visit, 
RER randomization strata (<1.15, ≥1.15), and persistent atrial fibrillation (Y/N)  as well as 
interaction terms of treatment -by-visit and baseline- by-visit with an unstructured 
covariance matrix. The exploratory change from baseline endpoints will also be analyzed using the same method as secondary efficacy endpoints. The models and terms will be desc ribed in the SAP before database lock.  
The correlation between CPET efficacy endpoints and non -CPET efficacy endpoints will 
be examined regardless of treatment groups and by [CONTACT_1570]. The Spearman 
correlation coefficients, p -values, and 95% confidence intervals will be provided.

Product: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: [ADDRESS_604976], inspecting the various records of the clinical study (e.g., e CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
Cytokinetics  is responsible for verifying the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of 
the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The 
Cytokinetics  representative is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the e CRFs. Should the site be 
unable to accommodate in- person source document review as a result of COVID -19, 
Cytokinetics may employ remote document verification tools should this be allowed by 
[CONTACT_779], is in compliance with Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board regulations,  
and consented to by [CONTACT_423]. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by [CONTACT_471937] ’ Quality Assurance function  (or 
designees). Inspection of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, protocol -required therapy 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study  related records will occur to evaluate 
the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable re gulatory 
requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the eCRFs must be maintained 
and readily available.  
• Updates to eCRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s audit trail. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Cytokinetics (or 
designee). During this review, subject data are checked for consistency, 
omissions,  and any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data are reviewed for 
adherence to the protocol and GCP. To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resol ution and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_471938] a Cytokinetics (or designee) reviewer.  
• The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments 
Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of drug -induced liver injury ( DILI), cases 
of concurrent aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
total bilirubin (TBL) and/or international normalized ratio (INR) elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3 require the following:  
• The event is to  be reported to Cytokinetics as a serious adverse event within 
24 hours of discovery or notification of the event (i.e., before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded) 
• The Adverse Event eCRF that captures information necessary to facilitat e the 
evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to  be completed and sent to 
Cytokinetics. 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.2 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom IP(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are withheld (either 
permanentl y or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Sections  6.3.[ADDRESS_604986] or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_604987] 
and a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s 
baseline levels. Assessments that are to  be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within [ADDRESS_604988]: Omecamtiv Mecarbil)  
Cytokinetics Protocol Number: CY 1031  
Date: 30 June 2021  Page 83 of 87 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, bilirubin (total and 
direct), and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities 
improve 
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the IP(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been discontinued AND the 
subject is asymptomatic.  
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or 
elevated TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
• Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain creatine phosphokinase, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood smear  
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for PK analysis if this has not already been 
collected 
• Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with 
an hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all 
laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal. The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all IP(s) and 
protocol -require d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications, and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding e CRFs.

communicated with the sponsor (e.g. , “Week 6 PK lab draw not completed due to site 
closure as a result of COVID -19 pandemic”). The following adjustments to the visits and 
schedule are only permitted in the setting of COVID19: 
• Screening and Randomization  
− Subjects that have undergone screening, but have yet to be randomized, will  
be screen -failed if COVID- [ADDRESS_604993] screening visit will be permitted (see 
Section 7.2.3 ). 
− Subjects having undergone randomization should continue on study, with 
primary focus being the maintenance of subject safety and with reasonable 
attempts to maintain study visits per protocol.  
− Study Assessments:  If, as a result of COVID -19, onsite visits need to be 
converted to telephone or virtual visits, some study procedures will be missed 
(for example sample collection or ECG). Please contact [CONTACT_7195], to discuss prior to upcoming study visits. In some instances, it may be 
possible to conduct the visit and/or study procedures (e.g. , blood draw, ECG, 
vital signs) in the subject’s home.  
• Visit-specific guidance:  
− Week 2:  Subjects unable to complete the W eek 2 OM plasma concentration 
blood draw will automatically continue with their initial dose and forgo dose 
adjustment (i.e. , remain on OM 25 mg BID or placebo).  
− Week 6:  Subjects unable to complete the Week 6 OM plasma concentration 
blood draw will automatically revert, irrespective of whether the dose was 
uptitrated at Week 4, back to the starting dose per IWRS (i.e. , OM 25mg BID 
or placebo).  
− Week 4 & Week 8:  These visits can be conducted as telephone visits per the 
Schedule of Assessments (see Table 2 ) if allowed by [CONTACT_779]’s institution.  
− Week 12, Week 14 & Week 18:  These visits are telephone visits. No 
modifications should be needed. 
− Week 20:  The CPET can be conducted within an additional +[ADDRESS_604994] remains on IP according to the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 2). In the setting of COVID -19 and only with 
approval from the medical monitor , additional IP will be supplied in 4 week

− Week 24:  This visit can be conducted as a telephone visit if necessary. It 
should occur 4 weeks after the Week 20 visit (CPET) has been completed.  
‒ Unscheduled Visits : In instances where a subject cannot complete the 
Week 20 CPET as planned due to COVID- 19, those subjects may continue 
on IP until the visit can be completed for up to an additional 12 weeks (total 
of up to 32 weeks on IP), and only after approval from the medical monitor. 
Additionally, the investigator should attempt to complete the Week 20 visit with the CPET as close as safely possible to the originally planned date. An 
Unscheduled Visit is required every 4 weeks during this period. This may be 
completed via telephone and should include at minimum a review for adverse 
events/serious adverse events, documentation of concomi tant therapy, and 
evaluation for ACS signs and symptoms

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Study purpose  To assess the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A -DP in the treatment of glabellar 
lines in comparison with placebo, including efficacy after repeat treatments 
and long term safety.  
Primary Objective  To assess the efficacy of BoNT/A -DP in reducing the severity of glabellar  frown 
lines  following treatment (compared with placebo) based on investigator  and 
subject  assessment  at week 4 (of the first treatment cycle) . 
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To assess the proportion of responders at maximum frown  and at rest at 
vario us time points after each treatment, based on investigator  and subject  
assessments . 
2. To assess the psychological impact of BoNT/A -DP treatment on subject s (in 
terms of emotional  and social functioning  and concerns relating to their 
glabellar lines ) in comparison with placebo after a single treatment.  
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135245] (at maximum frown ) 
after a single treatment with BoNT/A -DP compared with placebo (first 
treatment cycle) , based on investigator  and subject  assessment s. 
4. To provide long term safety data of BoNT/A -DP based on multiple 
treatment cycles  and to establish a sufficient safety database to support 
regulatory approval.  
5. To assess subject  perceptions of effect of, and satisfaction with, treatment 
in comparis on with placebo (first treatment cycle), and during the open -label 
extension phase.  
STUDY DESIGN  
Study Type/  
Classification/ Discipline  Efficacy and safety  
Control Type  Concurrent (placebo)  
Study Indication Type  Treatment  
Intervention model  Parallel for first cycle, followed by [CONTACT_590272]/Masking  Double blind for first cycle, followed by [CONTACT_590273] a parallel -group, randomized, double blind , placebo -controlled 
study followed by [CONTACT_338967].   
An interim Analysis will be performed when all subjects finalized the re-
evaluation for retreatment visit at week [ADDRESS_1135246] treatment cycle or 
completed the double blind phase (whichever occurs earlier) .  
The first treatment cycle o f the study will comprise two treatment groups as 
follows:  
 Group A (active): BoNT/A -DP (20 units, 0.5 m L) 
 Group B (placebo control): sterile, 0.9% sodium chloride, (0.5 m L). 
Eligible subject s will be randomized at baseline  (day 0) to Group A or B to 
receive the first treatment in a 3:[ADDRESS_1135247] treatment cycle.  
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135248] treatment (BoNT/A -DP or placebo) and attend for visits at 1, 2 and 4 
weeks after treatment and at 4 weekly intervals thereafter for evaluation of 
efficacy and safety (primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints are 
evaluated in the first treatment cycle in comparison with placebo).   
The first treatment cycle will last at least [ADDRESS_1135249] s qualify for re -treatment (in accordance with the "eligibility fo r re-
treatment criteria"). After the first treatment cycle is completed, all subject s 
may enter the open label extension phase  and will be dosed with BoNT/A -DP 
(20 U) for subsequent re -treatments.   
Evaluation for re -treatment takes place at the earliest a t [ADDRESS_1135250]/previous treatment. Subjects who do not qualify for re -treatment at 
week  [ADDRESS_1135251] the option (pending eligibility) of re -treatment at a later 
visit (at 4 weekly intervals thereafter) until they are eligible for re -treatment  
or until a total of [ADDRESS_1135252].  According to the study schedule ( Section 2.1 and Section 
2.2), a maxim um of [ADDRESS_1135253]  (4 treatment cycles) is permitted 
during the study time frame, with treatments separated by a minimum of [ADDRESS_1135254] 's qualification for re -treatment ; however, the last opportunity for re -
treatment is at week 48. 
Planned Duration of  
Subject Participation  Participation is anticipated to last up to [ADDRESS_1135255] s among BoNT/A -DP and 
placebo groups with a Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvement  of ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown ) at week 4 visit 
(of the first treatment cycle) relative to baseline  (responders ), based on both  
the investigator s’ and the subject s’ in-clinic assessments . Thus, the primary 
endpoint is a composite endpoint comprising investigator  and subject  
assessments of treatment effectiveness.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sample Size Calculation  Primary Analysis:  
The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint comprising investigators  and 
subject ’s assessments of treatment effectiveness using the FWS.  Composite 
endpoint treatment success (CETS) is defined as  a ≥[ADDRESS_1135266]  is a CETS “ Responder” only if both investigator - and subject -rated 
success criteria are satisfied at the week 4 visit after baseline .  
The primary analysis of efficacy is the proportion of responders in the 
BoNT/A -DP treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group. 
For superiority testing of BoNT/A -DP compared with placebo, the following 
assumptions for the sample size calculation will be used:

Software   The sample size calculation was 
performed using the software nQuery 
Advisor® [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
Based on these assumptions, [ADDRESS_1135268] s in the BoNT/A -DP arm and [ADDRESS_1135269] s in total. This is a very 
small sample size and not sufficient for a detailed evaluation of the data, 
including subgroup analyses. Furthermore, the response rate could not be 
estimated with sufficient precision. Assuming a response rate of 46% in the 
BoNT/ A-DG group, a  two-sided confidence interval (CI) of 95% with  a distance 
from the response rate to the CI limit s of about 5.6% could be achieved with 
a sample size of [ADDRESS_1135270] s in the BoNT/A -DP group. We propose a 3:1 
randomization of BoNT/A -DP (225 subje cts) to placebo ( [ADDRESS_1135271] s), which 
we believe is adequate for a precise estimate of response rate and for post -
hoc sensitivity analyses (i.e. treatment -by-center and other subgroup 
analyses), also taking into account a drop -out rate.  
In addition sample s ize is justified in order to fulfill FDA request for additional 
subjects treated with BoNT/A -DP to provide an adequate Safety database.  
In total, [ADDRESS_1135272] s will be enrolled . Applying a 15% drop out rate would 
result in a total number of completing subject s of about 300. 
Analysis Data Sets  Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  
All subject s who received at least one injection with study medication 
(independent of whether it is BoNT/A -DP or placebo) will be valid for the SAF. 
Within the SAF a subject  will be considered for the treatment actually 
received and not for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_17628], if different. 
The SAF will be used for the evaluation of the safety assessments.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135273] will be 
considered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_590279], if different, i.e.  following the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
principle. The FAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy assessments. 
The FAS serves as the primary efficacy analysis set.  
Modified Full Analysis Set ( MFAS):  
The MFAS includes all randomized subject s who received at least one 
injection with study medication who had a baseline  visit [ADDRESS_1135274]  will be considered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_819616], if different, i.e . following the intent -
to-treat (ITT) principle. The MFAS will be used for the evaluation of the 
efficacy assessments.  
Per-protocol Analysis Set (PP):  
The PP includes all randomized subject s who received at least one injection 
with study med ication who had no significant protocol deviations and an in -
clinic assessment with  the FWS by [CONTACT_819617]  
(day 0) and at the  week [ADDRESS_1135275] s in corresponding 
categories.  
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765].  
For responder analyses on the week 4 and week 12 visits, missing  in-clinic

For patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments, missing data will be 
imputed per developer guidelines, where these are available.  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_29974] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) ( using current version of Medical 
Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities  [MedDRA ]). The number of events, as well 
as the number and rate of affected subject s, will be reported. TEAEs (SOC and 
PT) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_12917], severity, relationship to study 
medication, and relationship to procedure.  
TEAEs will be separately analyzed as events observed on or after first 
treatment up to before the open label extension (first cycle), and events 
starting on or after re -treatment until end of study (open label phase). Events 
in subject s who star ted the first treatment with placebo but then entered the 
open label extension for re -treatment with BoNT/A -DP, will be considered to 
placebo for the first cycle and to BoNT/A -DP for the open label phase.  
Further aspects of statistical analyses will be de tailed within a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Planned Statistical 
Analysis  Primary Analysis:  
The proportion of subject s (responders ) meeting the primary endpoint  with 
a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS (at maximum 
frown ) at visit week [ADDRESS_1135277] (with stratification variable site) using a significance level ( ) of  
0.025. The hypothesis to  be tested is:  
 H0: pBoNT/A -DP≤ p Placebo  
 H1: pBoNT/A -DP>pPlacebo  
The FAS will serve as the primary analysis set.  
Subjects with missing  investigator s’ or subject s’ in-clinic assessments with the  
FWS at baseline  or week 4 visits  will be assigned as being non -responder s. 
Additional Analyses on the Primary Endpoint Variable:  
Further analyses on the primary endpoint variable are exploratory.  
A one -sided Pearson  2-test will be applied .

Two -sided CI of 95% for the responder rates in the BoNT/A -DP and the 
placebo treatment groups will be calculated using Wilson scores. Treatment -
by-center  interaction will be tested using the Breslow -Day test for 
homogeneity of the odds ratios.  The CIs will also be calculated for the 
additional  analyses as listed in the following : 
 The primary endpoint measure using the observed values only, 
i.e. missing  investigator  or the subject  in-clinic assessments with the  
FWS at baseline  or week 4 visit will be excluded from analysis , but 
not assigned as being non -responder . 
 The primary endpoint measure using the MFAS and PP. 
 The primary endpoint measure applying the LOCF for week 4 
visit.  
 Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725] , country and geographic region (US versus 
EU) 
o Subgroup analyses will be  conducted for site s, country and 
geographic region (US versus EU) . Sites with less than 3 
placebo subjects will be combined. The 2-test will be 
applied for each subgroup. In case of a total number of 
observations below 30, or in case of at least one cell  
frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead 
of the 2-test. Stratified analyses  applying the Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test will also be conducted  using factor 
geographic region . 
 Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_819618] t oxin 
versus naïve subjects . 
o Subgroup analyses w ill be c onducted for subjects with 
treatmen t with any serotype of botulinum toxin for any 
indication versus naïve subjects. The 2-test or Fisher’ s 
exact test (see above corresponding criteria t o use Fis her) 
will be applied for each subgroup. No stratified analysis 
using factor pre -treated/ naïve subjects  is currently 
planned.

multiplicity control based on the FAS population. The results of each test 
result will only be considered confirmative, if the previous test in the order 
showed a confirmatory result at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. If the 
one-sided p -value is larger than 0.025 for any of the tests, the results of the 
subsequent tests will only be considered exploratory, and not confirmatory. 
The application of this hierarchical approach keeps the global significance 
level to 0.025 one -sided and  requires no further adjustment of the 
significance level.  
The following order of tests will be defined:  
 Primary endpoint (composite endpoint)  
 Key secondary endpoint  1 
1.1 The modified Skindex -16 (GL -QoL) Emotional domain  
1.2 The modified Skindex -16 (GL-QoL) Social Functioning 
domain  
1.3 The modified Skindex -16 (GL -QoL) Overall score  
1.4 The FACE -Q Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale  
1.5 The FACE -Q Age Appraisal VAS score  
The same analyses, inclusive the additional exploratory analyses, as descr ibed 
for the primary endpoint , will be conducted.  Subgroup analysis for the key 
secondary endpoint will be conducted by [CONTACT_3725] , country , geographic region (US

subjects . 
Additional Secondary Analyses:  
The additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed applying the 
appropriate statistical method for the comparison of both treatment arms. 
For proportions, t he Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test (with stratification 
variable site) as  well as the  2-test will be applied. In case of a total number 
of observations below 30, or in case of at least one cell frequency below 5, 
Fisher’s exact test will be used instead of the 2-test. The modified Skindex -
16 (GL-QoL) and FACE -Q scale s will be analyzed according to the foreseen 
analysis approach of these tools.  
Beside s the FAS population for the analysis with multiplicity control, the 
analyses of these endpoints will also  be based on the MFAS and the PP 
population. For all analyses, a o ne-sided significance level of 0.025 will be 
used , if not stated otherwise .

Lewis and Bowler (2009)[ADDRESS_1135298] BoNT/A- DP 
CROMA Pharma GmbH's botulinum toxin BoNT/A-DP is a 900 kDa  multimeric complex, which is 
composed of a 150 kDa neurotoxin , a 130  kDa non -toxic non- haemag glutinating protein and various 
haemagglutinins ranging between 17 and 48  kDa in size.  The IMP is the Clostridium botulinum toxin 
type A purified from anaerobic culture of C. botulinum type A CBFC 26 strain. The genomic DNA 
sequence encoding the toxin in strain CBFC26 is identica l to that for the Hall strain A ATCC 3502. 
CROMA Pharma  GmbH ’s BoNT/A is supplied as a freeze -dried powder that is reconstituted with 
sterile diluent (preservative -free saline) prior to injection. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_31625] (BoNT/A -DP) 
are human serum album in and sodium chloride ( Table 4-1 ). Human serum albumin is used as a 
stabilizing agent and sodium chloride is added to provide isotonicity of the formulation. The labeled 
potency is 50 units (U)/vial, where one unit corresponds to the median intraperitoneal lethal dose 
(LD 50) when the reconstituted product is injected intraperitoneally into female Swiss-Webster mice 
under defined conditions29.  
Reconstitution with 1.25 mL sterile diluent (0.9% saline) is performed prior to i.m. injection, to 
obtain a solution of 4 U/0.1 mL.

Pharma GmbH’s BoNT/A- DP, and thus local and systemic toxicity following long-term treatment has 
not been evaluated for the IMP. 
Reproductive toxicity was investigated in an embryo-foetal development toxicity study in the SD rat 
model, where animals were dosed at 1 to 8 U/kg for 12 days. Clinical signs included paralytic gait in 
all treatment groups, which is considered to be due to exaggerated pharmacologic effects of 
BoNT/A- DP. The NOAEL was less than 1 U/Kg. 
A repeated dose toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted (Study No. 167857 ). The 
purpose of this study was to obtain information on the toxicity of BoNT -A DP  in rats after 
repeated intramuscular administ ration over a period of six months.  Rats initially received doses of 
0, 0.67, 2.0 and 6.0  U/kg (first application). Since animals did not show any signs of paralysis after 
the first administration, dose levels were increased from the second administration onwards to 
3.75, 7.5, and 15  U/kg, respectively.  At the end of the study n eurotoxic action of BoNT/A- DP 50U 
was demonstrated by [CONTACT_4659] (altered locomotion) occurring at all dose levels and 
atrophy of the injected muscle. This was confirmed histo pathologically by [CONTACT_819621]. Moreover, fatty infiltration was also seen at all dose groups. 
Often, there was an inflammatory infiltrate at the injection sites and a  minor fibrosis. At the end 
of the 6 -months treatm ent-free recovery period in absence of inflammation and fibrosis a partial 
recovery was seen in fiber number and diameter and fatty infiltration at the dose level of 
0.67/3.75 U/kg body weight once monthly. 
At a dose level of 6/15 U/kg body weight BoNT/A-DP 50U showed a clear effect on body weight 
development in both genders. Body weights were significantly lower than controls throughout the 
treatment period and not completely reversible in the recovery period. This coincided with lower 
food consumption during the treatment but not recovery period and was not associated with any 
clinical symptoms or other signs of systemic toxicity. Thus, this effect is considered secondary to 
the local effects described above preventing normal movement of the animal.  
A target organ other than the injected quadriceps muscle was not identified. Based on the results 
of this study that affect the skeletal muscle focally only, and considering the relatively small 
diameter and lengths of the muscle in rats compared to larger species and human, the high 
frequency of injections and the absence of further findings, the systemic NOAEL was established 
at 15 U/kg body weight BoNT/A-DP, when administered once monthly over [ADDRESS_1135299] pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic studies were performed with CROMA Pharma 
GmbH ’s BoNT/A- DP, since the chemical nature of the drug is a protein and the expected 
consequence of metabolism of proteins is the degradation to small peptides and individual amino 
acids.

4.4.2 Clinical Summary 
To date, the clinical development of BoNT/A- DP, including clinical two Phase 3 studies (BLESS I and 
BLESS II) have been performed in the US and Europe by [CONTACT_1034].  
The multicenter Phase [ADDRESS_1135300] part of the studies were a 
randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase which aim ed to demonstrate efficacy and 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page 36 of 141

safety of BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo. The second part was an open label extension phase 
to evaluate efficacy after repeat treatments and long term safety. Each product was administered 
at a dose of 20 U (0.5 mL). 
The primary efficacy endpoint of these studies was the proportion of subjects among BoNT/A- DP 
and placebo groups with a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥2 points in FWS score (at 
maximum frown) at the week 4 visit (of the first treatment cycle) relative to baseline (responders), 
based on both the investigator’s and the subject’s in -clinic assessments. Thus, the primary endpoint 
is a composite endpoint comprising investigator and subject assessments of treatment 
effectiveness. 
In addition Phase 3 and Phase 4 trials, has been performed in Korea using the IMP name “Botulax”. 
The Sponsor is currently using the name [CONTACT_322578]/A-DP for clinical development. 
In clinical trials to date, more than 1,[ADDRESS_1135301] been exposed to BoNT/A-DP for cosmetic 
and other indications, with doses ranging from [ADDRESS_1135302] stroke upper limb spasticity ( Table 4-2 ). A brief summary of the results is provided below, 
for further details please refer to the IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3: BLESS I: Indication; Glabellar Lines 
A total of 708 subjects were randomized; 531 subjects were allocated to BoNT/A-DP and 177 
subjects to placebo. The double-blind phase was completed by 500 (94.2%) and 160 (94.4%) 
subjects in the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups, respectively; and the study was completed by 456 
(85.9%) and 145 (81.9%) subjects, respectively.  
The composite responder rate (reduction in FWS of ≥ 2 points and FWS score of 0 or 1 at maximum 
frown) at Week 4 from baseline was 46.5% for the BoNT/A-DP group and 0.0% for the placebo 
group; the difference in responder rates between the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups was 46.50% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.78, 50.76) (p < 0.001, CMH test) in favor of BoNT/A-DP (FAS); thus 
this study confirmed the superior efficacy of BoNT/A-DP compared to placebo in the treatment of 
glabellar lines. Findings were robust. The results for the Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS) and Per 
Protocol Set (PPS) are consistent with the FAS results. There was no statistically significant 
treatment- by-center interaction difference in the odds ratios between the centers in the responder 
rates as determined by [CONTACT_093] (Breslow-Day test p-value = 0.363) (FAS). Sensitivity 
analyses with missing values handled with LOCF and observed values showed results that were 
consistent with the primary results. Results were similar by [CONTACT_159633], by [CONTACT_819622], and by [CONTACT_819623]. The 
responder rate was 66.5% and 0.6% of subjects for the BoNT/A-DP and placebo group, respectively, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_431]; and 55.6% and 0.0%, respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_1766] (p < 0.001, 
CMH test in both instances) (FAS); thus confirming the conclusions from the composite 
(concordant) primary endpoint. 
The results for the ad hoc analyses for ≥ [ADDRESS_1135303] 
of the BoNT/A-DP on the targeted hyperdynamic lines. During the double-blind phase, the 
composite rate of ≥ 1 point  improvement in FWS at maximum frown at Week 4 was 81.5% for the 
BoNT/A-DP group and 1.7% for the placebo group; with rates of 90.9% and 9.7% of subjects for the 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page 37 of 141

BoNT/A-DP and placebo group, respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_431]; and 84.5% and 7.4%, 
respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_1766] (p < 0.001, CMH test in all instances) (FAS). 
This benefit was maintained up to Week [ADDRESS_1135304]-injection for approximately 20% of subjects. 
Composite rates of ≥ 1 point improvement in FWS at maximum frown were 45.1% and 1 .2%, 
respectively, in the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups, at Week 12, 20.8% and 0.6%, respectively, at 
Week 16, and 9.9% and 0.0%, respectively, at Week 20 (p < 0.001 in each instance).  
Consistent with the primary endpoint, efficacy was maintained with up to 3 retreatments, with 
81.5%, 74.4% and 70.3% of subjects in the BoNT/A-DP group at Week [ADDRESS_1135305] retreatment cycles, respectively, having shown composite rates of ≥ 1 point improvement in 
FWS at maximum frown (with rates of 93.1%, 91.1% and 87.4% of subjects as assessed by 
[CONTACT_431]; and 84.4%, 76.7% and 73.4% of subjects, as assessed by [CONTACT_819624], 
second and third retreatment cycles, respectively). 
No deaths and no study drug-related SAEs were reported during the study. One (0.1%) subject 
during the study reported a BoNT/A- DP-related AE that led to discontinuation (headache; during 
the open-label phase). Pregnancy led to discontinuation from the study for 3 subjects. 
During the double-blind phase of the study, 19 (3.6%) subjects experienced TEAEs considered to be 
at least possibly related to BoNT/A-DP and 4 (2.3%) subjects experienced TEAEs considered to be 
at least possibly related to placebo. Study drug-related TEAEs in the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups, 
respectively included headache: 10 (1.9%) subjects and 1 (0.6%) subject; injection site pain: 2 (0.4%) 
subjects and 1 (0.6%) subject; and head discomfort: 2 (0.4%) subjects in the BoNT/A-DP group and 
none in the placebo group. The rate of headache was higher in the BoNT/A-DP group compared to 
the placebo group. All other events were experienced by [CONTACT_23818] 1 (0.1%) subject. 
One AESI was reported for 1 (0.1%) subject each in the BoNT/A DP and placebo groups during the 
double-blind phase and 3 (0.4%) subjects in the open-label phase. A total of 3 (0.4%) subjects had 
AESIs related to BoNT/A-DP and 2 (0.3%) subjects had AESIs related to injection procedure. No 
subjects had AESIs related to placebo or injection procedure. 
A secondary objective of the study was to provide long term safety data of BoNT/A-DP based on 
multiple treatment cycles. This study showed no increases in TEAE rates or TEAE severity with up 
to 4 cycles of treatment, thus confirming safety after repeated treatments and over prolonged 
period of use.  
There was no development of ADA during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3: BLESS II: Indication; Glabellar Lines 
The composite responder rate (at maximum frown) at Week 4 was 48.8% for the BoNT/A-DP group 
and 1.9% for the placebo group (FAS); the difference in responder rates between the BoNT/A-DP 
and placebo groups at Week 4 was 46.86% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.77, 54.70, p < 0.001, 
CMH test) in favor of BoNT/A-DP (FAS); thus, this study confirmed the superior efficacy of BoNT/A-
DP compared to placebo in the treatment of glabellar lines. Findings were robust. The results for 
the Modified FAS (MFAS) and Per Protocol Set (PPS) were consistent with the FAS results. There 
was no statistically significant treatment- by-center difference in the odds ratios between the 
centers in the composite responder rate (Breslow-Day test p-value = 0.193; FAS). Sensitivity

demographic factors (most subjects were white and female), and whether the subject had received 
previous treatment with botulinum toxin. The responder rates were 75.0% for the BoNT/A- DP 
group, and 1.9% for the placebo group as assessed by [CONTACT_431]; and 51.9% and 1.9% for the 
BoNT/A-D and placebo group, respectively as assessed by [CONTACT_1766] (p < 0.001, CMH test in both 
instances, FAS), which was consistent with the results obtained from the composite (concordant) 
primary endpoint analyses.  
The results for the ad hoc analyses for rates of ≥ [ADDRESS_1135306] of the BoNT/A-DP on the targeted hyperdynamic lines. During the double-blind phase, the 
composite rates of ≥ 1 point improvement in FWS at maximum frown at week 4 were 83.1% for the 
BoNT/A-DP group and 1.9% for the placebo group; with rates of 90.0% and 3.8% of subjects for the 
BoNT/A-DP and placebo group, respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_431]; and 85.0% and 9.4% 
respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_1766] (p < 0.001, CMH test in all instances) (FAS). 
Composite rates of  ≥ 1 point improvement in FWS at maximum frown were 40.5% and 2.1%, 
respectively in the BoNT/A DP and placebo groups, at Week 12 (p < 0.001), 12.1% and 0.0%, 
respectively at Week 16 (p = 0.006), and 4.7% and 0.0%, respectively at Week 20 (p = 0.068). The 
benefit was maintained up to Week [ADDRESS_1135307]-injection for approximately 40% of subjects and up to 
Week 16 for approximately 12% of subjects. 
Consistent with the primary endpoint, efficacy was maintained with up to 3 retreatments, with 
82.4%, 78.9% and 71.1% of subjects at Week [ADDRESS_1135308] retreatment cycles, 
respectiv ely having shown composite rates of improvement of ≥ [ADDRESS_1135309] 1 treatment and were included in the 
SAF, 160 subjects in the BoNT/A-DP group, and 53 subjects in the placebo group. No deaths were 
reported during the study. There were no SAEs that were related to study medication, and no TEAEs 
that led to discontinuation. 
TEAEs with an incidence ≥ 1% of subjects in any BoNT/A -DP stratum which were reported more 
frequently in the BoNT/A DP group than in the placebo group and included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348] (6 [3.8%] subjects in the BoNT/A DP group and 1 [1.9%] subject in the placebo group); and 
urinary tract infection (4 [2.5%] subjects), eyelid ptosis (3 [1.9%] subjects), gastroenteritis (2 [1.3%] 
subjects), and concussion (2 [1.3%] subjects), all in the BoNT/A-DP group; no subjects in the placebo 
group experienced these events. TEAEs considered to be at least possibly related to treatment with 
BoNT/A-DP during the double-blind, and open-label parts of the study (N = 208) included 6 (2.9%) 
subjects with headache, 2 (1.0%) subjects with eyelid ptosis, and 1 (0.5%) subject each with 
blepharospasm, injection site nodule, and dry skin. 
A total of 2 (1.0%) subjects who received BoNT/A-DP (N = 208) reported a severe TEAE; these 
included 1 (0.5%) subject each with vitreous detachment and asthma, both unrelated to study drug.  
AESIs during treatment with BoNT/A-DP during the double-blind, included eyelid ptosis, 
constipation and dysarthria reported for 1 (0.6%) subject each. During the open-label phase, AESIs 
included eyelid ptosis reported for 1 (0.5%) subject. All AESIs were of mild severity. None of the 
AESIs was considered to be related to study drug.

A secondary objective of the study was to provide long term safety data of BoNT/A-DP based on 
multiple treatment cycles. This study showed no increases in TEAE rates or TEAE severity with up 
to 4 cycles of treatment, thus confirming safety after repeated treatments and over prolonged 
period of use .  
There was no development of ADA during the study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 Study HG- 11-01: Indication; Glabellar Lines 
Phase 3 study HG- 11-01 was a comparative non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
for improvement of glabellar lines of BoNT/A-DP compared to® in subject s with moderate to 
severe glabellar lines. Study HG- 11-[ADDRESS_1135310] s receiving BoNT/A-
DP and [ADDRESS_1135311] w as administered at a dose of 20 U (0.5 mL). 
The primary endpoint was the response rate of physicians' assessment using the Facial Wrinkle 
Scale (FWS) at week 4. Secondary endpoints included the response rate according to investigator 
at weeks 8, 12 and 16, photographic assessment (3 independent blinded raters) at weeks 4, 8, 12 
and 16, subjects' improvement assessment and subjective self-satisfaction levels. 
Response rates for maximum frown at week 4 were comparable between the groups, at 89.3% in 
the BoNT/A-DP group and 81.9% in the  group. On the basis of secondary endpoints for 
photographic assessment, the response rates were significantly higher for BoNT/A-DP than  
at 4weeks ( p=0.02) and 8weeks ( p< 0.005) after treatment . Thirty eight subject s (28.4%) reported 
63 cases of adverse events (AEs) in the BoNT/A-DP group, and [ADDRESS_1135312] s (32.8%) reported [ADDRESS_1135313] s died during the study. Thirty three treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) were 
reported in [ADDRESS_1135314] s (10.3%) and the incidence rate of TEAEs was lower in the BoNT/A-DP group 
than in the  group (9.0% vs. 11.7%). Among TEAEs, injection site reaction was reported in 
four subjects in the BoNT/A-DP group and 11 subjects in the B  group; eyelid ptosis was 
reported in six subjects in the BoNT/A-DP group and three subjects in the  group. No TEAE 
was evaluated to be severe in intensity. Among TEAEs, six cases of moderate severity were reported 
in the BoNT/A-DP group and one in the  group. 
One serious adverse event (SAE) was reported in each group (cellulitis in the BoNT/A-DP group and 
sudden hearing loss in the ® group ); however, neither case was treatment-related. Antibody 
formation test results pre- and post-dose were negative for all subjects. 
BoNT/A-DP therefore demonstrated the expected safety and efficacy profile of botulinum toxin A 
products, with no noticeable difference in the assessment of safety and efficacy between the 
groups administered BoNT/A-DP and ®. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 Study HG- 06-01: Indication; Blepharospasm 
Study HG-06-01 was a double blind, randomized, active control comparative, parallel-designed, 
Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BoNT/A-DP in essential blepharospasm . 

  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135315] s receiving BoNT/A-DP and 104subject s 
receiving®. The total dose administered varied from 12.5 to 60 U.  
The primary endpoint was "efficacy rate after administration of test product" and the efficacy rat e 
was defined as an elevation of more than one grade (Scott method) at the fourth week after 
administration. Secondary endpoints included the effectiveness duration period, the degree of 
spasm, eyelid closure force, and vision function at predefined visit points, percentages of 
improvement (to grade 0 or 1) at the fourth week after administration of test product (Scott 
method), and percentages of cases where more than two grades are elevated at the fourth week 
after administration of test product (Scott method). The efficacy rates were comparable (98.91% in 
the BoNT/A-DP group vs. 100% in the  group) and BoNT/A-DP was not inferior to  (the 
lower limit of confidence interval [CI] for test group - control group was -2.87%, which exceeded 
the non- inferiority boundary of -10%). With regard to secondary endpoints, there was no statistical 
difference between the test group and control group with respect to the duration of effect.  
A total of [ADDRESS_1135316] s in the BoNT/A-DP group and [ADDRESS_1135317] s in the  group, with no statistically significant difference (p=0.8136) . The 
frequency of TEAEs was low and similarly distributed between treatment groups (27.56% in the 
BoNT/A-DP group vs. 39.56% in the group).  
Three cases of SAEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819607] s in the BoNT/A-DP 
group. One subject had moderate arrhythmia, and the other two subjects experienced severe 
headache and anxiety. The arrhythmia was considered ‘definitely not related’ to the treatment. The 
cases of headache and anxiety were considered ‘probably not related’ to treatment  and the 
subject s completed the study without any further AEs . Other safety endpoints were also 
investigated, including vital signs, laboratory tests, and antibody formation. No clinically significant 
finding was observed, no antibody formation was reported and there was no significant difference 
between treatment groups. 
Long-term safety of BoNT/A-DP was evaluated through the extension study HG-08-01 (up to 48 
weeks) and there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs between groups (p=0.[ADDRESS_1135318]). Antibody formation test results pre- and post-dose were negative for all subjects. 
As a result , there was no noticeable difference in the assessment of safety and efficacy between 
the groups administered BoNT/A-DP or . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 Study HG- 11-02: Indication; Equinus Foot Deformity in Children with Cerebral 
Palsy 
Study HG- 11-02 was a double blind, randomized, active control comparative, multicenter-designed, 
Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BoNT/A- DP versus for the 
treatment of dynamic equinus foot deformity in children with cerebral palsy . Study HG- 11-[ADDRESS_1135319] s receiving BoNT/A-DP and [ADDRESS_1135320] s receiving  control. 
The total dose administered was 6 U/Kg body weight for bilateral palsy and 4 U/Kg for unilateral 
palsy, with a maximum dose/injection limit not exceeding 200 U. 
The primary endpoint was the responder rate determined by [CONTACT_67178]’s Rating Scale  (PRS) 
score at week 12, with a responder defined as an increase in the PRS score by [ADDRESS_1135321] and control

The results of this Phase 4 study confirm the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in treatment of 
subjects with blepharospasm, consistent with the results of the Phase 3 study (HG- 06-01) and the 
extension study (HG- 01-08).

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135356]'s efficacy and safety have been 
confirmed and no particular safety signal was observed. Collection of information on 
adverse events, adverse drug reactions and efficacy will be continued to identify factors 
potentially affecting safety and efficacy and to assure safety of the product. Currently 
further clinical studies are ongoing in Korea for the indications of Crow`s feet (lateral 
canthal lines ; Phase I/III), muscle spasticity (post market surveillance) and cerebral 
palsy (post market surveillance), in accordance with Korean regulations. 
Ove
rall drug safety is similar to that reported for other BoNT/A products.  
4.5 Study Rationale 
As outlined in the Clinical Summary (Section 4.4.2 ), BoNT/A-DP should be a valuable option 
for the treatment of glabellar lines and other indications . BoNT/A- DP has been shown to be 
safe and well tolerated when administered at doses up to 360 U, which is well above the 20 U 
dose planned for use in this study. The current Phase 3 study is designed as a randomized 
double blind study to assess the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in the treatment of glabellar 
lines in comparison with placebo, followed by [CONTACT_819626]. Data obtained from this study (and from 
BLESS I and BLESS II ) will provide evidence of efficacy and subject safety in controlled clinical 
trial setting and will be used for registration purposes. The dose rationale for this study is 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Design Justification 
This will be a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by [CONTACT_819627]. The study will take place in the US and EU.  
To allow all subject s to profit from treatment and to obtain adequate safety data for BoNT/A-
DP treatment, the study will be comprised of two parts. The first part will comprise a double 
blinded treatment cycle comparing BoNT/A-DP with placebo (ratio 3: 1 respectively) and will 
be used for the determination of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The 3:1 ratio 
was selected to increase the number of subjects on active IMP, thus extending the safety 
database and still providing a sufficient number of placebo subjects for relevant comparisons 
in efficacy and safety. The second part of the study will be an open label safety extension, in 
which all subjects (regardless of initial treatment group assignment) will receive BoNT/A-DP, 
to assess long term safety of the treatment and efficacy after repeat treatments.

[IP_ADDRESS] Justification for Schedule 
The study schedule includes a maximum of four permitted treatments per subject(four 
treatment cycles), separated by a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_1135358] has been reported to be 85 days (12.1 
weeks)31and this treatment interval has been evaluated in several repeat treatment 
studies32,33.  
However, since treatment duration of 120 days34, 17.1± 6.[ADDRESS_1135359] s can obtain re-
treatment when they qualify (according to the "Eligibility Criteria for Re-treatment" Section 
7.3), which can be at week [ADDRESS_1135360] of BoNT/-DP will be evaluated in the first treatment cycle compared with 
placebo. The duration of effect of BoNT/-DP after repeat treatment will be assessed in the 
open label extension study. The duration of effect has been reported to increase with repeat 
treatment37. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Justification 
The dose selected is 20 U, where 1U is defined as "the calculated median intraperitoneal lethal 
dose (LD 50) in mice". Study HG- 11-01 performed in South Korea demonstrated that a dose of 
20 U BoNT/A-DP per treatment was safe and highly efficacious in the treatment of glabellar 
lines, with reported responder rates similar to those of the  comparator product 
administered at the same dose (20 U). The potency units of botulinum toxins for injection are 
specific to the preparation and assay methods utilized and are not interchangeable with other 
preparations38(historical data with similar products have confirmed the efficacy of a 20 U dose 
and current safety recommendations favour the use of such small doses39;FDA Guidance for 
Upper Facial Lines). 
4.[ADDRESS_1135361] 
The benefit of participation in this study is the expected reduction in the severity of glabellar 
frown lines after treatment with BoNT/A-DP. Since the subject s recruited are also negatively 
impacted psychologically by [CONTACT_590299], it is anticipated that treated subject s will 
benefit in terms of quality of life (emotional and social functioning; improved self-perception). 
Subjects receiving placebo for the first treatment cycle will benefit from free medical 
screenings and follow- up provided to all study subject s and will benefit from treatment when 
they enter the open label study.

4.6.2 Possible Risks/Inconveniences for the Subject 
Botulinum toxin drug products present a unique set of safety concerns related to the potential 
for local and distant spread of toxin effect. Therefore, an active evaluation of subject s for signs 
and symptoms of local and distant spread of toxin effect will be performed throughout the 
study at each study visit . Subjects will be warned about signs of the spread of toxin effects 
including asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, 
dysarthria, urinary incontinence, breathing difficulties and possible adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs, please see Section 11.1 ). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], speech or swallowing difficulties can 
also result, which could be life threatening, however no definitive SAE reports of distant 
spread of toxin effect associated with cosmetic or dermatologic use of botulinum toxin at the 
labeled dose of 20 U (for glabellar lines) or 100 U (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) 
have been reported to date . Baseline physical examinations will also be conducted to rule out 
pre-existing neurological or muscular deficiencies. In addition, key safety measures such as 
vital signs and pregnancy tests (where appropriate) will be conducted at suitable intervals to 
ensure no participating subjects are pregnant. 
As is the case with all injected products, injection site reactions such as pain, tenderness, 
redness, induration and/or swelling may occur after administration. In addition, a number of 
other symptoms have been experienced by [CONTACT_590300] s including pruritus, hypertonia, 
ptosis, headache, diplopia, edema and blurred vision. The most frequently observed injection 
site reactions were injection site pain and swelling. The vast majority of AEs were rated as 
mild. 
In addition, as with any IMP, there may be unforeseeable risks associated with the use of 
BoNT/A-DP or placebo control. As a side effect of drawing blood, pain, hematoma, and in very 
rare cases an infection at the venipuncture site may occur.

5. STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1 Study Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in the treatment 
of glabellar lines in comparison with placebo, including efficacy after repeat treatments and 
long term safety. 
5.2 Primary Objective 
To assess the efficacy of BoNT/A-DP in reducing the severity of glabellar frown lines following 
treatment (compared with placebo) based on investigator and subject assessment at week 4 
(of the first treatment cycle). 
5.[ADDRESS_1135362] of BoNT/A-DP treatment on subjects (in terms of 
emotional and social functioning and concerns relating to their glabellar lines) in 
comparison with placebo after a single treatment. 
3. To assess onset of effect and the duration of effect (at maximum frown) after a single 
treatment with BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo (first treatment cycle), based on 
investigator and subje ct assessments. 
4. To provide long term safety data of BoNT/A-DP based on multiple treatment cycles and 
to establish a sufficient safety database to support regulatory approval. 
5. To assess subject perceptions of effect of, and satisfaction with, treatment in comparison 
with placebo (first treatment cycle) and during the open-label extension phase. 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135363] part of the study is a 
randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase which aims to demonstrate efficacy and 
safety of BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo. The second part is an open label extension 
phase to evaluate efficacy after repeat treatments and long term safety .  
Subjects can receive a maximum of four treatment cycles over the duration of the study, a 
single treatment in the first cycle compared with placebo, and up to three subsequent 
treatments in the open label extension study. 
Based on historical data with similar products, it is anticipated that there will be a significant 
difference in responder rates between BoNT/A-DP and placebo in the first treatment 
cycle11,40,[ADDRESS_1135364] treatment cycle of the study will comprise two treatment groups as follows:  
 Group A (active): BoNT/A-DP (20 units, 0.5 mL). 
 Group B (placebo control): sterile, 0.9% sodium chloride (0.5 mL ). 
An interim Analysis will be performed when all subjects finalized the double blind phase re-
evaluation for retreatment visit at week [ADDRESS_1135365] treatment cycle or completed the 
double blind phase (whichever occurs earlier).  
Eligible subject s will be randomized at baseline (day 0) to Group A or B to receive the first

with the "eligibility for re-treatment criteria" as outlined in Section 7.3). Efficacy duration of 
four to six months36 or 17.1 ± 6.[ADDRESS_1135369] s may enter the open label extension 
phase and will be dosed with BoNT/A-DP (20 U) for subsequent re-treatments.   
Subjects will attend for visits at [ADDRESS_1135370] qualifies for re-treatment (in accordance with the 
"eligibility for re-treatment criteria" as outlined in Section 7.3) or with the End of Study visit

maximum frown) of ≥ 2, as determined by [CONTACT_479980], this visit on 
the same day at the same site visit will then be consider ed the End of Cycle visit and all other 
criteria required to determine eligibility for re-injection will be assessed e.g. negative urine 
pregnancy test (in women of child-bearing potential), lack of infection or inflammation in the 
planned injection area etc. Furthermore, all additional tests e.g. laboratory tests required for 
final cycle assessment will be performed (as outlined in the Schedule of events, Section 2.1). 
If the subject qualifies for re-treatment, on the same day at the same site visit, the subject will 
then enter the next treatment cycle and will receive the next study drug treatment as part of 
the Re-Treatment visit (i.e. day 0 of the next treatment cycle) .

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135374] wants to get re-treated, but the 
investigator does not agree or vice versa (i.e. the FWS score is not ≥ 2 by [CONTACT_590312]),

6.3.[ADDRESS_1135376] cycle will end 12 weeks later at week 60 
(i.e. End of Study visit).  
The End of Study visit will take place at week 48, if the week [ADDRESS_1135377] was re-treated at week 40.  
For subjects who are prematurely discontinued from the study (at any time), the End of Study 
visit will take place within [ADDRESS_1135378]'s qualification 
for re-treatment. A maximum of four study treatments may be administered per subject, with 
the last opportunity f
or re-treatment being week 48. A subject will be followed-up until he/she 
would qualify for re-treatment (if below 48 weeks), since there is no maximum time frame for 
re-treatment. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1135379] s are not eligible for re-treatment at the "Evaluation for Re-
treatment" visit, they will return at 4-weekly intervals thereafter, until they are eligible for 
treatment. The subsequent visit number for the cycle will remain the same, but will be 
amended with "a, b, c" etc ., corresponding to the time extended (at 4-weekly intervals) in that 
treatment cycle. For example, the first evaluation for re-treatment is at visit 7, week 12; 
however for subjec

Subjects will participate in this study for a duration of 50 to 62 weeks from signing the 
informed consent form (ICF) to the End of Study visit (i.e. up to 14 calendar days for screening, 
followed by 48 to 60 weeks study participation) .  
Subjects will receive a maximum of four permitted rounds of treatment, with a minimum 
interval between treatments of 12 weeks.  
6.4 Outcome Measures 
6.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects among BoNT/A-DP and placebo 
groups with a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥2 points in FWS score (at maximum 
frown) at the week 4 visit (of the first treatment cycle) relative to baseline (responders), based 
on both the investigator’s and the subject’s in -clinic assessments. Thus, the primary endpoint 
is a composite endpoint comprising investigator and subject assessments of treatment 
effectiveness.

assessments (applicable only for subjects who have a FWS score at rest ≥ 1 at baseline ). 
6. The proportion of responders among BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups with a FWS score of 
0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown) during the first 
treatment cycle visit relative to baseline, based on both the investigator ’s and the 
subject ’s in-clinic assessments (composite endpoint, at weeks 1, 2 and 8). 
7. The proportion of subject s with ≥ 2  point and ≥ 1 point reduction in FWS score (at 
maximum frown ) in the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups during the first treatment cycle 
visit relative to baseline , based on the independent rater’s assessment of photo graphs (at

BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups, during each treatment cycle, as assessed by [CONTACT_241887]-Q 
Satisfaction with Outcome Scale. 
10. The proportion of subject s with a ≥ [ADDRESS_1135388] in the BoNT/A-
DP and placebo groups, relative to baseline, during the first treatment cycle, based on the 
independent rater ’s assessment of photos. 
11. The percentage of subject s with a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement of ≥ 2 points 
in FWS score at maximum frown (investigator and subject assessment) at 4 weeks after 
re-treatment relative to the rating at the preceding end of cycle visit. 
12. The proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 -point reduction in FWS score (at maximum frown) in 
the BoNT/A-DP and placebo groups during the first treatment cycle at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,

assessments. 
13. The proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 -point reduction in FWS score (at maximum frown) in 
the BoNT/A-DP group during each re-treatment cycle at week 4 relative to re-treatme nt-
baseline, based on both the investigators’and the subjects’in -clinic assessments. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 
The secondary safety endpoints include: 
1. Frequency, severity and causal relationship of AEs, SAEs and AESIs during the entire study 
period. 
2. Antibody formation, evaluation pre-dose before each treatment, at 4 weeks after each 
treatment and at the final study visit.

6.5 Randomization and Blinding 
6.5.1 Randomization 
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety clinical study 
followed by [CONTACT_338967] . Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either 
BoNT/A-DP or placebo at a ratio of 3:[ADDRESS_1135389] treatment cycle. The 3:1 ratio 
in favor of active treatment versus placebo has been selected to increase the safety data base. 
Randomization will be performed per study site via interactive web response system (IWRS). 
One unique randomization code will be assigned to each subject. 
6.5.[ADDRESS_1135390] placebo controlled treatment cycle (the double-blind cycle of this trial), BoNT/A-
DP and placebo will be provided to the sites in glass vials. Since BoNT/A- DP-vials contain a 
pellet of lyophilized BoNT/A- DP, they can be discerned from placebo-vials (empty vials). 
H
owever, after reconstitution by [CONTACT_819630], both will look 
identical (clear solution, comparable volume) , thus maintaining the blind. The unblinded study 
team member preparing the IMP at the study site must not, by [CONTACT_61076], be involved in any 
other study data collection activities including AE assessment, case report form (CRF) 
completion, diary collection etc. IMP will be assigned to the subjects by [CONTACT_819631] (blinded medication number and batch/lot number during the double-blind phase of 
the study at the given site). The assigned vial will be reconstituted and will be forwarded to 
the investigator for injection. Specific Blinding Plans will be created at each study site during 
the Study Initiation visits. .  
6.5.3 Unblinding 
The decision to unblind lies fully with the investigator. The randomization assignment should 
not be revealed before the study has been completed and the database has been cleaned and 
closed. The study will be unblinded using the Study Specific Unblinding Procedure (an 
unblinding module is standard on all blinded studies; also it is possible to grant access to 
regulatory unblinding users so that they can monitor the safety of the study, if required). 
In case of emergency, the IMP administered to the subject s can be revealed using the 
unblinding function of the IWRS. 
In rare emergencies, unblinding may be necessary for the clinical management of an AE. 
Investigators should 
consider unblinding only if knowledge of the administered product will 
have an influence on the further treatment of the AE. In such events, the investigator should 
make every attempt to inform the Sponsor before breaking the blind or as soon as possible 
after unblinding has been performed. The  or CROMA medical team is available to discuss 
any unblinding need. However, such discussion is not mandatory. The investigator can always 
unblind as per his/her discretion if the actual treatment information is considered relevant for 
subsequent event treatment. Once unblinding has occurred, the site should immediately 

. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135391] identification number and randomization code will be 
documented within the IWRS. Subjects for whom the blind had been broken may continue in 
the study as per discretion of the Investigator. 
6.6 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_322517] a case of critical non-compliance of site to the Code of Federal Regulation (Title 21, CFR Part 
312), the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, or any applicable regulation, the Sponsor 
may stop the entire study or participation of a study site at any time. In addition, the Sponsor 
may stop the entire study, or terminate participation of a study si te for any medical reason at 
any time. 
In the event of individual subject ’s premature study termination resulting from an AE, refer to 
Section 9.5. 
Premature termination of a subject 
A subject -must be terminated from the study if any of the following occur: 
 Withdrawal of informed consent. 
 Treatment with any other investigational product in another clinical study. 
 Treatment with any BoNT other than study medication. 
 Pregnancy (with follow-up until the end of the current treatment cycle). 
 Any significant treatment-related side effects where treatment continuation would 
constitute an unacceptably high risk for the subject. 
Premature termination of a site or of the entire study 
A site or the entire study may be terminated if any of the following occur: 
 Critical non-compliance to Code of Federal Regulation (Title 21, CFR Part 312), the 
study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, or any applicable regulation. 
 The positive benefit/risk ratio is no longer maintained. 
 The Sponsor may stop the entire study for any medical reason at any time. 
 The Sponsor can terminate the study or a study site at any time for any other reason.

. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135398] AND PLACEBO 
8.1 Packaging 
The dosage form of BoNT/A-DP is lyophilizate for solution for injection. BoNT/A-DP is provided 
in single use vials containing50 U/vial. BoNT/A-DP will be reconstituted with a volume of 
1.25 mL sterile physiological saline (diluent, as outlined in Section 8.3). 
The dosage form of the placebo control is a solution for injection. Empty vials will be provided 
for placebo but identical in appearance to the BoNT/A-DP vials. At the study site, 1.25 mL of 
sterile physiological saline will be added to a vial. 
8.2 Labeling 
In accordance with the valid regulatory requirements for blinded clinical trials, the active drug 
and placebo control will be labeled similarly for the double blinded part of the study. A 
different label will be used for the open label extension part of the study. The content of the 
labels will be in accordance with the applicable regulatory authority requirements. 
8.3 Storage and Handling 
Unopened BoNT/A-DP must be stored at +2 to +8 °C in a refrigerator with a calibrated  
minimum -maximum thermometer. A fter reconst itution, the product (in the vial) can be stored

8.3.3 Dilution 
Sterile physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection) will be used as the 
diluent for reconstitution of BoNT/A-DP and will be added at a volume of 1.25 mL for 50 U. 
For the placebo control, 1.25 mL of sterile saline will be added to each vial prior to filling 
syringes. Diluent will be injected slowly into the vial, to avoid foam/bubble formation or 
vigorous agitation which may cause denaturation. If a vacuum does not pull the diluent into 
the vial, the vial will be discarded. The date and time of reconstitution will be recorded in the 
CRF. Reconstituted IMP should be colorless and transparent with no visible particulate matter. 
The reconstituted drug must be administered within [ADDRESS_1135400]

should be removed and replaced with a sterile insulin or tuberculin-type syringe of 1 mL 
volume with 0.01 mL graduation and with the gauge range of 30 to 31G, which the investigator 
routinely uses for toxin administration. The diluted BoNT/A-DP or placebo will be applied to 
the injection sites using a sterile [ADDRESS_1135402] will receive a total of 
five i.m. injections at each injection visit of 4 U/0.1 mL per injection site (i.e. a total of 20 U, 
0.5mLactive BoNT/-DP or placebo control), that is, two injections in each corrugator supercilii 
muscle and one injection in the procerus  muscle with an injection volume of 4U (0.1mL) into 
each site as shown in Figure 1 .  
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135403] injection will be made right above the medial margin of eyebrows. The second injection 
will be made ca. 1cm above the supraorbital ridge (rigid bony boundaries palpable above the 
upper part of the upper eyelid) where midlines of the eyebrows meet. The injection site of the 
procerus  muscle will be just above the midline of the nasal bridge where horizontal wrinkles 
are made between the medial end of eyebrows. When injecting into the medial ends of 
corrugator supercilii  muscles and on the midlines of the eyebrows, the injection sites will be 
at least [ADDRESS_1135404] from the supraorbital ridge (rigid bony boundaries palpable above the 
upper part of the upper eyelid). 
Injections will be made with caution to avoid intravascular injection. Before injecting the test 
drug or placebo control, a thumb or an index finger will be placed firmly below the orbital rim 
to prevent drug effusion to this area. The needle will be oriented superiorly and medially and

of 20 U, 0.5 mL) at a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_1135407] treatment cycle and receive BoNT/A-
DP for the subsequent treatments. The treatment schedule is illustrated in Section 2.2. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1135408] Accountability 
The investigator will ensure that the required storage conditions as specified in the Section 
8.3 are guaranteed at the investigational site, as described in the Site Specific Blinding Plan. 
Authorized unblinded study personnel will maintain accurate records of the receipt of all 
blinded IMP shipped by [CONTACT_1034] (for the double blind portion of the study), including date 
received, drug identity code, date of manufacture or expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], amount received and 
disposition. In the open label extension phase of the study, IMP can be handled by [CONTACT_819634]. IMP must be dispensed only at the study site as specified 
in the protocol (see Section 8.3). Records will be maintained that include the subject 
identification code (SIC), the dispensation date and amount of IMP dispensed. The IMP must 
be dispensed only at the institution specified for each site. After reconciliation by [CONTACT_224066], all remaining unused unreconstituted IMP will be returned to the Sponsor, or 
destroyed at site with the permission of the Sponsor, in accordance with applicable law and 
study site procedures. Partially used reconstituted IMP will be destroyed after use (e.g. 
autoclaved, treated with hypochlorite or discarded in appropriate containers and disposed of 
as medical biohazardous waste). If unused unreconstituted IMP is to be destroyed by [CONTACT_779] , 
the investigator will provide documentation in accordance with Sponsor’s specifications.  
 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135409] who provides informed consent (i.e. signs and dates the ICF ) and has been proven 
eligible during screening will be considered enrolled in the study. Study procedures cannot 
commence until the subject has undergone the informed consent process and signed the ICF. 
Efforts will be made to include subject s with a diversity of Fitzpatrick skin types. 
9.[ADDRESS_1135410] Identification Codes 
A SIC will automatically be assigned by [CONTACT_590311], which will comprise B3 
(denoting the BLESS III study), followed by a single digit country identification, a two digit site 
identification and a three digit subject identification number . All study documents (e.g. CRFs, 
clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified 
with the SIC. An abbreviated SIC containing only the 3-digit subject number is acceptable, 
when the country identifier and site number are clearly assigned to the document. 
9.3 Screening and Study Visits 
The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects screened. The log will also serve to document the reason for screening failure. All 
screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome.

outcomes used to measure treatment benefit or risk in IMP clinical trials. Three PRO 
instruments will be used in this study to support claims in the product label, comprising:  
 The FWS, which will be used to evaluate the severity of glabellar lines (Section 20.1  
and Section 10.1 ) which will be completed by [CONTACT_423] (PRO; Glabellar Line Scale 
for Subjects, GLS-S) and the investigator (clinician reported outcome; Glabellar Line 
Scale for Investigators, GLS-I). 
 The modified Skindex- 16 (GL-QoL) and FACE-Q scales (Appraisal of Lines Between 
Eyebrows scale and Age Appraisal VAS), which will be used to measure the 
psychological impact of glabellar lines and concerns relating to their glabellar lines, 
respectively (Section 20.3  and Section 20.4 , Section 20.5 ).

9.[ADDRESS_1135435] Completion/Discontinuation 
A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active participation 
in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to have, followed all appropriate 
conditions of a protocol (with or without protocol deviations). Completion of the first cycle 
and the open label cycles will be documented on two different CRF pages. 
Subjects will be considered to be "per protocol completers" of Cycle [ADDRESS_1135436] at baseline (day 0) and at the week 4 visit were performed. 
Subjects will be considered to be "per protocol completers" of the study if they have 
completed the final cycle within week 48-60, without major protocol deviation. 
Reasons for completion or non-completion will be reported on the Completion/Termination 
CRF, including: completed, screen failure, premature termination due to AE (including death), 
discontinuation by [CONTACT_1130](e.g.dropout, lost to follow-up, withdrawn informed consent), 
physician decision (e.g.non-compliance with protocol, or for safety reasons), study terminated 
by [CONTACT_2728], or other reason to be specified by [CONTACT_093]. Regardless of the reason for 
subject withdrawal, all data available for the subject up to the time of 
completion/discontinuation should be transferred from the subject records on the 
appropriate CRF.  
Every effort will be made to have discontinued subject s complete the End of Study visit. All 
procedure and assessment results performed at such visits will be recorded under the 
Termination visit assessments. If a subject terminates participation in the study during or after 
a visit and does not return for a Completion/Termination visit, or is lost to follow up their last 
recorded assessments shall remain under the last visit they attended (i.e. no assessment data 
shall be recorded under/transferred to the Completion/Termination visit assessments). The 
reason for discontinuation will be recorded on the CRF.

10. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
10.1 Assessment of Glabellar Line Severity: Facial Wrinkle Scale 
In accordance with FDA Guidelines for Upper Facial Lines, efficacy will be determined using 
well defined, valid and reliable clinician-reported and subject-reported assessments, capable 
of measuring the critical outcomes that contribute to a conclusion of overall success or failure. 
For both investigator and subject assessment, measurements will be made at maximum frown 
(which represents the worst appearance of upper facial lines with maximum load on the 
muscle) and at rest (which represents the best appearance of upper facial lines with the least 
load on the muscle), which allows one to impute benefit when the face is in dynamic motion 
(variable load on the muscle).  
The scale used most frequently in clinical studies is the FWS, which is a four-point rating scale 
as follows: 0 = no facial wrinkles; 1 = mild facial wrinkles; 2 = moderate facial wrinkles; and 3 
= severe facial wrinkl es. The scale has been validated and shown to be reproducible42. 
However, this scale includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_819608], 
meaning that the sensitivity of the scale at rest is low. The instrument proposed for use in this 
study is the FWS, which is named Glabellar Line Scale for Investigators [GLS-I] and Glabellar 
Line Scale for Subjects [GL S-S], as described in Section 20.[ADDRESS_1135438] s are described in Section 20.1  and in the 
completion manuals: ‘Glabellar Line Scale–  Subject: Completion Manual’, ‘Glabellar Line Scale 
- Subject: Completion Manual for Investigator’, and ‘G labellar Line Scale – Investigator: 
Completion Manual’.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1135439] and Investigator In-clinic Assessment 
Subjects will be trained extensively in accurate self-assessment of their glabellar line severity 
by [CONTACT_590315], as outlined i n FWS completion manuals ‘Glabellar Line 
Scale – Subject: Completion Manual’ and ‘Glabellar Line Scale - Subject: Completion Manual 
for Investigator’ . Investigators will complete training before trial initiation and will receive 
training certification. Investigators will also have an FWS completion manual: ‘Glabellar Line 
Scale – Investigator: Completion Manual’ . Subject FWS assessment must be performed 
independently of the investigator and ideally before the investigator FWS assessment, to rule 
out any influence or bias from the investigator. The date and time of assessment will be 
recorded for each visit in the double blind cycle and for the week [ADDRESS_1135440]'s glabellar lines at maximum 
frown and at rest using the FWS instrument (Section 20.1 ), i.e. the GLS-S (for subjects) and the 
GLS-I (for investigators).  
In the first treatment cycle, the severity of the subjects’ glabellar lines will be evaluated by [CONTACT_819636] 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks and at 4 weekly 
intervals thereafter (week 16, week 20, etc. ) until the subject qualifies for re-treatment with 
glabellar line severity returning to a score of [ADDRESS_1135441] treatment cycle , 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135442] the same investigator assess subjects at all time 
points. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be a composite endpoint of the investigators’ and the 
subjects’ assessments of  line severity at maximum frown in comparison with placebo at week 
4. A subject will be considered a responder if they have a FWS score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown) at the week 4 visit (of the first 
treatment cycle) relative to baseline, based on both the investig ator’s and the subject’s in -
clinic assessments. Responder rates at other time points in the first treatment cycle will be 
evaluated as secondary endpoints. 
In the open label extension phase, the percentage of responders (FWS score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvem ent ≥ 2 points in FWS score at maximum frown) at week [ADDRESS_1135443] treatment cycle at the following visits: baseline before the first treatment, study 
visits 2and 4weeks after the first treatment and at the Evaluation for Re-treatment visits, i.e. 
week [ADDRESS_1135444] qualifies for re-treatment. 
Selected photographs will subsequently be assessed by [CONTACT_590317].  Although 
a photograph will be taken at each evaluation for the re-treatment visit, only the photograph 
of the visit preceding the re-treatment visit will be reviewed by [CONTACT_590318] (in 
addition to the photographs at baseline, week 2 and week 4) and the data will be included in 
the analysis of additional secondary efficacy endpoints.

Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of 
the study (i.e. before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History; however any

study will be recorded as an AE. Clinically significant test results at screening will be recorded 
as Medical History. Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject between ICF and first dose 
will be recorded as a Pre-treatment Event on the Medical History page. Any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject after first dose until End of Study visit will be recorded as an AE. All

Note: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819611]. Examples of such 
events are: invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependence or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590264] 1 overnight stay. Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
(known already prior to signing the ICF) will not be considered an SAE, unless any of 
above criteria are fulfilled over the course of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819612]. 
11.4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
A TEAE is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatment, or any 
event already present that worsens in terms of severity, duration, or frequency following 
exposure to the treatment. 
11.5 Evaluation of AEs, AESIs, SAEs, TEAEs 
11.5.1 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator is obliged to assess the relationship between the IMP as well as study 
procedure and the occurrence of each AE/AESI/SAE. This relationship will be classed as not 
related, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related as follows: 
 Not related (both circumstances must be me t): 
 Is due to underlying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs. 
 Is not associated with the IMP or study procedure (i.e. does not follow a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP or has a 
much more likely alternative etiology). 
 Unlikely related (either one or both circumstances are met): 
 Has little or no temporal relationship to the IMP or study procedure. 
 A more likely alternative etiology exists. 
 Possibly related (both circumstances must be met): 
 Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP. 
 An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to the IMP or study procedure. 
 Probably related (both circumstances must be me t):

 Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IMP, 
which may include but is not limited to the following: 
o Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re-administration (positive 
re-challenge). 
o Positive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc.). 
o Toxic level of the IMP as evidenced by [CONTACT_322558]. 
 Another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely 
 Definitely related: 
 Has clear and undoubted relationship to the administration of IMP. 
The investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative 
causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk 
factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to IMP administration will be considered 
and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB in the determination of his/her 
assessment. 
For the purpose of expedited regulatory reporting, events assessed as possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to IMP or study procedure will be considered as drug related.  
11.5.2 Assessment of Severity 
The following definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild:  
 The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity. 
 Moderate:  
 The AE interferes with daily activity but the subject is still able to function. 
 Severe:  
 The AE is incapacitating and/or requires medical intervention. 
11.5.3 Outcome 
The outcome options that can be utilized include: 
 Ongoing 
 Resolved 
 Resolved with Sequelae 
 Death

investigative site or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_9487], will administer treatment for any 
SAEs. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations may be performed to ensure that 
an AE has fully resolved. AEs, AESIs, and SAEs ongoing at End of Study will be followed up until 
the event is resolved or stable. Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Whenever possible, a specific disease 
or syndrome, rather than individual associated signs and symptoms, should be identified by 
[CONTACT_67442] . However, if an observed or reported sign or 
symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_093] , 
it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF.  
When documenting AEs, standard medical terminology should be used in order to avoid the 
use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see Section 11.1 ). Each AE will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_1732]: 
 Seriousness, as defined in Section 11.3 . 
 Severity, as defined in Section 11.5.2 . 
 Causal relationship to IMP exposure, as defined in Section 11.5.1 . 
 Causal relationship to procedure.

If the report is sent via email then the completed and signed SAE/AESI or Pregnancy report 
form must be attached to the email. A notification email of the event describing it in the email 
text is not sufficient. 
There may be situations when an SAE/AESI has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial SAE/AESI report to CROMA Pharma GmbH, or their 
representative. However, it is very important that the investigator always makes an 
assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE/AESI report form. 
Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect product (i.e. IMP or 
concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source (investigator/study-site 
identification) and an event or outcome that can be identified as serious or as an AESI. The 
investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_322523]-up information, 
amending the SAE/AESI report form accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs.

Research, as specified above (Section 11.6.1 ) within 24 hours  of awareness of the pregnancy, 
using the pregnancy reporting form. 
Once a pregnancy has been detected/reported, no further study drug injections must be 
administered. Pregnant subjects will be followed-up until the end of the current injection cycle 
and will then be withdrawn from the study. At the end of the injection cycle, an End of Study 
visit will be conducted. Following detection of pregnancy, no invasive assessments must be 
conducted in pregnant women including no blood sampling for e.g. safety laboratory 
assessments or antibodies. The treatment code for pregnant women will be unblinded. 
 
 
11.6.3 Overdose 
Overdose is defined as any dose above the total body dose per injection session (i.e. 20 
U/treatment). Single treatment doses of up to 50 U of , a botulinum toxin 
with similar potency units to the study drug, are frequently used for cosmetic/aesthetic 
indications31,46,47,48,49and it is generally recognized that doses greater than 20 U may be 
required for larger muscles50. The treatment dose in this study is 20 U and the treatment 
vials contain only 50 U, hence there is virtually no risk of overdose.

Pharma GmbH) will also ensure the responsible ethics committee (EC) is notified of the urgent 
measures taken in such cases,  according to local regulations.

11.9 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not consistent 
with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safety Information (IB). 
“Unexpected” also refers to the AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.

botulinum toxin. At baseline and subsequent study visits (as listed in Section 2.1 and Section 
9.3), a full physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_093]. Full physical exam will 
include neurological assessment (including extraocular movements and cranial nerves) as well 
as assessment for muscle weakness.  In addition, if the subject reports an Adverse Event of 
Special Interest (as detailed in the AESI Manual) a focused p hysical examination by [CONTACT_24201], to evaluate these symptoms will also be undertaken. Any clinically relevant 
abnormal finding will be documented in the CRF as AE/medical history. 
11.[ADDRESS_1135457] 
For women of child-bearing potential (i.e. being pre-menopausal with no 12 consecutive 
months without a menstrual period or not surgically sterilized), a blood serum pregnancy test 
will be performed at screening and at the end of the study and urine dip-stick pregnancy tests 
will be performed before re-treatment. 
Pregnancy tests may be performed at more regular intervals per local regulatory 
requirements. 
11.13 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include pulse rate (beats/min), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(mmHg). Vital signs will be measured at screening, at each visit involving IMP administration 
(to be recorded before IMP administration, i.e. baseline for the first treatment cycle and end 
of cycle visit before re-treatment), at the visit 4 weeks after treatment and at the end of the 
study. Vital sign values will be recorded on the CRF.

Demographic data will only be collected at visit 1 (screening). These data include age(at time 
ICF signed),year of birth, height (cm), weight (kg), gender, race and ethnicity (including 
Fitzpatrick Skin Type). Height and weight data will be used for the calculation of body mass 
index. 
11.15 Clinical Laboratory Tests (Safety) 
A full list of the parameters that will be analyzed can be found below. 
Any safety laboratory results outside the normal range will be evaluated by [CONTACT_819640] “clinically significant” or “not  clinically significant”. Any test assessed as 
being clinical significant must be documented as pre-treatment event (if obtained at 
Screening) or as AE. Sites will conduct re-tests for blood samples which could not be analyzed 
at the central lab due to e.g. haemolysis etc. Repeat of lab tests for clinically significant test 
results are at the discretion of the investigator.   
11.15.1 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry 
Blood will be obtained for assessment of complete blood count (CBC) and clinical chemistry 
parameters in accordance with the schedule, i.e. at screening, [ADDRESS_1135458] of sodium, potassium, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, 
gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, creatinine, cholesterol and glucose (random). Testing of the 
blood samples will be performed at the central laboratory.

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135459] 
Serum samples will be tested for the presence of antibodies to botulinum toxin using an Anti 
Drug Antibody (ADA) ELISA assay; initially only the last sample obtained from each study 
subject will be analyzed together with the pre-dose baseline sample. If a sample tests positive 
for anti-drug antibodies, the other samples from the subject will be analyzed to determine 
when antibodies developed. Serum samples which test positive for binding antibodies will 
subsequently be tested for neutralizing activity. Blood serum for ADA tests will be collected at 
screening, at the visit 4 weeks after treatment and at the end of cycle visit for each treatment 
cycle and will be stored for future analysis should the need arise, based upon the presence of 
ADA at the end of the study. Sample storage at -80°C is preferable, but samples can be stored 
at -20°C at sites if -80°C storage is not available. Samples will be stored (at .) until 
completion of the trial and will be destroyed thereafter.

12. STATISTICS 
12.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
Primary Analysis: 
The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint comprising investigator and subject 
assessments of treatment effectiveness using the FWS.  Composite endpoint treatment 
success (CETS) is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_1135462] is a CETS “Responder” only if both investigator- and 
subject-rated success criteria are satisfied at the visit 4 weeks after baseline .  
The primary analysis of efficacy is the proportion of responders in the BoNT/A-DP treatment 
group compared with the placebo treatment group. For superiority testing of BoNT/A- DP 
compared with placebo, the following assumptions for the sample size calculation will be 
used: 
Item  Assumption  Comments  
Underlying test  Fisher’s Exact Test  Standard test for a response parameter for 
small numbers  
Randomization scheme  3:[ADDRESS_1135463] s to enlarge 
safety data base  
Power 1 - 90%  Actual power is 92.3%.  
Significance level () 0.025 one -sided   
Response  
Arm BoNT/A -DP 46% Conservative value  based on the results of 
previous studies (Bless I and Bless II)  
Response  
Arm Placebo  2% Conservative value  based on the results of 
previous studies (Bless I and Bless II)  
Software   The sample size calculation was performed 
using the software nQuery Advisor® [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
Based on these assumptions, [ADDRESS_1135464] s in the BoNT/A-DP arm and [ADDRESS_1135465] s in total. This is a very small sample size and not sufficient for 
a detailed evaluation of the data, including subgroup analyses. Furthermore, the response 
rate could not be estimated with sufficient precision. Assuming a response rate of 60% in the 
BoNT/A-DG group, a two-sided CI of 95% with a distance from the response rate to the CI 
limits of about 5.6% could be achieved with a sample size of 225 subjects in the BoNT/A- DP 
group. We propose a 3:1 randomization of BoNT/A- DP (225 subjects) to placebo (75 subjects), 
which we believe is adequate for a precise estimate of response rate and for post-hoc 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page 104 of 141

sensitivity analyses (i.e. treatment- by-center and other subgroup analyses), also taking into 
account a drop-out rate. 
In addition sample size is justified in order to fulfill FDA request for additional subjects treated 
with BoNT/A-DP to provide an adequate Safety database. 
In total, [ADDRESS_1135466] s will be enrolled. Applying a 15% drop out rate would result in 
a total number of about 300 subjects.  
 
12.2 Data Sets and Analysis Cohorts 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF): 
All subjects who received at least one injection with study medication (independent of 
whether it is BoNT/A-DP or placebo) will be valid for the SAF. Within the SAF, a subject will be 
considered for the treatment actually received and not for the treatment assigned by 
[CONTACT_17628], if different. The SAF will be used for the evaluation of the safety assessments. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): 
The FAS includes all randomized subjects, regardless of whether they received study 
medication. Within the FAS, a subject will be considered for the treatment assigned by 
[CONTACT_322534], if different, i.e. following the 
intent- to-treat (ITT) principle. The FAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy 
assessments. The FAS serves as the primary efficacy analysis set. 
Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS): 
The MFAS includes all randomized subjects who received at least one injection with study 
medication who had a baseline (visit 1 at day 0) and at least one post-dose in-clinic assessment 
with the FWS by [CONTACT_819641] 1, [ADDRESS_1135467] will be considered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_819642], if different, i.e. following the intent- to-treat (ITT) principle. 
The MFAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy assessments.  
Per-protocol Analysis Set (PP): 
The PP includes all randomized subjects who received at least one injection with study 
medication who had no significant protocol deviations and an in-clinic assessment with the 
FWS by [CONTACT_590326] (day 0) and at the week 4 visit. For the PP, 
all subjects will be assigned to the randomized treatment. The PP will only be analyzed for 
main efficacy outcome measures. 
Data Review Meeting: 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135468] s will be assigned to the SAF, FAS, MFAS and PP during a data review meeting (DRM). 
Further details on the analysis sets, criteria for the PP, and the DRM will be specified within 
the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Details for and decisions on protocol deviations will be 
specified in a classification meeting taking place between database lock and unblinding. 
Corresponding documentation should be held outside of the SAP. 
12.3 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765]. For responder analyses on visits at week 4 and week 12, 
missing in-clinic assessments (investigator or the subject ) with the FWS at baseline or w eek 4 
and week 12 visits will be assigned as being non-responders. 
As sensitivity analyses, the following additional approaches for handling of missing values will 
be applied: 
 Analysis on observed values only, i.e. missing values will be excluded from analysis. 
 Last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275]: each missing value will be assigned to either a response or non-
response, so that all possible combinations of replacing 1 or more missing values within each 
treatment group will be analyzed. p-values will be calculated for each combination and 
graphically displayed using a scatter plot. 
 
12.4 Methods of Analysis 
12.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
Primary Analysis: 
The proportion of subject s (responders) meeting the primary endpoint with a FWS score of 0 
or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown) at week [ADDRESS_1135469] (with stratification variable site; small sites 
with less than 3 placebo subjects will be combined ) using a significance level ( ) of 0.025. The 
hypothesis to be tested is: 
 H 0: pBoNT/A- DP≤ p Placebo  
 H 1: pBoNT/A- DP>pPlacebo 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be applied using SAS procedure Proc Freq (using the 
General Association Statistic ). The one-sided p-value will be derived by [CONTACT_819643]-sided 
p-value delivered by [CONTACT_590328]. Superiority of BoNT/A- DP over placebo will only be 
concluded if, besides statistical significance (one-sided p- value ≤0.025), the proportion of 
responders in the BoNT/A- DP treatment group is higher than for the placebo treatment group. 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_1135470] in-clinic assessments with the FWS at baseline or 
visit week 4 will be assigned as being non-responders. 
Additional Analyses on the Primary Endpoint Variable: 
Further analyses on the primary endpoint variable are exploratory. A one-sided Pearson 2-
test will be applied. Two-sided CI of 95% for the responder rates in the BoNT/A- DP and the 
placebo treatment groups will be calculated using Wilson scores. Treatment- by-center 
interaction will be tested using the Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratios. The 
CIs will also be calculated for the additional analyses as listed in the following: 
 The primary endpoint measure using the observed values only, i.e. missing 
investigator or the subject in-clinic assessments with the FWS at baseline or week 4 
visit will be excluded from analysis but not assigned as being non-responders. 
 The primary endpoint measure using the MFAS and the PP. 
 The primary endpoint measure applying the LOCF for week 4 visit. 
 Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725], country and geographic region (US versus EU). 
o Subgroup analyses will be conducted for sites, , country and geographic 
region (US versus EU). Sites with less than 3 placebo subjects will be 
combined. The 2-test will be applied for each subgroup. In case of a total 
number of observations below 30, or in case of at least one cell frequency 
below 5, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead of the 2-test.  Stratified 
analyses applying the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will also be conducted 
using factor geographic region. 
 Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_1130] s with previous use of botulinum toxin versus naïve 
subjects. 
o Subgroup analyses will be conducted for subjects with treatment with any 
serotype of botulinum toxin for any indication versus naïve subjects. The 2-
test or Fisher’s exact test (see above corresponding criteria to use Fisher) will 
be applied for each subgroup. No stratified analysis using factor pre-
treated/naïve subjects is currently planned. 
 In addition, the following subgroups will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint: 
o  Race  
o Subjects with previous use of botulinum toxin by [CONTACT_3725] 
o Naïve subjects by [CONTACT_3725] 
o Fitzpatrick skin type 
o Sex

12.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
Key Secondary Analyses: 
The testing of the key secondary endpoint will be performed with appropriate multiplicity 
control based on the FAS population. The results of each test result will only be considered 
confirmative if the previous test in the order showed a confirmatory result at a one-sided 
significance level of 0.025. If the one-sided p-value is larger than 0.025 for any of the tests, 
the results of the subsequent tests will only be considered exploratory, and not confirmatory. 
The application of this hierarchical approach keeps the global significance level to 0.025 one-
sided and requires no further adjustment of the significance level. 
The following order of tests will be defined: 
 Primary endpoint (composite endpoint) 
 Key secondary endpoint 1 
 1.1: The modified Skindex- 16 (GL-QoL) Emotional domain 
 1.2: The modified Skindex- 16 (GL-QoL) Social Functioning domain 
 1.3 : The modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) Overall score 
 1.4: The FACE-Q Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale 
 1.5: The FACE-Q Age Appraisal VAS score 
 
Analysis of key secondary endpoint 1: The extent of change in psychological impact (emotional 
and social functioning, and concerns relating to glabellar lines) at week [ADDRESS_1135471] 
treatment, in the BoNT/A-DP group in comparison with placebo, relative to baseline, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_590274]-16 (GL-QoL) and the FACE-Q Appraisal of Lines Between 
Eyebrows and FACE- Q Age Appraisal VAS. 
The modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) and FACE-Q Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale and 
FACE-Q Age Appraisal VAS will be analyzed according to the foreseen analysis approach of 
these tools, as described below. 
Emotional and Social Functioning 
The modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) Emotional and Social Functioning domains and overall 
scores will be derived in accordance with the Skindex-16 manual, adapted for the GL-QoL. The 
scores will be standardized on a scale from 0 (no impact) to 100 (maximal impact); a scale 
score is the average of responses to items addressing a construct. Domain and overall scores 
will be calculated if at least two of three social and of at least two of four emotional domain 
items are present. The absolute change from baseline (measured on the screening visit) will 
be calculated for the domain and overall scores and statistically compared between the 
treatment groups using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (or t-test). Estimates of ‘mild’,

‘moderate’, and ‘severe’ psychological impact, and of the minimal clinical important 
difference, will be used to aid interpretation of scores and will be considered exploratory .  
The analysis will be conducted with respect to the hierarchical order of key secondary 
endpoints; the analysis using the Emotional domain first, the Social Functioning domain 
second, and the overall score third. All analyses will be conducted on observed values only , 
i.e. missing domain and overall scores will be excluded from analysis; no imputation of missing 
domain and overall scores will be performed.

The FACE- Q Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale and FACE- Q Age Appraisal VAS scores 
will be derived in accordance with the developers’ instructions and missing data treated 
accordingly. The absolute change from baseline (measured on the screening visit) will be 
calculated for each scale and statistically compared between the treatment groups using the 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. All analyses will be conducted on observed values only, i.e. missing 
scale scores will be excluded from analysis; no imputation of missing scores will be performed. 
This analysis will be conducted with respect to the hierarchical order of key secondary 
endpoints as well; the analysis of FACE- Q Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale first, 
followed by [CONTACT_590329]- Q Age Appraisal VAS scores. 
Exploratory Analyses 
Exploratory analyses of modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) domain and overall score and FACE- Q 
Appraisal of Lines Between Eyebrows scale and FACE-Q Age Appraisal VAS will also be 
conducted using the MFAS and the PP population. Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725], by [CONTACT_555768], by [CONTACT_819644]ïve subjects 
will be conducted. 
Additional Secondary Analyses: 
Analysis of additional secondary endpoint 1: The percentage of responders at maximum frown 
(as defined above) at week 12 (after the first treatment with BoNT/A-DP or placebo). 
The same analyses, inclusive of the additional exploratory analyses, as described for the 
primary endpoint will be conducted. 
Analysis of additional secondary endpoint 2: The percentage of responders at week 16 (after 
the first treatment). 
The analysis of the week [ADDRESS_1135472] in-clinic assessments with the FWS at baseline or week 16 visit will 
be excluded from analysis but not assigned as being non-responders. Subjects who were re-
treated before visit week 16 are considered to be non-responders .  
In addition, the same analyses, inclusive of the additional exploratory analyses, as described 
for the primary endpoint will be conducted.

Analysis of additional secondary endpoint 3: The percentage of responders at week 20 or later 
(after the first treatment). 
The analysis of percentage of responders at week 20 (after the first treatment) will be 
conducted on observed values only, i.e. missing investigator or the subject in-clinic 
assessments on FWS at baseline or visit w eek 20 will be excluded from the analysis but not 
assigned as being non-responders. Subjects who were re-treated before visit week 20 are 
considered to be non-responders. 
In addition, the same analyses, inclusive the additional exploratory analyses as described for 
the primary endpoint, will be conducted (for subgroups also).  
Analysis of additional secondary endpoint 4: The proportion of subjects with a ≥ [ADDRESS_1135473] in-clinic assessments  
In general, the same statistical analyses, inclusive of the additional exploratory analyses as 
described for the primary endpoint, will be conducted. 
The analysis on the investigator ’s in-clinic assessment will be conducted only for subjects who 
have an investigator’s in -clinic assessment of a FWS score at rest ≥ [ADDRESS_1135474] ’s in-clinic assessment. 
Subjects with missing investigator in-clinic assessments at baseline or week [ADDRESS_1135475]’s in -clinic assessment. 
In general, the additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed applying the 
appropriate statistical method for the comparison of both treatment arms. For proportions, 
the Coch ran-Mantel-Haenszel test (with stratification variable site) and the Pearson 2-test 
will be applied. In case of a total number of observations below 30, or in case of at least one 
cell frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead of the 2-test. Two-sided 95% 
CIs for response rates will be calculated, where appropriate. Additionally the cumulative 
proportions of effects at weeks 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1135476] treatment cycle will be analyzed descriptively and by [CONTACT_33480]-Meier method. 
Moreover, the daily assessments of the line severity when frowning will be analyzed 
descriptively. The FACE-Q satisfaction with outcome scale will be analyzed descriptively. 
All endpoints, with exception of “responder” [ADDRESS_1135477] treatment cycle only. The analysis of “responder” [ADDRESS_1135478] (using a significance level of 0.05) will be used to compare the response

treatment are exploratory only. Additional exploratory analyses, as described for the primary 
endpoint, will not be conducted, with the exception of the calculation of 95% CIs.  
Besides the FAS population for the analysis with multiplicity control, the analyses of these 
endpoints will also be based on the MFAS and the PP population. For all analyses, a one-sided 
significance level of 0.025 will be used, if not stated otherwise. Additional exploratory 
subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_3725], or by [CONTACT_819619]ïve 
subjects, will be conducted for additional secondary analyses. For secondary endpoint 4 all 
subgroup analyses as described for the primary endpoint will be conducted. For the 
proportion of subjects with ≥ [ADDRESS_1135480] treatment cycle 
at week 12, 16 and 20 relative to baseline subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_3725], by [CONTACT_1606], by [CONTACT_819645]ïve subjects will be 
conducted. 
Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
No statistical testing methods will be applied to statistically evaluate the differences on safety 
variables between treatment groups. Safety endpoint variables will be analyzed descriptively 
only. 
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 1 (adverse events): 
Adverse events will be separated to pre-treatment AEs and TEAEs. TEAEs are defined as all 
AEs with onset or worsening (increase in severity) after receiving first dose of study 
medication (independent of whether it is BoNT/A-DP or placebo). If it cannot be determined 
whether an AE is treatment-emergent due to a partial onset date, then it will be counted as 
such. 
TEAEs will be analyzed overall (for BoNT/A-DP or placebo), and for BoNT/A-DP treatment 
group additionally separately per first treatment cycle or open label extension phase: events 
starting on or after first treatment up to before open label extension (first cycle), and events 
starting on or after re-treatment until end of study (open label phase). If it cannot be 
determined whether an AE started during the first treatment cycle or the open label extension 
phase due to a partial onset date, then it will be counted as having started during first 
treatment cycle. 
Events of subject s who started the first treatment with placebo but then entered the open 
label extension for re-treatment with BoNT/A-DP will be considered to placebo for the first 
cycle and to BoNT/A-DP for the open label phase.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) (MedDRA). The number of events, as well as the number and rate of 
affected subject s will be reported. TEAEs (SOC and PT) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_12917],

severity, relationship to study medication, and relationship to procedure. Treatment-
emergent AESIs will be tabulated separately. 
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 2 (antibody formation):  
The presence of antibodies will be summarized by [CONTACT_819646]. For the subgroup of subjects with a sample test positive for 
anti-drug antibodies, all analyzed samples will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_819647].  
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 3 (laboratory data, vital signs, ECG):  
All laboratory values will be classified as normal or abnormal according to the central 
laboratory normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant 
(NCS) by [CONTACT_093] . Quantitative laboratory values will be summarized with means, 
standard deviations, medians, minima and maxima at baseline and over time and of absolute 
changes from baseline. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_819648] s in corresponding categories. Shift tables illustrating changes with respect to the 
central laboratory normal ranges and the investigator assessment between baseline and post-
baseline visits will be created: Number and percentage of subject s with normal, CS and NCS 
laboratory values.  
The analyses of variables for vital signs will focus on the evaluation of the change from 
baseline to the scheduled time points after baseline. Descriptive analysis with means, 
standard deviations, medians, minima and maxima of the time course and of changes from 
baseline to each post-baseline visit will be presented. 
Normal/abnormal shift tables will be created for the overall ECG interpretation by [CONTACT_819649]. 
An additional safety evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_590334] 2 day 0 as baseline for 
subjects who switched from placebo to BoNT/A- DP. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_1135481] exposure will be 
tabulated in detail. Concomitant medication, including application site concomitant 
medication, will be coded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary 
and tabulated accordingly.

20.2 Glabellar Line Scale – Investigator (GLS- I) 
 In this questionnaire you will be asked to rate the severity of the patient’s glabellar lines when 
their face is at rest and when they are at maximum frown.  
 Please use the accompanying drawings and the photo atlas to help you make your ratings.  
 If the patient has any asymmetry in their glabellar lines, please use the most severe line to score 
the questionnaire.

20.3 GL-QoL (Modified Skindex- 16) 
During the past week how much have your glabellar lines bothered you? Glabellar lines are the vertical lines between your eyebrows that are more 
noticeable when you frown.    
For each question please check the box from 0 (Never bothered) to 4 (Always bothered) that best represents how much the lines between your eyebrows 
have bothered you. If the question is not relevant to you, please check ‘Never bothered’.

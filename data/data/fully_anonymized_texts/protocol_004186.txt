1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Study Overview  
Title ATG-GCSF  in New Onset Type 1 Diabetes  
IND Sponsor   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases (NIDDK ) 
Conducted By [CONTACT_39764] 1 Diabetes Trial Network (TrialNet)  
Protocol Chair  Michael J. Haller , MD  
Accrual Objective  84 
Study Design  Three -arm, 1:1:[ADDRESS_84919] 28  subjects will receive placebo  alone  within 100 days 
from diagnosis of T1D . An adaptive design will be used to 
determine the variance of C -peptide over time and may require 
additional subjects to be e nrolled in each group  to preserve 
power . 
Treatment Description  ATG will be administered a t a dose of 2.5mg/kg as  two divided 
IV infusions of 0.5mg/kg and 2mg/kg . GCSF will be 
administered at a dose of 6mg SC or if <44.5 kg a dose of 100 
mcg/kg every two w eeks for a total of 6 doses.  
Study Duration  Enrollment is expected to occur over two -three  years.  Subjects 
will be followed up to 24 months from randomization in this 
protocol.   
Objective  To determine the safety and ability of low dose ATG plus GCSF  
and low dose ATG alone  to retain/enhance C -peptide 
production in new onset T1D patients demonstrating residual 
beta cell function.  
Primary Outcome  The primary statistical hypothesis to be assessed in the study 
is whether the 2 hour area under the curve (change in baseline 
to 12 months) in residual beta cell function (C -peptide) will 
differ between those treated with ATG and GCSF  or ATG alone 
as compared with placebo.  
Secondary Goals  The study will also examine the effect of the proposed 
treatments on s urrogate markers for immunologic  and 
metabolic  outcomes

TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84922] been somewhat 
overshadowed by [CONTACT_77884] a long lasting means to either reverse or 
prevent the disease (i.e., identify a cure), using a variety of interventions (e .g., cyclosporine, anti -
CD3, anti -CD20, oral insulin) (1 -3). The majority of attempts to reverse T1D in humans have, to 
date, involved the delivery of agents as monotherapy.  As a result, we  and others have recently 
questioned whether the delivery of thera peutics in combination might produce a synergistic 
response that would allow for the successful revers al of T1D (2, 3). The success of combination 
therapy for advancing the treatment of patients with HIV and cancer demonstrates a model for 
multi -agent therapy in diseases involving multiple pathways required  for their successful 
treatment and cure.  
As described below, based on strong preliminary data demonstrating efficacy and potential 
mechanisms leading to reversal of diabetes in NOD mice with a combi nation  of ATG and GCSF , 
as well as preliminary safety and efficacy studies in humans with T1D utilizing ATG and GCSF  
as monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_77851], we will test the hypothesis that a short course of low dose 
ATG or a combination of  low dose ATG plus GCSF  will lead to preservation of C -peptide in 
patients with new onset T1D.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_84923] shown that ALS treatment of the NOD mouse (18) and BB rat (19) with 
recent onset T1D can induce remission, supporting proof of principle for such an approach in 
humans. The case for combination of ATG with other agents received sup port from follow -up 
studies in new -onset NOD mice involving the addition of Exendin -4, a long -acting GLP -[ADDRESS_84924] 
shown to augment insulin secretion in rodents (22) as well as T1D (23) and T2D (24) subjects, 
where remissions were seen in 90% of combinat ion treated mice. While our own NOD studies 
(Preliminar y Data section) found ATG and G CSF to be a superior combination (in comparison to 
ALS and Exendin -4) both sets of data provide additional support for the concept of combination 
therapy and it’s superio rity to relatively ineffective monotherapy in terms of reversing T1D.  
As further proof of the potential for translation from mouse to man, studies in human 
transplantation and various autoimmune conditions suggest that ATG may indeed induce 
tolerance.  ATG has been successfully used as combination therapy in preventing rejec tion 
following organ transplantation. After induction with ATG, transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_77852] (25, 26), with weaning of some to as 
little as a single dose of tacrolimus per week. ATG, either alo ne or in combination with other 
agents, has also been used to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions, including Wegner’s 
granulomatosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, aplastic anemia and 
myelodysplastic syndrome; with grea ter efficacy observed when used in combination (27 -38). 
Extensive studies with ATG in a non -human primate model demonstrates its effectiveness as a 
single agent in T -cell depletion intravascularly and in peripheral lymphoid organs, as well as in 
prolongati on of allograft transplantation of skin and heart (39).   
Other studies also  support ATG’s possible efficacy in T1D.  Specifically, early limited human 
studies with equine ATG and prednisone with new onset T1D suggested  efficacy in prolonging 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    10 
 the honeymoon  phase (11, 40).  In a small randomized, placebo -controlled, single -blinded trial 
with ATG (ATG -Fresenius, [LOCATION_013]), T1D participants aged 18 -35 years receive d a total dose 
of 18 mg/kg of ATG, administered in four infusions.  Of the 17 study participants t reated , 11 
received drug while 6 received placebo.  In terms of efficacy, increased glucagon -stimulated C -
peptide levels, a lower insulin requirement, and lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels were 
reported i n the ATG group (but not placebo group) at the [ADDRESS_84925] 
promising, two ATG treated subjects achieved remission (i.e., off exogenous insulin for at least 1 
month with fasting blood glucose below 126 mg/dl). (41).   
Recently , a phase 2 stu dy in humans with new -onset T1D and funded  by [CONTACT_77885] (ITN ) was completed  to determine if ATG (6.5mg/kg) could  preserv e C-peptide  in new 
onset T1D.  The study test ed the hypothesis that selective deletion of lymphocytes would reset 
the immunologic rheostat, effect dynamic immune regulation and perhaps induce and maintain 
tolerance in T1D.  While this study help ed to establish the relative safety of ATG in humans with 
T1D,  the study failed to demonstrate benefit  (41b) . Post -hoc analys es have suggested that an 
initial decline in beta cell function amongst those who were treated with active drug was followed 
by a relative preservation of beta cell function. We hypothesize that the initial decline in beta cell 
function was related to the severity of cytokine release syndrome and serum sickness. 
Furthermore, we hypothesize that the currently proposed protocol (utilizing ~1/3 of the ATG dose 
in combination with GCSF) will result in less severe cytokine release/serum sickness and, as is 
suppo rted by [CONTACT_77886], preservation /improvement in beta cell function 12 months 
after therapy . 
2.2.2  Potential Mechanism of Action  
 
ATG appears to induce both generalized immunosuppression and immunoregulation, with 
effects  on APC and immunoregulatory cel l function (42). It prevents B -cell proliferation and 
differentiation, as well as mediates T -cell suppressive effects via inhibition of proliferative 
responses to mitogens (43, 44).  A single “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” or “standard” dose of ATG reduces the total 
lymphocyte  count by [CONTACT_726] 85%. T-cell depletion may result from complement -dependent 
opsonization and cellular lysis, Fc -dependent opsonization, or Fas -mediated apoptosis; 
particularly at lower ATG concentrations, at which ATG exhibits preferential effects on pr e-
activated, as opposed to nonactivated, T -cells.  T-cell depletion in peripheral blood persists for 
several days to several months following cessation of ATG administration.  Recovery from 
treatment -induced lymphocyte depletion is gradual and total lympho cyte counts usually return to 
normal with 2 months after ATG administration.  
Following ATG function, the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio remains significantly and persistently lower 
and the ratio may correlate with the outcome in transplantation studies (45 -48).  It has been 
hypothesized that ATG administration may induce a regulatory population of CD8+, CD57+ and 
CD28 - cells that is critical for selective down regulation  of pathogenic self -reactive CD4+ Th1 
cells and the induction of tolerance.   
Other studies have s uggested alternative mechanisms to underlie the beneficial effects of ATG 
in vivo. As with anti -CD3, ATG may induce partial T -cell activation, leading to an anergic state 
(39, 53, 54).  In cynomolgus monkeys, ATG appears to coat T cells, leading to a down regulation  
in surface expression of CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8 molecules, along with impaired immune 
responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions (39).  In addition, antibodies to adhesion molecules 
may interfere with cellular adhesion and endothelial interactions,  as well as T -cell migration to 
sites of inflammation. ATG may also prevent co-stimulation  of T cells by [CONTACT_77887], 
and may induce complement -mediated lysis of these cells; particularly in more mature APC (55).  
The survival of immature DC th us may be more tolerogenic.  Antigens recognized by [CONTACT_77888] 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    11 
 include CD86, CD32, CD4, CD11b, CD29, and CD51/61; some of which are shared by 
[CONTACT_77889].  In addition, ATG contains antibodies that cross -react with B -cell surface 
antigens, allowing for ind uction of activated B -cell (another source of APC) apoptosis in vitro (56 -
58).   
 
2.3 Granulocy te colony -stimulating factor (G CSF)  monotherapy  
2.3.1  Rationale for GCSF Therapy in T1D  
 
In a spontaneous diabetes model, G CSF treatment of NOD mice at 4 weeks of age for 5 
consecutive days, repeated every 4 weeks thereafter until 16 weeks of age, prevented disease 
onset and insulitis when compared to injection of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (Figure 2) (59). Protection from 
diabetes onset corre lated with the recruitment of both DC and CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells. Indeed, 
the G CSF recipi[INVESTIGATOR_77853] -pancreatic lymph node accumulation of functional 
CD4+CD25+ Treg cells (60). Importantly, co -transfer of the functional Treg populations along 
with diabe togenic splenocytes into secondary NOD -SCID recipi[INVESTIGATOR_77854].  In addition, DC transferred from m ice given a single 5 -day-long G CSF treatment to 
secondary NOD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_77855]4+CD25+ Treg cells 
compare d to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_77856] n non -GCSF treated DC. Thus, G CSF likely restores a balance 
between immunogenic and tolerogenic DC, resulting in the recruitment of functional CD4+CD25+ 
Treg cells.  
Based on supportive data from animal models, several groups have moved  on to initiate clinical 
trials of GCSF  based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_77857]. Perhaps the most extensive 
human data derives from studies of GCSF  therapy in patients with Crohn disease. Several 
studies have now demonstrated improvement in clinical  disease scores in patients with Crohn 
disease provided varying courses of GCSF  (61-62).  Specifically, a [ADDRESS_84926] 15 
subjects with active disease (62). In a smaller study of Crohn dise ase patients with a history of 
severe endoscopic ileitis, a similar 12 -week course of GCSF  was associated with clinical 
remission of disease in all 5 subjects (61).   
 
2.3.2  Potential Mechanism of Action  
 
GCSF , an agent well known to help mobilize hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow, 
has been used clinically for nearly 20 years to help repopulate peripheral cell counts in patients 
undergoing cancer therapy. However, a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_77858]. GCSF  has been shown to favor the differentiation and mobilization of Treg cells, 
induce tolerogenic DC, and alter the balance between proinfl ammatory and anti -inflammatory 
soluble mediators both animals and in humans (Figure 3) (65 -67). Specifically, GCSF  can 
mobilize functional bone marrow CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. Preclinical models of GCSF -
induced inhibition of autoimmune and allogeneic T cell responses have demonstrated the 
potential efficacy of GCSF  in treating Croh n 
disease, myasthenia gravis, and T1D.

 DC functional profi le is depi[INVESTIGATOR_77859]. G CSF can alter the balance between pro -
inflammatory and anti -inflammatory soluble mediators, favor the differentiation and mobilization 
of Treg cells, and induce toler ogenic DC both in animals and in humans.  (Adapted from Rutella 
et al, J. Immunology 2005, 175: 7085 –7091 , (65) . 
 
With this extensive  experience of clinical use, G CSF therapy is known to be both safe and well 
tolerated. The side effe ct profile of short course G CSF therapy is limited; with frequency and 
severity of toxicities being dose dependent (greater with larger doses and longer duration) and 
minimal in comparison to many of the agents being used in current T1D intervention studies. 
Specifically, the  most commo n side effect associated with G CSF therapy is bone pain (occurring 
in 10 -20% of patients) which occurs [ADDRESS_84927] pain and dizziness (occurring in less than 10% of patients ). 
 
2.4  Combination of ATG and G CSF  
2.4.1  GCSF Enhances Reversal of Diabetes Afforded by [CONTACT_77890] a combination of ATG and GCSF in NOD mice with `new -onset’ 
diabetes, female NOD mice were monitored 3 times per week for hyperglycemia (defined as a 
blood glucose > 240mg/dL) by [CONTACT_77891] u p to 150 days as shown (Figure 2 ).  
Figure 2. Blood glucose values were 
obtained for up to [ADDRESS_84928] -onset 
in NOD mice treated with ( a) control  
(two IP injections of 500 ug rIgG) , (b) 
GCSF (Neupog en ([COMPANY_010], Inc.) 6ug 
daily x 8weeks , (c) murine ATG  (two 
IP injections of 500 ug murine ATG , or 
(d) murine ATG + G CSF.   All received 
sustaine d release insulin for 3 weeks.  
As shown (Figure 2), the 
administration of murine ATG alone to 
new-onset NOD mice resulted in 
durable (i.e., > [ADDRESS_84929] -onset) 
remissions from overt hyperglycemia 
in 33% (5/15) of treated animals, whi le 
neither control (0/16) nor G CSF 
monotherapy (0/14 mice) provided 
such reversions However, the 
combination of murine ATG and G CSF 
therapy resulted in a remission rate of 75%, a significantly greater rate of remission than was 
seen with murine ATG monotherapy (12/16; P = 0.0000006 versus control, P = 0.013 versus 
murine ATG).  
Interestingly and very importantly, in terms of dosage in humans, GCSF improved the 
therapeutic capacity for diabetes reversal even when in combination with a suboptimal dose  
(290ug) of murine ATG    Moreover, s uccessful treatment with murine ATG was largely limited to 

TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    13 
 values of <380mg/dL (mean 317.2mg/dL; range 256 -398mg/dL), whereas combinat ion therapy of 
murine ATG and G CSF significantly increased the therapeutic ceiling to ~500 mg/dL (mean 
401.8 mg/dL; range 264 -500mg/dL) .  Additional studies demonstrated an improvement in IP 
glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) at from the 60 to 120 day time points. This improvement in 
glucose control occurred in spi[INVESTIGATOR_77860] G CSF ther api[INVESTIGATOR_77861] 60 -day time point.  
 
2.4.2   ATG + G CSF Combination Therapy Induces Immunomodulation  
To address the question of whether GCSF -mediated enhancement of diabetes reversal was due 
to induction of immunoregulation, murine ATG and GCSF  (as both mono - and combination -
therapy) were administered to pre -diabetic [ADDRESS_84930] percentage of Treg cel ls was observed in mice receiving 
combination therapy. The health of the islets at the endpoint of the pre -diabetic study was an 
important consideration. As s uch, insulitis scoring was performed to determine the degree of 
lymphocytic infiltration over the 8 weeks of therapy in pre -diabetic NOD mice. Combination 
therapy resulted in markedly lower insulitis intensity scores when compared with islets from 
control animals after 8 weeks In addition, insulin staining revealed improved beta cell area in 
animals re ceiving combination therapy versus murine ATG monotherapy, while control animals 
demonstrated a decline in beta cell area over the 8 week period  
By [CONTACT_77892][INVESTIGATOR_014], however, the health of the islets was maintained relative 
to control as measured by [CONTACT_77893]. These results indicate that 
combined  treatment of murine ATG with G CSF offers a highly effective means for reversal of 
T1D in NOD mice.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84931] of 2008, the University of [LOCATION_012] T1D research group embarked on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (JDRF/NIH 
supported) study of GCSF monotherapy, in order to firmly establish the safety of GCSF  and 
demonstrate the potential for efficacy in mobilizing T reg in the T1D population.  The study used  a 
2:1 drug: placebo randomization scheme and AUC C -peptide as the primary efficacy outcome 
measure. Twenty -one s tudy participants completed a 12 week course of the study drug ( GCSF  
6mg sq q 2 weeks versus placebo ).  Analysis of the  [ADDRESS_84932] frequent complaints being bone pain or headache treatable with ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen. I n addition, there were no issues with splenomegaly or concerning elevation of 
the absolute neutrophil count.  
2.5.2  ATG  Monotherapy  
 
In late 2006, the ITN approved ATG monotherapy in new -onset T1D at a limited number of sites; 
the START trial ( Study of Thymoglobulin to Arrest Type 1 Diabetes). After safety and tolerability 
of the drug was demonstrated, the age group was lowered to 12 years in the Fall of 2009  and the 
study was fully enrolled . The primary endpoint analysis was completed in 2012 and did not 
reveal any benefit for ATG monotherapy (at 6.5mg/kg) in preserving beta cell function in new 
onset subjects (41b).  
2.5.3  ATG +GCSF  
 
A phase IIa study of ATG  (2.5mg/kg) and GCSF  (6mg q 2 weeks x 6 doses)  utilizing a 2:1 
randomization scheme (Drug: placeb o) is currently underway in “established ” (diagnosed for 4 
months to 2 years) T1D patients (Figure 3 ). The study is fully enrolled (n=25) and data from all

in adults and children, and the suggestion from our animal data indicating that lower dose ATG 
could be used successfully when ut ilized in combination with G CSF. Several autoimmune 
diseases (e.g., SLE, RA, Wegner’s Granulomatosis, Systemic Sclerosis, and T1D) have been 
treated with some success with ATG based protocols utilizing doses from 2.5mg/kg to in excess 
of 10 mg/kg (68). In addition, induction therapy for kidney transplantation using low doses of 
ATG (2.5 -5mg/kg) has demonstrated efficacy in protecting the graft and reducing acute rejection 
in both children and adults (69, 70).  
In the ITN START study, subjects received ATG at  a total dose of 6.5 mg/kg (0.5 mg/kg Day 1, 
then 2 mg/kg for next 3 doses). This dose has been effective and well tolerated in bone marrow 
and solid organ transplantation, and is well below the dose of 20 mg/kg that has been used for 
some transplantation protocols. Based on the observed efficacy in the mouse w ith combined 
low-dose ATG and G CSF therapy, the dose of ATG was reduced, albeit somewhat empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], 
to 2.5 mg/kg with the hopes of minimizing side effects while still providing for efficacy in 
prese rving beta cell function.  
The d ose and duration of G CSF was chosen on the basis of its safety as demonstrated to date in 
the T1D study completed at the University of [LOCATION_012], and on the basis of other [ADDRESS_84935] demonstrated potential for benefit in autoimmune disease (71).  
 
Summary pre -clinical and preliminary clinical data:  
 
Preclinical data demonstrate that combination therapy of ATG  and GCSF ha s multiple beneficial 
mechanistic actions (e.g., increased Treg frequency, reduced islet inflammation, improved beta 
cell area, etc.) and dramatically extend s the range of beta cell dysfunction allowable for effective 
and durable disease remission. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_77863]

3.3  Treatment Assignment and Double Masking  
After participants sign the consent form they will be randomized to one of the three arms.  The 
randomization method will be stratified by [CONTACT_77895].  The participants will not be 
informed regarding the intervention assignment until the end of the study. The investigator and 
clinic personnel will also be masked as to study assignment.  Labo ratories performing assays for 
this protocol will be masked as to the identity of biological material to be studied.  
 
3.4  Study Assessments  
During the course of the study, participants will frequently undergo assessments of their insulin 
production, immunologic status, overall h ealth and well -being and diabetes care (see schedule of 
assessments in Appendix A).  Information about the subject’s experience as a research 
participant will also be collected. The participants’ insulin production will be meas ured by a series 
of mixed meal glucose tolerance tests (MMTT) conducted regularly during the study.  The 
participants’ diabetes control will be evaluated by [CONTACT_35755] g lycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
and clinical records including insulin types, doses, and timing and S MBG  records. During the 
course of the study, samples will be drawn for storage in the National Institute for Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) Repository and at TrialNet Sites for future analysis.   
 
3.5  Quality Assurance  
 
During t he study, duplicate collections of blood samples for assays will be obtained in a small 
sample of subjects for the purpose of quality surveillance of the performance of the central 
laboratories.  
 
 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84944] -treatment Follow -up 
 
At the conclusion of the study or when subjects reach 24 months, s ubjects will be encouraged to 
participate in further follow -up via participation in the TrialNet Long Term Investigative Follow -Up 
(LIFT).  
 
4 PATIENT MANAGEMENT  
 
4.1 Overview  
 
Eligible subjects will receive either: (1) ATG (2.5mg/kg) IV followed by [CONTACT_77896] (for those ≥ 
44.5 kg, the dose is 6mg; for those <44.5 kg, the doses is 100 mcg/kg  q 2 weeks x 6 doses), (2) 
ATG (2.5mg/kg) IV plus placebo, or (3) double placebo.  Subjects will undergo screening visits to 
determine eligibility.  Within 8 weeks of screening but preferably less than 37 days, eligible 
subjects will be admitted to an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77865] 0 and will be 
randomized to one of th ree treatment groups (ATG/GCSF, ATG/Placebo, and Placebo/Placebo).  
Individuals will receive oral and IV premedication and the first dose of ATG/placebo will be 
administered over a minimum of 12 hours (maximum of 20 hours)  (Figure 4 ).  CBC will be drawn 
[ADDRESS_84945] dose, the 
second dose of ATG/placebo will be administered over a minimum of 8  hours (maximum of 16 
hours).  Each ATG/placebo dose will be followed by [CONTACT_77897]/saline infusion.  The first dose of 
GCSF /Placebo will be given 6 hours after the end of the second ATG/placebo dose.  
Subsequent GCSF /placebo will then be given as outpatient every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses 
over 5 visits. Subsequent visits will occur every 3 -6 months through 24 months.

The top half of the figure demonstrates the ideal scenario for ATG infusion: First dose of ATG 
(0.5mg/kg) completed over [ADDRESS_84946] infusion, second dose (2mg/kg) 
completed over [ADDRESS_84947] GCSF  dose given 6 hours after completion of ATG, and D/C [ADDRESS_84948] GCSF dosing if laboratory abnormalities or patient care 
issues require interrupting, postponing, or reducing the rate of ATG infusion  
 
4.2 Screening  
 
After informed consent, subjects will undergo assessments to determine if they meet eligibility 
criteria.  Documentation of the subjects understanding of the risks and benefits of the study will 
be collected through the Volunteer Understanding Assessment.  
 
4.3 Randomization  
 
Eligible study participants will be randomized by [CONTACT_77898]. Subjects  will be assigned a study randomization number 
corresponding to the treatment group assignment.   
 
 
 
 
4.4 Intensive Diabetes Management  
 
During the study period, all participants will receive “intensive” management of their diabetes.  
The goal of the treatment will be to keep the HbA1c levels within the currently recommended 
American Diabetes Association age -specific target range in the absence of significant or severe 
hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.  The primary responsibility for diabetes management will 
be the treating or referring diabetes care  provider, but the research study team will provide close 
additional support through regular interaction.  Subjects will not be permitted to use non -insulin 
pharmaceuticals for glycemic control.  
 
Glucose levels should be checked frequently and records of t he glucose levels communicated 
regularly to the study team.  Records of communication with the participant will provide source 
documentation of this interaction.  
 
The Clinic Monitoring Group (or designated TrialNet Committee) will be evaluating the HbA1c 
data and provide additional guidance to the clinical site as needed to bring diabetes control 
within goals.  Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_77866], if any, 
conveyed to the clinical site in conjunction with the Clinic Monitoring Group.

4.5 Drug Administration  
 
4.5.1  ATG   
 
ATG is indicated for the treatment of renal transplant acute rejection in conjunction with 
concomitant immunosuppression. Each 10 mL vial contains 25 mg ATG (rabbit) as well as 50 mg 
glycine, 50 mg mannitol, and 10 mg sodium chloride.  
 
4.5.2  ATG  / Placebo Administration  
 
All participants will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77867] 12 hours after ATG infusion  has been completed . Body weight at 
baseline (Time 0 – admission for the ATG/placebo infusion) will be used in calculating the doses 
for all infusions.   Allowance in dose administration will be within +/ - 5% of calculated dose.  
To minimize the risk for thrombophlebitis  associated with ATG infusion, [ADDRESS_84949] dose (0.5mg/kg) will be infused over a minimum of 12 hours, and the second dose 
(2mg/kg) over a minimum of [ADDRESS_84950] IV 
infusion will be allowed to complete all IV study drug  (see parameters below) . If a subject has not 
completed the two IV study drug infusions at the 60th hour, the infusion will be discontinued and 
they will not receive  additional study drug. Vital signs will be checked every [ADDRESS_84951]’s clinical signs and symptoms related to ATG infusion will be captured 
on infusion CRFs.  Those that are Grade 2 or more  will be cons idered AEs and reported as such.  
 
4.6  Premedication:  
To reduce the risk of adverse reactions to ATG infusion, methylprednisolone 0.25 mg/kg IV will 
be given no less than 30 minutes before each infusion of active drug and 0.25 mg/kg IV will be 
given 12 hours (±15 min) after the start of each infusion of active drug.  
Placebo group: A placebo (saline) infusion similar in appearance will be given no less than 30 
minutes before and 12 hours ( ±15 min) after the start of each infusion.  
Both groups :  Participants in  both groups will be pre -medicated with an antihistamine and 
acetaminophen PO at least 30 minutes before each infusion and every 4 –6 hours as needed 
during the infusion, as follows:  
 Diphenhydramine 1.25 mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 50 mg.  
 Acetaminophen 10 –15 mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 650 mg.  
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    21 
 4.6.1  Cytokine Release Syndrome:  
 
With ATG infusion, the subject may experience Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). The signs 
and symptoms can span a wide clinical spectrum.  
Mild Reactions : For mild (grade 1) reactions per the N CI-CTCAE for CRS, the study medication 
will be continued. The investigator shall take one or more of the following actions, depending on 
the type of the reaction:  
1. Administer additional doses of antihistamine and acetaminophen.                                                                              
2. Reduce the rate of infusion by 50% or more.  
3. For chills and rigors, meperidine may be considered.  
Moderate Reactions : For moderate (grade 2) reactions per the NCI -CTCAE for CRS, the study 
medication may be in terrupted. The investigator shall take the following actions, depending on 
the type of the reaction:  
1.  Interrupt infusion if any of the following occurs:  
   a. Oral temperature of > 40.0 °C  
   b. Symptomatic bronchospasm or pulmonary edema  
   c. Allergy -related edema  
   d. Hypotension  
2. When the temperature is < 38.5 °C and signs and symptoms improve, restart ATG. 
3. Closely monitor the subject with pulse oximetry and a blood pressure monitoring; provide 
ongoing nursing evaluation until at least 2 hours after the infusion is completed.  
4. If necessary, glucocorticoids can be given every 6 hours at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of 
methylprednisolone or equivalent.  
5. If a subsequent dose of ATG further exacerbates the signs and symptoms of CRS despi[INVESTIGATOR_77868], the study treatment must be permanent discontinued.  
6. Additional supportive or resuscitative measures (such as the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) may be 
needed if clinically indicated.  
Severe Reactions : For severe (grade 3) reactions or greater per the NCI -CTCAE for CRS, the 
study medication will be permanently discontinued.

4.6.2  Allergic Reactions  
 
Hypersensitivity:  In rare cases, patients may experience hypersensitivity, which refers to 
immediate allergic, IgE mediated reactions to ATG. Such patients primarily develop skin rash 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_77869] (usually within the first ho ur). For such 
reactions, the investigator shall take one or more of the following actions:  
1. Discontinue the infusion.  
2. Apply appropriate resuscitation measures, including administration of 0.3 –0.5 mL 
aqueous epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000 dilution) subcutaneously.  
3. Use other resuscitative measures, as clinically indicated, including oxygen, intravenous 
fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management.  
Mild to Severe Reactions: For mild to severe (grade 3 or less) reactions per the NCI -CTCAE for 
allergic reactions, the study medication may be restarted at the discretion of the investigator. For 
those with severe (grade 3) reactions, any subsequent doses should be accompanied by [CONTACT_094] -
medication with additional corticosteroids.  
Life-threatening R eactions: For life -threatening (grade 4) reactions per the NCI -CTCAE for 
allergic reactions, the study medication will be permanently discontinued.

4.7 Modification  or Discontinuation of ATG  
 
4.7.1  Modification of second ATG  dose to 1mg/kg  
 
All ATG must be administered by [CONTACT_5638] 60 hours .  CBC with differential will be obtained 8 
hours after the completion of infusion 1. If initial labs  show acceptable values (WBC count 
>2,000 cells/mm3, neutrophil count >1,200 cells/mm3, and platelet count >75,000 cells/mm3), 
ATG will be continued at the full dose.  If labs are outside of these parameters a second CBC can 
be obtained up to 24 hours after  completion of the infusion.  
The second ATG/placebo  dose will be reduced from 2mg/kg to 1mg/kg   if both the a  [ADDRESS_84952] infusion  platelet count s fall between 50,000 and 75,000 cells/mm3, or 
if the neutrophil count falls to a value >800 but <1,200 cells/mm3. Although the ATG package 
insert recommends reducing the dose by 50% if a patient has a total white blood cell (WBC) 
count of between 2000 and 3000 cells/mm3, it has been decided not to reduce the dose in this 
protocol for the following reasons:  
 Because the primary focus of this study is initial T -cell depletion, premature or unnecessary 
reduction of the ATG dose may result in reduced efficacy.  
 If the WBC count falls to a significantly lower level, i.e. <2000 cells/mm3, then ATG will be 
held  

TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    24 
  Participants will be closely monitored for infectious disease risk and offered prophylaxis as 
warranted to minimize their risk  
 GCSF  is expected to minimize t he time/severity of neutropenia  
4.7.2  Discontinuation of ATG  
 
The ATG/placebo w ill be discontinued  if any one of the following is observed:  
 A total WBC count <2,000 cells/mm3 that persists up to 24 hours after the time of the 
planned infusion.  
 A neutrophil count <800 cells/mm3 that persists up to 24 hours after the time of the planned 
infusion.  
 A platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3 that persists up to 24 hours after the time of the 
planned infusion.  
 The participant experiences exacerbation of Cytok ine Release Syndrome (CRS) twice 
consecutively despi[INVESTIGATOR_77870].  
 If the investigator believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best interest of the 
participant  
Participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and undergo 
all efficacy and safety assessments.

Prednisone as follows: Days 1 -3, 50 mg every 12 hours, Day 4, 40 mg every 12 hours, Day 5, 30 
mg every 12 hours, Day 6, 20 mg every 12 hours, Day 7, 10 mg every 1 2 hours. For subjects 
less than 50kg we will provide Prednisone as follows: Days [ADDRESS_84955] amount of steroid required to provide symptomatic relief of serum sickness.   
 
4.8 GCSF  
GCSF  is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor (filgrastim) and monometho xypolyethylene glycol.  GCSF  is a Colony Stimulating Factor 
that acts on hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_77899], thereby [CONTACT_77900], differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation. GCSF  is supplied  in 
0.6 mL prefilled syringes for subcutaneous injection. Each syringe contains 6 mg GCSF  (based 
on protein weight), in a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative -free solution (pH 4.0) containing 
acetate (0.35 mg), sorbitol (30.0 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.02 mg), and sodium (0.02 mg) in water 
for injection, USP. The standard 6mg dose will be given with the exception of subjects who 
weigh less than 4 4.5 kg. For subjects who weigh  less than 4 4.5kg, the dose of GCSF  will be 
given as 100mcg/kg/dose . Dosing calculations will be made based on the weight  at the previous 
visit unless there has been more than a 10% change.  Allowance  in dose administered up to +/ -
5% of calculated dose is permitted.  
 
 
4.8.1  GCSF  / Placebo Administration  
 
GCSF /Placebo treatment will begin 6 hours  after completion of the ATG / Placebo. GCSF / 
Placebo  will be given subcutaneously every [ADDRESS_84956] a directed physical exam at each study visit and a CBC obtained every two 
weeks after the initiation of GCSF  /placebo until they have completed study drug therapy. If at 
any time during the GCSF  /placebo therapy the subject develops an ANC greater than 35 x 
109/L, subsequent  doses of GCSF  /placebo will be given as placebo ( regardless of study 
randomization ) until the ANC is again lower than 35 x 109/L. A repeat CBC will be allowed once 
between sche duled doses to provide subjects an opportunity to normalize a previously elevated 
ANC.  In addition, if splenomegaly is noted on physical exam, placebo will be given for the 
remainder of the drug course regardless of randomization.

 4.10 Concomitant Mediations  
The use of concomitant medications will be assessed at each study visit and recorded on an 
appropriate source document and CRF. Participants are allowed to use preparations of insulin as 
advised by [CONTACT_77901].  
 
Participants will be requested not to use any of the following medications during the study.  
 Agents that influence insulin sensitivity or secretion (pramlintide, sulfonylureas, 
metformin, diphenylhydantoin, thiazide, or other potassium -depleting diuretics , beta -
adrenergic blockers, niacin).  
  Vaccination with live vaccines from [ADDRESS_84957] 
dose of study drug is not permitted.   Killed vaccines other than influenza are discouraged 
during this time period.  
 Any medication that may result in immunosuppression or immunomodulation . 
 Systemic glucocorticoids (unless required during ATG administration or for the treatment 
of cytokine release syndrome or serum sickness).  
 
If participants receive, or if the investigator believes that participants must receive, any of the 
above medications, the case must be discussed with the medical monitor  and/or treating 
physician to determine if alternatives are available . The use of these medications must be 
documented on the source d ocument and CRF .

markers of active infection.  Specific algorithm(s) for the evaluation and management of those  
patients identified as having signs and/or symptoms concerning for infection are provided in the 
manual of operations for this study and are directed based on the participant’s specific 
symptomatology. This will provide general and in some case specific r ecommendations for the 
assessment of patients.   
 
All subjects will have EBV serology determined prior to study enrollment . Subjects who are EBV 
seronegative at screening must be EBV PCR negative within [ADDRESS_84959] had signs or symptoms of an EBV compatible illness lasting longer than 7 days within 
30 days of randomization.   Additional EBV or other infectious disease monitoring  will be done 
only if clinically indicated.

 5 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
See Appendix 1 for detailed schedule of assessments  
 
5.1 General  Assessments  
 
Study visits for all groups will occur according to the Schedule of Assessments . General 
assessments include:  
 
• Medical history  including lifestyle and participant experience assessment  
• Physical exam  
• Concomitant medications  
• Adverse events  
 
 
5.2 Laboratory Assessments  
 
The following general laboratory assessments will be performe d: 
 Chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, glucose, BUN, creatinine)  
 Liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, total and direct 
bilirubin)  
 Hematology (complete blood count with differential and platelets)  
 CD4/CD8 ratio 
 Serum IgG levels  
 
 
At screening, these additional laboratory assessments will be performed : 
 
 Interferon -Gamma Release Assay Test (IGRA)  
 Diabetes Autoantibodies  
 Antibodies to HIV, hepatitis B (antiHBcAb, HBsAg), hepatitis C (HCV), Cytomegalovirus 
(CMV IgG , IgM ), and Epste in-Barr Virus (EBV IgG , IgM, EBNACMV and EBV PCR  
 
Additional assessments include : 
 Pregnancy test before each injection for all sexually mature women

  Insulin dose  
 HbA1c  
 Mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT): [ADDRESS_84961] occur within the time limits specified below:  
 
 Visit Windows  
Visit -1: At least [ADDRESS_84962] 21 days from diagnosis.  
Visit 0:  Randomization < 100 days from 
diagnosis of T1DM  and within 37 days 
from Visit -1. 
Visits 1 through 6 : ±3 days  
Visits 7 through 9 : ±7 days  
Visits 10 and 11 : ±14 days  
 
 
5.6 Withdrawal  from treatment  
 
The study will be conducted  according to the intent -to-treat principle.  This means that once 
randomized into the study, a participant will be expected to undergo all scheduled follow -up 
assessments and will remain within the assigned treatment group for purposes of statistical 
analysis regardless of the actual course of treatment administered.  Withdrawal from treatment 
does not automatically entail withdrawal from the study.  Withdrawal from the study will only 
occur if the participant dies or withdraws consent.  Subjects who withd raw consent are classified 
as inactive but may again become active upon re -entry into the study, if they so choose.  
 
Withdrawal from treatment can occur for a number of reasons, some of which are outlined below.   
 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84963] to discontinue study medications , may be unable to continue them, or 
may be withdrawn (temporarily or permanently) at the discretion of the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_39646] 
s/he determines that it is unsafe to continue or there is a significant change in the risk/benefit.  
 
Non-pregnant individuals who are withdrawn from treatment should remain in the study and 
undergo scheduled  assessment visits  as appropriate and any additional visits as needed to 
address ongoing AEs .  MMTT tests  will not occur while an individual is pregnant.  
 
 
5.7 Re-Entry into Study Treatment  
In some circumstances, a participant may temporarily discontinue the study medication and/or 
not return to the study clinic for follow -up visits. If the participant decides to return for study 
injections  and/or follow -up ass essments at a later date, he or she will be allowed and 
encouraged to do so.

importance for the understanding and amelioration of T1DM in children.  
The study procedures, while possibly slightly greater than minimal risk, offer the possibility of 
benefit i n the close monitoring for all children.  Assent of children along with consent of the 
parents will be obtained prior to any study procedures.  This research proposal in children is 
therefore consistent with [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human Ser vices, Protection of 
Human Subjects, subpart D, section 46.405 (research involving greater than minimal risk but 
presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects) and with Subpart D. 50.52 
(Clinical investigations involving greater than min imal risk but presenting the prospect of direct 
benefit to individual subjects).  
6.2 Potential  Risks  
6.2.1  ATG  
 
ATG has been widely used in transplantation and autoimmune disorder s (42). With the low dose, 
the absence of other immunosuppressive medications, and the lack of severe medical conditions 
other than T1D we expect minimal side effects. In the ITN study, subjects receive ATG at a total 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    30 
 dose of 6.5 mg/kg, a dose which has be en effective and well tolerated in bone marrow and solid 
organ transplantation, and well below the dose of 20 mg/kg that has been used for some 
transplantation protocols. For this study, t he doses will be administered as 0.5 mg/kg during the 
first infusion  and 2 mg/kg during the second infusion to reduce reactions.  ATG will be given 
slowly by [CONTACT_77903] a [ADDRESS_84965] 
an 8 hour period during the second dose .  Subjects will receive pre -medicatio n with 
methylprednisolone, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine to minimize side effects from possible 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and will be closely observed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77871]. Symptoms of CRS may include fever, chills, rigors , headache, tremor, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle and joint pain, and malaise.  Anaphylactic reactions 
have been rarely reported with ATG, but delayed allergic reactions with serum sickness are 
occasionally observed.   
ATG contains a v ariety of antibodies that may cross -react with cell -surface markers. ATG causes 
lymphocyte depletion with marked depletion of lymphocytes occurring acutely. The circulating 
number of T cells increases with cessation of therapy, usually reaching pre -treatme nt levels by 2 
months.  Subjects are at low risk for opportunistic infection during this window of recovery  and 
will receive  close surveillance for primary viral infections, viral reactivations, and bacterial 
infections (76, 77).   
ATG may also lead to leu kopenia and thrombocytopenia. Effects are dose -dependent and are 
mainly encountered with over dosage.  In up to 3% severe thrombocytopenia may occur but this 
is invariably seen in doses [ADDRESS_84966] not been noted in numerous 
other clinical settings in which ATG has been used, and it is not clear if this is related to the 
underlying disease or to associated medications used.  
Conflicting data exists about the risk of EBV -related lymphoproliferative disease. Furthermore, in 
renal transplant patients, the overall risk in this transplant population is  low (0.25% -0.85%), and 
patients received several immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_77872] (42). There were no reported cases of EBV -associated lymphoproliferative 
disease in over 1,675 treated subjects (including children) treat ed for aplastic anemia.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_84967] 5 days of 
GCSF/placebo therapy and then weekly until the week 12 visit.  
GCSF carries a risk (10 -20% of patients) of bone pain and a risk (less than 10%) of headache, 
fever, pain or redness at the site  of inject ion, and dizziness.  According to the company USPI, 
there is also potential risk of Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053], serious allergic reactions, 
and Sickle Cell crisis. There is also a risk that the subjects’ WBC could  become elevated while 
taking G CSF. A complete list of the potential risks associated with GCSF is further described in 
the package insert at http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/neulasta/neulasta_pi_hcp_english.pdf . 
This will be monitored by [CONTACT_77904] (to ensure blinding is 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330

 prote cted) if the ANC is > 35 x 109/L. There are also now a small number of r eports in which 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] G CSF have developed splenomegaly and/or splenic rupture. This risk will be 
explicitly discussed in the consent form and subjects will have close physical examination and 
follow -up to screen for any signs or symptoms. In addition, weekly contact  [CONTACT_77905]. The CBC and complete 
metabolic profile  at each blood draw will be carefully reviewed for any clinically relevant 
abnormalities.  There are no other known long -term r isks from a 12 week course of G CSF.  
 
 
6.3 Pregnancy  
Female subjects with reproductive potential will be instructed to use effective means of birth 
control  (which includes abstinence)  from randomization until [ADDRESS_84968] in a facility that has resuscitation 
capabilities, and subjects will be closely monitored during and after the injection.    
Subjects will be counseled about the potential risk for infections and the need to report any 
change  in health status between or at the time of visits.  Directed questioning about concurrent 
illness will occur before each injection.  No injection will occur in those with signs or symptoms 
indicative of active infection.   
 
7 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND SAF ETY MONITORING  
 
7.1 Adverse Event Definition  
 
7.1.1  Adverse Event  
 
In this clinical trial, an adverse event is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or 
unintended sign, symptom or disease whether or not associated with the treatment and study 
procedures.   
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84969] all adverse events on source documents.  
Events not related hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia which are Grade 2 or greater per the NCI 
CTCAE (see Section 7.1.5. Grading Event Severity below) must be reported to TNCC  as AE . 
The investigator should treat participants with adverse events appropriately and observe them at 
suitable intervals until the events resolve or stabilize.  
Adverse events may be discovered through:  
 observation of the participant;  
 questioning the participant;  
 unsolicited complaint by [CONTACT_2299].  
Questioning of the participant should be conducted in an objective manner.  
 
7.1.2  Adverse Reaction  
 
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse events  for which there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event.  Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for whic h there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse  reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by 
a drug.  Examples of evidence that suggest a causal relationship (reasonable possibility) 
between the drug and the adverse even t include:  
 A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure  
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the populations exposed to the drug  
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy ) that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
7.1.3  Serious Adverse Event/Reaction  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is defined as “any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.”  An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following  outcomes : 
1. Death.  A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of therapy 
must be reported whether it is considered to be treatment related or not.  
2. A life-threatening adverse event.  A life -threatening event is any adverse therapy 
experience that, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84970] and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immedia te risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Regardless of the relationship of the adverse event to study drug, the event must be reported as 
a serious adverse event if it meets any of the above definitions.  
7.1.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event/reaction is considered unexpected when the nature (specificity) or severity of 
the event is not consistent with the risks described in the Investigat or’s Brochure or the informed 
consent document. Unexpected refers to an experience that has not been previously 
observed.   This includes events that occur more frequently than expected.  
7.1.5  Grading Event Severity and Causality  
 
TrialNet has adopted usage of th e National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Technology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and/or study -specific criteria for classification to describe the 
severity of adverse events with the exception of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.  
Hypoglycemia and hyp erglycemia will be reported as adverse events only in the case of 
requiring the assistance of others due to loss of consciousness or DKA. TrialNet Investigators 
will also provide an assessment of relationship of AE to study drug as not, unlikely, possibly,  
probably, or definitely related.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting and Monitoring  
 
Adverse events will be reported to the TrialNet Coordinating Center.  The investigator will grade 
their severity according to common toxicity criteria or study -specific criteria and will make a 
determination of their relation to therapy.  Events will be as sessed and reported consistent with 
the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 21 CFR 312.32 for expedited safety reporting, and 
per the guidance of the DHHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).   
The adverse event case report form for the prot ocol must be completed for all adverse events 
(AE).  For reporting serious adverse events (SAE), the MedWatch Form should also be 
completed and faxed to the TNCC within [ADDRESS_84971] be reported immediately.  Event outcome and other 
follow -up information regarding the treatment and resolution of the event will be obtained and 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84972] 
regular safety reviews approximately every three to six months (and otherwise as needed) of 
adverse events by [CONTACT_48977].  Serious adverse events as well as a dverse 
events leading to study discontinuation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  
For SAEs that are unexpected and considered possibly or probably drug related, the Medical 
Monitor will provide information on frequency of similar events, and generate FDA form 3500A 
reports (MedWatch form) for distribution to FDA, NIDDK, DSMB and site investigators.  
Expedited safety reports will be submitted to the IND by [CONTACT_49010].   The TNCC will also be 
primarily responsible for sending required safety information to [COMPANY_010].  
 
[ADDRESS_84973] to the investigators and of relevance to the 
objectives of the study.  Analyses by [CONTACT_48984]/ethnicity, as appropriate, are also planned.  
Primary analysis of treatment effect will be conducted employing the intention -to-treat principle 
where all participants with measured one -year C -Peptide AUC mean are included regardless of 
treatment compliance (Complete Case Analysis).     
8.1 Primary Outcome  and Analyses  
The primary outcome of each participant is the area under the stimulated C -peptide curve (
AUCY ) 
over the first [ADDRESS_84974] conducted at the one-year visit.  
The 
AUCY  is computed using the trapezoidal rule which translates into a weighted sum of the 
timed C -peptide values over the 120 minute MMTT.  The more appealing quantity is the AUC 
mean which is 
120AUCY  in nmol/L and will be denoted as 
CpY .   
Let  
/, , and ATG GCSF ATG Control
Cp Cp CpY Y Y  represent the C -peptide AUC mean for study patients receiving 
both ATG and GCSF, receiving ATG alone, and those receiving placebo, respectively. Likewise,

 The primary analysis will be conducted on a transformed scale using the function 
log( 1)CpY   .  
This provides better normal distributional behavior by [CONTACT_77906].  The comparison between 
any two treatment arms will be based on a Wald test of treatment effect in an ANCOVA mode l 
adjusting for gender, baseline age, and baseline 
log( 1)CpY .   
 
8.[ADDRESS_84975] of ATG with and without 
GCSF include:  
 C-peptide AUC mean at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months using the ANCOVA mentioned 
above.  
 The hazard rate of C -peptide failure (C -peptide failure defined as the first occurrence at 
which the 2 hour peak C -peptide < 0.2 nmol/L during a MMTT) using the proportional 
hazards model82 while adjustin g for baseline level of C -peptide, gender and baseline age.  
 Longitudinal analyses of C -Peptide AUC means 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_84976], adjusted for the 
baseline level of C -peptide, gender and baseline age. The mean intercept and slope will 
be compared between treatment groups.  
 Treatment interactions with the covariates baseline C -peptide, ge nder and baseline age 
will be analyzed with a homogeneity test categorizing the continuous variables into 3 
approximately equal groups; ladder plots will be constructed. Other variables to be tested 
for treatment interactions are HbA1c  levels, HLA , other genotype and immune 
phenotypes, and race/ethnicity, as appropriate.  
Additional secondary objectives to determine the effect ATG with and without GCSF has on the 
following:  
 HbA1c, Insulin dose (units/kg) and Blood glucose over time by [CONTACT_77907].  
 Adverse events  
o Number and severity.  
o The rates of severe adverse events will be computed (total number of events 
divided by [CONTACT_77908] -up). 
 Hypoglycemia  
o Number of major hypoglycemic events (defined as loss of consciousness, seizure, 
or requiring assistance from another person because of altered state of 
consciousness).  
o Reported hypoglycemic events confirmed with capi[INVESTIGATOR_77873] 70 mg/dl.  
o The rates of severe hypoglycemic will be computed (total nu mber of events 
divided by [CONTACT_77908] -up). 
 For individuals with continuous glucose monitoring data available  
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    36 
 o Area under the curve and number of events less than 70 mg/dl on the continuous 
glucose monitoring record.  
o Hyperglycemia measured as the area under the curve and number of events 
greater than 180 mg/dl on the CGMS record prior to each study visit.  
o Glycemia and glycemic variability prior to each MMTT visit  
o The daily mean level of glucose, as well as the levels before and after meals w ill 
be computed.  
o Measures of diurnal variability in glucose will be measured by [CONTACT_941] J -value, 
standard deviation of glucose values, and the mean amplitude of glycemic 
excursion (MAGE).  
8.[ADDRESS_84977] to the Mechanistic Studies assessed from blood draws as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.   These measures include, but are not limited to, exploration of pharmaco -genetic 
signatures th at may differentiate response to treatment, and the relationship between hsCRP 
and IL -1β levels and beta cell function and/or other metabolic measures.  
Additional analyses will compare the results in this trial to other trials using ATG and GCSF and 
other TrialNet studies.  Data in this trial will be used in conjunction with other TrialNet data for 
exploratory analysis.  
8.4 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The primary analysis will compare the difference in C -Peptide between experimental and 
placebo treatment groups at 12 months using 
log( 1)CpY  transformation and ANCOVA model 
adjusting for gender, baseline age and the baseline value of 
log( 1)CpY . Estimates of the mean 
and standard deviation of 
log( 1)CpY  (expressed algebraically as: 
log( 1)ˆ
CpY  and 
log( 1)ˆ
CpY ) in the 
placebo group were derived from the last four TrialNet studies of early onset disease. The 90% 
confidence bound estimates were used to provide good confidence that this trial’s study 
population characteristics fall within these limits to assure th e advertised statistical power; the 
estimates are 
log( 1)ˆ 0.360
CpY and 
log( 1)|ˆ 0.167
CpYX (i.e., the residual mean squared error 
regressing on gender, baseline age and C -peptide). The geometric -like mean of 
CpY  for the 
placebo group is 
exp(0.36) 1 0.433 nmol/L.  
Using standard equations for the comparison of two means and a 1:1:1 allocation, a sample size 
of 78 participants (26 per group) with complete data would provide power of 85% to detect a 
50% increase i n the geometric -like mean in either experimental treatment group (compared to 
the control) using the Wald test (from the adjusted linear model) at the 0.025 level (one -sided).  
Thus the overall Type I error for both tests is approximately 0.05.  
Assuming th at 10% of the participants will have missing data (one -year MMTT was not done or 
subject withdrew prior to the one -year assessment), the sample size goal for this study will be 
set at 84 participants (28 per group).  
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    37 
 The study will be closed to additional participants when the total number then randomized plus a 
fraction of those in screening (i.e., screening for eligibility) is expected to provide the proper 
number of eligible participants.  Participants who had already conducted the initial screening visi t 
at that time will be allowed to complete screening and be randomized if both consenting and 
eligible.  
In the situation where both hypotheses are rejected in favor of the experimental regimen, then it 
is appropriate to decide which experimental regimen sh ould be considered first for additional 
clinical trials.  If ATG and ATG+GCSF truly differ in efficacy, it is not expected that the difference 
would be as large as the effect size used in this design.  Thus requiring the difference to reach 
statistical sig nificance would be too stringent due to the lack of statistical power.  The plan is to 
employ the method of Simon81 to select the treatment with the largest geometric -like mean in C -
Peptide regardless of how small the difference is over the other experimental regimen. Formally, 
the decision rule is to select the experimental regimen with highest predicted mean based on  the 
fitted linear regression model of C -Peptide used in the formal hypothesis tests.  Given the one 
experimental treatment is associated with 25% higher mean (half of the design effect size) 
compared to the other experimental treatment, the probability is  96% that the most efficacious 
regimen will be selected with this decision rule.  Even if the increase is only 12.5% (i.e., a fourth 
of the design effect size), the probability is 82% in making the right choice.  Since under the null (
/  ATG ATG GCSF
Cp Cp
) we consider selecting either treatment a non -error there is no contribution to 
the type I error, and therefore, no further adjustment is required to the α -level of the initial two 
pair-wise tests.  
8.5 Sample Size Re -estimation   
The Residual Mean Sq uare Error (RMSE) and the mean of the control group are two parameters 
used in determining the sample size goal (N SSG=78) which are directly tied to the study cohort 
enrolled.  The former value is directly proportional to the sample size and the latter app lies its 
influence in defining the effect size.  Thus the advertised statistical power of this trial may differ 
from the actual power if either differs from the initial values assumed.  Consequently, the plan is 
to estimate both values using the accumulate d data (internal interim estimate, IIE) when 
approximately half the subjects (N SSG/2) have had their 1 year C -Peptide assessment.  Since the 
initial values used are based on real data from four previous TrialNet studies, the re -estimation of 
each parameter  will be a two -term weighted average using the number of subjects on which the 
IIE is based as the one weight (N IIE) and the remaining number of subjects participants to be 
enrolled as the other weight (N SSG-NIIE).  Algebraically, the re -estimate will be c omputed:  
 
22
2
eˆˆ ()ˆIIE IIE SSG IIE Initial
R estimate
SSGN N N
N   
Similarly, re -estimation of the mean of the control group will be calculated.  These new estimates 
will be used to calculate a new sample size goal for the trial.  
It is important to note that this adaptive procedure is a non -comparative interim analysis (i.e., the 
observed treatment effect has no influence on the sample size re -estimation).  Therefore, this 
analysis has no effect on the type I error.  Note the re -estimation can be conducted by [CONTACT_77909] a blinded fashion.  The goal is to assure adequate statistical power at the completion 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84978] accurately the study population being 
enrolled.   
8.6  Interim Monitor ing Plan  
Interim analyses will be conducted periodically during the study and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_77910].  The Lan -DeMets74 spending 
function with an O’Brien -Fleming boundary will be used to protect the type I error probability from 
early and multiple testing  and to assess the significance of the interim results that emerge during 
the trial82. The spending function that approximates the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries is:    
* /2
1*( ) 2 2Zt
t  

 
where 
*t is the information fraction (
*01t ),
1is the 
-level  of the interim (one -sided) test 
and 
  is the type I error for one of the pair -wise tests (i.e., 0.025).  The monitoring plan will 
allow for early termination based on the treatment effect on C -peptide values at [ADDRESS_84979] (i.e. 
futility analysis). The boundaries are based on the paper by [CONTACT_48998]83. The study arm should be 
“closed” based on the futility of rejecting the null hypothesis at the completion o f the trial if: 
*( ) 0.1ATGzt
 when 
*0.5  0.75 t  or if 
*( ) 1.0ATGzt  when 
*0.75t  (z is the Wald test of the 
treatment effect coefficient).  The same rule would be applied to the ATG/GCSF treatment group. 
These 
*0.5 and 0.75t  are equivalent to when there are 39 and 59 participants with one -year 
C-peptide results, respective ly. Lachin showed that a onetime use of either boundary for the 
design parameters above    (
11 3.00 ZZ   ) raises the type II error to approximately 
0.[ZIP_CODE] and 0.[ZIP_CODE], respectively.  For larger values of 
*t  the increas e to the error probability is 
even less.  Furthermore, by [CONTACT_77911] a single use of each rule will increase the type 
II error no more than the sum of the increase (i.e., 0.[ZIP_CODE][PHONE_1839] = 0.0103).   
8.7 Interim Analysis Study Modification  
Whether  Lan-DeMets boundary is crossed or a futility decision rule indicates closure of an 
experimental arm, the course of action for the study is as follows.  In case the futility decision 
rule indicates closure of one of the experimental arms (and the governing  bodies concur), the 
trial should continue randomizing between the other remaining experimental treatment and 
placebo (1:1 ratio) since the corresponding hypothesis remains unaddressed.  However, in the 
circumstance where the Lan -DeMets boundary is crossed  the normal course of action would be 
to close the placebo arm.  This would incapacitate the second formal hypothesis test thus 
leaving only the issue of which experimental treatment is “best” as the remaining question.  
However, it may or may not be reaso nable to make this decision as well.  To evaluate the 
evidence at the interim the plan is to use stochastic curtailment and compute the probability that 
the currently ‘best’ treatment (as defined by [CONTACT_77912]) is not the ‘best’ when the 
full sample size is reached.  In the normal employment of stochastic curtailment in futility 
analysis the parameters used for the simulation are based on the alternative hypothesis. The 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: 20160330  
    39 
 analogous parameters for this situation is to set the mean of the currently  ‘best’ treatment to be 
lower than the other experimental treatment mean and determine the probability of a reversal.  
As with the normal application of stochastic curtailment, we will use the probability of 0.20 or less 
to stop accrual completely and invo ke the decision rule for selecting the ‘best’ treatment 
immediately.  Alternatively, the study would continue to its planned completion, randomizing 
between the two active treatment arms, until the projected probability of a re -ordering of the 
outcome (cha nge in the selection of the superior treatment arm) is less than 0.2.  
Our choice for setting the parameters for simulation is to set the ‘best’ treatment group at 25% 
lower than the other experimental treatment mean; these two parameters being centered at the 
midpoint between the two estimated experimental group means. This is consistent with the 
difference between the two treatment arms specified in the Simon selection at the completion of 
the trial (described above), should both arms be superior to the pl acebo.       
The graph below provides an estimated probability of a ‘best’ selection reversal conditioned on 
the interim data (simulated under the condition of crossing the Lan -DeMets boundary and t* = 
0.5).  The probability is primarily a function of the relative position of the ‘lesser’ mean to the 
positions of the placebo mean and the ‘greater’ mean (all means being estimates from the 
interim data).  That is, the closer the ‘lesser’ mean is to the placebo, the less likely there could be 
a reversal in the  selection of the ‘best’ treatment.  
 
Additional analysis will assess potential adverse outcomes of treatment and will assess the 
incidence of all severe adverse events.

 9.3 Informed Consent  
The process of assuring that individuals (and parent/guardian if less than 18 years of age) are 
making an informed decision about participating in this study includes both verbal and written 
communication.  W ritten materials include a Volunteer Handbook, Volunteer Understanding 
Assessment, and written consent forms.  There are several consent forms for this study.  One is 
a Screening consent form that describes the procedures, risks, and benefits, and determin es 
eligibility for the study.  The second is the Intervention consent form, which describes the 
procedures, risks, and benefits for the remainder of the study.  A third consent form is for use at 
clinical sites that will be performing the post -treatment vi sits, but not the treatment visits.  The 
consent forms will be reviewed with participants (and their parent/guardian in the case of 
participants under 18 years of age) and the participant will be given time to review the written 
consent form and ask questi ons.  An assent form has also been developed for participants less 
than 18 years of age (unless local IRB/REB requirements differ in procedure).  
As part of the informed consent process, the participant and/or parent or guardian (if the 
participant is less  than 18 years of age) will also be required to complete a short, written 
Volunteer Understanding Assessment that is designed to ensure that the subject understands 
the study, as well as what is being asked of him/her. The participant will be given a copy of their 
consent/assent forms.   
The consent process will be conducted by [CONTACT_9260] (the Trial Investigator or 
Study Coordinator and/or other designee).  All participants (or their legally acceptable 
representative) must read, sign and date  a consent form prior to participation in the study, and/or 
undergoing any study -specific procedures.  
The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever there is new, clinically 
significant  information applicable to the safety of the participan ts,  when indicated for a protocol 
amendment, and/or whenever any new information becomes available that may affect a 
subject’s participation in the study.   
Subjects will be re -consented if they reach the age of [ADDRESS_84981] 
protected computer system.  At the end of the study, all study databases will  be archi ved at the 
Coordinating Center for long -term storage.   
Stored samples including genetic samples could be utilized to learn more about causes of type 1 
diabetes, its complications (such as eye, nerve, and kidney damage) and other conditions for 
which individuals with diabetes are at increased risk, and how to improve treatment.   The results 
of these future analyses, and any mechanistic studies will not be made known to the participant.  
 
9.5 Risks and Benefits  
The risks of this study are presented in this protocol, and informed consent form.  There is no 
guaranteed benefit to subjects for their participation in the study.   
Special consideration regarding risks and benefits for ch ildren is described in section 6.2 . 
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84982] of the study. [COMPANY_010] will be providing GCSF /Placebo.  
 
10.3 Groups and Committees  
10.3.1  ATG -GCSF Study Chair Committee  
 
The Study Chair and TrialNet Executive Committee will receive periodic reports from the TNCC 
on the progress of the study.  These will include accrual rates and baseline demographic 
characteristics. Interim data summaries provided to others (except those t hat could lead to 
unmasking of study outcome) will first be supplied to the Study Chair for review. Criteria and 
results of ongoing monitoring of the TrialNet labs in terms of reproducibility will also be provided 
on a routine basis and reported on during TN19 ATG -GCSF Study Chair Committee meetings, 
as scheduled. As appropriate, abstracts and manuscripts dealing with the progress of the trial 
shall be directed by [CONTACT_77916]19 ATG -GCSF Study Chair Committee.  
10.3.2  TrialNet Chairman’s Office and TNCC  
 
The TrialNet Ch airman’s Office and TNCC will work together in providing leadership to the 
TrialNet study group to include protocol and manual preparation, training for clinical sites, 
development of statistical design for each study, and analysis of study results.  The T NCC will 
also coordinate interactions among the participating TrialNet Clinical Centers, test laboratories 
including TrialNet Core Laboratories and other subcontract laboratories, NIDDK, and other 
sponsoring agencies.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_84983] communication and site visits, as needed, will f acilitate evaluation of 
the trial management.   
10.3.4  Safety Monitoring Subcommittee  
 
The Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Safety Monitoring Subcommittee (SMS ) is responsible for 
establishing policies and procedures for assurance of safety monitoring of TrialNet protocols and 
of TrialNet subjects. The Safety committee will review all serious AEs and receive summary 
reports of all AEs.  This committee will be ma sked as to treatment assignment.   
TrialNet Protocol TN 19 Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_84984] safety.  All sites will be monitor ed 
by [CONTACT_77917], compliance with 
protocol procedures, completeness and accuracy of data entry, the occurrence and reporting of 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), site pharmacy 
accountability/operations and to confirm the presence of appropriate IRB/REB regulatory 
approvals/documents.   
10.3.[ADDRESS_84985] (DSMB)  
 
All adverse events will be recorded on the adverse event forms, which will be sent to  the local 
IRBs/REBs, per their reporting requirements, and to the Coordinating Center.  
An independent physician will be designated to serve as the medical monitor for this study who 
will maintain regular contact [CONTACT_77918].  (S)he  will review all adverse 
event reports, masked to treatment assignment, and will file event reports with regulatory 
authorities as appropriate.   
The DSMB will meet approximately every [ADDRESS_84986] participants for reasons of health or for notification to them about future 
studies. Approval from the TrialNet Steering Committee and the NIDDK would be required before 
such link age could occur.  Researchers from outside of TrialNet will not be permitted to identify 
samples.  
Data collected for this study will be sent to the TNCC.  De -identified data will be stored at the 
NIDDK Repository, under the supervision of the NIDDK/NIH, f or use by [CONTACT_77919].  
With permission of the subject, when TrialNet is completed, samples will continue to be stored at 
the NIDDK Repository.  Since the stored data will be fully de -identified upon the completion of 
TrialNet, it will no longer be possible to identify samples.  Thus, whereas a sample can be 
destroyed upon a participant’s request during the existence of the TrialNet, it can no longer be 
destroyed once TrialNet is completed.  However, there will still be th e potential to link data 
derived from the samples with data that had been derived from TrialNet studies.  Once TrialNet 
is completed, researchers will only obtain access to samples through grant proposals approved 
by [CONTACT_49010].  The NIDDK will convene an e xternal panel of experts to review requests for 
access to samples.

10.5 Preservation of the Integrity of the Study  
The scientific integrity of the trial dictates that results be reported on a study -wide basis; thus, an 
individual Center will not report the data collected from its site alone.  All presentations and 
publications using TrialNet trial data must protect the main objectives of the study.  Data that 
could be perceived as threatening the study outcome will not be presented prior to release of the 
primary study outcomes.  Approval as to the timing of presentations of data and the meetings at 
which they might be presented will be granted by [CONTACT_49011].  Study results 
should be discussed with the news media only upon authorization o f the Steering Committee, 
and never before the results are presented.  Any written statements about this study that are 
shared with national media must be approved by [CONTACT_77920].

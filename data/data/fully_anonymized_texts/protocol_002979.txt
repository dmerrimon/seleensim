Ablation for the Treatment of Vulvar Intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_33962]  
 
1. Introduction  
Vulvar intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (VIN) is a chronic precancerous medical condition 
causing vulvar dysplasia affecting nearly 50,000 women in the [LOCATION_002] each 
year. [1]The causes of pre -cancer of the vulva are multi -factorial but common risk 
factors including multiple sexual partners, early age at first coitus, smoking, and a 
history of vulvar irritation. Common to all of the se causes is the association with 
the infection by [CONTACT_564238]. While the HPV vaccine has been used extensively 
to control the development of pre -cancer of the cervix, the effectiveness of this 
treatment has not been shown in pre -cancer of the vulva. Add itionally, pre -cancers 
of the vulvar generally affect women in the 4th and 5th decade of life and therefore, 
many women have not received the HPV vaccine. If untreated, pre -cancers of the 
vulva can further develop into invasive cancers. The treatment of an  actual vulvar 
cancer can include radical surgery for removal of the vulva, extensive dissection 
of the groins to obtain lymph nodes , as well as chemotherapy and radiation. These 
treatments can be incredible disfiguring, painful , and can have significant s ide 
effects for women . 
 
Incidence of VIN is increasing among women and there still lacks a standard of 
care for optimal treatment.  Current treatment options aim to treat the symptoms  
associated with VIN and result in a high recurrence rate.  Repeated trea tment 
leads to psychosocial and sexual distress and decreased quality of life for the 
affected women. [1]  Treatment for vulvar dysplasia usually occurs in 3 categories: 
surgical excision, laser ablation and topi[INVESTIGATOR_564209]. 
While the efficac y of all three modalities has been shown, each one has the 
potential for side effects. Surgical excision is difficult in multimodal disease states 
as this can leave the vulvar significantly disfigured. CO2 laser ablation , while 
effective , has been document ed to scar and cause significant pain in the 1 -2 weeks 
following surgery. [2] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_564210] (an immune modulator) 
take up to [ADDRESS_741168] compared ultrasonic laser 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564211]. Von Greunigen et al compared 
CO2 laser a blation in women with VIN  with ultrasonic asp iration in a randomized 
trial from 2000 -2005 . This study found no difference in recurrence  rates between 
the two techniques (HR=.96, 95% CI .64 -1.50) and suggested that women who 
underwent ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564212]2 lase r ablation. While this study is compelling, due

Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  to its age and statistical flaws, ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564213] a 
major modality by [CONTACT_564239]. [3] 
 
1.1   Significance  
Vulva preserving treatments are necessary women with dysplasia in order to 
maintain function and decrease discomfort  typi[INVESTIGATOR_564214] a vulvectomy . [4]  However , 
these less invasive techniques have a high re currence  rate. Re currence  is 
particularly greater for those with HPV and multifocal disease. [5, 6] Women must 
follow these treatments with long -term surveillance , which  often leads to repeat 
treatment and eventually dysfunction  and psychological mor bidity .  [5] Studies 
have found that recurrence rate s with CO2 laser ablation can range from 25 -50% 
recurrence, while rates for ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564215] f rom 22 -
35% recurrence.  [5, 7-13]  [2, 14]  
 
Von Greugenigen’s study failed to limit the study to women with high -grade 
dysplasia only.  As a result, the final analysis failed to meet statistical power. No 
RCT has been conducted since looking at  reoccurrence difference and QOL 
outcomes associated with ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204] . CO2 laser. [3] 
 
We propose a similar st udy by [CONTACT_564240]2 laser 
ablation or ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564216]. We estimate 
that we need [ADDRESS_741169] patients complete quality of life (QOL) surveys to assess which differences 
in wellness and function following treatment  at baseline, 6, and 12 months . 
 
2. Study Objective s  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of vulva dysplasia 
recurrence within 12 months of treatment with CO2 laser ablation or ultrasonic 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Women referred for treatment f ollowing diagnosis of  VIN II/III  will be 
randomize d to receive CO2 laser ablation (typi[INVESTIGATOR_564217]) or 
ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ( approved treatment providing a  more targeted technique).   
 
Secondary objectives will examine incidences of pain, scarring, and sexual and 
psychosocial distraught  following treatment for high -grade dysplasia.  
 
 
2.1  Hypothesis  
Hypothesis 1: Treatment for VIN II/III with ultr asonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564218] a 60 % 
reduction in recurrence rates over 12 months as compared to CO2 
laser aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Hypothesis 2 : Treatment f or VIN II/III with ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564219] 6 weeks following 
treatment as compared to CO2 laser aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
5 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  Hypothesis 3 : Treatment for VIN II/III with ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564220] a 
decrease in change of sexual and psychosocial function (as 
demonstrated with validated instruments) in the [ADDRESS_741170] and surgeon at the 
University of Colorado Denver (UCD) whose research interests includes 
decreasing surgical  morbidities for gynecologic cancer patients.  The University of 
Colorado Denver is a clinical research institution and one of the nation’s 40 
Comprehensive Cancer Centers.  UCD is the only National Cancer Institute -
designated cancer center serving Colorad o and its surrounding states.  The goal 
of the University of Colorado Cancer Center is to provide cutting edge and 
nationally recognized clinical and translational research, to discover and shape 
tomorrow’s treatments, and improve survivorship. The Gynecol ogic Oncology 
clinic is made up of three board -certified Oncologists and a general gynecologist.  
The gynecologic oncology providers see approximately 350 new patients and 
perform over 600 surgeries per year . [15]  In addition the cancer center, [CONTACT_564265] and his partners oversee medical residency training in our general 
gynecologic colposcopy clinic.   
 
Additional sites will be identified and the protocol will be edited to reflect all 
participating sites upon receipt of each site’s local IRB approval.  
 
4.  Outcome Measures  
Primary  Outcome:  The primary outcome of this study is recurrence rates of 
dysplasia within 12 months of treatment. Rates of recurrence  will be compared for 
CO2 laser ablation and ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], stratifying groups based on HPV and 
multifocal disease status.  Recurrence will b e assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months 
following treatment.    Recurrence will be determined by [CONTACT_564241]  (followed by [CONTACT_564242])  at each of the follow -up visits.  
Those with recurrence will be discont inued from the study and receive appropriate 
treatment for their recurring dysplasia , per standard of care ( SOC ).  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
Secondary outcomes will compare:  
1) Incidence of pain in the initial 7 -10 days following treatment. Pain will be 
asses sed using a patient pain scale.  Participants will  be asked to assess their own 
pain and report to the research team.  
 
2) Incidence of scarring due  to treatment regimen .  Participants will be 
examined during regular post -procedure visit approximately 4 -6 weeks following 
treatment.  A visual exam of the vulva will be conducted to assess scaring.   
6 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701   
3) Sexual function  will b e measured at baseline and at the 6 and 12 month  
follow -up visits.  Changes in sexual function will be compared to baseline within 
each treatment arm.  Overall sexual dysfunction rates will be compared between 
treatment arms for each study time interval.  The Female Sexual Function (FSFI) 
and the Female  Sexual Distraught Survey will be used to examine sexual function 
at each time point.  
 
4) Wellness and Function  will be measured using a validated instrument 
FACT -V health survey , designed specifically for women with vulva disease. The 
FACT -V provides met rics for functional , emotional, physical, and social well-being . 
Wellness and function scores will be compared between treatment arms for each 
study time interval and compared to baseline within each treatment arm.  
 
Demographic and clinical data will also  be collected in order to describe the study 
population and determine differences among the randomized groups. 
Demographic and clinical data will be verified against the participant medical 
records to assure data completion and minimize missing data in our  analysis.  
 
Demographic data will include: name, medical record number , contact [CONTACT_3031], 
date of birth, age, race /ethnicity , relationship status , and smoking status .  
Identifying information (name, medical record number,  and contact [CONTACT_3031]) 
will not be entered into the database by [CONTACT_564243], and will only be used by 
[CONTACT_564244], access medical records, and contact [CONTACT_564245].  At these sites, a  log will be kept with their identifiable data and 
participants will be linked to their study chart by [CONTACT_40337].    
 
Clinical Data w ill include: menopause status, colposcopy results, treatment history, 
history of STDs, pre-existing me dical conditions, concomitant medications, 
allergies, and vitals (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], height, 
weight, BMI).  
 
4.1.   Study Endpoints  
Patients will be enrolled at participating  centers prior to receiving  treatment  for their 
VIN II/III.  Baseline assessments will include all study surveys and collection of 
demographic and clinical data.   
 
Pain and scarring will be assessed within the first 6 weeks following treatment.  
Participa nts will be followed at 3, 6, and 12 months for recurrence. Participants will 
be discontinued from the study at time of recurrence, or at the completion of 12 
months follow -up. Total participation is 12 months duration.  
 
5.  Ethical Considerations  
 
5.1 Good Clinical Practice

written information to be provided to subjects.  
The investigat or will provide  COM IRB with continuing review reports annually .  In 
addition, any revised study materials or amendments will be submitted for approval 
prior to use/implementation.  
Each additional site will obtain local IRB approval prior to any procedures being 
conducted. The University of Colorado Denver study team will provide study 
monitoring and will audit study sites, requiring direct access to source data and 
documents.    The  study will remain open with each site’s  local IRB until receipt of 
notification from coordinating site to close the study.  All correspondence with the 
local IRB will be maintained in the study regulatory files. The sponsor may request 
additional audit of  study sites.  
 
5.3 Informed Consent  
Potential Participants will be approached for participati on at their initial visit in our 
gynecologic clinics .  Investigators will ensure that subjects are clearly and fully 
informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding 
clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
Investigators will: 
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study prior 
to clinical study participation. The language will be n on-technical and easily 
understood.

3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_564246].  
4) Obta in IRB  approval  of the written informed consent form and any other 
information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
5) Revise the informed consent whenever important ne w information becomes 
available that is relevant to the participant’s consent. The investigator, or a 
person designated by [CONTACT_093], will fully inform the subject of all 
pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant’s  willingness to continue participation in the study. This 
communication will be documented.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study participants are the most important 
considerations and will prevail over interests of science and society.  
 
6. Investigational Plan  
 
6.1  Description of Population to be Enrolled  
Women diagnosed with high-grade vulvar intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601]  (VIN II/III ) will 
be eligible to participate.  Women with prior treatment for dysplasia will be 
considered eligible for the study.  Prior treatment for dysplasia includes all 
treatments such as surgery, laser ablation, and/or aldara (a topi[INVESTIGATOR_168842]).   
 
6.1.1.  Inclusion Criteria:  
• Women 18 -89 years ol d 
• Diagnosed with VIN II/III (diagnosed by [CONTACT_56618])  
• Referred for vulva sparing treatment for dysplasia  
• Available for follow -up of treatment for 12 months  
 
6.1.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
• Women who are pregnant  
• Women with VIN I  dysplasia  (diagnosed by [CONTACT_56618])  
• Women with vaginal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601]  (VAIN)  
• Women requiring vulvectomy for treatment  
• Women unable to provide informed consent  
 
Women with suspected dysplasia will undergo routine biopsy for diagnosis of vulva 
dysplasia.  P athology will categorize disease as either “low -grade” or “high -grade”  
or using the grading I, II, and III .  Women with high -grade dysplasia , VIN II/III , will 
be referred for further treatment. Women meeting the inclusion criteria  will be 
eligible for incl usion . Women with low-grade dysplasia, VIN I , will not be included 
in the study.  
 
6.2  Sample Size  
9 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  Based on previous studies, approximately  37.5% of patients will reoccur within 12 
months  with traditional treatment (CO2 laser).  [5, 7-13]  We can detect a 60% 
reduction of recurrence to a rate of 15% at 80% power and an alpha of 0. 05 with 
62 patients per arm . [3] We will enroll an additional 1 3 patients per arm ( n=75 per 
arm, 150  total) to account for noncompliance, lost to follow -up or misclassifi cation 
diagnosis.  
 
Approximately 75% of participants will be recruited at the coordinating site, 
University of Colorado Denver.   The other 25% of participants will be recruited at 
the secondary sites  Regional West Medical Center,  and The University of 
Oklahoma are the secondary sites recruiting participants.   
 
6.3 Research Design and Duration  
 
This study will employ a  randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. This is a phase 
III study to determine the effectiveness of a more targ eted treatment therapy  for 
VIN II/III (comparing ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564206]2 laser ablation ). Potential 
participants will be identified through the gynecological clinical practices  following 
diagnosis of VIN II/III and will be randomized (1:1) to one of the treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
Randomization will be stratified for multi -focal disease  and HPV status .  
 
Participants will be followed for 1 year following initial treatment for recurrence of 
vulva dysplasia. Study events will be documented on the study clin ical research 
forms  for each visit. The study will continue until 150 participants ha ve completed 
procedures, which is expected to take a pproximately 3 years . 
 
7. Treatments  
Both the Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564221]2 laser ablation devices are FDA 
approved devices for the treatment of vulvar dysplasia.    
 
7.1 Treatment Assignment  
Participant s will be randomized 1:1 to either treatment with Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564222]2 laser ablation after consent of study.  Prior to treatment, participants will 
receive a local anesthesia (lidocaine) to numb the affected area.  
 
• Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] : The Sonope t Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (manufactured by 
[CONTACT_564247]) provides precise control of soft tissue while 
simultaneously allowing fine bone dissection in close proximity to delicate 
structures. The Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564223], suction, and irrigation with one

order to desiccate  the tissue.  The tissue will change color to a yellow color 
indicating the epi[INVESTIGATOR_564226].   
 
• CO2 Laser Ablation :  Lasers provide an efficient method of achieving rapid 
10 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-[ADDRESS_741172] commonly for large lesions and for multifocal manifestations of human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509]  (HPV). The use of this technology is limited in some areas 
because of healthcare provider training and experience and because of a 
lack of availability of equipment. CO2 laser also leaves destruction of the 
skin at treatment site, and therefore no tissue remains for further histology. 
However it still remains a preferred treatment modality for VIN among 
women. [1] The treatment area will be identified by a 3-[ADDRESS_741173] of care procedures for diagnosing and treating 
vulva dysplasia will be the responsibility of the patient and/or their insurance 
provider .

COMIRB # 16-[ADDRESS_741176] treatment assignment will be 
included in the final analysis.  Training of all study investigators will be conducted 
prior to initiation and regular  monitoring and site visits will be conducted throughout 
the study to ensure continued compliance.  Secondary analysis will look at 
differences in treatment performance and scarring assessment among the 
investigators.  Any differences will be noted in any publication of the data.  
 
Women with gynecologic  disease  are afflicted with a number of psychological and 
social issues  disrupting quality of life . Patients report  changes to t heir social and 
functional well-being  as well as changes to their sexual health . Quality of life 
assessments will be  conducted at baseline, 6 , and 12-month  follow -ups.  Patients 
struggling with psychosocial aspects will be referred for clinical consult as needed. 
The University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564227] a group of social workers wh o are 
available to meet with patients in a private clinical office if the patient expresses a 
psychosocial issue that requires attention.  
 
9.1  Social and Functional Well Being  
Perceived health status can be an important factor in the functional assessment 
for women with gynecologic disease .  We plan to study overall wellness  and social 
support as it relates to treatment in women diagnosed with VIN II/III using the 
following vali dated survey instruments:  
• FACT -V: In order to assess functional health status we will use the 
Health Status the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy  (FACIT) 
instrument  specific for vulva disease called FACT -V (appendix 1. 2). [16]  
 
9.2 Sexual Function  
Sexual function is often affected following treatment for dysplasia due to the high 
occurrence of scarring and discomfort associated with these procedures.  We will 
evaluate sexual function as it relates to treatment  women diagnosed with VIN II/III 
using the following validated survey instruments:  
• Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) validated survey instrument, 
(appendix 1.3 ) for overall sexual function . [17]    
 
• Female Sexual Distress Survey (FSDS) , a validated instrument for 
measuring sexual distraught (appendix 1. 4) [18]. 
 
10. Protection Against Risks  
Study s taff will obtain all necessary Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and human 
protection HIPAA training to oblige to such standards for maintaining participant’s 
privacy.  REDCap, a secure data collection system, will be used to capture 
data. [19] REDCap tools provide the highest possible degree of assurance that data 
14 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  will be secure. The University IT department also provides encrypted email 
services to inter nal and external recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Any study information communicated 
among the research staff will be done using the encrypted University email service.  
 
There is a risk that subjects may feel uncomfortable answering the survey 
questions, particularly those regarding their sexual function. Participants will be 
informed that they may skip any question they feel uncomfortable answering.  
 
11. Event reporting  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event [AE] is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether 
it is considered related to t he medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable or definite).   An unanticipated event is 
defined as any  adverse experience where the nature, severity or frequency is not 
described in the application form or detaile d in the consent form. This can also 
include non -compliance issues such as over enrollment of subjects without prior 
COMIRB approval.  
 
The causal relationship to study treatment  will be  determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_564228] . The causal relationship can be one 
of the following:  
Possibly related : In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], the adverse event is unlikely to be 
related to the study intervention, drug or device.  
Probably related : In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], it is more likely than not that the 
adverse event is related to the study intervention, drug or device.  
Related to the research : An event is “related to the research procedures” if in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], it was more likely than not [probably] t o 
be caused by [CONTACT_564248] [probably] 
that the event affects the rights and welfare of current participants.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_564229] 5 days, per COMIRB’s policy.   
 
The risks associated with the ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564221]2 laser ablation 
devices are similar with the exception that early studies suggest scarring may be 
significantly decreased with the use of the ultrasonic  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]. [1]  Previous studies 
have also suggested  that the ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564230].  [3]Since these early studies have failed to provide 
significant powe r, this is only hypothesized at this time and is the primary outcome  
for this phase III study.   
 
Adverse events that are deemed not related will  be documented in the study AE 
log, subject study charts, and reported to COMIRB at the time of annual review,

Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  per their policy . The coordinating site will review AEs at interim analysis.  
Anticipated clinical adverse events may include:  
• Pain and/or discomfo rt (~25% of women)  
• Presence  of scarring (~30% of women  receiving  CO2 laser, less than 5% 
in women  receiving ultrasonic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13521])  
• Dysureia or burning ( ~25% of women)  
• Adhesions (less than 5%)  
• Infection : yeast, UTI, or other (~10% of women)  
• Abnormal discharge  (less than 10% of women)  
• Eschar  (~10% of women) .  [1] 
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564231] (see NOTE *: below for exceptions)  
• Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed above  
Suspec ted transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or non -
pathogenic) via the study treatment  is an SAE.  
 
*NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 
24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important 
medical event” or a life -threatening event)  
• Elective surgery planned before signing consent  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of 
health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill health state that was 
planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing 
on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of 
housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, 
administrative reason)

Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-[ADDRESS_741177]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, 
whether related or not related to study procedures , must be collected, including 
those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. If 
applicable, SAEs must be c ollected that relate to any later protocol -specific 
procedure (such as follow -up skin biopsy).  
 
The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that 
is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure. An SAE 
report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its 
status of seriousness.  
 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  treatment , but is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of p revious 
therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be 
specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study intervention must be reported 
to the sponsor agent within [ADDRESS_741178] be recorded on the SAE 
Report Form;  
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) 
initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE change s in its intensity or relationship to 
study intervention or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE 
report should be sent within 24 hours to the sponsor (or designee) using the 
same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should 
be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
11.3  Non-Serious Events  
A non -serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.  
 
11.3.1  Non-Serious Adverse Events (NSAEs) Collecting and Reporting  
The collection of non -serious adverse event (NSAE) information will begin at 
initiation of study treatment .  
 
17 
Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  Non-serious AEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs 
that cause interruption or discontinuation of study treatment , or those that are 
present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
 
Non-serious Adverse Events are provided to local IRB and the sponsoring 
agent via annual safety reports (if a pplicable), and interim or final study reports.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anticipated Risks  
While the study anticipates minimal risks, the following outlines any potential 
minimum risk to subjects:  
i. Breach of Confidentiality:  Data obtained using information from medical 
records, p oses minimum risk.  All procedures in which information is being 
obtained will be conducted per standard of care.  There is a risk that a patient’s 
privacy may not be protected. This risk is uncommon.  
 
ii. Discomforts:  Persons receiving treatment for Vulvar Intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_564232]: infection, dysuria, burning, 
adhesions , light bleeding,  and discharge.  Participants could expect to 
experience pain and discomfort following surgery for approximately 1 week. 
Participants shoul d refrain from exercise and sexual intercourse in the two 
weeks following surgery in order to avoid addition discomfort.   
 
iii. Recurrence: Current treatment for vulva -sparing has a recurrence rate of 
25-50% of return disease.  Recurrence, left unmanaged, could lead to cancer 
of the vulva, vagina, or the cervix.   
 
Participation in this study will not have any influence on the pati ent’s current 
treatment. The study may include risks that are unknown at this time.  
 
12.  Data Collection  and Confidentiality  
This study will obtain approval for conduct through the Colorado Multiple 
Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) for research involvi ng human subjects.  All 
patients within the Gynecologic Oncology clinic at the University of Colorado 
Cancer Center who meet the study criteria will be considered eligible for the study.  
We will not enroll  any vulnerable populations as defined by [CONTACT_403883] , but 
will follow participants that may become pregnant during the 12 month participation 
duration . Potential particip ants will be screened by [CONTACT_978]/Co -I and the research 
team and approached for consent.  Consent will occur prior to the initiati on of any 
study procedures at a scheduled clinic visit in the Gynecologic Oncology clinic s of 
participating sites . Potential participants will be provided a private setting for in -
person consent and will be adequately informed of the study intent, requirem ents, 
and potential risks and benefits.  Patients will also be informed that any 
participation is voluntary and will not affect any clinical care they are to receive. 
Research staff providing consent will be certified in Collaborative Institutional 
Trainin g Initiative (CITI) and Human Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

review the consent and ask any questions prior to signing consent.  
 
For secondary sites, additional a pproval will be obtained by [CONTACT_8236]’s local 
IRB.   
 
12.1  Data Collection Tools  
Data will be collected using clinical research forms (CRFs) followed by [CONTACT_564249] (REDCap) database. For data collected via 
iPad tablet or secured web link, data will be entered directly into a Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.   Research coordinators should 
verify all demographic and health history to  the participant’s medical records prior 
to entry into REDCap. REDCap is a secure, web -based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies. [19] REDCap provides: 1) secured 
interface for validated data entry, 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulations and 
data storage and export procedures, 3) automated export procedures for seamless 
data downloads to common statistical package s, and 4) procedures for importing 
data from external sources. The University of Colorado Denver Informational 
Technology (IT) department will provide the host services for the REDCap secure 
application. Data extracted from the database for analysis will d e-identified and 
linked to the original source using only a coded study number.  All analysis will be 
conducted using SPSS statistical software program.  UCD will serve as the 
coordinating site for all participating research sites. Data intake at all locat ions will 
be inputted directly into the lead REDCap database and all data analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_564250]. REDCap survey privileges will be 
restricted to the non -affiliated locations for data entry only.   
 
Study documents include s tudy consent, CRFs, and study surveys. A study file 
should be constructed for each participant for maintaining these documents.  All 
paper records will be securely stored in the locked research offices with limited 
access.  
 
Data sources will not be shared with outside institutions. Non -affiliated institutions 
participating in this study will only have access to the study resources for data 
entry.  Any final study results presented to the non -affiliated sites will be de -
identi fied.  Data shared among the researchers will be sent in encrypted email 
messages.  All data will be maintained until completion of study and properly stored 
per federal regulations after completion of study analysis.   
 
All research sites will be responsi ble for maintaining a subject log with the subjects 
name [CONTACT_564263]’s name [CONTACT_564264]. The study ID will serve as a link for participant 
and study data and will be used for data  verification. This will be done to maintain 
patient confidentiality.

13.2 Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for executing the safety 
monitoring  plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal 
authorities. This safety monitoring plan will be conducted via the use of a safety 
officer.  Th e safety officer will be a 3rd party reviewer, affiliated with the University 
of Colorado  Denver  but with no direct affiliation to the research study or the 
sponsor.  The safety officer will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_222241].  
This s tudy does not require a full data safety monitoring board since there are no 
investigational devices or treatment interventions in this study.

to change treatment assignment.  
   
Descriptive statistics using means, frequencies, and percentages will be computed 
to describe the study population.  Participant data will be analyzed employing the 
per protocol  approach.    Student’s t-test (for continuous variables) and chi-square 
tests (for categorical variables) will be used to compare the two groups for 
demographic, and secondary outcome variables : pain, scarring, QOL scores .  For 
the primary outcome measure  rate of recurrence for each of the study endpoints, 
3 months,  6 months and 12 months will be calculated per treatment arm and 
compared with initial bivariate analysis using chi—square analysis.  Additional 
predictors for recurrence (pain, scarring, sexual function, and general wellness) 
will be compared similarly wi th chi -square for categorical variables and t -tests for 
continuous variables. Potential covariates (age, race, previous disease, etc.) will 
also be analyzed using bi -variate analysis. Variables found to be significant in the 
bivariate analysis will be incl uded in multivariable analysis using logistic 
regression. Logistic regression models will be used to identify significant 
independent predictors associated with recurrence for each treatment arm . The 
logistic model will allow for control of study covariate s. A p-value of <0.05 will be 
used to demonstrate statistical significance.  IBM SPSS version 22 will be used for 
all statistical analyses.  
 
Incidence of AEs and SAEs will be compared between treatment arms using chi -
square analysis.  A p -value of <0.05 w ill be used to demonstrate statistical 
significance.   
 
14.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the study is recurrence of vulvar dysplasia. Recurrence 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_564254] . Further exam by [CONTACT_564255], per provider’s discretion.  All clinical 
guidelines for referring to colposcopy should be f ollowed, per standard of care.   
 
14.2  Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this study are as follows:  
 
Pain: Pain in the initial 7 -10 days following treatment will be self -assessed using 
a pain scale.  Average pain scores  and incidence of high -level of pain  will be 
determined for each treatment arm.   
 
Scarring: Scarring in the 6 weeks following treatment will be assessed via visual 
exam  by a study investigator . Incidence rates of scarring   will be determined 
for each treatment arm.   
  
Sexual function and sexual distraught: Sexual function and distraught will be 
assessed at baseline, 6 , and 12 months following treatment. Mean scores for

Ultrasonic Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. CO2 Laser Ablation  Version  04/12/202 1 
COMIRB # 16-0701  function and distraught will be determined for each t reatment arm per study 
time-point. Sexual function and distraught will be measured with validated 
instruments, The Female Sexual Function Index , and the Female Sexual 
Distress survey (Appendix 1.3 and 1.4).  
 
Wellness and Function : General wellness and fun ction  will be assessed at 
baseline, 6 , and 12 months following treatment. Mean scores for general 
function will be determined for each treatment arm per study time -point. 
Wellness will be measured using the validated instrument FACTS survey for 
vulvar mali gnancies (Appendix 1.2).

required to submit the protocol amendment to their local IRB and maintain all 
submission and approvals in their regulatory files.  Sites will not initiate any 
changes to study proc edures until after approval of the protocol amendment by 
[CONTACT_9918].  Insignificant changes (i.e. personnel changes) may not have to 
be submitted to the sponsor and/or lead site first.   
 
15.1.[ADDRESS_741184] an end 
of treatment visit.  If  after 3 attempts, the participant still does not return, a 
certified letter noting withdraw from study should be sent to the participant.  The 
study coordinator will maintain a return receipt for such.  Additionally, the study 
coordinator should send a se lf-addressed package to the participant for return 
of any study medications and/or study documents.

15.1.4 Clinical Monitoring  
Clinical monitoring of the study will be conducted by [CONTACT_2710] (data 
manager) from the University of Colorado Denver for all additional sites.  The 
University of Colorado will conduct their own audit and validation of study entry 
with internal research personnel through the Clinical Research Support Center .  
In order to conduct monitoring, study sites should make staff and r esources 
available for the following:  
• Initial in -service of the study site, including investigator training and site tour  
• Regular attendance of progress meetings  
• Research staff available for interim monitoring visits  
• All study documents (consents, CRFs, et ) available for site visits in which 
the monitor will verify accuracy of data as entered into the electronic database  
• Response to data requests via fax/email if site visit is not necessitated  
• Maintenance of all regulatory documents and accessible for monit or review 
(UCD may request these be sent to the lead site for regulatory maintenance)  
• Research staff available to response to data queries and resolve 
inconsistencies in study records  
• Close out of the study at the study site  
 
The study monitor will provide each site with a report of the monitor ing visit to 
be submitted to their local IRB.  In addition to monitoring visits, a monthly 
conference call will take place among all sites to discuss treatment outcomes, 
enrollment, significant toxicities, dose  modifications , and responses. These 
meetings will be documents and the minutes shared with all sites.  
 
Additionally, the University of Colorado DSMC may request a site audit to 
evaluate conduct and compliance of the investigational protocol as a study site.  
All study documents and regulatory documents must be available to audit.  The 
audit reviewer will also require direct access to study source (participant 
medical records relating to study) and time with the site investigator and/or 
regulatory personnel during their visit.

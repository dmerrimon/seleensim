 1 PURPOSE/HYPOTHESES  
1.1 Primary Hypothesis  
The primary hypothe sis is that Theracurmin  treatment can decrease the rate of Revised ALS 
Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R) progression by 50% relative to matched historical 
controls.  
1.2 Secondary Hypotheses 
Secondary hypotheses are as follows:  
1. Theracurmin  can increase the frequency of ALS reversals (defined by [CONTACT_367864] 4 or more points in t he ALSFRS -R over the course of 6 months ) 
from 2- 5% (obser ved spontaneously) to at least 10%.  
2. Theracurmin  can alter the fecal microbiome in patients with ALS.  
3. The fecal microbiome of  patients with ALS is significantly different from 
matched control subjects.  
4. The fecal microbiome of patients with ALS  is significantly different between 
subgroups with differi ng clinical features including sporadic vs. familial, 
anatomical location of sym ptom onset, and rate of progression as measured on the 
ASLFRS- R. 
5. The novel features of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_367850] 2 
participants per site per mo nth. 
6. The novel features of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_367851] 
22% at 12 months.  
7. The novel features of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_367852].  
2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Its Treatment  
ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that causes rapi[INVESTIGATOR_367853], disability and premature death. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a large number of attempted ALS trials, there are no significant disease -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_367854] (1).  
2.[ADDRESS_459887] been wrong. The hypotheses for many prior trials came from observations made in animal models of familial ALS (1). How well the  animal models predict human ALS, the vast majority 
of which is not familial, has been called into question (2). Second, the dosing in previous ALS trials may not have been adequate. Indeed, most ALS trials have not even employed pharmacodynamic biomarkers to test their dosing regimen (3). In addition to these problems, 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
5 
 ALS trials are often challenge d by [CONTACT_367865] (4) and poor retention (5). While some of the 
enrollment and retention issues may have to do with misconceptions on the part of enrolling 
clinicians and potential participants (4), patients with ALS do become more disabled over time, and study burdens , including trips to the study site , may eventually become impossible to bear.  
2.3 Success of Previous Hybrid Virtual /Remote Trial  
We previously conducted an open- label, single -center, hybrid -virtual 12 -month trial of Lunasin 
for patients with ALS (6). This single -center trial featured broad inclusion criteria, historical 
controls, mostly virtual data collection, and real- time results. Participants measured their 
ALSFRS- R score, weight and perceived efficacy, and recorded these monthly on Patien tsLikeMe 
(PLM; an online platform described section 2.7). ALSFRS- R decline was compared to historical 
controls. For each enrolled participant, PLM identified 3 historical controls matched according to pre-treatment ALSFRS- R progression, as in their previous Lithium study (7). We had 90% 
power to detect 50% slowing in decline of ALSFRS -R scores.  
Although there were no significant differences in ALSFRS -R (p=0.99) between study 
participants and historical controls, the study’s outcomes suggested that there is utility and internal validity in a virtual trial model. Enrollment rate was 9.[ADDRESS_459888] ALS trials, our 50 participants were primarily wh ite (94%) males (58%), mean age of 60, limb onset disease (82%), taking 
riluzole (60%). However, our participants had longer disease duration than those in most trials, and several had non- invasive ventilation, PEG and/or tracheostomy, which are traditiona l 
exclusion criteria. This trial population was therefore more representative of the population seen in ALS clinics.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_367855], the survivor retention rate was 84%, while the survivor retention ra te in traditional ALS trials is 78% 
(5).  
We also looked at the accuracy of patient recorded ALSFRS- R and weight measurements. Lin’s 
concordance (C) showed high agreement between coordinator and participant derived ALSFRS -
R and weight respectively at month 1 (C=0.9939, 0.9947) and month 12 visits (C=0.9428, 0.9905). These results suggest that participant recorded ALSFRS -R scores and weight are 
sufficiently accurate to be used in a clinical trial.  
Compliance with study protocol (assessed by [CONTACT_367866] 2 of the 3 key outcomes) was 88% or greater for each of the first 6 months, but then began to decline , eventually reaching only 55% at [ADDRESS_459889] many bioactive properties . It is widely available as a dietary supplement in multiple 
formulations  from many commercial companies (8). The treatment  Theracurmin  utilized in this 
study is a form ulation  of curcumin ( see section 3.2.1) .

 2.5 ALS Reversals on Curcumin 
ALSUntangled is a consortium of ALS clinicians and researchers that review alternative and off -
label treatments on behalf of  patients with ALS ( 9). ALSUntangled recently reported on 3 
patients with a validated diagnosis of ALS, whom experienced an ALS reversal while taking a 
supplement regimen containing curcumin ( 8). Several other patients with ALS have also reported 
improvements on a curcumin regimens , though records were not  obtainable t o validate these ( 8). 
2.[ADDRESS_459890] published a review describ ing multiple biological mechanisms through whic h curcumin 
could influence  ALS  progression (8).  In this study we are going to focus Theracurmin’s 
potential effects on the fecal microbiome.  
2.6.1 Alterations of the Fecal Microbiome 
As in Parkinson’s disease (1 0), there is increasing recent evidence that abnormalities in the gut 
microbiome may play a role in ALS pathophysiology.  In a mouse model of ALS, for example, 
dysbiosis and impaired intestinal tight junctions and permeability occur before symptom onset 
(11).  Altering the mouse microbiome via germ -free conditions, broad spectrum antibiotics or 
introduction of specific bacteria (Ruminococcus torques  or Purabacteroides dist asonis)  
exacerbate the ALS phenotype ( 12).  On the other hand, feeding the mice butyrate ( 13), a natural 
product of a healthy microbiome, or introduction of other specific bacteria ( Akkermansia 
muciniphilia ) (12) improve the ALS phenotype.  Alteration of t he intestinal microbiome in a 
worm model of ALS can also improve motor function ( 14).  Three studies suggest that people 
with ALS have altered intestinal microbiomes compared to healthy controls ( 12, 15, 16); a fourth 
small study did not find such a differ ence ( 17). 
The curcumin formulation used in Theracurmin has been shown to have the capability of altering 
the fecal microbiome in mice ( 18).  If curcumin can lead to a more favorable  fecal microbiome 
profile in patients with ALS, it may help to slow or rev erse ALS progression.  
2.7 PatientsLikeMe 
PatientsLikeMe® (PLM; www.patientslikeme.com) is an online platform that has demonstrated an ability to engage patients in learning about their conditions and building a large quantitative and qualitative database about patients’ experiences of their conditions. PLM is a patient network with over 300,000 members comprising over 2000 different conditions founded by a family affected by [CONTACT_367867], and to date has conducted over  30 published studies in ALS including studying 
patient use of off -label treatments. Members who join the site with ALS are asked to complete a 
number of data fields including demographics, disease condition history, treatments, symptoms, weight, treatment evaluations and lab measurements (e.g. weight, for ced vital capacity). In 
addition, a unique feature of the site is the ability of patients to complete a widely used patient reported outcome, the ALS Functional Rating Scale , Revised  (ALSFRS- R) which allows patients 
to see their disease progression in cont ext in visual form. Data capture is facilitated by a team of 
PhD scientists, nurses, and pharmacists that incorporate information from various medical databases (e.g. RxNorm, ICD -10, MEDDRA). The  site also provides means of social support 
through a message  board forum, private messages, and profile commenting. Online methods of 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
[ADDRESS_459891] the potential to dramatically accelerate trial recruitment, provide more 
convenient means of data capture for patients, and minimize trial complexity by [CONTACT_367868] a placebo control group. Our previous lunasin study (see section 2.3) was conducted on the PLM platform  and we will continue to utilize the PLM platform for this 
study.  
3 DESIGN & PROCEDURES:  
3.1 Design Overview  
This will b e a 6-month, widely inclusive, largely remote/virtual, single -center, open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_367856] a historical control group. Following informed consent and screening, participants will take the intervention (see section 3.2.1) for [ADDRESS_459892] the opportunity to review  PLM ’s terms and conditions 
(Appendix A) as well as their privacy policy (Appendix B ). After the baseline video/telephone 
visit, partici pants will be asked to enter the following data: weight  and height , Theracurmin  
treatment evaluation s (Appendix C ), ALSFRS- R score (Appendix D ) and Thrive Questionnaire s 
(Appendix E). Participants will be given the following study documents and material s shipped to 
their home:   
A PLM  bag ( Appendix F ) including:  
1. Welcome letter (Appendix G ) 
2. Study One -Sheet (Appendix H ) 
3. Study drug  
4. Microbiome kits  
5. PatientsLikeMe gifts  
3.2 Study Drug  
3.2.1 Theracurmin HP 
The intervention is based on the  twice daily dosage of Theracurmin 90 mg capsules used in a 
trial of patients with mild cognitive impairment ( 19). This dosage is similar to that used in a trial 
of patients with ALS  using similar bioavailable version of curcumin ( 20). Our 6- month 
intervention consists of Theracurmin HP capsules containing 90 mg curcumin each that will be 
taken as one capsule twice daily. Each capsule contains 300 mg Theracurmin enhanced bioavailable water -dispersible turmeric rhizome complex providing 30% curc umin (90 mg). The 
content of Theracurmin HP has been independently certified by [CONTACT_367869]/ANSI 173 ( 21). 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
[ADDRESS_459893] Theracurmin HP (referred to as Theracurmin throughout) will be obtained from 
Integrative Therapeuti c (22). Products will be stored in [CONTACT_367892]’s locked office at Duke 
University. At enrollment into the study, participants will be sent a 2- month supply of product. 
After the Week 3 video/telephone visit, participants will be sent an additional [ADDRESS_459894] health care professionals.  
3.2.3 Dose Adjustments and Holidays 
The investigator may temporarily reduce or stop administering the Theracurmin  for adverse 
events. If the adverse event is mild or moderate, the dose may be reduced to 90mg once a day until the event improves. The investigator may then choose to resume the dosage of 90mg twice a day or  maintain the participant at redu ced dose. If a related event is serious or life threatening, 
the Theracurmin should be stopped and will not be re -challenged. One drug holiday will be 
allowed; the holiday can last no more than [ADDRESS_459895] 2 cycles of infusions  before 
enrolling.  
3.3 Outcome Measures  
3.3.1 ALSFRS- R 
The ALSFRS- R will be determined at all video/telephone visits (Appendix D ). ALSFRS -R is a 
quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0 -4) used to determ ine patients' 
assessments of their capability and independence in 1 2 functional activities. All 1 2 activities are 
relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established in ALS patients by [CONTACT_367870]- R scores correlated with change in strength over time, and it was closely associated 
with quality of life meas ures and predicted survival ( 23). The test -retest reliability is greater than 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
9 
 0.88 for all 13 items. The ALSFRS -R declines linearly with time over a wide range during the 
course of ALS. Recent work has shown that the measure can be conducted over the phone ( 24), 
and it can even be reliably conducted and recorded online by [CONTACT_164472] ( 25). The 
ALSFRS- R will be administered to participants over video /telephone  by [CONTACT_367871]. During this visit, the coordinator will also teach participants how 
to complete this measure themselves and to use the EM interface  to record it.  C alls from the 
coordinator will be made at weeks 1, [ADDRESS_459896] on their PLM  profile once every 30 days.  
3.3.2 Participant Subjective Treatment Evaluation 
At all PLM  virtual visits, participants will be asked to evaluate the interv ention. They will be 
asked to provide information  on perceived effectiveness, side effects, adherence, burden, 
unexpected positive effects, and advice & tips regarding the treatment (Appendix C ).  They will 
also be asked to complete Thrive Questionnaires  to assess their quality of life (Appendix E ). 
3.3.[ADDRESS_459897] saliva and fecal samples and send by [CONTACT_367872]. Research personnel will deidentify the samples of any personally identifiable information (PII) and subsequently submit them to the Duke Microbiome  Core 
(https://genome.duke.edu/cores -and-services/microbiome -shared -resource) for sample 
processing and preparation for biospecimens for long term archiving at the Duke University BioBank. The Duke Microbiome Core will perform DNA extraction, sequencing li brary 
preparation, and 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Data analysis of the 
deidentified microbiome sequencing data will be conducted in collaboration with the Duke University Microbiome Center (DMC). Data will be compared within subjec ts with ALS to 
assess possible changes over the length of the study and identify microbial correlates of disease progression. Fecal microbiome data at enrollment, week [ADDRESS_459898]. Raphael  Valdivia  at the Duke Department of Molecular 
Genetics and Microbiology, will perform metagenomic analysis of deidentified selected fecal samples from patients that positivel y respond to Theracurmin to achieve strain level 
identification of microbes positively and negatively associated with improved outcomes.  His 
group will also culture selected anaerobes (eg.  Akkermansia muciniphila) that have been linked 
to ALS severity for  further genetic sand phenotypic characterization.

 3.3.5 Enrollment Rate 
Enrollment rate will be calculated as the number of participants enrolled per month. A previous 
meta -analysis showed the mean ALS trial en rollment rate to be 2.2 participants per site per 
month (4).  Our previous Lunasin trial had an enrollment rate of 9 participants per site per month 
(6). 
3.3.6 Retention 
Retention will be assessed by [CONTACT_367873] 6 months (the percentage of surviving enrolled patients who complete the Month 6 Visit). A previous meta -analysis of 
traditional clinical trials showed the mean ALS participant dropout rate to be 22% at 12 months (5). Our previous virtual trial with Lunasin had a dropout rate of 16% at 12 months (6). 
3.4 Study Schedule 
Following informed consent and screening, enrollment visit activities will commence and 
Therarcurmin treatment will be started.  T reatment and all study activities will end at month 6. 
Partici pants will be required to make 4 video/telephone visits  with the Duke study team 
(enrollment , weeks 1, 2, and 3) . Participants will not be required to make any physical visits to 
Duke. At months 2- 6, participants will make “Internet PLM  visits” by [CONTACT_367874]- R score and wei ght and height , and logging ont o the PLM website to record it as well 
as perceived efficacy, perceived side effects, perceived compliance , changes in concomitant 
medications  and Thrive questionnaires . Participants will be reminded to log into their PLM  
profile and record the above -mentioned data points via email  and text reminders from PLM . The 
study coordinator will call /video  participants at enrollment, weeks , 1, 2, [ADDRESS_459900] not entered data for 2 weeks beyond expected entries . 
The call script for such communications can be found in Appendix I . 
3.4.1 Screening/ Enrollment/ Baseline Video/Telephone Visits  
During the enrollment visit(s) (can be one or two visits depending on patient preference and 
tolerance), participants will be consented. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be reviewed to 
ensure the participant qualifies. Participants will be taught to s elf- administer the ALSFRS -R 
(23). Participants will be taught to register for an account o n the website PLM  and taught to enter 
their ALSFRS -R, perceived efficacy, compliance, adverse events and concomitant medications. 
The participant will complete/enter their current ALSFR S-R and weight  and height  in PLM  
during this visit. The ALSFRS -R has previously been validated for similar online use by [CONTACT_1962] 
(25).  
3.4.2 Week 1, 2,3 Video/Telephone Visits 
During the Week 1, 2, and 3 video/telephone  the study coordinator will confirm that participants 
are logging into the PLM  site and entering data without difficulty. The coordinator will measure 
an ALSFRS -R by [CONTACT_367875] -generated score. Differences will be 
reconciled as part of the teaching process.  
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
[ADDRESS_459901] not e ntered data within 7 days of a visit, they will receive a reminder email and 
text from PLM (Appendix I). If they still have not entered data after another 7 days, they will receive a reminder call from the study coordinator.

Risk associated with participation in the Duke or PLM database include loss of confidentiality. Risks of logging into Internet for any website including P LM include inadvertently downloading 
malicious software such as viruses that could put personal information or computer integrity at risk. These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_367881] (see below).  
Participants will be provided with contact [CONTACT_367882]. All sites will have an appropriate staff member available [ADDRESS_459908] benefit to the volunteers other than altruism (knowledge that they are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_367859], and potentially helpi[INVESTIGATOR_367860]). No at risk populations such as minors, prisoners, pregnant women, or cognitively impaired adults will be included in this study. Patients who elect not to participate will have standard of care 
options for their ALS including participation in [CONTACT_367892]’s multi- disciplinary ALS clinic and 
the drug riluzole.

4 DATA ANALYSIS & STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
4.1.1 Historical Controls 
For each enrolled participan t, three matched historical controls will be identified from the 
PatientsLikeMe database. Participants will be matched according to their ALSFRS -R 
progression rate before they start on the Theracurmin (estimated by [CONTACT_367883] 48 on the date of symptom onset). Full details of the matching process are described in 
a previous paper  (7). 
4.1.[ADDRESS_459910] comparing the ALSFRS -R progression rate in our 
participants to a gro up of matched historical controls identified from the PatientsLikeMe 
community. This type of analysis has previously been used to look for treatment effects in 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
15 
 patients with ALS taking lithium (7 ), dexpramipexole and vari ous forms of sodium chlorite ( 29) 
and lunasin (6). We made the following assumptions to calculate a sample size requirement for 
this analysis: 
1. The mean ALS -FRS progression in 12 months is 11 points (rate of ~0.9 
points/month) and the standard deviation at 12 months is ~8 ALS -FRS 
points (est imates based on unpublished data from PatientsLikeMe.)  
2. The effect size we are looking for is to halve the mean progression rate  
3. The treatment is not having a harmful effect (allows us to use a one- tailed 
comparison)  
4. There is a 5% chance of seeing an effect  this big by [CONTACT_29745]  
5. We desire a 90% chance of finding an effect this big, assuming it is real  
6. There will be a dropout rate of 15% over 6 months. We had a 16% 
survivor drop- out rate over 12 months in our prior Lunasin trial (6).  
Based on these assumpt ions we will again need to enroll 50 participants (and compare them to 50 
matched historical controls).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_459911] is 2- 5% (30 ). We will 
look for an increase  in this frequency to at least 10% (1 in 1 0). 
4.1.4 Enrollment  
To determine whether the participant enrollment  rate in this study is greater than in studies with 
more traditional designs, we will compare our enrollment rate (participants enrolled per month) to the mean ALS trial enrollment rate of 2 (4) using a chi- squared test.  
4.1.5 Retention 
To determine whether part icipant retention in this study is greater than in studies with more 
traditional designs we will compare our dropout rate (percentage of living enrolled participants that complete the Month 6 Visit) to the mean ALS participant dropout rate of 22% at 12 months (5) using a chi -squared test.  
4.1.6 Microbiome Analyses 
We will compare saliva and stool microbiome samples between patients with ALS and healthy controls at every sampling point.  We will compare the changes in the saliva and stool microbiome over time in patients with ALS on Theracur min to the changes observed in untreated 
healthy controls.  We will compare the enrollment saliva and stool microbiome across patients with different ALS origins (sporadic versus familial), onset regions (limb versus bulbar) and  
ALSFRS- R progression rates.  
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
16 
 Raw, 16S microbiome sequencing data will undergo processing & strict quality control using the 
Qiime2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] (31).  Dada2 (32) will be used to infer and quantify amplicon sequence variants 
(ASVs).  Taxonomy information will b e assigned to the ASVs using the q2- feature -classifier 
(33) a gainst the SILVA 132 database (34)   Initial analyses of the data will focus on associations 
between the diversity of the microflora environment to ALS patients relative to the control samples as well as between the different forms of ALS.  We will employ four different metrics for calculating within -sample diversity (alpha diversities: Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, 
Shannon index, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_182584]’s evenness, and the total number of ASVs) and four different metrics for calculating between -sample diversities (beta diversities: Bray -Curtis dissimilarity, Jaccard 
dissimilarity, UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac).  To identify associations between alpha diversity metrics and ALS, we will employ linear mixed -effects models with household as a random 
effect.  Beta diversity indices will also be evaluated using mixed -effect modeling using the vegan 
package from the R statistical programming environment.  The PhyloSeq (35) package will be employed to test for differential abundance of individual taxa between ALS patients and the control samples. In brief, raw ASV counts will be agglomerated in Family, Genus, and Species level data before being normalized by [CONTACT_941] ‘poscounts’ function from DESeq2 (36).  Negative binomial linear models will then be used to identify differential abundance of microflora at the varied taxonomic  ranks.  Performing all analyses in a linear model framework will allow us to 
control for potential cofactors such as patient antibiotics usage, age, and gender.  The false discovery rate will be used to control for multiple hypothesis testing.   
5 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1 Adverse Events Monitoring  
All adverse events (AEs), whether observed by [CONTACT_737], elicited from the participant or volunteered by [CONTACT_2299], and whether ascribed to the drug or not, will be recorded. This will include the following: a brief description of the event, the date of onset, the date of resolution, the duration and type of the event, the severity, contributing factor s and any action 
taken with respect to the study drug. This recording will commence with the institution of protocol -specific procedures (including any pretreatment procedures) and continue at each study 
visit or telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_107990] [ADDRESS_459912] study related visit.  
For each adverse event, the relationship to the study drug will be recorded as one of the choices on the following scale:  
DEFINITE Causal relationship is certain (i.e., the temporal relationship between drug 
exposure and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de -challenge, other causes have been eliminated and the event must be 
definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically using a satisfactory re -challenge 
procedure if nec essary).  
PROBABLE High degree of certainty for causal relationship (i.e., the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de- challenge [re- challenge is not requi red] and 
other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely). 
Clinical Protocol  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_367849], MD, PhD  
17 
 POSSIBLE  Causal relationship is uncertain (i.e., the temporal relationship between drug 
exposure and the adverse event onset/course is reasonable or unknown, de -challenge/re -
challenge information is either unknown or equivocal and while other potential causes 
may or may not exist, a causal relationship to the study drug does not appear probable).  
UNLIKELY Not reasonably related, although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out (i.e., while the t emporal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event 
onset/course does not preclude causality, there is a clear alternate cause that is more likely to have caused the adverse event than the study drug).  
NOT RELATED No possible relationship (i.e ., the temporal relationship between drug 
exposure and the adverse event onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is implausible).  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as one of the choices on the following scale:  
MILD  No limitation of usual activities  
MODERATE Some limitation of usual activities  
SEVERE I nability to carry out usual activities  
The expectedness of an AE must be indicated when reporting adverse events. An unexpected adverse event is any adverse experience for which the specificity or severity of the event is not 
consistent with the known side effects of Theracurmin (or similar curcumin products), as described in section 3.9 above. 
5.1.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse drug event (SAE) is defined as any adverse event that occurs during the study that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life - threatening adverse event (i.e., the 
participant was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; does not include an event, that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death), inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367861] a pre -existing condition which has not 
worsened during participation in the study will not be considered a serious adverse event), a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one's ability to conduct normal life functions), a congenital anomaly/birth defect, a medically important event or required medical intervention to avoid one of the above outcomes. In addition to the above procedures for AEs, all SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of recording. All serious adver se 
event information will be followed until resolution or an appropriate end point is reached. This may involve contact[CONTACT_367884]’s care to obtain information on diagnoses, investigations performed and treatment gi ven 
Fatal or life -threatening, unexpected adverse events will be reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_756], 
facsimile, or in writing as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_459913] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034] -investigator. Serious, unexpected advers e events that are not fatal or

[ADDRESS_459914] knowledge by [CONTACT_456] -investigator.  
5.2 Data & Safety monitoring 
Adverse events will be tracked throughout the study as described above and below. There is no 
formal safety monitoring plan or DSMB, nor are there any formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_367862]. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_459915] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_367863] (SI) is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source docu ments and discrepancies should be explained.  
5.2.2 Global Unique Identifier (GUID)  
A patient Global Unique Identifier (GUID) will be used as an identifier.  The GUID is an 11 -
character string that is generated using encryption technology and algorithms licensed by [CONTACT_367885] (NIH).  
The GUID is generated on a secure website that utilizes 128 -bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL). The 
GUID is generated using an irreversible encryption algorithm – it accepts twelve identifying data 
elemen ts, (e.g. last name [CONTACT_133113], first name [CONTACT_133113], gender at birth, day, month and year of 
birth, city and country of birth, etc.), and produces a unique random -generated character string, 
or GUID. No identifying information is stored in the system; it is simply used to generate the 
GUID. If the same information is entered again, the same GUID will be returned.  
Participants will be given the option to opt out of sharing their de -identified information across 
studies .

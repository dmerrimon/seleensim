2.0 BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
 
AML is the cause of approximate ly 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the US with an annual incidence 
rate of 2.[ADDRESS_553334] e < 20 years to > 10 per 100, 000 in the elderly. AML 
represents approximately 90% of a ll acute leukemias in adults, and accounts for about 25% of all 
cases of leukemia diagnosed in the Western hemisphere.
1,[ADDRESS_553335]-line treatment induce complete remissions in a majority (55% to 75%) of patients. Standard consolidation therapy with high d oses of cytarabine leads to 
improved survival in younger pa tients.  Overall, up to 70% of p atients can be expected to 
relapse, so that only about 20-30%  attain long-term disease-fre e survival. 
 Two major problems in the treat ment of AML remain: primary resi stant/refractory disease and 
high risk of relapse/recurrent d isease.  While newer drug combi nations and higher doses of 
therapy may begin to address upfro nt resistant disease, there a re very few options, with the 
exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, for long ter m maintenance of remission after 
consolidation.  In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), maintena nce therapy has become a 
standard part of treatment and ha s contributed to long term dur able remissions and cures.  
Results of studies of maintenan ce therapy in AML have been mixe d. In early studies by [CONTACT_1345]
3,[ADDRESS_553336] survived the 
induction therapy and are the sour ce of relapses would be presu mably resistant to ‘more of the 
same’.  Newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], employi ng different mechanisms of acti on are less likely to be cross-
resistant to the initial cytotoxic induction regimens.  For exa mple, Brune et. al.11 studied an 
immunotherapy approach investiga ting an IL2 + histamine mainten ance therapy.  A cohort of 
320 patients in CR1 or greater were randomized to receive 10 cy cles of IL2+histamine vs. no 
treatment.  At 3 years, the maint enance arm had a significant improvement in leukemia-free 
survival.11  Lenalidomide, a non-cytotoxic drug with activity in AML, has multiple unique 
mechanisms of action including immune modulation and alteration  of intracellular signaling and 
may be an ideal candidate for long t erm maintenance in this dis ease. 
 
As a background, we know that AML patients (young and old) with : (1)primary refractory 
disease, (2)adverse cytogenetics, (3)FLT3 positive disease, (4) antecedent hematologic disorder, 
and (in relapsed patients) (5) short CR1 duration have a high risk of relapse, despi[INVESTIGATOR_436754].  If these patients are not  candidates for transplant, we are 
often beholden to “watch and wait” until their leukemia relapse s.  In this setting, a long term, low 
intensity, easy to administer, a nd effective antileukemia treat ment needs to be developed.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to ha ve single-agent activity in AM L as a higher dose induction 
followed by a longer term, lower dose maintenance strategy.12  Lenalidomide, in the treatment of 
myelodysplastic syndrome MDS and multiple myeloma (MM) has been  shown to be safe during 
continuous, long term administrati on (MM, MDS) as well as in a maintenance strategy (MM).  
 
2.2 Lenalidomide in AML 
 
Lenalidomide, a derivative of tha lidomide is currently approved  for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) and MDS (myelodyspl astic syndrome), but has been s hown to have single-agent 
activity in AML as an inducti on – maintenance strategy.  In a phase II trial of older patients (age 
≥ 60 yrs) with untreated AML, lenalidomide was given at a high ‘induction’ dose, of 50 mg 
orally daily on a 28 day cycle ( for up to 2 induction cycles), followed by a lower ‘maintenance’ 
dose of 10 mg orally daily for up to 12 months.  The CR/CRi rat e was 30% overall and 53% in 
patients who completed all of the high-dose therapy.12  The median CR duration was 10 months 
(1 – 17+ months).  The treatment w as well tolerated in this coh ort of patients, with the most 
common grade 3-4 toxicities be ing myelosuppression and infectio n.  Based on this data of single 
agent activity in AML and its longer-term use in AML, MDS, and MM we propose to use this as 
a maintenance strategy for higher-risk patients who are in remi ssion after induction/consolidation 
therapy.  The exact mechanism of action of lenalidomide is not known, but may involve immunomodulatory activity and reversal of an immunosuppressive environment present in 
Protocol 2014-[ADDRESS_553337] cytotoxicity, secreti on of cytokines, and by [CONTACT_436765] g other immune cells (T-cells, 
dendritic cells) to mount anti-tumor immunity.15,17,[ADDRESS_553338] responded to induction/ consolidation chemotherapy 
and are not immediately candidates for BMT.  From our own data,  the expected relapse free 
survival in this cohort of younger patients with higher risk di sease who do not proceed for stem 
cell transplant is 8.5 months.  Approximately 25% of these patients may become eligible for and proceed to transplant, but the majority are left without meaningful therapy until relapse.  Based on published data, NK cells are important mediators of im mune surveillance, particularly 
in AML.  In addition to affecting direct cytotoxicity of AML blasts, NK cells may also alter the cytokine and immune cell (eg. T-lymphocytes) milieu to favor an ti-leukemia immunity.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to enhance NK cell activity and num bers – making it an important 
agent to study in a setting of low disease burden (ie. minimal residual disease after 
chemotherapy).  As part of the clinical trial, we also aim to s tudy the effects of lenalidomide on 
NK cell activity – both at baseline (prior to lenalidomide trea tment) and at several time points 
during treatment.  This will help us  derive more insight into t he actions of lenalidomide on NK 
cell activity and how it relates to maintenance of remission in  patients with AML. 
 The rationale for the selected dos ing of lenalidomide maintenan ce is drawn from previous 
experience in chronic dosing of len alidomide for maintenance strategy.  In the AML experience 
described above, Fehniger, et. a l. treated patients in the main tenance phase with 10 mg orally

  daily.  In multiple myeloma maintenance studies,24,25 lenalidomide was dosed at 10 – [ADDRESS_553339] therefore been sh own to be safe and active in a 
long-term dosing strategy. 
   
2.5 Lenalidomide 
 
Background  
Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corpora tion.  IMiD® compounds 
have both immunomodulatory and an ti-angiogenic properties which  could confer antitumor and 
antimetastatic effects.  Lenali domide has been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity 
through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothel ial cell migration, due at 
least in part to inhibition of A kt phosphorylation response to bFGF.
[ADDRESS_553340] antitumor mech anism of action of lenalidomid e is unknown, a number of 
mechanisms are postulated to be res ponsible for lenalidomide’s activity against multiple 
myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell prolif eration, which leads to an 
increase in IL-[ADDRESS_553341] in mu ltiple myeloma cell lines and 
in multiple myeloma cells of patients resistant to melphalan, d oxorubicin and dexamethasone.  
Indications and Usage: Revlimid
® (lenalidomide) is indicated for the treatment of patients with  transfusion-dependent 
anemia due to Low- or Intermediat e-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 
5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenet ic abnormalities.  Revlimid® is 
also approved in combination with d examethasone for the treatme nt of patients with multiple 
myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.  Revlimid is also for the treatment of 
patients with mantle cell lymphoma  (MCL)whose disease has relap sed or progressed after two 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], one of w hich included bortezomib.

Lenalidomide Description 
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-
angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2 H-isoindol-2-yl) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510]-2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structur e:

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pa le-yellow solid powder. It is  soluble in organic solvent/water 
mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more s oluble in organic solvents and 
low pH solutions. Solubility was  significantly lower in less ac idic buffers, ranging from about 
0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically 
active forms S(-) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixtur e with a net optical rotation of 
zero. 
Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lena lidomide remains to be fully cha racterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and an tiangiogenic properties.  Lena lidomide inhibited the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cyt okines and increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral bl ood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomid e inhibited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lin es.  Of cell lines tested, 
lenalidomide was effective in i nhibiting growth of Namalwa cell s (a human B cell lymphoma 
Protocol 2014-0116 
January 18, 2018

  cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth 
of KG-1 cells (human myeloblasti c cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and 
other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro.   
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
Absorption: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers , is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_436755] 0.[ADDRESS_553342]-dose. 
Co-administration with food does not  alter the extent of absorp tion (AUC) but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic  disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax a nd AUC increase proportionately w ith increases in dose. Multiple 
dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the phase I 
studies.  Absorption was found t o be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maximum 
blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels ( 5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No 
plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  P lasma lenalidomide declined in 
a monophasic manner with elimi nation half-life ranging from 2.8  to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 
28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall  plasma concentrations were  dose proportional over the dosing 
range of 5mg to 50mg Error! Reference source not found. .  Exposure (AUC) in multiple 
myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.   
 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Distribution 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma  proteins is approximately 30% . 
 
Metabolism and Excretion 
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been st udied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two-thirds of len alidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerul ar filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active.  
Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.

2.0 BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
 
AML is the cause of approximate ly 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the US with an annual incidence 
rate of 2.[ADDRESS_553349] e < 20 years to > 10 per 100, 000 in the elderly. AML 
represents approximately 90% of a ll acute leukemias in adults, and accounts for about 25% of all 
cases of leukemia diagnosed in the Western hemisphere.
1,[ADDRESS_553350]-line treatment induce complete remissions in a majority (55% to 75%) of patients. Standard consolidation therapy with high d oses of cytarabine leads to 
improved survival in younger pa tients.  Overall, up to 70% of p atients can be expected to 
relapse, so that only about 20-30%  attain long-term disease-fre e survival. 
 Two major problems in the treat ment of AML remain: primary resi stant/refractory disease and 
high risk of relapse/recurrent d isease.  While newer drug combi nations and higher doses of 
therapy may begin to address upfro nt resistant disease, there a re very few options, with the 
exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, for long ter m maintenance of remission after 
consolidation.  In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), maintena nce therapy has become a 
standard part of treatment and ha s contributed to long term dur able remissions and cures.  
Results of studies of maintenan ce therapy in AML have been mixe d. In early studies by [CONTACT_1345]

induction therapy and are the sour ce of relapses would be presu mably resistant to ‘more of the 
same’.  Newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], employi ng different mechanisms of acti on are less likely to be cross-
resistant to the initial cytotoxic induction regimens.  For exa mple, Brune et. al.11 studied an 
immunotherapy approach investiga ting an IL2 + histamine mainten ance therapy.  A cohort of 
320 patients in CR1 or greater were randomized to receive 10 cy cles of IL2+histamine vs. no 
treatment.  At 3 years, the maint enance arm had a significant improvement in leukemia-free 
survival.11  Lenalidomide, a non-cytotoxic drug with activity in AML, has multiple unique 
mechanisms of action including immune modulation and alteration  of intracellular signaling and 
may be an ideal candidate for long t erm maintenance in this dis ease. 
 
As a background, we know that AML patients (young and old) with : (1)primary refractory 
disease, (2)adverse cytogenetics, (3)FLT3 positive disease, (4) antecedent hematologic disorder, 
and (in relapsed patients) (5) short CR1 duration have a high risk of relapse, despi[INVESTIGATOR_436754].  If these patients are not  candidates for transplant, we are 
often beholden to “watch and wait” until their leukemia relapse s.  In this setting, a long term, low 
intensity, easy to administer, a nd effective antileukemia treat ment needs to be developed.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to ha ve single-agent activity in AM L as a higher dose induction 
followed by a longer term, lower dose maintenance strategy.12  Lenalidomide, in the treatment of 
myelodysplastic syndrome MDS and multiple myeloma (MM) has been  shown to be safe during 
continuous, long term administrati on (MM, MDS) as well as in a maintenance strategy (MM).  
 
2.2 Lenalidomide in AML 
 
Lenalidomide, a derivative of tha lidomide is currently approved  for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) and MDS (myelodyspl astic syndrome), but has been s hown to have single-agent 
activity in AML as an inducti on – maintenance strategy.  In a phase II trial of older patients (age 
≥ 60 yrs) with untreated AML, lenalidomide was given at a high ‘induction’ dose, of 50 mg 
orally daily on a 28 day cycle ( for up to 2 induction cycles), followed by a lower ‘maintenance’ 
dose of 10 mg orally daily for up to 12 months.  The CR/CRi rat e was 30% overall and 53% in 
patients who completed all of the high-dose therapy.12  The median CR duration was 10 months 
(1 – 17+ months).  The treatment w as well tolerated in this coh ort of patients, with the most 
common grade 3-4 toxicities be ing myelosuppression and infectio n.  Based on this data of single 
agent activity in AML and its longer-term use in AML, MDS, and MM we propose to use this as 
a maintenance strategy for higher-risk patients who are in remi ssion after induction/consolidation 
therapy.  The exact mechanism of action of lenalidomide is not known, but may involve immunomodulatory activity and reversal of an immunosuppressive environment present in 
Protocol 2014-[ADDRESS_553352] cytotoxicity, secreti on of cytokines, and by [CONTACT_436765] g other immune cells (T-cells, 
dendritic cells) to mount anti-tumor immunity.15,17,[ADDRESS_553353] responded to induction/ consolidation chemotherapy 
and are not immediately candidates for BMT.  From our own data,  the expected relapse free 
survival in this cohort of younger patients with higher risk di sease who do not proceed for stem 
cell transplant is 8.5 months.  Approximately 25% of these patients may become eligible for and proceed to transplant, but the majority are left without meaningful therapy until relapse.  Based on published data, NK cells are important mediators of im mune surveillance, particularly 
in AML.  In addition to affecting direct cytotoxicity of AML blasts, NK cells may also alter the cytokine and immune cell (eg. T-lymphocytes) milieu to favor an ti-leukemia immunity.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to enhance NK cell activity and num bers – making it an important 
agent to study in a setting of low disease burden (ie. minimal residual disease after 
chemotherapy).  As part of the clinical trial, we also aim to s tudy the effects of lenalidomide on 
NK cell activity – both at baseline (prior to lenalidomide trea tment) and at several time points 
during treatment.  This will help us  derive more insight into t he actions of lenalidomide on NK 
cell activity and how it relates to maintenance of remission in  patients with AML. 
 The rationale for the selected dos ing of lenalidomide maintenan ce is drawn from previous 
experience in chronic dosing of len alidomide for maintenance strategy.  In the AML experience

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pa le-yellow solid powder. It is  soluble in organic solvent/water 
mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more s oluble in organic solvents and 
low pH solutions. Solubility was  significantly lower in less ac idic buffers, ranging from about 
0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically 
active forms S(-) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixtur e with a net optical rotation of 
zero. 
Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lena lidomide remains to be fully cha racterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and an tiangiogenic properties.  Lena lidomide inhibited the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cyt okines and increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral bl ood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomid e inhibited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lin es.  Of cell lines tested, 
lenalidomide was effective in i nhibiting growth of Namalwa cell s (a human B cell lymphoma

  cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth 
of KG-1 cells (human myeloblasti c cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and 
other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro.   
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
Absorption: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers , is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_436755] 0.[ADDRESS_553357]-dose. 
Co-administration with food does not  alter the extent of absorp tion (AUC) but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic  disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax a nd AUC increase proportionately w ith increases in dose. Multiple 
dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the phase I 
studies.  Absorption was found t o be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maximum 
blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels ( 5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No 
plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  P lasma lenalidomide declined in 
a monophasic manner with elimi nation half-life ranging from 2.8  to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 
28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall  plasma concentrations were  dose proportional over the dosing 
range of 5mg to 50mg Error! Reference source not found. .  Exposure (AUC) in multiple 
myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.   
 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Distribution 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma  proteins is approximately 30% . 
 
Metabolism and Excretion 
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been st udied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two-thirds of len alidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerul ar filtration rate and therefore is partially or entirely active.  
Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.

2.0 BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
 
AML is the cause of approximate ly 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the US with an annual incidence 
rate of 2.[ADDRESS_553363] e < 20 years to > 10 per 100, 000 in the elderly. AML 
represents approximately 90% of a ll acute leukemias in adults, and accounts for about 25% of all 
cases of leukemia diagnosed in the Western hemisphere.
1,[ADDRESS_553364]-line treatment induce complete remissions in a majority (55% to 75%) of patients. Standard consolidation therapy with high d oses of cytarabine leads to 
improved survival in younger pa tients.  Overall, up to 70% of p atients can be expected to 
relapse, so that only about 20-30%  attain long-term disease-fre e survival. 
 Two major problems in the treat ment of AML remain: primary resi stant/refractory disease and 
high risk of relapse/recurrent d isease.  While newer drug combi nations and higher doses of 
therapy may begin to address upfro nt resistant disease, there a re very few options, with the 
exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, for long ter m maintenance of remission after 
consolidation.  In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), maintena nce therapy has become a 
standard part of treatment and ha s contributed to long term dur able remissions and cures.  
Results of studies of maintenan ce therapy in AML have been mixe d. In early studies by [CONTACT_1345]
3,[ADDRESS_553365] survived the 
induction therapy and are the sour ce of relapses would be presu mably resistant to ‘more of the 
same’.  Newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], employi ng different mechanisms of acti on are less likely to be cross-
resistant to the initial cytotoxic induction regimens.  For exa mple, Brune et. al.11 studied an 
immunotherapy approach investiga ting an IL2 + histamine mainten ance therapy.  A cohort of 
320 patients in CR1 or greater were randomized to receive 10 cy cles of IL2+histamine vs. no 
treatment.  At 3 years, the maint enance arm had a significant improvement in leukemia-free 
survival.11  Lenalidomide, a non-cytotoxic drug with activity in AML, has multiple unique 
mechanisms of action including immune modulation and alteration  of intracellular signaling and 
may be an ideal candidate for long t erm maintenance in this dis ease. 
 
As a background, we know that AML patients (young and old) with : (1)primary refractory 
disease, (2)adverse cytogenetics, (3)FLT3 positive disease, (4) antecedent hematologic disorder, 
and (in relapsed patients) (5) short CR1 duration have a high risk of relapse, despi[INVESTIGATOR_436754].  If these patients are not  candidates for transplant, we are 
often beholden to “watch and wait” until their leukemia relapse s.  In this setting, a long term, low 
intensity, easy to administer, a nd effective antileukemia treat ment needs to be developed.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to ha ve single-agent activity in AM L as a higher dose induction 
followed by a longer term, lower dose maintenance strategy.12  Lenalidomide, in the treatment of 
myelodysplastic syndrome MDS and multiple myeloma (MM) has been  shown to be safe during 
continuous, long term administrati on (MM, MDS) as well as in a maintenance strategy (MM).  
 
2.2 Lenalidomide in AML 
 
Lenalidomide, a derivative of tha lidomide is currently approved  for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) and MDS (myelodyspl astic syndrome), but has been s hown to have single-agent 
activity in AML as an inducti on – maintenance strategy.  In a phase II trial of older patients (age 
≥ 60 yrs) with untreated AML, lenalidomide was given at a high ‘induction’ dose, of 50 mg 
orally daily on a 28 day cycle ( for up to 2 induction cycles), followed by a lower ‘maintenance’ 
dose of 10 mg orally daily for up to 12 months.  The CR/CRi rat e was 30% overall and 53% in 
patients who completed all of the high-dose therapy.12  The median CR duration was 10 months 
(1 – 17+ months).  The treatment w as well tolerated in this coh ort of patients, with the most 
common grade 3-4 toxicities be ing myelosuppression and infectio n.  Based on this data of single 
agent activity in AML and its longer-term use in AML, MDS, and MM we propose to use this as 
a maintenance strategy for higher-risk patients who are in remi ssion after induction/consolidation 
therapy.  The exact mechanism of action of lenalidomide is not known, but may involve immunomodulatory activity and reversal of an immunosuppressive environment present in 
Protocol 2014-[ADDRESS_553366] cytotoxicity, secreti on of cytokines, and by [CONTACT_436765] g other immune cells (T-cells, 
dendritic cells) to mount anti-tumor immunity.15,17,[ADDRESS_553367] responded to induction/ consolidation chemotherapy 
and are not immediately candidates for BMT.  From our own data,  the expected relapse free 
survival in this cohort of younger patients with higher risk di sease who do not proceed for stem 
cell transplant is 8.5 months.  Approximately 25% of these patients may become eligible for and proceed to transplant, but the majority are left without meaningful therapy until relapse.  Based on published data, NK cells are important mediators of im mune surveillance, particularly 
in AML.  In addition to affecting direct cytotoxicity of AML blasts, NK cells may also alter the cytokine and immune cell (eg. T-lymphocytes) milieu to favor an ti-leukemia immunity.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to enhance NK cell activity and num bers – making it an important 
agent to study in a setting of low disease burden (ie. minimal residual disease after 
chemotherapy).  As part of the clinical trial, we also aim to s tudy the effects of lenalidomide on 
NK cell activity – both at baseline (prior to lenalidomide trea tment) and at several time points 
during treatment.  This will help us  derive more insight into t he actions of lenalidomide on NK 
cell activity and how it relates to maintenance of remission in  patients with AML. 
 The rationale for the selected dos ing of lenalidomide maintenan ce is drawn from previous 
experience in chronic dosing of len alidomide for maintenance strategy.  In the AML experience 
described above, Fehniger, et. a l. treated patients in the main tenance phase with 10 mg orally

  daily.  In multiple myeloma maintenance studies,24,25 lenalidomide was dosed at 10 – [ADDRESS_553368] therefore been sh own to be safe and active in a 
long-term dosing strategy. 
   
2.5 Lenalidomide 
 
Background  
Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corpora tion.  IMiD® compounds 
have both immunomodulatory and an ti-angiogenic properties which  could confer antitumor and 
antimetastatic effects.  Lenali domide has been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity 
through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothel ial cell migration, due at 
least in part to inhibition of A kt phosphorylation response to bFGF.
[ADDRESS_553369] antitumor mech anism of action of lenalidomid e is unknown, a number of 
mechanisms are postulated to be res ponsible for lenalidomide’s activity against multiple 
myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell prolif eration, which leads to an 
increase in IL-[ADDRESS_553370] in mu ltiple myeloma cell lines and 
in multiple myeloma cells of patients resistant to melphalan, d oxorubicin and dexamethasone.  
Indications and Usage: Revlimid
® (lenalidomide) is indicated for the treatment of patients with  transfusion-dependent 
anemia due to Low- or Intermediat e-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 
5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenet ic abnormalities.  Revlimid® is 
also approved in combination with d examethasone for the treatme nt of patients with multiple 
myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.  Revlimid is also for the treatment of 
patients with mantle cell lymphoma  (MCL)whose disease has relap sed or progressed after two 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], one of w hich included bortezomib.

4.1 Treatment Schema 
 
4.1.1 Maintenance Lenalidomide Dosing:  Lenalidomide continuous dosing on days 1- 28 of a 28 day cycle.  Dose of lenalidomide is as follows:  - Starting dose (DOSE LEVEL 0):  10mg orally daily during cycle 1 
 
- If after one cycle, the patient  has persistent evidence of (1 ) minimal residual disease or (2) 
morphologically active disease AND is tolerating their starting  dose of lenalidomide, their dose 
may be increased to the next highe r dose level for the remainder of the study.  A maximum of 2 
dose escalations per patient are allowed if well tolerated.

therapy can improve relapse-free survival (RFS), which is defin ed as the time interval from date 
of treatment start until the da te of death or disease relapse. Patients who are alive and relapse-
free at the last follow-up date w ill be censored at that time.  
 The study will be continuously monitored for the primary endpoi nt, RFS, using the method of 
Thall, Wooten, and Tannir (2005) .  Our goal is to improve the m edian RFS from 8 months 
(based on historical treatment) to 10.5 months using lenalidomi de maintenance therapy. It is 
assumed that the RFS time is e xponentially distributed with a m edian of 
E among patients who 
receive lenalidomide as a maintenance therapy, and a median of H is assumed for the historical 
treatment.   Further, we assume that H follows an inverse gamma distribution, i.e., H ~ IG(3.6, 
20.8), which has a mean of  [ADDRESS_553390] the little prior knowledge of 
E we assume an inverse gamma prior distribution with the same mean of 8 months and a much 
larger variance of 500, i.e., E ~ IG(2.128,9.024).  The trial will  be stopped early if Pr( E  > H 
+δ|data) < pL, where δ = 2.[ADDRESS_553391]=0.[ADDRESS_553392] been e nrolled. A maximum of 50pat ients will be enrolled into this 
study at an expected accrual ra te of 1 patient per month.  From historical experience, 25% of 
patients in this cohort may become eligible for stem cell trans plant and may come off study.  For 
purposes of this analysis, these patients will be censored at t he time of receiving transplant  .  
Patients will be followed up for an additional [ADDRESS_553393] (C TC) website maintained by [CONTACT_436776].  
 The operating characteristics  of the design, based on an overal l assumed accrual rate of 2 patients 
per month with 5000 simulated trial s per scenario, are given in the following table. One-Arm  
Time-to-Event Simulator (versi on3.0.1) was used for the design and simulation.

For the primary analysis of the efficacy endpoint, we will compute the Bayesian posterior 
probability of Pr( E  > H +δ|data). As a secondary analysis, we will perform a competing  risk 
analysis treating stem cell transplant as a competing event for  RFS.  
 
In addition, we will continuously monitor treatment-related tox icities using the Bayesian 
approach of Thall, Simon, Estey ( 1995).  Specifically, the tria l will be stopped if Prob(πT>0.30 | 
data)>0.92, where πT is the toxici ty rate and we assume a beta (0.6, 1.4) prior for πT That is, if at 
any given time, there is more tha n 92% probability that the tox icity rate of the maintenance 
therapy with lenalidomide is greater than 30%, the trial will b e stopped. For the purpose of 
toxicity monitoring, toxicities are defined as any treatment –related clinically significant grade 3 
or 4 non-hematologic AEs occurred  any time during the trial, wh ich are also outlined in Table 2.  
We will apply this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_436756] 10th patient and in cohort size of 10. The

CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
will be utilized for AE reporting.  The CTEP Active Version of the CTCAE is identified and 
located on the CTEP website at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDev elopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm .  All appropriate 
treatment areas should have acce ss to a copy of the CTEP Active  Version of CTCAE.

  10.2 Leukemia-specific Adverse Event Recording and Reporting Guidelines 
 
These guidelines serve to bring the  Department of Leukemia in c ompliance with the institutional 
policy on Reporting of Serious Adve rse Events-definition of exp ected AE- “ All clinical 
protocols should include a list  of the expected and anticipated  events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436761]” and Gui deline for Good Clinical Practic e 4.11.1 “All serious adverse 
events (SAEs) should be reporte d immediately to the sponsor exc ept for those SAEs that the 
protocol or other document  (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure) ide ntifies as not needing immediate 
reporting”. 
 
Adverse event is any untoward med ical occurrence that may prese nt during treatment with a 
pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this 
treatment. 
 Adverse drug reaction is a res ponse to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs 
at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or th erapy of disease or for the 
modification of physiologic function.  Assessing causal connections bet ween agents an d disease is fundamental to the understanding of 
adverse drug reactions. In genera l, a drug may be considered a contributory cause of an adverse 
event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the event would not have happened at all, 2) the 
event would have occurred later  than it actually did, or 3) the  event would have been less severe. 
 
Adverse Events (AEs) will be eva luated according to current CTC  version in each protocol. Only 
unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  Expected events during leukemia therapy are: 
1. Myelosuppression related events (due to disease or leukemia therapy) 
a. febrile or infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_436762] 
b. epi[INVESTIGATOR_339112] 
c. anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis 
2. Disease related events 
a. symptoms associated with anemia 
i. fatigue 
ii. weakness 
iii. shortness of breath 
b. electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, pot assium, bicarbonate, CO2, magnesium) 
c. chemistry abnormalities (LDH, phosphorus, calcium, BUN, protein, albumin, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, glucose) 
d. coagulation abnormalities 
e. disease specific therapy (induction, maintenance, salvage, or stem cell therapy) 
f. alopecia 
g. bone,  joint, or muscle pain 
h. liver functio

c. rash related to antibiotic use 
4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436763]. Fo r abnormal chemical values

Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untowar d medical occurrence that at any 
dose  
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767]  a serious adverse drug experi ence when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient o r subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patie nt signs consent until [ADDRESS_553396] returned to base line, progression of the 
event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution o f the event.  
 
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on lenalidomide, or within  [ADDRESS_553397]’s last dose of  lenalidomide, are considered  immediately reportable events. 
Lenalidomide  is to be discontin ued immediately. The pregnancy,  suspected pregnancy, or 
positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety  immediately by [CONTACT_299799]. The female subje ct should be referred to an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, prefer ably one experienced in reprod uctive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling.  The Investigator will follow t he female subject until completio n of the pregnancy, and must 
Protocol 2014-0116 
January 18, 2018 
23 
 
  notify Celgene Drug Safety immed iately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spo ntaneous or therapeutic aborti on), the Investigator should 
report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome m eets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, within 24 hours  of the Investigator’s knowl edge of the event using the SAE

causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days  that the Investig ator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be repor ted to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or othe r appropriate method, within 2 4 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form.   
Male Subjects 
 
If a female partner of a male s ubject taking lenalidomide becom es pregnant, the male subject 
taking lenalidomide should notif y the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their health care provider immediately.

1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE  
Chronic pain is common ly reported in clinical settings, affecting over 20% of the global 
population.1 Several studies previously estimated the prevalence of chronic pain to range from 
11% to 40% of adults in the [LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_781359] been shown to co -occur in  many individuals, and nearly 50% of patients with 
chronic pain suffer from one or more anxiety diso rders.3 This association is seen across multiple 
clinical settings and major life domains,4 and healthcare for its surveillance and treatment is  
costly and resource -intensive.5 
Virtual Reality (VR) was first effectively used to treat pain in 1998,[ADDRESS_781360] VR therapy regimen for chronic pain and anxiety, but also in formulating 
a prediction of an individual’s therapeutic response to VR based on biodata and clinical factors.  
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this study is to ass ess the therapeutic response to VR Solac e in patients with 
chronic pain and anxiety using real -time clinical and survey data . Regression analysis of 
demographic characteristics, lab and survey data will be conducted to better understand the 
efficacy of VR Solace in treating chronic pain and anxiety. We also aim to  explore the possible 
association between the patient -reported  changes in  pain or anxiety  levels  with real- time 
physiological changes  observed during VR Solace use.

use of VR such as motion sickness or headaches, in which case the patient will 
be instructed promptly to remove the headset.  
• An investigator will be present at time of VR use , and thorough instructions 
will be given prior to session

for access  
• No data will be downloaded to unencrypted portable devices (e.g., flash drive, personal laptop, etc.)  
Linking Lists/Files  
• Linkin g lists with codes assigned for each subject, will be maintained 
separately from research  data  
• Access to the linking list will be limited to approved research personnel  
• Study data will be coded upon abstraction, and any d irect identifiers 
will be maintaine d separately from data  
Identifiable Information

• Subject safety - All serious adverse events will be reported to the members of 
the DSMB and the university IRB within [ADDRESS_781364] members and the IRB yearly. NIH 
will be informed of all actions taken by [CONTACT_592373].  
• There are no concerns for any unexpected events, pa tient harm, or protocol 
deviations in this study.

by [CONTACT_592374].  
6.2 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
• The study investigators will meet at regular intervals to evaluate the protocol 
and assure adherence to protocol. This will be done after enrollment of the 
first 10 patients to the  protocol. After that the investigators will meet every 
two months to assess protocol and evaluate da ta. Additionally, after 
enrollment of half the patients there will be a meeting of investigators.  
• Primary investigators listed on the cover page will all be responsible for the 
 evaluation of data quality which will be assessed after each subject session.  
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 7 .1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES 
Outcomes will be continuous —change in pain/anxiety levels in response to VR Solace 
treatment session. The levels will be measured by [CONTACT_592375], and changes will be 
calculated based on pre -session and post- session survey responses. Secondary 
outcomes will also be continuous, as change in averages of first and last minute of the VR Solace session  (not including pre - and post- VR survey time) . 
 
 
7.2 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS   
• A paired t -test was used to calculate power. The desired power is 80% and 0.05 
was used as the significance level.  
• To achieve a moderate to large effect of 0.5, we estimate  to recruit a sample of 
[ADDRESS_781365] of 0.8, we estimate  to recruit a sample 
of 16 patients.  
• No measures to decrease bias/precision such as blinding of staff will be 
performed, however study protocol will be followed strictly  for all subjects in 
same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225].

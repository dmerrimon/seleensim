Cannabis Use and Cancer. The American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) quotes a lifetime risk of invasive cancer of 42% in men and 38% in women in the [LOCATION_003]. Consequently, with the emergence of medical Cannabis as a therapeutic option in many states, particularly for cancer treatment-related symptomatology, this population represents one of the largest opportunities for real world medical Cannabis use research. As of early 2017, twenty-nine states 

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154153] legalized medical Cannabis programs. Importantly, recreational use is now legal in several states, making Cannabis even more accessible to potential medical users even without a doctor’s explicit recommendation or prescription. Recent polls indicate that 77% of Americans believe that Cannabis has legitimate medical purposes2. Likewise, a recent poll of physicians in North America found that 76% would recommend the use of Cannabis to alleviate symptoms, specifically in the case of a patient suffering from advanced cancer and severe cancer treatment-related side effects3. In addition, because of its potential to target multiple symptoms, it has been suggested that Cannabis might reduce polypharmacy among cancer patients4. While there is a great deal of cultural support for medical Cannabis programs, cancer patients and doctors alike have very little scientific information on which to base decisions regarding whether or not to use Cannabis or which product, cannabinoid composition, or route of administration to use5. This information is critical as some products may be more or less beneficial, or more or less harmful in this population. Given the fact that acceptance of and access to Cannabis is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135804], research on the risks and benefits of legal market cannabis use in this vulnerable population should clearly be a high priority. The bulk of research on the use of medical Cannabis in cancer focuses on physical symptom reduction, while in contrast almost no studies have examined the psychological and cognitive impacts of medical Cannabis on cancer patients. This lack of research is surprising, given that the importance of examining new strategies with the potential to improve quality of life in cancer care is well-recognized among clinicians6. As noted, research examining medical Cannabis use in cancer patients has focused primarily on the effects of Cannabis on the reduction of physical symptoms related to cancer and anti-cancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy). Recent reviews of this literature suggest that there is some evidence that medical Cannabis and/or synthetic cannabinoids can alleviate nausea and vomiting, stimulate appetite, reduce pain, alleviate anxiety, and mitigate neuropathy in this population7,8. Importantly, some studies have illustrated that Cannabis may be more effective and/or desirable than standard treatments for these symptoms. For example, a review of [ADDRESS_154154] antiemetics found that oral cannabinoids were more effective at reducing nausea and vomiting, and in these studies, between 38 and 90% of patients reported that they preferred the cannabinoids9. While its antiemetic properties are clear, much less is known about other potential beneficial effects. The current state of the research on Cannabis is fraught with important limitations. Most relevant to the current proposal is the fact that much of the research on cannabinoids in cancer treatment examines the effects of synthetic cannabinoids administered in capsule form (e.g., nabilone, dronabinol10). However, given the changing legal status and availability of Cannabis both recreationally and medicinally, it is increasingly the case that cancer patients who use Cannabis are using it in plant derived form. While there are a vast number of products available in state-regulated medical and recreational markets, there is very limited research on how these new products might influence the consumer. Cannabis in its plant form contains more than 60 different cannabinoids, and the potencies of each vary significantly across strains10,11. One of these cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) may actually mitigate detrimental psychological effects of the more well-known and psychoactive cannabinoid, ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)12. Yet most published research on Cannabis in cancer care equates effects of isolated synthetic THC to the far more complex plant form. The current proposal seeks to assess the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered study of the effects of plant-derived legal market Cannabis as used

  8 of 47  by [CONTACT_135840]. Specifically, we wish to determine whether it is feasible to appraise the effects of orally administered Cannabis products among a cancer patient group by [CONTACT_135841] a study examining   how differing ratios of cannabinoids in cannabis products (based on type of product strain used) relate to symptom relief, quality of life, and cognitive measures. 2.1.2. Psychological effects of Cannabis use in cancer patients. There is some research that suggests the potential for positive psychological effects of Cannabis use that may improve quality of life. For example, some of the effects that are commonly described as adverse or harmful (e.g., feeling “high”, euphoria, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]), may be reframed as positive effects for those suffering from cancer and the side effects of treatment (i.e., mood elevation, reduced anxiety, improved sleep quality)7. One study examined the effects of medical Cannabis on psychological symptom management by [CONTACT_135842] 6-8 weeks after they received a medical Cannabis license, and found reductions in self-reported mood disorders, sleep disorders, and pain, as well as reduced use of pain medication and depression/anxiety medication after initiation of medical Cannabis use. Given these findings, the study authors concluded that medical Cannabis may be an important contribution to palliative cancer care13.  At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the potential negative effects. Specifically, the literature is fairly clear that acute use of Cannabis temporarily compromises cognitive function. For example, one study observed impaired performance on an executive function task and two motor control tasks after a 13% THC dose of Cannabis13. On the other hand, the evidence is mixed regarding the long-term effects14,15. Notably, this evidence base is somewhat limited in that relatively few researchers have examined these effects, and results of such studies have in some cases been inconclusive or have important limitations (including studying only the effects of very low doses of THC that are rarely used in the real world)15. Regardless, it is nearly inevitable that cancer patients are faced with both self-regulatory challenges (i.e., adhering to complicated drug regimens, healthy eating, exercising to reduce fatigue) as well as cognitively taxing decisions (e.g., weighing pros and cons of treatment options) that rely on high-level working memory and executive function processes that may be influenced acutely by [CONTACT_135843]. Further, one of the greatest concerns of cancer patients and survivors are changes to their cognitive abilities16–18. Research using traditional neuropsychological assessment has documented deficits in processing speed, attention/working memory and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]19–21. Moreover, cancer patients’ subjective reports of cognitive difficulties are often greater than the deficits when compared to performance on objective tests22. Finally, there is a large body of research demonstrating that cancer patients may experience reduced cognitive functioning due to the effects of chemotherapy23. Thus, it is essential to examine the impact of Cannabis use on both objective and subjective cognitive function in this already-vulnerable population. 2.1.3. Synergistic effects of multiple cannabinoids on pain, anxiety, and insomnia. It is worth noting that pain, anxiety, and insomnia are three of the most common complaints among cancer patients and are also the three most common conditions cited for use of medical Cannabis24. Importantly, an expert panel convened by [CONTACT_135844], Engineering, and Medicine concluded in their [ADDRESS_154155] on sleep outcomes, and limited evidence for effects on anxiety25. They also concluded that there is conclusive evidence for Cannabis effectiveness at treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, however this was the only symptom domain where research has been conducted primarily or exclusively with 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154156] common condition cited by [CONTACT_135845] U.S. states with legal markets; 87%-94% of self-reported medical Cannabis users report using Cannabis for relief of a pain condition26,27. Treatment of anxiety and insomnia are the next most common medical uses24. In addition, there is some evidence that individuals are replacing the use of traditional pain, mood, and sleep medications with Cannabis. For example, one recent study reported survey data suggesting that medical Cannabis use in pain patients was associated with a 64% decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]28. A second study recently observed significantly lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_135805]29. Similarly, recent analyses of prescription data in states with medical access to Cannabis suggest a significant reduction in the prescription of medications for pain, anxiety, and sleep dysfunction30.  Pain. Across five high quality reviews conducted in the past four years, results were consistent in suggesting that cannabinoids demonstrate an effect on pain31–35. For example a rigorous, systematic review by [CONTACT_135846]35 covered 28 chronic pain studies (2454 participants) primarily conducted in Canada or Europe. Twenty-two of these studies evaluated plant-derived cannabinoids (cannabis extract mouth spray or nabiximols n=13, plant flower that was smoked or vaporized n=5, oramucosal spray n=3, oral THC n=1) while 5 studies evaluated synthetic THC (i.e., nabilone). All of the selected studies included either an active comparator or placebo control. Analyses across studies that evaluated the effects of inhaled plant-derived Cannabis suggested a statistically significant effect on the odds of a 30% or greater improvement in pain (OR = 1.41). The largest single effect size presented across the reviews was observed with inhaled Cannabis on pain [e.g. OR, 3.43; 38]. Consistent with this, an average OR of 3.22 (CI: 1.59 to 7.24) was found across [ADDRESS_154157] that cannabidiol (CBD) is another primary cannabinoid that may work synergistically with THC in a multi-target analgesic approach to pain relief. For example, nabiximols which are an administration of a plant-based mixture of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) via mouth or nasal spray were associated with significant reductions in numerical pain ratings across the available studies. Anxiety/affect. There is evidence demonstrating that Cannabis use is associated with increased anxiety and anxiety disorders36. However, other data, including our own prospective work, suggests that Cannabis use may be protective for anxiety and may decrease the chances of developi[INVESTIGATOR_135806]37. A number of studies have found that Cannabis acutely increases positive mood and measures of reward38,39 even when using a “balanced placebo” design to control for expectancy effects40. This finding is consistent with a growing body of evidence from animal models suggesting that Cannabis has anxiolytic effects41. Overall, however, research studies have largely ignored the fact that Cannabis exists in different forms with differing ratios of THC to CBD and have not characterized the effects of Cannabis as the compound action of different cannabinoids that vary in terms of their pharmacological effects. Two primary cannabinoids, THC and CBD, may have opposing effects with regard to anxiety. Importantly, THC is thought to be acutely anxiogenic42, while treatment with CBD has anxiolytic effects without the experience of a “high”43. Clarifying the anxiolytic effects of specific strains that differ in their cannabinoid composition may explain these discrepant findings.  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154158] been reported. For instance, an early study found a diminution in sleep after systemic administration of CBD46, whereas other work showed an improvement in sleep in insomniacs after using CBD47. Much of this work has been done, again, with synthetic oral forms of THC and CBD in isolation, leaving a limited knowledge base on the effects of the synergistic effects of plant-derived cannabinoids in common forms of administration.  A 2017 survey study of cannabis use among cancer patients showed that pain, stress, and sleep were all identified as reasons for Cannabis use5. Though the study did not ask specifically about quality of life, over half (51%) of patients felt that Cannabis was a “major benefit” while another 39% agreed it was a “moderate benefit.” It is logical to assume, therefore, that to the extent that Cannabis alleviates negative symptoms from cancer and cancer-treatment, it should also increase overall quality of life. Also, while there is evidence to suggest that Cannabis may be effective for pain, anxiety, and sleep—and consequently quality of life—it is not clear whether these effects are driven by [CONTACT_135847] (THC or CBD) or the synergistic combination of the two. Overall, very little is known about the efficacy, dose, routes of administration, or side effects of commonly used Cannabis products in the U.S that come in a variety of potencies and cannabinoid contents, nor critically how these products may work differently in cancer patients.  2.1.4. THC and cognitive impairment. A number of studies indicate that Cannabis produces acute cognitive impairment, especially relating to memory and attention during intoxication and possibly for hours to days after use48,49. For example, studies that were published as early as the 1970’s suggest that Cannabis disrupts immediate and delayed free recall of information e.g., 50,51. Recall of words from a list is one of the most common approaches to demonstrating the effect of THC on recall performance e.g., 52. Studies have also suggested working memory may be the most sensitive to the acute effects of Cannabis see 53. Among the studies that included two THC concentrations, higher doses mostly yielded greater cognitive impairment15,54–56. In neuroimaging work, Cannabis users showed differential brain response to an associative memory task while under the influence of THC compared with a placebo. Specifically, THC attenuated brain activity in the insula, right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle occipi[INVESTIGATOR_135807], and increased network-wide activity during recall. Taken together, these results suggest that THC has a negative effect on the neurocognitive processes involved with encoding, and neural activation changes during recall likely reflect a compensatory mechanism for the affected encoding. That is, the memory system as a whole must work harder in order to account for the cognitive deficits induced by [CONTACT_135848]. In sum, the literature suggests that acute administration of Cannabis impairs the encoding and retrieval of information, albeit to a modest degree, and these effects may be dose-dependent on THC level. Further, this Cannabis-induced cognitive impairment can last from hours to days after use48 and potentially longer in heavy chronic users. Thus, the potential cognitive side effects of regular use of current Cannabis products are highly relevant to cancer patients, who may use Cannabis on a regular basis to treat their symptoms but who also want to maintain as much cognitive function as possible.  2.1.5. Does CBD mitigate the harmful cognitive effects of THC? Clearly, the evidence suggests that acute Cannabis use is associated with at least modest cognitive impairment. However, almost all of this research was conducted with low potency cannabis provided by [CONTACT_1600]:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154159] that CBD may attenuate the negative effects of THC on cognition and other measures59–68. Most of the work on CBD has involved the administration of THC and CBD in synthetic pi[INVESTIGATOR_135808]. Much less is known about the combined effects of THC and CBD when using cannabis in the forms commonly available in dispensaries across the U.S. This is a high priority area of research in terms of understanding how to reduce the potentially harmful effects of cannabis use in cancer patients.  2.1.6. Limitations of existing literature. Most of the Cannabis products that are sold in state regulated markets bear little resemblance to the products that are available for research from NIDA at the federal level in the U.S. For example, per Figure 169, the most recently available data in Colorado alone show that >600,000 edible units of Cannabis were sold across medical and recreational dispensaries each month of 2015, nearly a 50% increase from the monthly data reported for 2014, the first year of legal Cannabis sales in our state69. Data also suggest that medical Cannabis patients are more likely to use edible products than recreational users69. Importantly, using Cannabis in orally administered form represents a very different way to use cannabis, in part because in contrast to smoked forms of Cannabis which produce acute effects that begin to diminish rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135809] (blood levels dramatically decrease within 15 minutes of smoking), orally administered Cannabis produces prolonged effects that last at least [ADDRESS_154160] their patients not to inhale Cannabis, but instead to use orally administered forms. More research is desperately needed given the increased availability of Cannabis across the nation and the lack of any research in the U.S. on the beneficial or harmful effects of orally administered Cannabis for cancer patients.

  12 of 47  2.2 RATIONALE  2.2.1. Overview. We submitted a grant to NIH/NCI using an observational design that is well established by [CONTACT_135849] a fully powered trial with cancer patients. While the reviewers noted that “the proposed research will provide much needed scientific data to the public, physicians, patients, and to the larger research community on the varying effects of different forms of Cannabis on cancer treatment-related symptoms and patient quality of life” they were concerned that “while the group is experienced with the methodology proposed, the lung cancer population is a new endeavor. The team is bolstered by [CONTACT_135850], but there are no pi[INVESTIGATOR_135810]-of concept and feasibility of yielding a sufficient sample with reasonable compliance with procedures.” Thus, we seek to demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility. Our lab has been conducting neurobehavioral research on Cannabis39,72 as well as observational research on the relationship of Cannabis use to broader health behavior72–[ADDRESS_154161] for use (i.e., products with a combination of THC and CBD as opposed to those with THC only will attenuate cognitive impairment, and also will be correlated positively with quality of life outcomes).” Thus, an observational study will provide concrete data to inform medical decision making and reduce the harm of Cannabis use in cancer patients. Note that in the current legal environment, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_135811] [ADDRESS_154162] Cannabis in our research lab, nor provide Cannabis itself nor instructions for its use to research participants. Tightly controlled experimental laboratory studies (e.g., clinical trials with randomization) using products available in state-regulated markets are simply, at this point, not possible owing largely to federal law and the University requirements related to the Controlled Substances Act and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. Because a traditional clinical trial design is not possible given the current federal status of Cannabis products, we would employ our established prospective observational design. Specifically, individuals who have already decided to try Cannabis for their cancer treatment-related symptoms will initiate use of an orally administered product they have selected. A research assistant will provide information on the range of edible Cannabis products and basic information about their various cannabinoid profiles, approximate prices, and nearby [CONTACT_135851].   The participants will then purchase the product and decide how often and how much to use. This approach is consistent with federal law, supported by [CONTACT_135852], and timely given that Cannabis is widely used by [CONTACT_135853]. An observational design that balances adequate internal validity with high external validity is critical for beginning to build the knowledge base about why so many cancer patients are turning to Cannabis. To that 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154163] developed and deployed innovative procedures that allow us to study legal market Cannabis in the compositions and forms that are widely available, while staying within the current regulatory framework and maintaining a high level of internal validity (see preliminary studies). Our purpose in future studies is to explore the pharmacological properties of THC, CBD, and their combination in orally administered cannabis with regard to differential impacts on symptom relief and cognition in order to understand and maximize any potential positive impact of Cannabis and minimize potential harm. Moving from our prior studies in recreational users to a cancer patient population has required an evolution in our research approaches, including addressing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135812] a symptomatic population, together with capturing co-medications, anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135813]. Our studies will provide much needed scientific data to the public, physicians, patients, and to the larger research community on the varying effects of different forms of cannabis on cancer treatment-related symptoms and patient quality of life. Our proposed research is innovative and significant for the following reasons: 2.2.2. Opportunity to examine orally administered Cannabis products in a state with legalized medical and recreational use. We capi[INVESTIGATOR_135814] a novel opportunity to examine effects of orally administered Cannabis products currently legally available to, and used in growing amounts by, individuals with cancer. As reviewed, prior human clinical and laboratory work on the effects of Cannabis on pain and anxiety has focused on short acting nabiximols in studies outside the U.S or on U.S. government grown Cannabis of very low THC potency and with no CBD, which is smoked or vaporized. It is important to note that there is no federal source of orally administered Cannabis products for research, despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] >600,[ADDRESS_154164] pain, other symptom areas, and cognitive side effects in cancer patients. Using legal market orally administered Cannabis products  will provide new, externally valid, and more reliable assessments of the relationship of THC and CBD to both the potential beneficial and harmful effects of Cannabis. This research thus fills an important gap in the knowledge base on the effects of primary cannabinoids on symptom relief in cancer patients.  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154165] harmful effects on cognition. Successful dissemination of this information to the public can directly inform patient decisions about whether to use Cannabis at all and which type to use.  2.2.5. Preliminary studies relevant to this proposal.  Prior experience and expertise of the team. The research team has taken a transdisciplinary approach to the study of the risks and benefits of Cannabis use across a number of populations. The PI (Bryan) and major Co-I (Bidwell) are co-directors of the CUChange Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder and have extensive experience in the integration of neurocognitive assessments into longitudinal behavioral research on substance use (e.g., R01 AA017390: PI [INVESTIGATOR_135815]; 2R01AA013844: PI [INVESTIGATOR_135815]; R01 DA025074: site PI [INVESTIGATOR_135816], Co-I Bryan; R01AA024632: Co-I’s Bidwell and Bryan; R01DA039707: Co-I’s Bidwell and Bryan). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_135817] a wealth of statistical expertise. Co-I Camidge, who is a renowned clinical scientist and thoracic oncologist with medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_135877], treatment, and palliative care aspects of lung and other thoracic cancers, will serve as the medical director on the project. His medical oversight will be supported by [CONTACT_15957]-I Bowles, who has considerable expertise in the role of medical Cannabis in cancer patients. Drs. Camidge and Bowles are faculty at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine. Together, they authored a paper on the use of Cannabis in cancer care10..  Previous and Current Cannabis Studies in the CUChange Lab. Our neurobehavioral research on Cannabis75,76 as well as observational research on the relationship of Cannabis use to broader health behavior is well documented12,72–74. One pi[INVESTIGATOR_135818] a design similar to the one proposed in this application. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], regular Cannabis users (n=22) were asked to switch strains for three days after a washout period. Participants used either a +THC/-CBD (~14% CBD, <1% CBD) or a +THC/+CBD (7% THC, 14% CBD) smoked strain that was acquired from a local dispensary. Both the researchers and participants were blind to condition, and the blind was maintained by [CONTACT_135854]. After the washout period of no Cannabis use, participants used the assigned Cannabis strain daily for three days, including a final use on the third day. Immediately after this final use, participants came to the lab, by [CONTACT_135855], for assessment of its effects on cognitive responses. Our data (Figure 2) suggest that CBD may mitigate the negative effects of THC on verbal recall12.

  15 of 47   University of Colorado Thoracic Oncology Program. The program cares for close to 1000 patients in total at the University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UCH) and sees approximately 400 new thoracic oncology patients a year. In 2017, an informal survey in the clinic suggested approximately 40-50% of patients have tried medical Cannabis and 2 new medical Cannabis cards are being issued a month to this population. Although recall, nearly identical Cannabis products are available at recreational dispensaries to any adult 21 or over; thus, a medical card is not necessary. All aspects of clinical and translational research are well established in the program, with consistent rates of 30-40% of new patients engaged in classical interventional clinical trials. The main University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UCH) is also associated with the largest VA in the Western region (set to move on site in 2018) and is part of a clinical network of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135819] (see section 5.3.4). The study of Cannabis as an adjunct to palliative care approaches is thus critical and highly relevant to this patient group.   2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS   2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS   • Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics: Participants for the proposed research will be individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer of any solid tumor type and are interested in using Cannabis in the context of their cancer care. Participants’ medical charts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_135856], with the documented consent of the patient participant, to ensure their safety to engage in study participation. To account for expected attrition (20-25% based on our similar Cannabis studies) 150 participants will be recruited in total, though we anticipate that only 30 of these will complete the study.  • Sources of Materials: The source of the majority of research data will be the participants’ responses to questionnaires or questions on interviews. Other research data will involve cognitive tests. Finally, we will obtain information on health status and current medications from HIPAA compliant review of electronic medical records accessed by [CONTACT_135857]-investigators. • Potential Risks: Potential risks are minimal. They include: a) Breach of confidentiality; b) Adverse effects of Cannabis such as intoxication, acute mood shifts, odd perceptual experiences, etc.; and c) The need for medical oversight in a cancer patient population.  2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS   

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, 2022 
  16 of 47  The risks to participants are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to participants and/or society, and in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result, thereby [CONTACT_135858]:  • To Participant: This study is expected to add to the knowledge base of information on the effects of different types of Cannabis and cannabinoids on cancer-related symptoms, quality of life, and cognition and are expected to inform patient choices and future harm reduction efforts. Given only a slight risk to participants and the greater possibility of long-term benefits to the scientific and public knowledge bases and providing highly externally valid data to inform harm reduction efforts, the risks/benefits ratio seems reasonable. The risks associated with participating have been minimized via procedures described above.  • To Society: From a larger perspective, the findings of this investigation will increase the body of knowledge about the potential benefits and risks of orally administered legal market Cannabis use in cancer patients with any solid tumor type. Existing research on the connection between Cannabis and cancer related processes has used either animal models with extracted constituents of Cannabis (which is not how it is used by [CONTACT_1978]) or has focused on low potency forms and/or forms of Cannabis not typi[INVESTIGATOR_135820] U.S. residents, but are silent in several important ways. First, such studies are completely silent on the effects of orally administered Cannabis in forms widely available to cancer patients across the U.S. In addition, limited information is available on the impact of various potencies and the different components of the Cannabis used. We also have limited data on the impact of these legal market Cannabis products on cognitive functioning in cancer patients with any solid tumor type.  • Justify the importance of the knowledge: Ultimately, the proposed study will add critical information to the knowledge base and provide an evidence-base that will inform personal decisions and reduce harm in patients who are considering using Cannabis in the context of their cancer treatment. In addition, these studies will allow for the development of public policy approaches to harm reduction, which is much needed in states that are legalizing Cannabis use for either medicinal or recreational purposes.  3 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of a human observational study of orally administered Cannabis use among cancer patients with any solid tumor type, towards developi[INVESTIGATOR_135801]/pi[INVESTIGATOR_135802] R01 grant application to the National Cancer Institute. The primary objective will be to demonstrate the number of contacts necessary to enroll 30 eligible patients and demonstrate reasonable compliance with study procedures (see section 10.5.4) within fifty-four months of active recruiting.

  17 of 47  4 STUDY DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY DESIGN Tightly controlled experimental laboratory studies (e.g., clinical trials with randomization) using Cannabis products available in state-regulated markets are simply, at this point, not possible owing largely to federal law and the University requirements related to the Controlled Substances Act and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. Because a traditional clinical trial design is not possible given the current federal status of Cannabis products, we will use a patient-oriented, prospective observational design. Specifically, individuals who have already decided to try Cannabis for their cancer treatment-related symptoms will initiate use of an orally administered product they have selected. A research assistant will provide information on the range of edible cannabis products and basic information about their various cannabinoid profiles, approximate prices, and nearby [CONTACT_135851].   The participants will then purchase the product and decide how often and how much to use. This approach is consistent with federal law and supported by [CONTACT_135852]77 (1R01AT009541-01, 1R01DA044131-01, CDPHE2902, R01DA039707). Participants will take the product as they see fit, without any frequency or dosing instructions from study staff, for two weeks, at which time they will be scheduled for their Pre- and Post- Administration Assessment (Ta1-Tc1) so that we may examine the acute effects of the product. The final follow-up will be one month later via an online survey sent directly to the participant via email. Details about the various study sessions are provided in Section 7.   4.[ADDRESS_154166] meet all of the following criteria: Number of interested patients who contact [CONTACT_135859]:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154167] intent to use Cannabis to treat their symptoms.  5.2 PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 1. Report of other non-prescription drug use, such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine in the past [ADDRESS_154168] cognition or compliance per the decision of the study M.D. 4. Premenopausal females who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Participants who become pregnant while participating in the study will also no longer be eligible for participation. 5. A Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) score indicating moderate or severe cognitive impairment at screening  5.[ADDRESS_154169]. Bowles, we will advertise our study with flyers in local oncology clinics affiliated with the University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) system. Our partner oncologists will not actively recruit or consent study participants, but rather contribute by [CONTACT_135860]. Flyers will also be posted in local oncology clinics not affiliated with UCHealth. Paid advertisements through Facebook and other social media sites that allow for targeting based on age, geographic location, and interests will be used. We will also utilize targeted mailings. A list of names and addresses of individuals who fit our age demographic and geographical area will be obtained from publicly available records purchased from a marketing firm (http://www.alescodata.com/reseller-programs.html). The recruitment flier will be mailed to each address on the list. In addition, print advertisements in local newspapers and magazines will be used. In terms of minority inclusion, the percentage of ethnic groups in the study will reflect the demography of the UCHealth Cancer clinics. Specifically, approximately 74% of participants will be non-Hispanic white, 12% will be Hispanic/Latino, 5% will be African American, and the remaining participants will be Asian, Native American/American Indian, or of mixed or other race. With respect to the recruitment of women, approximately 50% of cancer patients at UCHealth are female (51.4%). In terms of the inclusion of children, this is a study of the influence of Cannabis use on cancer care-related symptoms and cognitive function among cancer patients. Because the legal age for Cannabis use in Colorado is 21, we will not include any children in this project.

  19 of 47  5.3.2. Participant Selection. A trained research assistant will screen prospective participants who call in for the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If any subject is questionable for inclusion, [CONTACT_135879] (a licensed clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_87452] (a licensed M.D.), will make the final determination of eligibility. Finally, all female potential study participants of child-bearing age will undergo a pregancy test to confirm eligibility. For the pregnancy screening, a trained research assistant will deliver a urine receptacle to the participant’s home. The participant will then use the restroom in their home and return the receptacle to the research assistant to complete the urine test in the mobile laboratory.We expect that the proposed studies will reflect the ethnic diversity of the cancer population at the Cancer Center at Anschutz School of Medicine, such that approximately 20-30% of the final sample will represent Latino and non-Caucasian individuals. 5.3.3. Informed Consent. Potential participants who meet inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a remote baseline session. Participants will be emailed the eConsent in advance of this session. The eConsent may be viewed in its entirety and may be accessed at a later date if they want to think about participation. Each participant will go through the informed consent process with a trained research assistant over the phone or via Zoom, which will include reviewing all sections of the form, and answering any questions patients may have about study procedures or processes. Should participants choose to participate, they will verbally confirm that they agree to be in the study and will document informed consent electronically on the eConsent. Participants will be given the option of printing, downloading, or having the research team mail them a copy of the signed consent form for their own records. The REDCap e-consent framework will be used to document informed consent. The research assistant obtaining informed consent will electronically sign a separate instrument in REDCap associated with that participant’s record to document the informed consent process. 5.3.4. Incentives and Retention. Our recruitment plan is to include patients with a diagnosis of any solid tumor type who has or is undergoing either curative or palliative treatment. However, because patients are not currently asked about their desire to use cannabis by [CONTACT_25240], and clinicians currently only know about patients’ cannabis use desires if they are asked to sign an authorization for medical use, we are not certain that our recruitment goals are obtainable. A second potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_135821] a cancer patient population is cognitively and medically vulnerable, so it is possible that our assessments may be too taxing in terms of length or duration for patients to comfortably complete. We have ordered and scheduled assessments in this feasibility study prioritizing measures that would be representative of primary outcomes in a fully powered study to be collected first should patients fatigue and wish to quit. If it becomes clear that the number or order of assessments is not feasible, we will assure that procedures are adjusted to minimize burden on our patient participants. Incentives are offered at three different time points in the study (see Table 7.1 for compensation rates at Baseline, Two-week Acute Use, and One-Month Online Follow-Up appointments).   5.[ADDRESS_154170]. An investigator may terminate participation in the study if any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, new pregnancy, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued

Though highly unlikely, other circumstances under which a participant would be withdrawn without her consent include: (1) obviously not following study instructions (note: we will carefully track the number of participants who do not or cannot follow instructions as this is critical for feasibility and the design of the fully powered trial) or (2) behaving in a way that is verbally or physically abusive towards research staff. Those who experience early withdrawal will receive prorated payment based on the number of sessions they completed.  5.4.2 HANDLING OF PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWALS OR TERMINATION All procedures in this study are completely voluntary, and participants may withdraw their consent to participate at any point. Attempts will be made to understand why participants withdraw, as this is important for a feasibility trial, but even in that case giving investigators information concerning withdrawal is voluntary. Termination of participant by [CONTACT_431], as described above, will also be tracked in case there are procedures that are not feasible for cancer patients to follow. Again, this is critical for a feasibility trial. Once participants withdraw or are terminated, there will be no attempt to follow up with or further engage with the participant.  5.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF STUDY (STUDY STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442]) This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_135861]. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s) for the termination or suspension.  Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants. • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements. • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/ or evaluable. • Determination of futility.  6 STUDY AGENT 6.1 STUDY AGENT(S) AND CONTROL DESCRIPTION  6.1.[ADDRESS_154172] at a dispensary.

A urine pregnancy screening test will be administered to all female potential study participants of child-bearing age after informed consent has been obtained at the Baseline visit to verify eligibility for the study. For the pregnancy screening, a trained research assistant will deliver a urine receptacle to the participant’s home. The participant will then use the restroom in their home and return the receptacle to the research assistant to complete the urine test in the mobile laboratory.   7.2.2 OTHER ASSAYS OR PROCEDURES (RESEARCH)  Pain Intensity and Pain interference. We employ two self-report measures of pain intensity and interference. Pain Intensity consists of one item asking about the participant’s level of pain in the past seven days. Participants are asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). The Promis Pain Interference CAT asks participants about how their experience of pain interfered with or affected their enjoyment of various daily activities in the past seven days. The scale is computer-adapted and has a minimum of four questions and a maximum of 12 questions.  Anxiety and Mood Disturbance. The primary measure of lasting effects of Cannabis anxiety, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)[ADDRESS_154177] Schedule (PANAS), a brief, reliable and valid measure of positive and negative affect83 and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) consisting of 21 scaled statements designed to assess symptoms of depression84. As its name [CONTACT_135878], the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)85 assesses both trait and state anxiety.  Sleep. Perceived sleep quality will be assessed by [CONTACT_135863]-used and well-validated Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]86. Quality of Life. A commonly-used quality of life measure specific to cancer patients will be used to assess perceived quality of life: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General

  24 of 47  (FACT-G)87 assesses aspects of quality of life specific to cancer patients, including physical (e.g., nausea, lack of energy), social, emotional, and cognitive well-being88.  Objective and Subjective Cognitive Functioning. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) will be used at screening to assess for moderate to severe cognitive impairment that would preclude enrollment as a study participant. The TICS is a widely used and validated measure of cognitive impairment that is highly correlated to the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) 89. To assess objective cognitive functioning, we will conduct a neurocognitive battery on all participants that targets executive function. We will conduct this battery using Tatool, an open-source software developed to run psychological experimental studies90. This battery includes tests for which deficits have been observed among cancer patients78–80 and include measures that are recommended by [CONTACT_135862]91. The battery covers the domains found to be sensitive to the effects of Cannabis 55. Specifically, the cognitive battery will include the Stroop Task92 to assess inhibition and the Shape/Color Shifting Task93 to assess shifting. We will assess subjective cognitive functioning with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog), a reliable and valid assessment of perceived cognitive functioning specifically designed for cancer patients94. Health/Disease Status and Treatment Regimen. With the assistance of our oncology collaborators and OCRS staff, and with explicit informed consent from our patient participants, we will access Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) via the Health Data Compass95 coinciding with the Baseline encounter and the One Month Follow-up. We will obtain data regarding cancer staging, tumor characteristics, treatment regimen (observation versus chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, combination of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or other), current medications and doses (including treatment-supporting medications only), and any co-existing conditions.  Substance Use History.  The Marijuana Consumption Questionnaire (MCQ)[ADDRESS_154178] (AUDIT)97 will be used to examine the extent of alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use. A Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) will be used to assess daily substance use for the [ADDRESS_154179] reliability and validity99 Demographics. Personal information including gender, age, detailed race/ethnicity, and SES will be collected by [CONTACT_6270]-report in addition to extraction from the EMR obtained via Health Data Compass.  Pregnancy Screening. A urine pregnancy screening test will be administered to all female potential study participants of child-bearing age after informed consent has been obtained at the Baseline visit to verify eligibility for the study. For the pregnancy screening, a trained research assistant will deliver a urine receptacle to the participant’s home. The participant will then use the restroom in their home and return the receptacle to the research assistant to complete the urine test in the mobile laboratory.

  25 of 47  7.3 STUDY SCHEDULE  7.3.1 SCREENING  A trained research assistant will screen prospective participants who call in for the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research assistants will also provide an explanation of the study timeline and schedule of assessments, and compensation during this call, and answer any questions that participants may have about participation. If any subject is questionable for inclusion, [CONTACT_135879] (a licensed clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_87452] (a licensed M.D.), will make the final determination of eligibility. If a patient is deemed eligible for participation and wishes to proceed, an appointment will be made for a Baseline remote session. All female potential study participants of child-bearing age will then be asked to participate in pregancy testing to verify eligibility. A trained research assistant will deliver a urine receptacle to the participant’s home. The participant will then use the restroom in their home and return the receptacle to the research assistant to complete the urine test in the mobile laboratory.   7.3.2 ENROLLMENT/BASELINE  Potential participants who meet inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a baseline session. A trained research assistant will meet remotely with the participant via phone or Zoom. Each participant will go through the informed consent process. Once consented, participants will complete current and historical health and substance use assessments and cognitive testing (see Table 7.1). Participants will complete assessments via emailed, individually tailored links hosted by [CONTACT_135864]’s REDCap databases (https://redcap.ucdenver.edu/). Participants will then receive a consultation from research staff on the range of edible Cannabis products and basic information about their various cannabinoid profiles, approximate prices, and nearby [CONTACT_135851]. Again, research staff will not advise study participants to purchase any specific product. Participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_154180] for their time and effort at the end of the visit, which will be mailed to their home.  7.3.3 FOLLOW-UP   
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154181] they are ingesting, it is important to note that the subjective effects of THC and CBD are quite different59–62,64–68,102, and thus participants who are not naïve to Cannabis use would likely not be blind even if assigned to a product. Importantly, the researchers who conduct the assessments as well as most of the senior investigators will be blind to condition. The observational aspect of the design involves the instruction to use their selected product at home consistent with the packaging directions and/or as they see fit. Consistent with federal law, study staff will not provide any directions regarding dosing and administration. For verification purposes, participants will take and send a pi[INVESTIGATOR_135823] 6.1.3.  Pre- and Post- Administration Assessment (Ta1-Tc1). The Pre- and Post- Administration Assessment will take place two weeks (+/- 4 days) following the baseline session. A trained research assistant will meet remotely with the participant via phone or Zoom. Links to assessments will be emailed to the participannt at the start of the session. Prior to taking their Cannabis, participants will complete self-report assessments, including those assessing quantity/frequency of Cannabis use and symptom severity over the prior two weeks (Ta1). They will then consume their orally administered Cannabis. Because 60 minutes is the average time that CBD and THC levels begin to peak in the blood after oral administration of Cannabis extract70,71, assessments of the acute effects of Cannabis (see Table 7.2) will begin one hour (+/- 5 minutes) post-edible consumption (Tb1). After peak, levels steadily decrease over the next 2-[ADDRESS_154182]-ingestion begin to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135824]70,71. To account for individual differences in metabolism and sensitivity, participants will be assessed again at 2 hours (+/- 5 minutes) post-consumption (Tc1). After completing the 1- and 2- hour post-consumption assessments,, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_154183] 

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, [ADDRESS_154184] to their symptoms levels, Cannabis use, and cognition, using an online survey one month (+/- 7 days) later (M1), in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_135825]. This aspect will provide important data on feasibility of longer-term follow-up with this population, and further valuable data in regard to patient choice, patient behavior, patterns of use of Cannabis products, and associated experience of symptoms related to cancer treatment in a fully-powered iteration of the study. The survey will assess their Cannabis use, other substance use, symptom levels (pain, anxiety, and sleep), quality of life, and subjective and objective cognitive functioning over the past month. We also will conduct the final health status and treatment regimen review of the participant’s EMR separately at this time point via Health Data Compass. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_154185] as compensation for their time and effort, which will be mailed to their home.    7.3.5 Schedule of Events Table

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, 2022 
  29 of 47  8.1.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  We define adverse event as “Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research” (http://www.colorado.edu/vcr/sites/default/files/IRB%20Policy%20Procedures-%20Final%2010-01-11_website.pdf).   8.1.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  We define serious adverse event as an event that “Results in death, is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards.”  (http://www.colorado.edu/vcr/sites/default/files/IRB%20Policy%20Procedures-%20Final%2010-01-11_website.pdf).   8.1.3 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UAP)  This study will use the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) definition of an unanticipated problem: “involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.”     8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  8.2.1 SEVERITY OF EVENT For AEs not included in the protocol-defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity. 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, 2022 
  30 of 47  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities. • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.   8.2.2 EXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS   Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. Given the observational nature of our study and the disease state of our target participants, common events in our study population such as feeling intoxicated from marijuana, mild or consistent with baseline levels of pain, anxiety, drowsiness, or nausea are to be expected and will be documented on case report forms but not be reported as adverse events.  8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study sessions. All AEs including local and systemic reactions 1) not meeting the criteria for SAEs, 2) not included in the list of expected events in Section 8.2.3, or 3) beyond a threshold for an expected event listed in Section 8.2.3 (such as greater than mild symptoms or significant change from baseline in pain, anxiety, drowsiness, or nausea) will be captured on the appropriate case report form by a CUChange Lab professional research assistant. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, assessment of severity, and time of resolution/ stabilization of the event.   Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  At each study visit, the professional research assistant will inquire about the occurrence of AE/ SAEs since the last visit.   8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES 8.4.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  The study team will adhere to the protocol detailed in the figure below for reporting adverse events.

All SAEs will otherwise be followed to adequate resolution or stabilization.  8.4.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, UAPs are not anticipated. Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UAPs require the creation and completion of a UAP report form and including the following information: • Protocol-identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents a UAP; Research Assistant becomes aware of AEPI [INVESTIGATOR_135827]-I Camidge receive notice of AE within same business dayResearch Assistant submits formal AE documentation to Bryan and Camidge within 24 hours of eventSubmission of AE documentation will be made to IRB within 72 hours of events

  33 of 47   10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  10.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS This is a feasibility study and thus underpowered for meaningful analysis; the endpoints are strictly recruitment based. We will however examine the data for completeness (i.e., were any measures or items consistently left blank). In addition, we will examine the summary statistics including mean and standard deviation for continuous items as well as skew and kurtosis to evaluate whether the measures approximate a normal distribution. For categorical outcomes, we will examine proportions in each category to get some idea of variability on the measure.   10.2 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES • Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): This section is not applicable.  • Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): This section is not applicable.  10.3 DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL METHODS 10.3.1  ADHERENCE AND RETENTION ANALYSES This feasibility study has an 80% retention goal for reasonable compliance with study procedures by [CONTACT_135868]. Reasonable compliance is defined as 75% completion of study assessments. Adherence is not applicable to this observational study design.  10.3.2  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS We will characterize the cohort based on demographics, disease stage, and other relevant descriptives.  10.4 SAMPLE SIZE We plan to recruit 30 participants into this feasibility study, as we believe this will be adequate to determine whether the larger trial is possible and whether there are changes in study procedures that would be required before initiating a fully powered study.

A member of the study team not responsible for data collection will maintain the experimenter blind.  10.5.1 ENROLLMENT/ RANDOMIZATION/ MASKING PROCEDURES Participants will be free to select the edible Cannabis product of their choice and use their product ad libitum. They will report on their selection via an individualized, emailed REDCap survey blinded to the study team with the exception of a member of the study team not responsible for data collection.  10.5.2 EVALUATION OF SUCCESS OF BLINDING  Because we do not anticipate the blinding to be maintained by [CONTACT_4317], we will not assess the success of the blind.  10.5.3 BREAKING THE STUDY BLIND/PARTICIPANT CODE Since participants are aware of which product they are taking, there are no conditions under which the blind needs to be broken.  11 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS We have taken a number of measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data and the safety of the participants. All data from the proposed study will be identified by a numerical ID code only. The information linking the numerical ID code to identifying information will be maintained separate and secure from the data themselves.

  38 of 47  14.2 STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  Study documents should be retained for a minimum of two years after the final participant has completed the study. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427], or institution policies. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_135830].   14.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or SOP requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. These practices are consistent with ICH E6, sections: • 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3. • 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1. • 5.[ADDRESS_154197] be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/ study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the -SOP and/or study procedures manual.   14.4 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the published results of NIH-funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication.  The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human participants to intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and the Section [ADDRESS_154198] of 2007 requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_135796] #:  18-0836 Version Date: May 31st, 2022 
  39 of 47  clinical trials performed under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to publish.   FDAAA mandates that a “responsible party” (i.e., the sponsor or designated PI) register and report results of certain “applicable clinical trials”. • Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation; • Trials of Devices: Controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric postmarket surveillance studies.  [ADDRESS_154199] of this trial will be disclosed and managed.by [CONTACT_135876]’s (UCD) Office of Regulatory Compliance Conflict of Interest and Commitment Management (COIC) program. Persons with a perceived conflict of interest will have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. Conflict of Interest management plans are project-specific and are reviewed at least annually. UCD has integrated the institutional conflict of interest management program with its existing program.  17  LITERATURE REFERENCES  1.  Temel JS, Greer JA, Muzikansky A, et al.

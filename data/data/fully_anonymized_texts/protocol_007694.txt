 Page 9 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019  1. Objectives 1.1. Purpose: To use magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia by [CONTACT_67940] a treatment protocol in order to determine whether can benefit pediatric pain in post-operative transplanted patients and decrease overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. 2. Background 2.1. Significance of Research Question/Purpose: Our study’s purpose would be to improve analgesia in TPI[CONTACT_50182] (total pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplant) and liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872848], and to expand growing literature regarding magnesium as an analgesic, including in a yet-studied population. There is currently some promising data that MgSO4 can be beneficial as an analgesic in certain operative and post-operative pediatric patients, though data remains mixed depending on the method of magnesium delivery, as well as the dosing used and study design.  Pain remains a significant source for morbidity in post-transplant pediatric patients, and to our knowledge use of magnesium for analgesia has not been studied in these populations.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing medication and targeting new analgesic options is an important and growing research topic in medicine. 2.2. Preliminary Data: To our knowledge there is no data regarding magnesium use for pain control in post-operative transplant patients, despi[INVESTIGATOR_872849] (both adults and pediatrics).  There is data in MgSO4 pediatric analgesia studies, extrapolated data from continuous MgSO4 infusions in asthmatics, and numerous adult studies, the combination of which support safety for our intended infusion dosing in our study. 2.3. Existing Literature: Early data regarding MgSO4 use as adjuvant analgesia dates back to the late 90’s in adult literature (2), and has since been studied in a wide variety of those populations, with some meta-analysis data now showing efficacy as well (3-13).  Pediatric literature often lags behind, however now also has growing data over the past two decades.  Much of the pediatric analgesic-specific data is in tonsillectomy populations, which has mixed but promising results on efficacy depending on the method of delivery as well as outcome measure studied (14,15,22-25,28-29).  Potentially more comparable pediatric populations to our proposed study population include osteotomies in cerebral palsy and scoliosis repairs, which both tend to have more analgesic requirement than T&A.  Both of these populations have been studied and shown to have decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_872850]/or pain scores with magnesium analgesia (17,18).  Most statistically significant beneficial data of MgSO4 use cites a bolus IV dose in the OR, followed by a continuous infusion during the procedure.  Adult studies have shown potential benefit in extending this infusion beyond the OR as well (40,41).  Given the increased and prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_872851] (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.  VERSION DATE: 06/09/2022 
 Page 10 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/[ADDRESS_1219237]-operative magnesium protocol.  To our knowledge there is no definitive therapeutic window for magnesium’s analgesic effect, and studies vary as to what supra-physiologic levels are obtained based on their derived infusion protocol.  Comparable intra-operative infusion doses in pediatric analgesic studies range from as low as 30 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr (25) and 50 mg/kg + 8 mg/kg/hr (17) to as high as 50 mg/kg + 15 mg/kg/hr (18).  The study at our proposed dosing had levels of 3.2 mg/dL immediately post-op (18).  Infusions of higher doses have been used safely in pediatric asthma studies, including doses of 50-75 mg/kg + 40 mg/kg/hr for 4 hours, reaching interquartile levels of high 3’s to mid 4’s mg/dL (37).  In adult studies prolonged infusions have been used for subarachnoid hemorrhage targeting higher ranges of 4-6 mg/dL for up to 10 days duration (38,39).  Adult studies have also demonstrated efficacy in infusion protocols beyond the operative period (40,41).  One protocol of 30 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr was used for 48 hours in thoracotomy patients with levels of 2.8 +/- 0.3 mg/dL at conclusion (41).  Prolonged infusions in pediatrics beyond [ADDRESS_1219238] only in asthma studies, including one with average duration of ~4 days (42).  None of the above studies encountered any clinically significant magnesium side effects, and only transient diplopia and muscle weakness was reported in the adult subarachnoid hemorrhagic study when levels reached 6 mg/dL (symptoms resolved with lowering dose).   According to DynaMED and Micromedex searches on magnesium, normal levels may range 1.5 - 2.5 mEq/L (equivalent to 1.8-3.1 mg/dL), and toxic hypermagnesemic levels are typi[INVESTIGATOR_872852] >4 mEq/L (4.86 mg/dL), which does not yet include many of the hemodynamic and EKG changes (typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] >5 mEq/L or 6.08 mg/dL).  Most background data in our referenced sources cite ~4.5-5 mg/dL as potential sources of clinically relevant magnesium toxicity.  We intend to target levels well below this and will avoid adverse effects by [CONTACT_872921].  Level checks and titration plan is determined from existing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, discussions with our pharmacy team, which is standardly involved with safety modifications of all admitted PI[INVESTIGATOR_447951], and recommendations from the FDA during the IND process.  The significance and rationale for this study has been alluded to above, namely due to the extensive pain that post-operative transplant children endure, and our clinical duty to treat this medical problem (benevolence).  Our post-operative patients are scheduled on a number of analgesic modalities simultaneously, including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], ketamine, non-pharmacologic intervention (child life, music therapy, etc), and even procedural (paravertebral block in TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872853]) - stressing both the difficulty of their pain control as well as the need for safe alternatives.  Additionally, the growing threat of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_872854] a multitude

 Page 11 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 of patient populations to better distribute what opi[INVESTIGATOR_872855] (justice).  Magnesium is one of the potential adjuvants that we hope to expand existing literature on by [CONTACT_171095] a yet-studied population.  Secondary benefit from the use of MgSO4 is the optimization of hypomagnesemia, which is especially common in ICU populations, including post-transplant patients who are often on tacrolimus for immunosuppression (43-45).  Hypomagnesemia in itself is associated with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic alkalosis, and prolonged PI[INVESTIGATOR_128392] (45).  Based on its safety profile outlined above, promising literature search, and optimal patient population (high analgesic requirement), we feel that this study has tremendous potential for scientific significance in pediatric patients. 3. Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes 3.1. Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome: Primary outcome focuses on the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321] (morphine equivalent per body weight) over the operative and post-operative PI[INVESTIGATOR_872856] (which may range upwards of 7 days in some transplant cohorts).  The hypothesis is that magnesium sulfate use will decrease this dosage compared to controls, however measurements will be used to determine whether the intervention does not have any statistical difference as well (or even increases doses, which would be otherwise unexpected in the literature).  We intend to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 30 prospective transplant patients (liver, TPI[CONTACT_50182]).  Retrospective control data will consist of the last 60 transplants (30 liver, 30 TPI[CONTACT_50182]), which was determined based on original power analysis targets for a larger-based study anticipated in the future.  The study will be stopped prematurely if during obligated data reviews it is determined that opi[INVESTIGATOR_872857].  The study will also be halted if 2 patients develop clinically significant adverse reactions secondary to magnesium, at minimum until able to further review dosing and protocols.  If arrhythmia (other than transient bradycardia), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or coma are encountered once (also deemed secondary to magnesium), the study will be halted immediately with that patient.  Per above, if encountering more frequent anemia than typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396]-transplant, the study will be halted to evaluate lab frequency’s effect. The study will also be halted for further review if there is a dosing error.  A list of data measures is provided in a secondary attachment with this protocol. 3.2. Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): Secondary outcome data will evaluate total opi[INVESTIGATOR_872858]-operative day (i.e. POD#1, POD#2, POD#3, etc) to help determine any variance in effect based on proximity to the surgery as well. Secondary outcomes will also focus on other opi[INVESTIGATOR_872859], including amount of ‘requested’ (PRN) opi[INVESTIGATOR_872860].  Secondary outcomes will also include opi[INVESTIGATOR_872861], since these would hypothetically be less if MgSO4 does indeed lessen opi[INVESTIGATOR_418690].  We will collect ‘pain scores’ as well, however literature suggests these are often difficult to

 Page 12 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/[ADDRESS_1219239] of data measures is provided in a secondary attachment with this protocol. 4. Study Intervention(s)/Investigational Agent(s) 4.1. Description: MgSO4 is a pharmacological agent which will be administered intravenously as a 30-minute bolus dose of 50 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) in the OR, followed by a 15 mg/kg/hr IV infusion for an additional [ADDRESS_1219240].  The bolus will be given after anesthesia induction for TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872853], and after reperfusion of the transplanted liver for liver transplant patients (this is deemed by [CONTACT_872922]). Of note, it is not anticipated that our patient population would leave the PI[INVESTIGATOR_872862] [ADDRESS_1219241] bolus dosing of MgSO4 in pediatrics is 25-75 mg/kg, so per the above literature search 50 mg/kg seems a confirmed safe dosing.  Similar dosing protocols using a bolus and infusion which have been studied for analgesia in children without side effect in the literature include the following: 50 mg/kg then 15 mg/kg/hr (18,20), 30 mg/kg then 10 mg/kg/hr (14,25), 50 mg/kg then 8 mg/kg/hr (17).  Our proposed 50 mg/kg + 15 mg/kg/hr infusion dose has been utilized effectively and safely at the adult level as well (5,49).  Dosing as high as 100 mg/kg then 40 mg/kg/hr has been used in tetanus.  To our knowledge, MgSO4 for analgesia remains ‘off-label’ use, unless discussing for headache pain (used commonly in emergency room medication ‘cocktails’ for migraines).  It is known however that magnesium acts antagonistically on the NMDA receptor, a common nociceptor, one also targeted by [CONTACT_113883] (1).  MgSO4 will be delivered at concentration of 100 mg/mL via patient’s central line (placed in all transplants regardless of study intervention).  MgSO4 is also a physiologically vital electrolyte in the human body, and one that is replaced frequently in the ICU, including in the post-operative transplant population.  To avoid nearing toxic magnesium levels, we will titrate medication dosing to be below 3.5 mg/dL.  Total magnesium level will be checked in the OR following bolus dose, every 2 hours throughout the transplant procedure, at the initial PI[INVESTIGATOR_872863] 4 hours [expected window +/- 1 hour] for the remainder of infusion.  Other electrolytes (including potassium, ionized calcium, phosphorus) will be checked at least daily (sometimes more if deemed appropriate for other standard of care transplant requirements, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_116511] 6 hours).  If any magnesium level is above target, infusion dose will be decreased by 5 mg/kg/hr.  These adjustments are based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data and pharmacist expertise at the UMN.  If magnesium infusion is at any time decreased to 0 mg/kg/hr based on these levels, it will not

 Page 13 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 be restarted.  Should the infusion be discontinued, once magnesium levels normalize we will plan to check magnesium levels at discretion of primary team rather than study intervals, so as to minimize risk of anemia and excessive accessing of central line.  If levels are not able to be drawn due to some other unpredicted variable (patient participating in physical therapy, patient escorted down to gift shop, patient had emergent surgical intervention for other reasons, etc), blood draw will be performed at earliest availability.  This is standard of care for any serial blood draw ordered on the unit.  If there is an adverse event that there is concern magnesium may be contributing, the infusion will be immediately turned off until further investigation deems safe to restart.  Any adverse event deemed secondary to magnesium will result in indefinite discontinuation of the infusion, notification of safety monitor, and review of study protocol as outlined elsewhere.  This is discussed further in risk sections.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_872864], based on the above protocol and the extended duration of magnesium infusion compared to available literature, as well as the absence of previous research in our targeted population, this proposed project was submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_872923].  Based on the sources discussed above in existing literature section, our dosing protocol has been tried intraoperatively in both pediatrics and adults without side effect and demonstrated levels below which cause hemodynamically relevant side effects.  Further data (asthma in pediatrics, multiple purposes in adults) have demonstrated prolonged durations of magnesium infusion at comparable doses without adverse effects, including durations longer than our proposed [ADDRESS_1219242]. 4.2. Drug/Device Handling: This is an IND research study, in which case the Investigational Drug Service at UMN will monitor handling of magnesium including ordering, storage, and handling of the medication.  OnCore programming will be used for IDS-monitoring and study’s protocol schedule.  Costs for medication and drug levels will be paid for by [CONTACT_89755].  Nurses perform 2-person checks to confirm all ICU-delivered medications, which will include MgSO4.  This includes checking name [CONTACT_2100], dose, and infusion rate when starting the medication.  There will be no change-over to a new MgSO4 bag at transfer from OR to PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  The medication is already currently ordered and stored at the UMN, so would not otherwise require any new/additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872865], other than pharmacy and IDS tracking any shortage of supply. 4.3.

 Page 14 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 5. Procedures Involved 5.1. Study Design: Experimental Group: Prospective Cohort of next [ADDRESS_1219243] a 50/50 balanced prospective cohort. Control Group: Control will be via retrospective chart review of the last 60 transplant patients from the same population (liver, TPI[CONTACT_50182]) with same surgeon.  Intervention and data collection will be as outlined elsewhere in protocol. 5.2. Study Procedures: Experimental Group: There will be no operative procedures per study parameters (though the transplantation procedure itself as well as any secondary procedures from complications are otherwise per standard of care).  Patient’s medical record will be reviewed for basic eligibility criteria (history of myasthenia gravis or heart block).  If female and of reproductive age, patient will have a urine B-hCG, which is routine prior to any abdominal surgery.  The only prospective study procedure will be the magnesium protocol previously outlined, where IV MgSO4 will be delivered as a 30-minute bolus dose of 50 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) in OR followed by a 15 mg/kg/hr infusion initiated immediately after (i.e. in OR as well) until conclusion of PI[INVESTIGATOR_872866] [ADDRESS_1219244].  Magnesium levels will be monitored throughout the duration of the infusion per above - every 2 hours in OR starting after bolus dose, then every 4 hours [expected window +/- 1 hour].  There are no other baseline visits or follow-up visits independent of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_872867].  We do not anticipate this study intervention impacting workflow significantly, as infusion medications are standard interventions in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], and these patients already have frequent blood draws.  A study schedule with these interventions will be created via OnCore program to ensure compliance with protocol.  Data outcomes will be collected from epic EMR at the conclusion of each patient’s ICU admission by [CONTACT_3252]-investigator and medical student researcher and stored in REDCap.  All collected data is via EMR, so no surveys/scripts/forms are needed for data collection.  Specifically, the EMR will be accessed for appropriate transplant patient, followed by [CONTACT_872924] (which would be current), followed by [CONTACT_872925] (for example: Intake/Output section, or results review -> magnesium level, etc).  Only specific data collection pathways will be targeted while in a patient’s medical chart.  There are no other drugs/devices involved in study or that would alter MgSO4 delivery.  Similarly, there are no out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872868].  Any out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175981] (i.e. pre-admission consent if performed) will include adherence to COVID precautions per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].

 Page 15 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 Control Group: For collection of control data, a MRN list of the most recent 60 transplant patients under the same surgeon at this institution (30 liver, 30 TPI[CONTACT_50182]) who have not opted out of research will be obtained via UMN’s Best Practices Integrated Informatics Core (BPIC), followed by [CONTACT_872926]’s chart and collect for intended outcomes, which are also uploaded into RedCap.  This will be done in identical manner as that for prospective data collection — the EMR will be accessed for appropriate patient by [CONTACT_256720], followed by [CONTACT_872927], followed by [CONTACT_872928] (for example: Intake/Output section, or results review -> magnesium level, etc).  Collection of this data will be initiated at the start of IRB approval and ongoing to completion.  Full data analysis will be completed at conclusion of study followed by [CONTACT_872929].  Of note, hypomagnesemia is corrected per standard ICU care with IV MgSO4 regardless of study, and liver transplant patients currently have a pre-designed magnesium replacement protocol (also used in our CVICU post-operative cardiac patients).  This will still be included in data collection without adjustment to any comparison data in statistical analysis.  This replacement protocol will not be used in our study as we will already be providing continuous IV MgSO4.  Similarly, magnesium blood levels are checked independent of this study, although will be more frequent now for safety monitoring.  These blood levels are drawn through a central line that is already in place independent of this study, so will not require percutaneous needle stick. There are no other drugs/devices involved in study or that would alter MgSO4 delivery. 5.3. Study Duration: Experimental Group: Enrollment of study participants will be ongoing for entire duration of study as transplant becomes available.  The total duration of participant participation will be approximately [ADDRESS_1219245] made surgical schedules more unpredictable, and therefore a more confirmatory timeline is difficult to infer.  Institutional scheduling of elective procedures and approval of patient enrollment did not occur until July 2020.  Data analysis should not extend the study duration by [CONTACT_726] 2-3 months.  Control Group: Control will be via retrospective chart review of same transplant population.  Data analysis and manuscript preparation will follow (ideally with the project being fully concluded by [CONTACT_9179]-June 2023).  There is no intended long-term data follow up needed.

Included/Allowed to Participate — though coercion will be adamantly avoided   9.2 Additional Safeguards:  Children: Entire targeted cohort will be a pediatric population <[ADDRESS_1219247] degrees in pediatric intensive care or pediatric surgery.  If a patient turns 18 while the study is ongoing, we will re-consent using an adult consent form.  If a patient turns 18 while the study is ongoing, but is unable to consent for themselves (incapacitated), we intend for parental consent to stand until that participant became able to consent.  Parental consent is described further in section 20.5. Non-English Speakers: It is possible that family may be encountered which are non-English speaking, given the overall diversity in our area.  Consent standards will be maintained in these cases with use of interpreter (in person, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_98991]), services which are provided by [CONTACT_137025].  We will include short form consent templates and a 2nd witness.  Interpreters are also used for daily medical updates and on medical rounds, which is our current standard practice for all patients. Illiterate: Consent forms will be read for the patient by [CONTACT_872931] ‘teach back’ technique to ensure full understanding is obtained prior to informed decision-making.  This aligns with standard of care and that used for consent for transplant surgery. Military/Employees/Colleagues: While these populations are excluded given their age, children of any members of this population would be eligible for participation. Undervalued or disenfranchised social group:  Intention will be to offer IV MgSO4 analgesia to all patients of all variety without any discrimination toward wealth, race, sexual identity or orientation, politics, social interests or preferences, stereotypes, or any other characteristic not mentioned in the exclusion criteria above. Stressful Situation: Only anticipated situation for this study would be if patient develops acute disease exacerbation necessitating organ transplant (i.e. Liver).  In

 Page 20 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 these cases patient and family are still given formal consent process prior to surgery.  Consent for this IV MgSO4 use will be done at this time per protocol (i.e. no variance from the standard for other patients).  Any unwillingness to discuss research protocol/consent due to stress will be immediately honored and patient excluded from study. Disadvantaged: Intention will be to offer IV MgSO4 analgesia to these patients without any discrimination.  Consent per routine protocol will be discussed without variance from the standard for other patients. Serious Health Condition: Any patient which has developed a condition without any satisfactory standard treatments and has thus been offered transplant will still be considered eligible for this study.  Consent per routine protocol will be discussed without variance from the standard for other patients.  MgSO4 analgesia is independent of the underlying disease due to secondary pain from transplant. Fear of negative consequences: Derived consent forms address our intent that participating or not participating has no bearing on consequences to patient regarding their care in the ICU.  This will be discussed during the consent process without variance from the standard for other patients. Increased vulnerability/coercion: There are no anticipated dynamics which would otherwise alter discussions of post-operative pain, which is a part of the initial transplant consent regardless.  As for coercion, research investigators are also physicians directly involved in patient care.  Dedication will be paid to patient autonomy as is for all patients.  Consent will be obtained without variance from the standard for other patients. None of the above populations affect the underlying physiology of post-operative pain and so seem appropriate to have all analgesic options discussed.  Ongoing PI[INVESTIGATOR_872870]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872871], so all are aware of any effects on medical care strategies.  Emphasis on respect for patient autonomy will be made regarding decision for or against MgSO4 therapy in this communication.  Additionally, this study’s IV MgSO4 dosing will be built into the post-operative transplant care protocols which are shared with the medical team for each transplant patient.  No one aside from the necessary treatment team is aware of medical management of these patients, so as to protect confidentiality and anonymity.  These interventions should help prevent any undue harm to above populations. 10. Local Number of Participants 10.1. Local Number of Participants to be Consented: Local Number of Participants to be Consented: 30 consented for prospective cohort, 60 previous patients for control group.  Assuming ~75% consent rate, this will require ~40 patients approached.  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.  VERSION DATE: 06/09/2022 
 Page 21 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 This number was originally determined based on power analysis performed on available literature - see section 15.2 (Power Analysis), however has been adjusted based on further stipulations during IND approval. Due to COVID alterations and other instigators on decreased procedures at this institution, this target may be altered to a lower number, with intentions to prove feasibility. 11. Local Recruitment Methods 11.1. Recruitment Process: Experimental Group: Study team personnel will introduce this study at a patient’s routine pre-operative PACCT appointment (pain specialist) for all TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872853].  This team is routinely involved in all TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872872]-operative analgesic course, and also presents an un-biased view in regards to this research.  The transplant surgeon (Co-Investigator) will introduce this study at all Liver transplant patients’ pre-operative visit while discussing analgesic management after surgery.  It is possible that liver transplantation may be introduced as an emergent medical situation.  Regardless, visits/discussions are done in private consultation.  When available the co-investigator will be present for study introduction and consent as well.  If the patient expresses interest, the TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872873], transplant surgeon or co-investigator would introduce the details of study.  Formal consent discussion will ensue if participant intends to enroll and will be supplemented from created consent/assent documents.  Any signed documents will be uploaded to patient chart for adequate communication to treatment team.  Similar procedure will be performed for liver transplant patients, however approach will be at a similar outpatient appointment with liver transplant team or while inpatient (if admitted for acute hepatic complications).  Recruitment is intended to continue until the intended patient number is reached.  Any patient contact, including if pre-admission consent is performed, will include adherence to COVID precautions per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]. When it is not possible to obtain written informed consent for infection control or other justifiable reasons, we will use a waiver of documentation of written/signed documentation of consent and obtain phone consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent from the patient when deemed possible based upon patient age, developmental status and illness severity. Study coordinators will generally err on the side of utilizing the phone consenting process for infection control, unless the treating team allows for entrance into the patient’s room. Study staff will create a consent narrative for each enrolled patient to document the consent process in detail.   Control Group: Participants will be identified from medical records 11.2. Identification of Potential Participants: Experimental Group: Potential participants will be identified by [CONTACT_872932] (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.

The transplant surgeon (also a co-investigator of this study) will make initial contact [CONTACT_808190]/families, and will describe the intended treatment plan including consent for our study.  The surgeon and PI [INVESTIGATOR_872874], in addition to consent and HIPAA authorization forms being added to patient chart so that can be confirmed at admission to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]. Control Group: The records used in the study for the control group are the records of the patients in the investigators’ clinical practices.  Any medical records marked with the opt-out-research flag will not be viewed.  A list of the past 60 patients based on inclusion criteria will be obtained from the BPIC at the UMN. 11.3. Recruitment Materials: n/a 11.4. Payment: n/a 12. Withdrawal of Participants 12.1. Withdrawal Circumstances:  Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may terminate participation in the study if: 1. Any clinical adverse event (AE), such as secondary toxic reaction to magnesium sulfate, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant.  Specifics regarding secondary reactions: ▪ regarding the hemodynamic adverse effects of magnesium: the drug will be halted for etiologic evaluation in the presence of confirmed hypotension or sustained bradycardia; if deemed secondary to magnesium that patient’s therapy will be permanently discontinued ▪ regarding sedative effects: the PI[INVESTIGATOR_872875]; preference with over-sedation will be to decrease other analgesia/sedative infusions as able given overall goal of this study (i.e. lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], dexmedetomidine first as able).  If deemed unable to decrease other infusions or already at a minimum, and over-sedation still present, then magnesium infusion will be discontinued. ▪ regarding frequency of blood draws: blood draws are already frequent in this population of patients in initial [ADDRESS_1219249]-op (typi[INVESTIGATOR_116511] 6

 Page 23 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 hours at minimum already).  If deemed by [CONTACT_872933] (familiar with typi[INVESTIGATOR_872876]) that this population is suffering hemoglobin < 8 g/dL more frequently than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], and is not felt to be secondary to other complications from the surgery or transplant course, the patient’s infusion will be stopped and the study will be halted to review the protocol and lab frequency further  2. Patient dosing is serially decreased to 0 mg/kg/hr per protocol 3. The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation, including if study staff member no longer able to be present in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872877]-in throughout procedure 12.2. Withdrawal Procedures: If a participant wishes to withdraw or we determine that the participant should withdraw, all data collected up to that point will be used in analysis unless the participant wishes for their data not to be used. We will intend for a partial withdrawal, where data will continue to be collected via private/protected records. 12.3. Termination Procedures: This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_87077], funding agency, the IND sponsor and regulatory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s) for the termination or suspension. The study team will notify the participants of the study termination.  Specifically, the study will be halted if 2 patients develop clinically significant adverse reactions secondary to magnesium, at minimum until able to further review dosing and protocols.  If arrhythmia (other than transient bradycardia), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or coma encountered once (also deemed secondary to magnesium), the study will be halted immediately with that patient until able to review with IRB and FDA.  Per above, if encountering more frequent anemia than typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396]-transplant course on multiple patients, the study will be halted to evaluate lab frequency’s effect.  The study will also be halted for further review if there is a dosing error. Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants • Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable

 Page 24 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 • Determination of futility. The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and/or data quality procedures are addressed and satisfy IRB and FDA. Data collected for the study prior to the study termination will be handled in the following manner: • if the study is terminated due to safety reasons, the data related to AEs will be evaluated.  • if the study is terminated for any other reason, the regulatory and institutional document/data retention policies will apply. 13. Risks to Participants 13.1. Foreseeable Risks: This would include the potential for known side effects from magnesium toxicity, namely: hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, hyporeflexia, effects on other electrolytes (such as potassium and calcium), muscle weakness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (secondary to muscle weakness), and increased sedation (including when combined with opi[INVESTIGATOR_73773]).  These toxic risks are cited typi[INVESTIGATOR_872878] > 4-4.5 mg/dL.  We will minimize this risk by [CONTACT_872934].  Hypotension is monitored for via routine serial blood pressure monitoring in all ICU patients, and can be treated with IV fluid resuscitation as needed (standard for hypermagnesemia treatment).  Cardiac arrhythmia is monitored for via cardiac telemetry in all ICU patients, and cardiology specialists and arrhythmia resuscitation techniques are available per standard ICU care.  Both of these are risk factors that are present in these populations regardless of magnesium use, however if these conditions are felt potentially contributed to by [CONTACT_872935].  Electrolyte abnormalities are also common in ICU populations and are monitored routinely per post-transplant protocols.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_872879], however if secondary to perceived muscle weakness out of proportion to standard post-operative course, the magnesium infusion will be stopped as well.  Sedation and other analgesia is routine in post-operative transplant care and is addressed and titrated based on daily goals.  Decreasing other sedatives will take precedent over magnesium in cases of oversedation given the overall objective of the study.  Increased blood draws may occur during monitoring, however in [ADDRESS_1219250] ICU regulations per institutional and leadership for routine drip/dose checks.  The only other potential foreseeable risk would be that of intravenous line capability.  Post-operative transplant patients require multiple IV

 Page 25 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 medications (both bolus and drips), which sometimes require placement of additional IV catheters.  Given that magnesium is already periodically replaced in these populations for hypomagnesemia, we think the risk for impacting line availability is rather low, but in theory could increase potential of line complications.  IV catheter complications are anticipated/potential risks of any patient in the ICU independent of this study.  Per the above protocol, there will be both peripheral and central line magnesium concentrations in case there are compatibility issues where magnesium cannot be administered in the same IV line as another medication (amphotericin and calcium infusions being the two rare instances that could occur).  Risk for administering the wrong concentration into its intended IV line (peripheral or central) will be avoided via separate Epic orders (‘PERIPHERAL’ and ‘CENTRAL’ built into the research medication entry), appropriate labeling and delivery by [CONTACT_17387], pharmacy checks (routine on all ICU administered medications), and nursing checks (also routine standard of care).  All efforts will be made to protect participants’ confidentiality following Good Clinical Practice, the policies of the Committee on Clinical Investigations (IRB), and Federal and State laws as they apply. There is risk of protocol deviation. This will be mitigated by [CONTACT_872936], study staff check-in communication with PI[INVESTIGATOR_872880]. 13.2. Reproduction Risks: n/a 13.3. Risks to Others: no perceived risk to others 14. Potential Benefits to Participants 14.1. Potential Benefits: The most notable potential benefit to study participants is for a more comfortable ICU stay with less opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321].  This would hopefully correlate with less overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293], which otherwise may further contribute to morbidity (most notably constipation, ileus, itching, nausea).  It is difficult to predict the likelihood of this impact given lack of data in this population, however the potential for beneficial effect of an otherwise physiologically required electrolyte compared to minimal chance of side effect seem an optimal opportunity for study.  If proven beneficial, the magnitude may be quite significant, with the potential to alter protocols in these populations, and further fuel studies regarding magnesium's analgesic effect and dosing optimization.  While we anticipate that our impact on these children will mostly be in the ICU, adult patients have more notable long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321] (something not as replicated in kids according to TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872881]), and may be an interesting new cohort to study as well given overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_872882]. 15. Statistical Considerations 15.1. Data Analysis Plan: EPIC will be the source document used for collection of all data, which will be transferred to REDCap for clinical database.  The following will

Longitudinal measurements of magnesium, other analgesics, ionized calcium, PTH, and creatinine levels will be analyzed using mixed effects models.  Group summaries including means, standard deviations, and rates will be reported and group differences will be summarized as incidence rate ratios, odds ratios, or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals.  Analyses will be conducted using the intent-to-treat principle; control group participants who underwent magnesium replacement (for hypomagnesemia or pre-designed post-transplant protocol) will be included in the control group, and experimental group participants with discontinuation of magnesium, if any, will be included in the experimental group.  A two-sided 5% level result will be regarded as significant.

 Page 33 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 18.1. Data Integrity Monitoring: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators will be in direct day-to-day contact (specifics below) throughout the study intervention and with any of the following that arise.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or co-investigator will have direct notifications any time a transplantation surgery is planned and will confirm that study intervention has been ordered correctly in medical chart on day of PI[INVESTIGATOR_7035].  Surgery, anesthesia, ICU, and safety monitoring teams will be notified prior to interventions when a patient is confirmed as a study participant.  Medical staff will be instructed to page PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or co-investigators as well as research coordinator in case of any intervention side effect for further direction.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators are the most appropriate direct monitors, as both have full understanding of research protocol, and are also frequently in PI[INVESTIGATOR_872899].  In cases where the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigators are not present, deferral will be made to the medical team, which is already adept and required to be following lab results and ensuring nurse orders are carried out.  A co-investigator will also otherwise make routine daily lab surveillance for added layer of monitoring.  This level of monitoring appears appropriate as once the intervention is ordered in our EMS, nurses carry out the order throughout duration of study.  There is no blinding required in this study as all participants will be intended to receive intervention, so there appears no opportunity for bias introduced by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigators while caring for these patients.  As patients complete their ICU and conclude their involvement in study, chart reviewer will be notified to update data into REDCap.  This will be further overseen by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators.  All data collected through chart review will be collected with a standardized data collection form to ensure uniformity.  Specific safety measures to prevent protocol non-compliance include the following: study team will have a brief after enrollment of each patient and prior to infusion initiation to review pertinent protocol elements, which will be debriefed to medical team (both in email and in person); a study team member will check-in with medical team and bedside nursing team twice per day to ensure compliance and answer any questions; a study team member will check in at major checkpoints (specifically at dosing change and at discontinuation); there will be a request for nursing to be calling study team at medication discontinuation for added layer of safety; a study member will be available for contact [CONTACT_872940]; only study team members are able to direct order changes in epic pertaining to MgSO4 dose or frequency of level checks, resident physicians specifically are not to change these orders (medical team attending or fellow physicians may change dosing per protocol if level > 3.5 mg/dL); study team will additionally contact [CONTACT_872941] (specifically lab trends, infusion dosing, appropriateness of timing, and active problem list to ensure no adverse events secondary to MgSO4). In regards to OR

 Page 34 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 safety, a study staff member will be specifically in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872900]. This staff member will go to the OR every 2 hours at the time magnesium levels are drawn to provide a helpful reminder of blood draw requirement, ask if there are any questions regarding the study drug, and help address any new concerns. Data regarding magnesium levels (and all labs) as well as intra-operative vitals (such as heart rate and blood pressures) and medication deliveries/changes are auto-populated into the patient’s electronic medical record in real-time. We do not anticipate that the anesthesia team should have to report any additional data for the study team to help guide dosing magnesium dosing adjustments. The study team member will follow up the result of this level. If there is a needed dosing change based on the level, that study team member will return to the OR to provide a helpful reminder to change the dose (in the case this has not yet been done). If the anesthesia provider is too busy to draw a level or change the dose, which is not anticipated, study team will seek out an available anesthesiologist (i.e. on call provider) to come pause the infusion until able to further discuss. If a study staff member is not forecast to be available for day of procedure, that patient will be excluded from consent. If a study staff member becomes unavailable on day of procedure, that patient will be removed from the study. A data integrity monitor (external to the direct research team) will be involved throughout this project. The study monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements. The monitor will provide ongoing monitoring of data validity and regulatory issues (e.g. eligibility determinations, consent form process, SAE reporting, IRB actions, disclosures of conflict of interest). Study records will be monitored at regular intervals by [CONTACT_11200]. The monitor will perform source data verification and as such must be given access to the participant’s primary source documentation, such as paper or electronic medical records, consent to participate in the study, visit dates, demographic information, medical history, physical examination, vital signs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_284944], AEs, concomitant medications, drug accountability (etc.), that support data entries in the REDCap database. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_872901]. Findings will be noted and followed up in the subsequent monitoring visit. The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_150997].

 Page 35 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 18.2. Data Safety Monitoring:  The following safety data will be collected starting at the baseline visit through the end of study visit to establish any change from baseline parameters, and for monitoring adverse events:  • Confirm that participant met inclusion/exclusion criteria • Confirm that delivered magnesium dose is appropriate with intended protocol dosing (i.e. 50 mg/kg bolus, 15 mg/kg/hr infusion) • hypotensive events: including value and interventions needed (pressors, fluid bolus, etc) • respi[INVESTIGATOR_375521]: specifically if needing to increase to higher level of support (nasal cannula to high flow, high flow to positive pressure, etc), interventions required for respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], relation to sedation • arrhythmia: include type, EKG results (if done), interventions required • hypocalcemia: specifically if ionized calcium < 4 (or age-appropriate norm), interventions required • hyperkalemia: include value (if higher than normal range), interventions required • hyperphosphatemia: include value (if higher than normal range), interventions required • hypermagnesemia: include if > 3.5, confirm that dose was decreased per protocol guideline • for all of above, comment on whether side effects deemed secondary to magnesium Safety data will be captured in the CRFs for each visit. Any AEs and SAEs will also be recorded in the REDCap database. Any safety event meeting the IRB’s urgent reporting criteria will be reported to the IRB within its published timelines, and similarly to the FDA as outlined at conclusion of this section.  A pediatric ICU physician external to the research team will serve as the safety monitor for this protocol.  The safety monitor will not be enrolling any research participants or caring for patients as part of this protocol.  The safety monitor is qualified to review the patient safety data generated by [CONTACT_872942]/his expertise in pediatric intensive care.   After the first [ADDRESS_1219255], as well as any other unforeseen events which are deemed potentially secondary to magnesium.  As long as meeting safety

If a SAE, Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to participants or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) or other event causing risk to the research participants occurs, the clinical research team will notify safety monitor immediately.  Safety monitor will assure the study is conducted in accordance with the investigator’s agreement, the investigational plan, the IND and other applicable FDA regulations, and conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_115482].  Research will be suspended immediately if any life-threatening events occur due to magnesium.  An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_872902] a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771].   The Annual Report will be sent to the safety monitor and will be forwarded to the IRB and FDA. The IRB and other applicable recipi[INVESTIGATOR_94706].  Below outlines definitions and specifics regarding relevant events:  Safety and Adverse Events A.  Definitions Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events, whether or not considered intervention-related.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: • results in study withdrawal • is associated with a serious adverse event • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.  VERSION DATE: 06/09/2022 
 Page 37 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests • is considered by [CONTACT_872943]: Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities —— Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. — — Severe: Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. Of note, we do not intend to report mild side effects which are known to frequently occur in TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872903].  For example, we will not report individual epi[INVESTIGATOR_86021]/emesis, post-operative pain, ventilator adjustments (unless an escalation to new mode of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]), non-sustained hypertension/hypotension on routine vital checks, anticipated returns to OR (for example to close abdomen after initial surgery).  Similarly, known/predicted intraoperative fluctuations in coagulopathy, bleeding, and vitals trends will not routinely be reported, unless not responding to expected interventions per OR team.  All of the above will be reported if medical team experts (i.e. surgeon or anesthesiologist in OR, intensivist in PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) believe these above symptoms are contributing to an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_872904] a worsening in patient’s expected trajectory. Relationship to Study Intervention All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_872944]/his clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. Probably related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. —— Possibly Related: There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. —— Not Related: The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].   Serious Adverse Event 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.  VERSION DATE: 06/09/2022 
 Page 38 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event based on appropriate medical judgment or that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes listed in this definition  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events.  Adverse Event Reporting Period The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_1219257] administration of study treatment or until discharge from the ICU (whichever occurs first). Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  Post-study Adverse Event All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403490] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.

 Page 39 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844]. B.  Recording of Adverse Events At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document (i.e. within 24 hours of event notification), and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately. C.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 1. IRB Notification by [CONTACT_403519] (including follow-up information) must be submitted to the IRB within 5 working days if it falls under the UPI[INVESTIGATOR_17235].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_17236]’s binder. 2. FDA Notification by [CONTACT_872945]-threatening experience associated with the use of the drug as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the sponsor’s original receipt of the information. If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a written report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the time the determination is made.

Protecting Privacy:  Patients will be given opportunity in initial consent process as to whether there are any members of medical or research team they wish to interact or not interact with, desires which will be maintained.  The only members which should have direct contact, however, will include the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators (if on medical staff).  Autonomy will be emphasized to all members of research team, including transplant surgeon (co-investigator) or PACCT physician performing initial consent, with respect for any patient who wishes not to enroll in our intervention.  This will be emphasized to medical team involved in PI[INVESTIGATOR_872905].  We do not otherwise anticipate any privacy concerns as our intervention is not dependent on any other underlying attributes other than the transplantation procedure itself.  HIPAA compliance measures are otherwise routine at the institution where study is taking place.  Comorbidities and transplant indication will not be identified in either control or experimental group, which should further limit potential of identifying information in final written product. 19.2. Access to Participants: The research team will need access to medical chart in order to collect data regarding the primary and secondary outcomes, as this is the 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) PROTOCOL TITLE: Magnesium sulfate as adjuvant analgesia and its effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_872847]-operative transplant patients in the pediatric ICU.  VERSION DATE: 06/09/2022 
 Page 41 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/[ADDRESS_1219259] data is stored/located.  We will only search chart in specific areas that our outcome measures are located, and will avoid all other unnecessary information.  Some of the data elements need more diligent, subjective searches than what can be consistently and reliably obtained by [CONTACT_872946] (which were discussed during development process).  Specifically, the EMR will be accessed for appropriate patient by [CONTACT_256720], followed by [CONTACT_872924], followed by [CONTACT_872947] (i.e. Intake/Output or results review -> magnesium level, etc).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators, however, will have more frequent and expanded access to chart in circumstances where they are the medical provider taking care of patient for the day (unrelated to research itself), since that person may be directly involved in patient care.  All of the patients are otherwise within the co-investigator’s (transplant surgeon) and PI’s (PI[INVESTIGATOR_872906]) practice area. 20. Compensation for Research-Related Injury 20.1. Compensation for Research-Related Injury: In the event that research-related activities result in an injury, treatment will be provided to the participant (e.g., first aid, emergency treatment, and follow-up care as needed). Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary manner to the participant or the participant’s insurance company. 20.2. Contract Language: n/a 21. Consent Process 21.1. Consent Process (when consent will be obtained): Experimental Group: consent will be obtained, before any research procedure occurs, in the initial meeting between the transplant surgeon (co-investigator) or PACCT physician and parents (with or without patient) when discussions regarding their procedure are had.  This is done in a private setting, though dependent on situation (i.e. surgeon office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872907], etc).  Parents will be given opportunity to address questions per usual routine, and will use standard 'teach back' technique to elicit understanding from parents.  Written consent will be obtained and stored in patient chart.  If a liver transplant candidate develops more acutely, consent will be attempted while inpatient prior to any procedure initiation.  Any patient contact, including if pre-admission consent is performed, will include adherence to COVID precautions per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]. When receiving consent/assent over the phone, study staff will hand a copy of the consent, HIPAA and assent if applicable through a small door on the side of the patient’s room. There will be another study coordinator on the phone via conference call to witness/attest to the consent process. Study staff will create a consent narrative not to file for each enrolled patient to

 Page 42 of 49 Template Revised On: 09/01/2019 document the consent process in detail which will be signed by [CONTACT_872948].  Control Group: we intend for a waiver of consent for data review of control group given both that treatment was at an academic institution and information will be de-identified. 21.2. Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (when consent will not be obtained):  There will be no waiver or alteration of consent process for the experimental group.  We intend for a waiver of consent for the retrospective control group.  The control group of this research is not FDA-regulated as patients were given standard of care treatment. No investigational drug was given to these participants. The research does not involve non-viable neonates. The research does not involve newborn dried blood spots. The research could not practicably be carried out without a waiver. For the control group, the research involves no more than Minimal Risk to the participants. The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. 21.3. Waiver of Written/Signed Documentation of Consent (when written/signed consent will not be obtained): n/a 21.4. Non-English Speaking Participants: non-english participants are likely over the course of the study.  Participants who do not speak English may be enrolled.  Consent short forms will be used for those participants who will not be able to understand the consent form written in English.  The short form will be used in conjunction with an oral presentation of the consent information by a translator.  We will make use of in-person interpreters through the UMN's extensive interpreter service for any participants whom English is not preferred language.  An impartial witness who is fluent in both English and the language spoken by [CONTACT_2299]/representative will be present during the entire consent discussion to attest to the adequacy of the consent process and to the participant’s voluntary consent.  The interpreter may serve as a witness. 21.5. Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults (infants, children, teenagers under 18 years of age):  all patients will be consented or assented (if age 8-17 years) in accordance with HRP-013 and Minnesota state regulations.  We anticipate all of our patients to be under 18 years old and therefore children.  In the rare event that children are emancipated, we will consider legal council if unclear.

Recruitment may occur at a private UMN setting during the initial consent for transplantation if this occurs outpatient (i.e. for TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872909]).  This will primarily occur in the transplant physician (co-investigator) office or TPI[INVESTIGATOR_872873]’s office, as outlined in consent sections.  For inpatient settings required in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], consent will preferentially occur in a family conference room. 22.2. International Research: n/a 23. Multi-Site Research: n/a 24. Coordinating Center Research: n/a  25. Resources Available 25.1. Resources Available: PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigator have multiple other research colleagues available for assistance if needed.  As stated above, it is difficult to predict how many potential participants we will have since transplant is a dynamic field year-to-year, but based on previous years we predict ~10-20 patient per year.  The co-investigator (PI[INVESTIGATOR_872910]) is allotted multiple blocks each year to research, so most of this time will be devoted to conducting and completing our project, including following up on chart review progress, additional external grant applications, manuscript writing.  Multiple other members will also be assisting with various tasks, including a research coordinator who will help with database creation (OnCore and REDCap) and ongoing study monitoring.  Data integrity and safety monitoring members are available through UMN services.  Biostatistician will be hired through grant funding for data analysis.  We anticipate that the combination of these contributors will be enough resource for the project.  The UMN Masonic PI[INVESTIGATOR_872911] a 24-bed unit with capability for all current standard-of-care modalities needed in critical care.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a fellow office where able to review research data privately.  Patients have access to various therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (PT/OT/ST, music therapy) for their

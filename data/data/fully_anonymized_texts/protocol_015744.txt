Abstract  
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_552825],  especially 
with in the adolescent student athletic environment, a group particularly at risk and presenting 
their own challenges for science and practice.  Effective interventions to are needed for these 
young people to help them avoid prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] .  
 
The Student Athlete Wellness Portal  model s effective opi[INVESTIGATOR_552826] .  It was adapted from the evidence -based keepin’ it REAL curriculum that is 
recommended for schools in the Surgeon General’s 2016 report on addiction.  
 
The process of translating research about opi[INVESTIGATOR_552827]-based 
intervention  began with formative research  among  35 student athletes, ages 1 4 to 21, who had 
all been injured in their school -based sport and who received a pain management plan from 
their doctor . They  participated in in -depth qualitative interviews to explore narratives relating 
to their injuries; their pain management plans; and the ways in which they used, misused, or 
avoided prescription med ication. An inductive analysis of interview transcripts revealed themes 
of the (a) the challenges of being a student athlete ; (b) s ports, drugs, and you ; and (c) w ays to 
stay healthy .  
 
These themes were then translated into prevention messages for the Student Athlete Wellness 
Portal intervention , including a series of video docudramas portraying resistance process . A 
single -group  feasibility test was conducted that provided evidence of its usability, engagement 
and preliminary outcomes.  
 
Introduction  
To date, there are no evidence -based interventions addressing prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_552828]. The proposed intervention, adapted from an evidence -based substance use prevention 
intervention, will be the first to effectively address thi s problem among at -risk high school athletes.  
Background and Rationale  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_552829]. This includes 
athletes who misuse their own prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (i.e., use them recreationally or for other non -
prescribed purposes) as well as those divert prescription  opi[INVESTIGATOR_552830]. It is 
estimated that 2% of youth athletes use heroin, although this, too, varies by [CONTACT_539716]. Unfortunately, little 
has been done to address the needs of this at -risk population. This paper addresses these issues.  
Accordin g to a recent national study, the incidence of non -medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_552831] -athletes.  National statistics document the prevalence of the problem among athletes, with 
some sports (i.e., ice hockey) particularly impacted. Other r esearch shows the incidence of nonmedical 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_552832]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], however, is complex: some 
studies suggest that rates for athletes merely mirror those for the general adolescent student 
population, which stil l puts them at risk, some suggest an increased risk for male athletes but not female 
athletes, and others suggest greater likelihood of use among those participating in only some sports. 
Overall, it is estimated that as many as 14% of athletes misuse presc ription opi[INVESTIGATOR_552833], including the heightened perceived need to compete 
and arguably a high pain tolerance.  
Other reports have highlighted the problem of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_289026] (e.g., sharing or selling their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_552834]) among student athletes, and schools across the country have begun partnering with 
law enforcement for Natio nal Prescription Drug Take Back Day  events, to help students understand the 
risks of unused medications and prevent old medications from diversion. These trends have 
underscored the importance of prevention interventions tailored to meet the needs of youn g athletes 
and keep them safe.  
Objective  
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the Student Athlete Wellness Portal (SAWP). 
SAWP is a digital intervention that targets  
1) prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_552835]  
2) prescript ion opi[INVESTIGATOR_552836].  
Study Design  
 
Five high school were recruited. Student athletes from the five high schools were recruited through the 
athletic departments as well as through online advertisements. Parental consent and youth assent was 
obtained for youth [ADDRESS_726664]. Participants receive incentives of $50.  
Usability and Engagement scores were from the posttest only and compared to neutral using a one -
sample t -test. Efficacy and Willingness posttest scores were compared to pretest schools. Efficacy 
analysis was conducted using a paired t -test while Willingness comparison used a Chi Square test.

data were collected during a single session, we fixed a somewhat conservative response rate such as 
72%. U   g      ’  f  m     f      m     ff   ,  ur power analysis suggests that the required sample is 
[ADDRESS_726670] program effects. We calculated nominal sample size based on the 
expectation of 72% attrition to require an initial sample of 139 (i.e., 139 athletes x 7 2% respons e rate  = = 
100 athletes at posttes t). Using these estimates, the  proposed study power was good.   
Planned Analyses  
Missing data was not a problem because the program required responses to every item. We planned 
listwise deletion if missing data emerged; no ne did.  
To examine findings for usability , engagement, and perceptions of opi[INVESTIGATOR_552842], we planned on using one sample t -test.  For self -efficacy and willingness to misuse, 
measured on pretest and posttest, we planned on using a  paired t -test.

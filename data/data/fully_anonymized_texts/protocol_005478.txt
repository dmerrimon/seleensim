Study Title:  
A Randomized, Open -Label, Parallel -Group Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing 
Regimens of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution in Patients with Corneal Edema Due to Fuchs Corneal 
Dystrophy  
Study Number:  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] -CS210  
Study Phase:  
2 
Primary  Objective:  
To evaluate the reduction in central corneal thickness (CCT) in eyes dosed with either Netarsudil Ophthalmic 
Solution 0.02% (netarsudil) once -daily (QD) or netarsudil twice -daily (BID) for the treatment of corneal 
edema due to Fuchs corneal dys trophy (FCD).  
Secondary Objectives:  
(1) To evaluate the proportion of subjects demonstrating improvement in vision following treatment for FCD
with netarsudil QD or netarsudil BID.
(2) To evaluate the safety of netarsudil QD and netarsudil  BID in subjects with FCD.
Study Design:  
This is an 8 -week, randomized, open -label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study in subjects with FCD. 
The study will be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_003]. Two different dosing regimens (QD and 
BID) of netarsudil will be studied (randomized 1:1) to evaluate their efficacy in reducing or resolving corneal 
edema in subjects with FCD. Subjects randomi zed to the netarsudil QD dosing regimen will be instructed to 
instill one drop of the Study Artificial Tear in the study eye every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in the 
study eye every evening. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of 
netarsudil in the study eye every morning and evening.  
CCT will be measured by [CONTACT_885781] ±  60 minutes and 
always before noon (local time), at each of the 5 scheduled visits (Screeni ng, Baseline [Day 1], Week  2, 
Week  4, and Week  8/Exit). In order to be eligible to participate in the study, subjects will have been 
diagnosed with visually significant central corneal edema due to FCD, in at least one eye at Screening and 
Baseline, for no  longer than 12 months’ duration.  
For analysis purposes, the study eye will be defined as the eligible eye with a Baseline CCT of at least 
[ADDRESS_1239239] and enrollment criteria, the study eye will be the eye with the thinner cornea at the Baseline Visit.   
Study Population:  
Approximately forty (40) subjects will be enrolled  
Key Inclusion Criteria:  
•Adults aged 18 years or older
•Documented diagnosis of FCD

    • Evidence of central corneal edema, in at least one eye, at the Screening and Baseline Visit. The study 
eligible eye(s) should have a CCT of at least 600 μm at both the Screening and Baseline Visit  
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  using the  Early Treatm ent of Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS ) methodology of 70 to 20 letters  at Screening and Baseline in the eligible eye(s)  
 
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
• FCD so advanced that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], surgery would likely be required in the study 
eligible eye(s) within the study period  
• Clinically significant ocular disease (other than FCD) or trauma in the eligible eye(s) which could 
interfere with study interpretation  
• History of ocular surgery within 6 months of the Screening Visit, or any prior c orneal refractive surgery 
in the eligible eye(s)  
Study Medication , Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Once Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Study Artificial Tear; one drop, in the study eye in the morning  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in  the study eye in the evening  
Twice Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in the study eye in the morning and in the evening  
Duration of Treatment:  
Eight (8) Weeks  
Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by [CONTACT_885782] 4  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 4  
• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by [CONTACT_885782] 8  
• Mean change from ba seline in BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 8     
Safety Assessments:  
The safety of netarsudil QD and BID will be evaluated at each visit by:  
• Adverse events  
• BCVA  
• Anterior segment biomicroscopy  
• Ophthalmoscopy  
• Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure)  
• Intraocular pressure

Statistical Methods:  
Continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). Categorical study 
assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (a s applicable) using frequency counts and 
percentages.  
Hypothesis:  
H01: The mean change from baseline CCT by [CONTACT_885783] 4 = 0.  
H11: The mean change from baseline CCT by [CONTACT_885784] 4 ≠ 0. 
H02: The mean change from baseline CCT by [CONTACT_885785] 4 = 0.  
H12: The mean change from baseline CCT by [CONTACT_885786] d with netarsudil 
BID at Week 4 ≠ 0. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary comparisons in this trial will be within a treatment group on the mean change from baseline 
CCT to Week  [ADDRESS_1239240] will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed 
primarily using one -sample t -tests; comparisons between treatment groups will be completed using two -
sample t -tests. Sensitivity analyses w ill be completed using Wilcoxon signed -rank tests within a treatment 
group, Wilcoxon rank sum tests between treatment groups and an ANCOVA model with terms for baseline 
CCT value and treatment. The least squares mean will be presented for each treatment gr oup from the model 
together with two -sided p -values and 90% and 95% confidence intervals around the change from baseline 
within each treatment group.  Comparisons between treatment groups on the change from baseline CCT will 
also be made including the leas t squares mean difference and corresponding two -sided p -values and 90% and 
95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use the modified Intent to Treat (mITT), population with available data per subject. 
Robustness analyses will also be presented b ased on the multiple imputation methodology under different 
assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), 
and using the per protocol population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the following manner:  
• Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored [treatment policy 
strategy].  
• Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed as the wo rst 
within subject observation prior to the intercurrent event [hypothetical strategy].  
• Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse 
events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation ( MI) using randomized treatment -
based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to impute non -monotone missing data and 
regression methodology to impute monotone missing data [hypothetical strategy].

Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized at the subject level by [CONTACT_885787], tre atment related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature 
discontinuation by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose 
of study medication. Similar summaries will be presented for all TEAEs by [CONTACT_2074]. Separate 
summaries will be performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs. Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, 
anterior segment biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, ophthalmoscopy, and vital signs will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_885788]. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be 
summarized where appropriate. For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow eye will be 
summarized separately.

    1. INTRODUCTION  
Fuchs Corneal Dystrophy (FCD) is a slowly progressing disease of the cornea that is the 
most common indication for corneal -endothelial transplants worldwide ( Gain 2016 ). 
FCD  is characterized by [CONTACT_885789], which are collagenous 
excrescences of Descemet’s membrane ( McL aren 2014 ). As FCD progresses, 
corneal -endothelial cell degeneration compromises the ability of the cornea to pump out 
excess fluid resulting in corneal edema and clouding ( Okumura 2018 ). Patients with FDC 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_885754], blurry vision, and a  hazy cornea. Decreased visual acuity may be 
more pronounced in the morning due to increased corneal hydration that occurs from closed 
eyelids overnight. In later stages of the disease, edema may reach the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_885755] ( Moshirfar 2020 ).  
Currently, the only definitive treatment option for FCD is surgery, and endothelial 
keratoplasty using donor corneas is the gold standard. A newer surgical procedure, called 
Descemet Strippi[INVESTIGATOR_885756] (DSO) or Descemetor hexis Without Endothelial Keratoplasty 
(DWEK), is available for select patients and does not require donor corneal tissue. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_885757], there are still many risks associated with 
these procedures including infection, cataract formation, secondary ocular hypertension 
(OHT) from long term steroid use, graft rejection, and treatment failure requiring a second 
surgery ( Moshirfar 2020 ). Therefore, there is a large unmet medical need for pharmacologic 
alternatives  to surgery for treating FCD ( Koizumi 2014 ).  
Netarsudil is a novel Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that was approved for marketing as 
Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% by [CONTACT_861404] [ADDRESS_1239250] potential benefit for the treatment of corneal endothelial decompensation. Although the 
mechanisms are sti ll being elucidated, preclinical evidence is emerging that ROCK inhibition 
can promote adhesion, enhance proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis of corneal -endothelial 
cells ( Okumura 2009, Okumura 2017 ). Findings from a clinical case series suggest that 
topic al administration of the ROCK inhibitor Y -[ZIP_CODE] after performing transcorneal freezing 
can improve central corneal edema in patients with FCD ( Okumura 2013 ). In one patient, 
full corneal transparency was achieved for more than 6  years, and original plans f or corneal 
transplantation were cancelled ( Koizumi 2013, Okumura 2018 ). An additional two case 
reports of patients with FCD have described improvements in corneal edema and corneal 
endothelial cell counts with the use of netarsudil following DSO ( Ploysanga m 2019, 
Hirabayashi 2020 ). Several clinical trials are now ongoing to investigate ROCK inhibition in 
both pre -surgical ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and post -surgical ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) FCD patients.  
Overall, net arsudil is well tolerated, and the most common adverse event is conjunctival 
hyperemia. Several case reports of honeycomb or reticular edema have been observed in 
patients taking netarsudil, both with and without pre -existing corneal edema or a history of

    FCD ( Fernandez 2018, Liu 2019, Moumneh 2020, Wisely 2020 ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], reticular or 
honeycomb edema resolves after discontinuation of netarsudil.  
The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of netarsudil as a pharmacologic 
agent to delay or prevent the need for surgery in patients with visually significant edema due 
to FCD.  
2. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective(s)  
To evaluate the reduction in central corneal thickness (CCT) in eyes dosed with either 
netarsudil once -daily (QD), or netarsudil t wice -daily (BID) for the treatment of corneal 
edema due to Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) . 
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
(1) To evaluate the proportion of subjects demonstrating improvement in vision following 
treatment for FCD with netarsudil QD or netarsudil BID . 
(2) To evaluate the safety of netarsudil QD and netarsudil BID in subjects with FCD.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is an 8 -week, randomized, open -label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study in subjects 
with FCD. The study will  be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_003]. Two different 
dosing regimens (QD and BID) of netarsudil  will be investigated for their efficacy in 
reducing or resolving corneal edema in subjects with FCD. Subjects randomized to the 
netarsudil QD dosin g regimen will be instructed to instill one drop of the Study Artificial 
Tear in their study eye every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in their study eye every 
evening. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of 
netarsudil in their study eye every morning and evening.  
CCT will be measured by [CONTACT_885781] 
± 60 minutes and always before noon (local time), at each of the 5 scheduled visits 
(Screening , Baseline [Day  1], Week  2, Week  4, and Week  8/Exit). In order to be eligible to 
participate in the study, subjects will have been diagnosed with visually significant central 
corneal edema due to FCD, in at least one eye, for no longer than 12 months’ durati on.  
At the Screening Visit, the subject’s diagnosis of FCD will be confirmed and CCT measured 
using an ultrasonic pachymeter. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) will also be collected.

Confidential  Page 18 of 55  
    At the Baseline Visit (Day  1), the eli gibility assessments conducted during Screening will be 
repeated to ensure that the subject meets all criteria for enrollment in the study. The same eye 
must qualify at both the Screening and Baseline Visit. If qualified, the subject will be 
provided with the Visual Function and Corneal Health Status (V -FUCHS) patient reported 
visual disability questionnaire ( Wacker 2018 ). The subject will be randomized (1:1) into the 
study and provided with study medication. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil QD dosing 
regimen will be instructed to instill one drop of the Study Artificial Tear in the study eye 
every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in the study eye every evening. Subjects 
randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of netarsu dil in the 
study eye every morning and evening. The subject will also be trained on appropriate 
techniques for applying eye drops.  
At the Week [ADDRESS_1239251] and enrollment criteria, the study eye will be the 
eye with the thinner cornea at the Baselin e Visit.   
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
Current treatment options for FCD include hyperosmotic saline ophthalmic drops/ointments 
and surgical procedures. Hyperosmotic saline can provide temporary symptomatic relief by 
[CONTACT_885790] d ehydration. Endothelial keratoplasty using donor corneas is currently the 
gold standard therapeutic option to restore vision in patients with FCD. Although 
improvement of surgical techniques has enabled less invasive treatment and better outcomes, 
corneal transplants require long -term steroid use and are still associated with difficult 
surgical techniques, graft rejection, acute/chronic cell loss, and worldwide donor cornea 
shortages ( Okumura 2017 ). A relatively new non -transplant surgical procedure known a s 
Descemet Strippi[INVESTIGATOR_885756] (DSO) or Descemetorhexis Without Endothelial Keratoplasty 
(DWEK) is also now available for a minority of FCD patients.  
A pharmacologic alternative to surgery in patients with FCD would be very beneficial, 
even  if pharmacologic tre atment only delays the need for surgery.

medication. AE information may be volunteered by [CONTACT_885798] -leading questions.  
All AEs occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective electronic case report form (eCRF). Adverse events should 
be documented from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the subject’s last 
study visit. If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the 
administration of study medication), it should be recorded as an AE. A ny medical condition 
present prior to administration of the study medication which remains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits.  
If a subject has an ongoing AE at the time of study completion, the ongoing AE must be 
followed -up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, act ion(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome.  
Investigators are also asked to note all observations of new or worsening conjunctival 
hyperemia on the biomicroscopy eCRF as well as on the study AE form  if deemed necessary 
(per Investigator discretion) .

    The followi ng definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event (AE). Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR). Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable 
possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug  
and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR. An AE or SAR is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the v iew of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected  adverse reaction (SSAR). An AE or 
SAR is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885767], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events inclu de allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR. An AE or SAR is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is 
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the Package Insert, or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpe cted (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only 
cerebral vascula r accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or 
SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occur ring with the particular drug under investigation.

    6.9.3 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_1560]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
1 = Mild: present a nd noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily  activity.  
A change in increased severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous 
severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity 
may go from mild to severe or from moderate to severe. In b oth cases, the start and stop dates 
should be recorded.  
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.6  for further 
information on serious AEs [SAEs]).  
6.9.4 Relationship  
The study medication relationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_60265]:  
• Not R elated : The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the 
subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product.  
• Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_219819]’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or 
the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relations hip. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by 
[CONTACT_7860].  
• Possibly Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response patte rn to the study 
medication, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from th e time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1239277]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to  the subject, and 
either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive 
reaction at the application site.  
6.9.5 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected a dverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are  mentioned 
in the IB as occurring with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of netarsudil, and are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study 
medication. The AEs and adverse reactions that are both unexpecte d and serious should be 
reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor (see Section 6.9.6  for further details).  
6.9.6 Serious Adverse Events, Suspected Serious Adverse Re actions or Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting SAEs, SSARs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report any SAE, SSAR or S[LOCATION_003]R 
to the Sponsor using the SAE report form, whether or not considered medication -related, 
including those listed in the IB, and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the medication caused the event. In addition, in the case of 
immediately life -threatening AEs or AEs with fatal outcome, or S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the Investigator 
must inform the Sponsor by [CONTACT_1382] [ADDRESS_1239278] be reported to the IRB/IEC according to the IRB/IEC

While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, pregnancy reports are tracked 
by [CONTACT_885801]. Premature terminations including miscarriage, 
spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an SAE. Other pregnancy complications should be reported as SAEs, if they meet 
serious criteria. Should a pregnancy result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, a separate

9.1 General Considerations  
Continuous study assessments will be summariz ed by [CONTACT_12268] 
(as applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum). Categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] 
(as applicable) using frequency counts and perc entages. Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise 
indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.10 significance level. Where applicable, 2 -sided 
90% and 95% CIs will be reported. All p -values will be displayed to four decimal places, 
with p -values less than 0.00 01 presented as '<0.0001' and p -values greater than 0.9999 
presented as ‘>0.9999’. Difference between netarsudil QD and netarsudil BID will be 
calculated as netarsudil QD – netarsudil BID.

imputation methodology under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events 
(at random and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and using the 
per protocol population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the follo wing manner:  
1. Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored, values 
measured after discontinuation of study medication or regardless of compliance will be 
used in the analyses [treatment policy strategy].  
2. Withdrawal due to l ack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed 
as the worst within subject observation prior to the intercurrent event [hypothetical 
strategy].  
3. Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy  
or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) 
using randomized treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to 
impute non -monotone missing data and regression methodology to impute monotone 
missing data  [hypothetical strategy].  
9.1.3 Multiplicity Considerations  
Adjustments for multiplicity will not be made in this early phase trial.

9.4.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
The mITT population will in clude all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
dose of study medication. This population will be the primary population for efficacy 
analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables and will summarize 
subjects as randomiz ed. 
9.4.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population is a subset of the mITT population, which will include those subjects 
(and their visits) who do not have major protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the 
primary outcome of the study. This population will be the secondary population for efficacy 
analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables. If the  PP and mITT 
populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will 
not be performed. The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1239294] disposition will be presented in terms of the numbers and percentages of  subjects 
who completed the study and discontinued from the study. Disposition will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_183180].

The primary efficacy endpoint change from baseline CCT will be summarized descriptively 
(n, mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed primarily using one -
sample t -tests; compariso ns between treatment groups will be completed using two -sample 
t-tests. Sensitivity analyses will be completed using Wilcoxon signed -rank tests within a 
treatment group, Wilcoxon rank sum tests between treatment groups and an ANCOVA 
model with terms for ba seline CCT value, treatment. The least squares mean will be 
presented for each treatment group from the model together with two -sided p -values and 90 
and 95% confidence intervals around the change from baseline within each treatment group. 
Comparisons betw een treatment groups on the change from baseline CCT will also be made 
including the least squares mean difference and corresponding two -sided p -values and 90 and 
95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use the mITT population with available da ta per subject. 
Robustness analyses will also be presented based on the multiple imputation methodology 
under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events (at random and not at 
random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and usi ng the per protocol 
population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the following manner:  
1. Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored, values 
measured after discontinuation of st udy medication or regardless of compliance will be 
used in the analyses [treatment policy strategy].  
2. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed 
as the worst within subject observation prior to the intercurrent  event [hypothetical 
strategy].  
3. Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy 
or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) 
using randomized treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to 
impute non -monotone missing data and regression methodology to impute monotone 
missing data  [hypothetical strategy].

Weeks 4 and 8 (separately) will be completed using logistic regression with fixed effects of 
treatment and corresponding baseline measure.  
The adjusted odds ratios and marginal proportions and difference in proportions along with 
corresponding two -sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p -values will be presented.   
Treatment comparisons will also be made using Pearson’s chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact 
test if any of the cell counts are less than five as a sensitivity analysis.  
The primary analyses of the secondary endpoints will use the mITT population with available 
data per subject. Robustness analyses may also be presented based on the multiple imputation 
methodology under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events (at random 
and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and using the per 
protocol population with available data per subject.

9.8.6 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed in a similar manner as the secondary endpoints.  
9.8.7 Primary Safety Assessments and Analyses  
Adver se events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and 
percentages of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized at the 
subject level by [CONTACT_885807], treatment related 
TEAEs, ser ious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature treatment discontinuation by 
[CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of 
study medication. Similar summaries will be presented for all TEAEs by [CONTACT_2074]. 
Separ ate summaries will be performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs.  
Best corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure data for both the study eye and the 
fellow eye will be summarized for each measured visit and for change from baseline to each 
post-treatm ent visit using the continuous summary statistics.  
Anterior segment biomicroscopy  and ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each 
measured visit using discrete summary statistics. Additionally for anterior segment 
biomicroscopy, discrete summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_11338], finding, visit, time point, and 
eye (study eye and fel low eye) for the number of subjects with at least one severity grade 
increase from baseline and for the number of subjects judged to be clinically significant by 
[CONTACT_737]. Shift tables from baseline may also be summarized.  
Vital signs will be summa rized at each measured visit and for change from baseline to each 
measured visit using continuous summary statistics by [CONTACT_6982].

The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that no subject is subject to any study -related 
examination or activity before that subject has given informed consent. The subject must give 
written consent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanatio n will cover all 
the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or 
continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, metho ds, anticipated benefits and 
potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be 
given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask 
for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject may be given time to reflect if 
this is required, or if the subject requests more time. Subjects and/or legal guardian will be 
required to sign and date the informed consent form.  
Signed informed consent must be attained prior to the  conductance of any study procedures.

Interactive response technology (IRT) activities will be performed as described in the IRT 
User Manual.  
10.[ADDRESS_1239304] source documentation. 
The location and nature of the source documentation for all data collected in the study will be 
identified in the study files at the Investigator’s site. In cases where no sou rce documents will 
be used (i.e., data will be recorded directly into the eCRF without first being recorded on 
another document, such as a flowsheet, laboratory report, or other typi[INVESTIGATOR_885769]), the origi nal data will be included in the eCRF.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by 
[CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the 
corrected data. The person who has made t he correction should place his or her initials as 
well as the date of the correction next to the correction. Data may not be obliterated by 
[CONTACT_63049], redaction, or with correction fluid.  
Study data will be transcribed and recorded via an electronic data cap ture (EDC) system as 
eCRFs. Security and authorization procedures consistent with the EDC system must be used. 
At each subject visit, the appropriate eCRFs must be completed. Whenever an eCRF is used, 
be sure to provide all information requested including subject identification number and 
initials, name [CONTACT_219841], date(s), etc. All applicable questions should be 
answered, and all data requested should be provided. Those areas that require a response but 
are not filled in correctly are consid ered incomplete or erroneous entries and will have to be 
corrected.  
Each authorized study staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the 
EDC system. Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will 
make ent ries and/or changes to eCRFs via a secure internet access. Each completed set of 
eCRFs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_885809].  
The study recor ds must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license, and 
statement of Investigator qualifications. The name [CONTACT_885823] -Investigator working under 
the supervision of the Investigator is also required to be filed in the study records.

10.9 Protocol Deviations  
Per ICH E6 (GCP) R2 Section 4.5.1 the Investigator/institution should conduct the trial in 
compliance with the protocol agreed with the sponsor and, if required, by [CONTACT_885810]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_219792]/IEC.  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not 
allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory  
acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the 
protocol is essential.  
The site will contact [CONTACT_885811]/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject.  The Sponsor will document clarification 
requests and responses or their representative. If a subject does not meet all the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria during screening, that subject may not be enrolled into the study.  
If a protocol deviation is ident ified by [CONTACT_885812]/IEC may be required e.g., 24 or 48 hours (as per IRB 
guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these 
non-complian ces should be reported to the relevant competent authority as a serious breach 
of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant competent authorities’ requirements, the protocol 
deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still required to be n otified to the 
IRB/IEC, the specific protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress report.  
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the 
database lock.  
10.10  Access to Source Documentation  
The Investigator will  permit study -related monitoring visits, audits, IRB/IEC review, 
and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_60282].

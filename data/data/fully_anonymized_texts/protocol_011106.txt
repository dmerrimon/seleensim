Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 [ADDRESS_348689]     
 
Persons with serious mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, die on average [ADDRESS_348690] 15 
million Americans, has a high burden of modifiable CVD risk factors including smoking, obesity, hypertension, 
diabetes, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  The Ameri can Heart Association (AHA) recently set ambitious strategic Impact 
Goals to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans and reduce deaths from CVD by [ADDRESS_348691] the hypothesis that an 
18-month comprehensive, practical CVD risk reduction program will be superior to control in improving CV  
health in persons with SMI.  W e will partner with Mosaic Community Services, Inc., a large mental health care 
organization, and enroll a target of 250 persons with SMI who attend 4 psychiatric rehabilitation day programs 
(PRPs) or adjoining mental health clinics.  Rehabilitation programs provide opportune  setting s to implement 
CVD risk reduction program s because patients attend several days a week and environmental components 
can take place on -site.  We will provide a common background of  exercise classes and healthy changes to 
meals served.  Participants will then be randomized to receive this control condition or the 18-month active 
IDEAL intervention with a Heart Health Interventionist, who will provide  on-site: 1) individual CVD risk reduction 
behaviora l counseling (e.g., for smoking cessation, diet); 2) coordination with primary care providers to ensure 
appropriate management of risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control ); and 3)  collaboration with mental health 
staff and social supports to encourage and motivate participants to reach goals.  The primary outcome will be 
the change in estimated CVD risk from the global Framingham Risk Score; secondary outcomes will include 
AHA metric s for CV health.  Accomplishing meaningful reductions in CVD throughout the population will require 
targeted interventions focusing on vulnerable, high -risk groups such as those with SMI. If successful, this trial 
will provide persuasive evidence for use of  a practical, comprehensive CVD risk reduction strategy in SMI to 
reduce health disparities.  
 
2. SPECIFIC AIMS  
     Accomplishing meaningful reductions in CVD throughout the  US population will require implementation of 
targeted interventions that focus on vulnerable, high -risk groups such as those with serious mental illness. In 
this context, we propose the following Specific Aims:  
Primary Aim:  
1. Test the hypothesis that the acti ve IDEAL intervention is more effective than the control condition in 
reducing CVD risk using the global Framingham Risk Score (FRS).  
Secondary Aims:  
2. Determine the effect of the active intervention compared to control on AHA metrics for ideal CV health 
risk behaviors and health risk factors:  
a. Weight and BMI;  
b. Physical fitness with [ADDRESS_348692];  
c. Healthy diet measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report;  
d. Smoking cessation with biochemical validation ; 
e. Fasting plasma glucose levels and diabetes mellitus treated to goal (HgBA1c ); 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 5 f. Blood pressure levels and hypertension treated to goal;  
g. Lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL -C, triglycerides) and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_285811];  
3.   Determine the effects of the active intervention on other outcomes: health status (SF -12); quali ty of 
life (Euroqol); medication use for CVD risk factors; and medication adherence.  
 4.   Assess costs per participant and perform a cost effectiveness analysis.  
        Exploratory Aims:  
        5.   Conduct analyses to identify potential mediator variables (e.g., intervention participation,  
         medication use for CVD risk factors and adherence) ; 
        6.   Assess organizational factors that could facilitate the most effective future disseminat ion. 
  
The primary outcome variable will be reduction in CVD risk with global FRS from randomization to 18 months.  
Six-month FRS and 6 and 18 -month changes in health risks comprise secondary outcomes.  
 
 
3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Public Health Burden  of Cardiovascular Disease in Persons with Serious Mental Illness  
 Persons with SMI, over 5 percent of the population or 15 million Americans, comprise a high -risk group for 
CVD -related mortality with rates approximately twice those of the overall US.1-5  SMI frequently produces 
challenges in everyday functioning due to cognitive impairment and ongoing psychiatric symptoms;6 
accordingly, populations with SMI are often characterized by [CONTACT_285844], low -income and social  isolation.7  The AHA Strategic Plan (co -authored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Appel) defines 7 goals for ideal CV health for all Americans including ideal health behaviors (BMI <25 kg/m2, 
physical activity at goal levels, healthy diet, nonsmoking) and ideal health factors (fasting blood glucose 
<100mg/dl, untreated blood pressure <120/<80mmHg, untreated total cholesterol <200mg/dl).8  Persons with 
SMI experience increased prevalence of unhealthy levels of these CVD risk factors, summarize d below.  
 
Overweight and obesity  are at epi[INVESTIGATOR_285812], particularly in women, where 60% are obese.9-[ADDRESS_348693] majority of SMI require ≥1 long -term psychotropic 
medication, yet many psychotropic classes cause weight gain, in part from increased appetite.13-17 In particular, 
2nd generation antipsychotics lead to substantial weight increases; in the case of ola nzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], up to 0.9 kg/mo .18 
 
Physical inactivity is prevalent in SMI; [CONTACT_49173] reported persons with SMI report 50% higher leisure time 
inactivity than the general population.19  An accelerometry study showed only 4% of persons with SMI in a 
psychiatric rehabilitation program (PRP) met r ecommended moderate to vigorous physical activity in bouts of 
≥10 minutes.20  Lack of affordable, safe places to exercise, and ne gative affective states such as depression 
may be  important barriers .   
 
Unhealthy diet  is reported in persons with SMI with some studies reporting higher fa t and lower fruit an d 
vegetable intake and others show higher overall caloric intake .21-23 Persons with SMI are also likely to depend 
on others for meals; preliminary baseline data from [CONTACT_285881] t’s study show 40% of participants relying on 
others to buy or prepare food when they eat at home.  
 
Tobacco smoking  is extremely prevalent in SMI, with 70 to 80% reporting lifetime and half to more than two -
thirds reporting current smoking.22,24-26 Smokers with SMI report using more and high er tar cigarettes and 
consuming more nicotine compared with other US smokers .27,28 Smoking may be reinforced in SMI by 
[CONTACT_285845], enhanced cognitive functioning 
from nicotine, socioeconomic factors and relative lack of other pleasurable pursuits.26,29 
 
 
Diabetes mellitus  is estimated ≥ 1.5 -2 times higher in SMI than the overall population.30-35 Multiple factors  
converge to increase risk of diabetes, and related emerging risks of glucose intolerance/insulin resistance and 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 [ADDRESS_348694] on weight gain and adiposity.18,30,36-40   
 
Hypertension  prevalence is 50% higher in persons with SMI than those without.24  Obesity, physical inactivity,  
and alcohol use are likely contributing factors to elevated blood pressure.34,41-44 
 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] s are also prevalent in SMI; in parti cular, certain antipsychotics lead to elevated triglycerides and  
low HDL.18,34,45-49  With glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_285813], metabolic syndrome prevalence is correspondingly 1.5 to 2 times higher in SMI as well.34,50 
 
Interventions to Reduce CVD Risk in Persons with SMI  
 
In order to accomplish meaningful reductions in CVD risk, targeted interventions will be required for 
populations with SMI, who urgently need to adopt healthy behaviors and decrease health risk factors.51  
Lifestyle interventions require tailoring for many with SMI,  where cogn itive deficits as well as other competing 
demands (e.g., psychiatric symptoms, economic stresses) are highly prevalent.  Although few studies have 
been conducted in PRPs, these facilities are well suited for implementing comprehensive CVD risk reduction 
interventions as infrastructure facilitates collaboration with staff for patients with SMI.  
Interventions to Improve Health Risk Behaviors:  
Weight loss and physical activity lifestyle interventions including those addressing multiple health behaviors are 
effective in the general population, yet these trials systematically exclude persons with SMI who have pressing 
need. Several studies  of behavioral weight loss interventions  in SMI have shown success; most focus on diet 
changes alone and are short -term.52-[ADDRESS_348695]. Dickerson, recommend smoking cessation  
treatment, specifically a psychosocial intervention and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] +/ - nicotine replacement ther apy (NRT).61  
These treatments produce evidence of smoking reduction and up to 33% abstinence .62-[ADDRESS_348696]  not been 
tested in persons with SMI.  
 
Interventions to Improve Health Risk Factors:    
In the general population, there is substantial evidence that non -physician interventionists (e.g., care 
managers) facilitating treatment and coordination with PCPs can improve single and multiple CVD risk 
factors.86-[ADDRESS_348697] targeted SMI. In SMI, a small literature  describes 
interventions in mental health clinics to improve primary care delivery including co -locating primary care (e.g., 
with nurse practitioner) or a care management model facilitating preventive screening and referral to primary 
care.95-[ADDRESS_348698] not been specifically designed or 
staffed (i.e., with skilled interventionist) to effect changes in multiple CVD risk behaviors and factors. More 
recent evaluations of the behavioral health home incorporating primary care coordination into the specialty 
mental health care setting and other integrated care programs have shown mixed results with no or minimal 
effects on CVD risk factors.  97,99-104 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 7 Summar y of significance : Persons with SMI are at extremely high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Unless 
effective interventions are developed and tested, this population will continue to lag far behind the nation in 
CVD goals, and disparities will likely persist if not worsen.  If the CVD risk reduction goal that the trial aims to 
attain could be applied widely to the millions with SMI in the US, tens of thousand of lives could be saved  each 
year.3,105-107  Psychiatric rehabilitation programs ( PRPs ) provide an available, yet untapped structure for 
multifactor CVD risk reduction interventions in SMI.  
 
4. DESIGN SUMMARY  
 
 The IDEAL Trial is a community organization -based, two -arm clinical trial that will test the hypothesis 
that an 18 -month comprehensive, practical CVD risk reduction program will be superior to control in improving 
CV health in persons with SMI.  W e will en roll a target of 250 persons with SMI who attend 4 psychiatric 
rehabilitation day programs or adjoining mental health clinics.   We will promote a common background of  
exercise classes and healthy changes to meals served.  Participants will be randomized to  receive this control 
condition or the 18-month active IDEAL intervention with a health coach and nurse, who will provide  on-site: 1) 
tailored  CVD risk reduction education and counseling (e.g., for smoking cessation, diet); 2) collaboration  with 
physicians  to advocate for appropriate management of risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control ); and 3)  
coordination  with mental health staff and social supports to encourage and motivate participants to reach 
individually tailored CV health goals.

 [ADDRESS_348699] few exclusion criteria.  
 
 
 
Participant eligibility is determined by [CONTACT_285846] n of several screening measures .  Screening visits  will occur 
on-site at rehabilitation centers  and outpatient clinics . Study instruments are administered in -person by [CONTACT_285847].  
 
 
6. RECRUITMENT   
 
Recruitment and retenti on strategies are  facilitated because patients  come  on-site to the psychiatric 
rehabilitation programs or near by [CONTACT_285848] .  
 
For participant recruitment for the trial at psychiatric rehabilitation programs, we will recruit in several ways 
including announcements to mental health consumers (i.e. , patients); posters; brochures and  working with 
rehabilitation  staff. We will make announcements during regular consumer meetings at the sites. We will also 
post posters and have flyers and brochures available in the rehabilitation c enter. We will work with 
rehabilitation staff to identify potential participants by [CONTACT_285849] . 
Rehabilitation counselors may mention the trial to their consumers. Interested individuals will be directed to 
contact [CONTACT_285850]. Study staff will be at the 
rehabilitation sites to discuss the study with any interested consumers.  The study will be a behavioral health Table 1 : Eligibility Criteria

 9 organization -wide program offered to all consumer s who may be eligible. Recruitment activities will be parallel 
to/ similar at the outpatient clinics as in the psychiatric rehabilitation programs, except there are no mental 
health consumer meetings.   
 
Participant retention  is a very  high priority. We will use strategies successful in the teams’ prior studies. In 
addition to maintaining strong participant rapport, we collect and review contact [CONTACT_285851] /friends ’ contacts  who can facilitate comm unication if needed. We also will have access to 
information through the PRP and clinic . We will make home visits to collect data on those  who move out of the 
area.  
 
 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MEASUREMENTS  
 
We will collect follow -up measures at 6, 12 , and 18 months after baseline with in -person contacts at the study 
sites. (Table 2). The [ADDRESS_348700] data.  Table 3 summarizes the data collection schedule.  
 
Detailed measures are described below.  
Demographics and Medical History:  We will collect demographic and contact [CONTACT_3031], medical history with 
a short checklist of conditions, Rose Angina Questionnaire, and assess alcohol or substance use using the 
ASI-Lite.108,109 
Mental health diagnoses and  medications  will be abstracted from PRP (or mental health clinic) charts. 
Participants and providers will confirm medications.  
Physical measures.  
Blood pressure  will be determined by [CONTACT_285852] 907 XL, a validated device which records BP  using an 
oscillometric technique.110  Blood pressure  will be obtained by [CONTACT_23872] , certified dat a collectors.  At each data 
collection time point that blood pressure is obtained (3 baseline visits and 1 randomization visit for pre -
enrollment time point, 3 visits for follow -up at 6 and 18 months respectively), measurements for blood pressure 
occur 1we ek apart, and 3  measurements (each separated by 30 seconds) will be obtained on the right arm of 
participants after they rest quietly in the seated position for at least [ADDRESS_348701] 0.1 lb by a high quality digital scale with participants wearing light 
indoor clothes without shoes.  Duplicate measurements  will be made.  Weight will be measured in lbs . for ease 
of interpretation by [CONTACT_285853] d to kg for ca lculation of BMI, calculated as the Quetelet index 
(kg/m2).   
Height  to the nearest 0.1 cm will be measur ed at entry using a wall-mounted  stadiometer.  The participant 
stands shoeless on a firm, level surface, with head in the horizontal  (Frankfort)  plane.   
Waist  circumference  will be  measure d with an anthropometric  tape, in a horizontal plane [ADDRESS_348702] m easurement is needed.115  Serum CRP and insulin, kidney 
function (creatinine)) will also be mea sured.116-[ADDRESS_348703] found an association between antibodies to 
infectious agents and clinical outcomes in serious mental illness.  Blood from part of the collected spec imens 
will be frozen at -70° at Johns Hopkins for future investigation of putative risk factors related to cardiovascular 
disease.  Candidate assays include inflammatory markers, leptin and adiponectin. We also will store samples 
of whole blood at base line for DNA for later studies. As this study will collect detailed information on 
medication, blood pressure, BMI, tobacco smoking and traditional laboratory markers of cardiovascular risk 
pre/post intervention, future analyses of stored serum samples wil l be able to be interpreted in the valuable 
context of these other risk factors. Approximately seven teaspoons of blood total will be collected at each study 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 10 time point with one teaspoon stored for future investigation and ½ teaspoon stored for future DNA testing (DNA 
storage at baseline only). We plan to store blood samples indefinitely.  
   Potential participants have specific choices on the consent form to decline or agree to have their 
blood stored and to DNA testing.  The serum samples will be identifie d with a code that does not include any 
identifying participant information and will be stored in a secure Johns Hopkins facility . There are currently no 
plans to re -contact [CONTACT_285854], and we will not release the results 
of future tests from serum samples to individual subjects.   We believe these procedures described above 
constitute minimal risk for the participants.  Study samples may be shared with other researchers partnering 
with the study team for future research. If we do share any study samples with outside investigators not directly 
addressing the research questions in this protocol, an amendment/change in resea rch or a new protocol would 
be submitted to the IRB.  
 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_285814] ( Covita ) will be collected and will confirm smoking 
status (see below).119  Urinary cotinine will be substituted for CO if the validity of CO is expected to be low 
(e.g., COPD or difficulty formin g an adequate seal on the smokerlyzer) and if the participant is not using 
nicotine replacement therapy.120,121 
 
Urine will also be  collected for Na, K, creatinine and protein.  
 
Questionnaires  will be used for a variety of purposes including baseline data to describe participants, 
outcomes to assess intervention effects, and mediating variables to assess potential causal pathways. The 
study team has experience with these and similar instruments  for persons with SMI.70  Instruments are 
described here:  
Healthy diet . Block Fat, Fruit, Vegetable and Fiber  and Sodium  Screener  Questionnaires provide self -report of 
daily fruit, vegetable intake,  and percent energy from fat .[ADDRESS_348704] of Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ), a [ADDRESS_348705] 7 days confirmed by [CONTACT_81958] <[ADDRESS_348706] -effectiveness analyses.127-129  
Medication adherence  will be measured with an adapted questionnaire based on the  Morisky Medication 
Adherence Scale for each class of medications for  CVD risk factors (e.g., antihypertensives, lipid lowering 
medications).130   
Mental health symptoms  will be assessed by [CONTACT_285855][INVESTIGATOR_285815]  (CES -D) 
to measure depressive sy mptoms131,132 and the Behavior and Sympto m Identification Scale (BASIS -24), a brief 
comprehensive mental status measure for overall mental health status.133-135 
Social Support  will be measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Questionnaire136,137 
Other health measures  related to CVD risk relevant in SMI population . We will use the Neighborhood 
Questionnaire  to assess participants’ home environments for safe places to exercise and places to purchase 
healthy food, a questionnaire on food and shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_285816], the  Questionnaire for Eating and Weight Patterns -
Revised to measure Binge Eating, and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206525] Q uality Index.138-140 We will assess health literacy 
with the Health Literacy Skills Ins trument.  
 
 
Participant s emi-structured interviews  (approximately 15 -20 minutes) will be conducted at the end of the 18 -
month intervention to gain an understanding of participant  perceptions of and satisfaction with the heart health 
program and  exercise classes. Interviews will be conducted with a convenience sample of participants across 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 11 the study locations. Interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed. Transcripts will not contain names and 
will be kept in a secure location . Audiotapes wi ll be destroyed after transcription is completed.  
 
 
Table 2 : Data Collection 
Schedule  Baseline  [ADDRESS_348707].  This will include consent documents and medical release forms with appropriate text and 
a surveillance process that is applied identically to each randomized group.  
Food envi ronment:  We will analyze a random sample of menus at baseline, 6 and 18 mos. and use ESHA 
software to assess changes in total calories/nutrients in site meals as a result of dietary consultation .141  
 
Staff semi -structured interviews for o rganizational factors:  To better understand the intervention 
implementation process and perspectives of intervention staff, non -intervention staff and leadership at Mosaic  
concerning the sustainability and future acceptability for dissemination of IDEAL, we will conduct semi -
structured in terviews.  We will ask about the intervention’s perceived effectiveness, ease of or barriers, fit 
within the organization and financial models for continued support. We will interview before the intervention for 
baseline information and then at end of the 18-month intervention  to assess changes  due to the intervention . 
We will gain an understanding of factors that impact the intervention being acceptable and workable, and 
prepare for dissemination to other organizations. We expect to conduct interviews with  [ADDRESS_348708] e, or a total of 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 [ADDRESS_348709] emerging data issues with sufficient time to implement appropriate corrective 
actions.  Our approach to Quality Assurance includes: 1)  preparing a manual of operations; 2) implementing a 
master trainer model to train and certify other staff; 3) train and certify all data collectors; 4) recertify data 
collectors at least annually; 5) routinely calibrate equipment; 6) maintain logs of cert ified staff and calibrated 
equipment.  Our approach to Quality Control includes: 1) monitoring counts of completed data collection items; 
2) monitoring distribution of trial outcomes, overall, by [CONTACT_62143]; 3) record lag time in data entry; 
4) issue queries on missing data, out of range values or illogical data relations; 4) review types and distribution 
of data entry errors; and 5) prepare reports for staff, investigators and DSMB on Quality Control .  Investigators 
will review CVD risk factor  data to determine study endpoints and adjudicate as needed in a masked fashion.   
 
 
9. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 
     Randomization to the IDEAL intervention or control will be stratified by [CONTACT_285856]. Within each 
stratum, blocked randomization assignments are computer generated by [CONTACT_285857], where the block size is randomly generated to be either a size of 2 or 4. A data table 
containing these generated  assignments is loaded into the trial’s REDCap database for web -based delivery to 
randomize eligible participants after confirmation of eligibility and informed consent. This REDCap 
randomization assignment table is accessible only to the statistician and the data manager.  Prior to obtaining 
the assignment, the study coordinator will confirm the participant meets all eligibility criteria and all required 
baseline data have been collected. Then the coordinator  logs into REDCap  to receive  the group assignment  for 
the specific participant and communicates the treatment  assignment to the participant.  Due to the nature of the 
intervention, participants and interventionists will be aware of group assignment, however, data collection staff 
will be kept blinded  Due to the nature of the intervention, both participants and interventionists will be aware of 
the assignment.  Until the trial end, investigators, other staff and participants are masked to outcome data, with 
the exception of trial statistician, stu dy coordinator, data manager and data analyst .  We will take considerable 
efforts to ensure data collection staff will be kept blinded to assignment (e.g.,  exclude them from all parts of 
intervention delivery , remind  participants not to share group assignment , designate/track unmasked staff).   
 
10. INTERVENTION  
  
Intervention:  
Common Background : To establish environments conducive to healthy behaviors and standardized across 
sites, the study will provide training for group physical activity classes open to all participants, and a dietician to 
consult to improve the health of meals served.  We train PRP staff to deliver g roup exercise classes using a 
DVD we provide, and recommend classes are held three times per week. Classes focus on aerobic condition 
and fo llow a progression appropriate for sedentary adults , gradually building to [ADDRESS_348710] used this successfully in 
SMI.70,143,144  In order to support active intervention participants’ ability to select healthy foods, a study dietician 
will work with  PRP staff to identify healthier menu choices , so that food served is more consistent with AHA 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 13 Healthy Steps. The dietician will be sensitive to budgetary issues and federal food guidelines. This common 
background will make available a needed foundation fo r physical activity and healthy diet choices to occur. 
However, these offerings are very unlikely to be sufficient alone for significant behavior change.  
Randomized groups:  
   Control condition : The control group will receive this common background.  
   Active intervention:  The active group will receive this common background and the IDEAL intervention.  
    Figure 1 displays our active IDEAL intervention framework. PRP staff, social supports, ment al health 
providers (e.g., psychiatrists) and PCPs already have relationships with individual patients.  For a participant 
randomized to the IDEAL intervention, the intervention staff (health coach and nurse) work directly with the 
participant on health ri sk behaviors and catalyze support from others, serving as a bridge between these 
individuals and the participant in moving toward ideal health risk behaviors and factors, resulting in improved 
CV health and quality of life.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IDEAL Intervention goals  include heart healthy behaviors ( weight loss, phys ical activity, diet , smoking 
cessation)  and heart healthy factors (blood sugar, BP, cholesterol) (Table 3 ).  We use AHA goals and modify 
some (e.g.,10 lb. weight loss instead of BMI<25) to provide intermediate targets achievable with the study 
sample over 18 -months.8  Strategies combine individual counseling and goal -setting, consulting  with the 
physician to optimize CV risk factor  treatment, and working with PRP staff, social supports and mental health 
providers.  
Health coaches  coordinate resources and work with participants to develop tailored strategies to achieve the 
heart healthy goals.  Coaches will be physically located on -site at Mosaic. Embedding health coaches at 
community sites will enable optimal  coordination of heart  healthy planning with other PRP staff and allow 
coaches the opportunity, in addition to scheduled sessions, to take advantage of everyday occurrences to 
reinforce healthy choices and behavior change (e.g., encouraging participant to go to exercise class, checking 
in and giving positive reinforcement for reporting decreased cigarette use, healthy vending machine choice or 
improved medication adherence, rewarding  a participant for self -monitoring at a weigh -in). Coaches will be 
skilled facilitators with trai ning in health behavior change and individual -level counseling, with a skill level 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a community health educator, and will not require a Master’s degree.[ADDRESS_348711] ongoing, regular interaction with the Intervention Director and 
the nurse. The health coach is modeled after a position that would be feasible and sustainable in a community 
mental he alth setting, with back -up nurse support.

 14 A study nurse will be a Registered Nurse or equivalent with responsibility to support health coaches  by [CONTACT_285858]. The nurse regularly will review participants’ progress on heart healt h factors  
with the coach . He/she  will collaborat e with PCPs in advocating for participants’ CV health. The nurse will be 
trained in smoking cessation pharmacotherapy principles and will provide NRT and education and monitoring 
to interested and eligible participants using established guidelines (Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 
2008).  
The co ach and nurse report to an intervention director with motivational interviewing and health behavior 
change expertise. The intervention director implem ents quality assurance , and may also provide direct 
services to participants.  
Individual Coaching  Session s (20-30 mins.) will be held at least weekly for up to [ADDRESS_348712] bi-
weekly for 12-15 months with the health coach, based  on participant  need .  The initial sessions will focus on 
building rapport and using motivational interviewing to review c urrent heart healthy risk behaviors and factors, 
medication adherence, and to identify individual goals.  Guided by [CONTACT_285859], the participant’s abilities , 
interests  and readiness to address each risk factor , risks and targeted behaviors will be addres sed either 
simultaneously or sequentially.148 (See Table 1 ). Participants will work with their health coach  to identify 
behavioral changes topi[INVESTIGATOR_285817] a list of recommended sessions  (e.g., healthy weight management, becoming 
smoke free, staying physically active) . The coach  will use solution -focused therapy to encourage attainment of 
individual goals and provide  reinforcements. The nurse provides educational and counseling sessions related 
to specific CVD risk factors tailored to participant needs.  
Primary Care Provider ( PCP) and Psychiatrist Coordination : The nurse  will review the participant’s baseline 
labs, physical measurements and medications and then initiate contact [CONTACT_285860] . The nurse  will 
accompany  the participant on selected  visits to the PCP in the community in order to facilitate a collaborative 
relationship and assist the participant in reaching CV health goals. T he nurse identifies  modifiable components 
of the FRS taking into consideration participants’  preferences for change  and individual abilities . The nurse or 
coach  will follow up with the PCP and psychiatrist as needed to facilitate  coordination of behavioral strategies 
and any pharmacologic treatment and coordinate additional visits as nee ded. Guidelines for DM, HTN, lipid 
control and smoking cessation consistent with AHA, JNCVII, ATP -III and ADA and other prevailing guidelines 
and evidenced -based approaches including those emerging during the conduct of the trial are made available 
to phys icians.30,41,71,84,85,149-158 Intervention staff communicate with participants and providers about tailoring 
goals as needed (e.g., higher HgbA1c target). SMI patients often have communication barriers, may have 
medication adherence issues due in part to lack of medication r econciliation across service settings, and often 
require advocates to make appointments and follow -up on tests. The coach and nurse  will facilitate  this 
coordination for improved CV health.  For participants who smoke and are interested in pharmacotherapy, t he 
nurse will communicate with PCPs or psychiatrists to advocate for  prescription of  varenicline or bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_285818]/or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and may provide NRT. . 
Staff and Social Supports Coordination : The health coach serves  as a change agent, leveraging  PRP staff and 
social supports around the participant’s CV health goals. (Figure 1)  Coaches  when possible attend regular 
PRP staff case management meetings, which include residential staff for participants in supported housing .  
Here the coach updates  staff on participants’ progress with reaching CV health goals .  Having the coach  on-
site enables two -way communication about participant CV health: 1) The coach  encourages staff to promote 
adherence to heart health recommendations (e.g., attending exercise class) and individually identified plans 
(e.g., setting quit date); 2) PRP staff inform coaches  about ongoing issues that could interfere with participant  
progress towards CV health goals (e.g., change in living situation). The coaches also will encourage social 
support and may include family members  or peers in intervention sessions to support the participant for better 
control of risk factors (e.g., tobacco smo king). Through all of these pathways, the health coach and nurse 
coordinate a team -based approach to improve participants’ CV health.  
Mental Health Provider Coordination:   Participants have therapi[INVESTIGATOR_285819]; for the most part they will be in the adjoining mental health clinics. For 
uncontrolled risk factors, the health coach or nurse may work with mental health providers to strategize on how 
to improve CV health (e.g., adherence to d iet and medication for diabetes). Psychotropic prescribing  practices 
are not specific intervention targets, however, the psychiatrist may decide to modify medications based on the 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 15 participant’s CVD risks.  The health coach and nurse will facilitate communi cation between the psychiatrist and 
PCP as needed.  
Program materials:  Individual visit manuals  are developed to guide coaches  in conducting sessions . Options 
tools, cards with pi[INVESTIGATOR_285820]’s risk factors, are u sed to identify 
conversation topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. These tools give the participant the autonomy to choose specific behaviors to discuss, 
while also allowing the coach to provide direction for the session.  
Self-monitoring:  Participants will be encouraged to self -monitor eating, exercise and smoking behaviors  
as appropriate to their individually tailored behavioral goals and cognitive abilities. Simple paper trackers are 
made available for this purpose. . 
Reinforcements : We p lan a points system to reinforce behavior change. Points are awarded for  
recommended behaviors (e.g., decreased cigarette smoking, group exercise) and can be traded for cheaper 
items (e.g., pen, key chain) or saved for larger rewards (e.g., CD player).  Re wards are used to reinforce 
healthy habits that forgo immediate gratification (e.g., eating candy now) for larger, delayed gratification 
(e.g.,weight maintenance).  
Quality assurance : We will ensure high -quality intervention delivery  through training, case  management 
meetings and fidelity measurement. Coaches receive initial training on CVD risk behaviors and risk factors, 
and all intervention staff are trained in behavior change theories, working with persons with SMI, motivational 
interviewing and impleme nting the intervention according to the manual of procedures. Follow -up training 
occurs quarterly. Case management intervention meetings with the study team are used to review each 
participant’s CVD risk factors and current treatment plan and help facilita te behavior change and/or appropriate 
monitoring or treatment. The meetings ensure that all participants are reviewed regularly, and those with 
uncontrolled risk factors are prioritized. The intervention director facilitates meetings for the intervention t eam, 
and as needed, investigators with expertise in CVD risk reduction strategies participate. To ensure high fidelity, 
health coach and nurse sessions are either observed in person or audio recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_285861]. Fidelity reviews occur at least quarterly.  
Process measures:  For active intervention participants, we will track intervention  session completion, exercise 
class participation, and interim  progress towards goals (e.g., weight, pedometer cou nts, expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559]) for 
participant feedback, case management and analysis of potential mediators.  
 
NRT:  Nicotine patches and nicotine lozenges are FDA approved and available as over the counter 
pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation. F or interested participants in the active intervention arm who are 
smokers and would like to quit or reduce their smoking, we will provide and supervise the use of nicotine 
patches and nicotine lozenges as nicotine replacement therapy for them. Nicotine pat ches are dosed every 24 
hours; nicotine lozenges (2 and 4mg doses) are used as needed initially every 1 -2 hours and then tapering 
down to every 4 -8 hours over several weeks.  Nicotine patch initial dosing is based on the level of smoking at 
baseline, with 21mg generally used for those smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day; 44mg may be used for 
those smoking 2 packs per day. Patches and lozenges may be used in combination.

 [ADDRESS_348714] inconsistencies. Outliers (e.g., extreme 
weight changes) will be identified using Rosner’s extreme Studentized  deviate  (ESD).160 Every effort will be 
made to determine correctness of outl iers in a timely manner . Confirmed outliers will be flagged and set as ide 
in the principal secondary analyse s. Those removed will be treated as all other missing data ; sensitivity 
analyses will be conducted to assess influence of outliers on results. T he data manager will create detailed 
variable  documentation and the data analyst will conduct analysis  per protocol  under direction of the study  
statistician.   
 
 
 
12.  DATA ANALYSIS  
Our target is to enroll t wo-hundred and fifty  participants recruited from 4 sites in 1 health organization , 
randomized in equal allocation to active intervention (Group A) and  control (Group B), stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  Formal 
assessments are at baseline, 6, and 18 months. Primary anal yses will be conducted under the  intention to treat 
principle.161   
Core analytical model : Let Y ijk denote the log -transformed FRS for the ith participant at the jth visit (j = 0, 1,  
or 2), corresponding to the baseline, 6, and 18 -month visits), in the kth treatment group (k = 0 or 1 
corresponding to intervention groups A and B). X ik is a vector of pre -randomization covariates (which will  
include study site indicators). The longitudinal regression model for the primary  analysis is: E[Y ijk ] = X ik +  + 
j + k + jk + e ijk with the constraints that each of ( j , k ,jk ) equals [ADDRESS_348715] value.  
The e ijk are independent unless the (i, k) subscripts are the same.  For participant (i,k) the e ijk have an 
unstructured 3 3 covariance matrix.  The  measure the influence of baseline covariates, the j give visit 
effects  within Group A, k baseline treatment effects (which under effective randomization should be close to 0) 
and the jk are the treatment by  [CONTACT_285862], “the treatment effects.” The primary testing contrast is to 
compare baseline to 18 -month changes in FRS (the primary outcome) between intervention groups, i.e. testing 
the hypothesis that 21 = 0. Data at [ADDRESS_348716] randomization variables. This core model is also applicable to other secondary continuous 
outcomes such  as weight, blood pressure and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and other CVD risk scores, in their original scale or log -
transformed as appropriate.  Modeling will be implemented via SAS PROC Mixed (or the Stata or R -
equivalents ). Site effects will be included to account for possible within -site clustering.  
Missing and incomplete data:  Prevention is far superior to statistical treatments; every effort will be made to 
collect outcome data on all randomized.  The underlying missing d ata process determines the biasing effects 
of missing data and structures valid analytic strategies.162 The primary analysis above treats all missing 
primary outcomes as resulting from a MAR process, through which the probability of missing can depend on all 
observed information (Observed FRS, covariates) but does not depend on any FRS scores that are not 
recorded. If the probability of a potential observation being missing depends on what has, but not on what 
hasn’t been observed, ter med missing at random (MAR), then estimates based on an appropriate analytic 
model (both the mean and error structure) for the observed data will not be biased. A valid model for the 
observed data allows the missing data process to be ignored. If the missi ng is informative, meaning that the 
probability of an observation being missing depends on th e value of that observation, then bias cannot be 
avoided by [CONTACT_285863], and the im pact of such bias would be evaluated using sensitivity 
analysis.  Data set aside (censored) due to protocol defined high-leverage events such as pregnanc y or a 
serious medical event (e.g., liver failure ) that may strongly influence components of the FRS  will be treated as 
missing at random.  
 
Secondary Analyses  
Analysis of  secondary outcomes :  We will repli cate the foregoing analyses for measured outcomes (BP  [raw 
scale], lipid levels and Hg bA1c levels [log scale].  For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., HTN control, lipid control, 
diabetes control, smoking cessation) GEE based logistic regression modeling will be conducted using SAS 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 19 Proc Genmod (or the Stata or R -equivalents) with a logistic link and a within -individual, unstructured correlation 
structure. We will use data for all participants to compare changes in outcomes over time between intervention 
arms. For certain dichotomous outcomes we will include only “at risk” participants (e.g., smoking cessation in 
smokers). Medication use for CVD risk factors and psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_285823] s.163-165  
Sensitivity Analyses: We will conduct sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation with respect to departures 
from the MAR assumption. The model will be derived from our primary analytical model under MAR, 
maintaining the covariance structure and modifying the imputation mean according to informative missing data 
scenarios. Second, to evaluate potential impact of out of window FRS scores on the robustness of findings 
from the primary analysis, we will set aside all the out of window measurements and repeat the analyses 
following the core analytic modeling approach described previously. When the number of out of window FRS 
scores is high, w e will modify the core analytic model with more flexible mean (e.g. use the actual follow -up 
time as a continuous variable rather than a categorical variable with prespecified follow -up time window) and 
covariance (e.g., heterogeneous TOEP or heterogeneous  AR) structure to accommodate the more variable 
intervals for follow -up times between [ADDRESS_348717], we will 
conduc t analyses restricting the study sample to those in age range to 30 -79, which corresponds to the 
suggested age range of the FRS.  
 
Exploratory Analyses : We will perform several types of exploratory analyses related to other outcomes of 
interest, and potential moderators or mediators.  We will explore the effects of the IDEAL intervention using 
other potential outcomes of interest. For example, we will investigate the AHA/ACC ASCVD risk score which 
became available during the trial. We will systematical ly evaluate the efficacy of the IDEAL intervention in 
study subgroups defined by [CONTACT_25059] (pre -randomization) variables. We are especially interested in baseline 
variables related to psychiatric conditions (psychiatric diagnosis, symptoms, substance use an d psychotropic 
medications). We will also explore the efficacy of the intervention in subgroups by [CONTACT_285864], 
race,gender and medications for CVD risk factors. These analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_285865] (product) terms in the ana lysis models for study outcomes. The trial is not powered for these 
exploratory analyses, and we will be careful in interpreting any findings.  
 
 In addition to  these and for  analyses that preserve the intention to treat principle, we will also perform 
informative exploratory analyses based on subgroups defined post -randomization to characterize aspects of 
the intervention that may be related to improved outcomes in the active group. Such analyses will use post -
randomization variables that are potential med iators - interventionist visit and exercise class participation, 
medication modifications, medication adherence and self -monitoring activities.[ADDRESS_348718] Analysis . The primary analysis will be conducted from  the perspective of an adopting organiz ation or 
payer (e.g., Medicaid) . The main goal is to estimate the incremental implementation costs of the active 
intervention relative to the control. Resource measurement will focus on sampling and tracking intervention 
staff time.  We will sample at specified intervals throughout the intervention at each site for one week at a time. 
Tracking specific tasks will allow us to eliminate time spent strictly on research and perform sensitivity analyses 
with different potential levels of efficiency (e.g., amount of active client involvement v ersus administrative time).  
We will also have data on self -reported utilization of office visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285824]. With estimates of total costs for the active grou p 
and control, we will be able to estimate incremental co sts for the active intervention  and the incremental costs 
per incremental improvement in 1°and 2°outcomes.   To extend the time horizon forward, we will use the global 
FRS to project the proportion in each group expected to have  a CV event within 10 years and the present 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 [ADDRESS_348719] the same number of observations as the main study .168   
 
Qualitative Analysis :  Interviews will be transcribed and coded. NVivo will be used to enter and  
group discrete passages from data into themes. We will use the constant comparative method169 to categorize 
transcript statements that demonstrate common attributes, then combine categories into broader, recurrent 
themes using a hybrid approach  where we will start with larger categories and then  add nodes and subnodes 
as new concepts emerge until saturation of ideas is reached. Findi ngs will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_285825].  
Power analyses :  The trial has sufficient resources to enroll a target of 250 participants.  With this sample 
size, our  objective was to determine the minimum detectable difference (MDD) in relative risk reduction in the 
global Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Our assumptio ns are as follows:  
  Two-sided type I  error=0.05; type II  error=0.20; 90% follow -up. 
  Baseline absolute CVD risk with global FRS =11% from ACHIEVE Trial (n=291, Table 1);  
  Standard deviation of change in global FRS=3% from ongoing ACHIEVE Trial (from [CONTACT_49173]’s 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_285826], similar SD of 2.9%);  
 Global FRS change in controls=5% relative  risk red uction. C ontrols cou ld experience some 
reduction in  CVD risk because of secular trends and offerings of physical activity c lasses on -site.  
However, aging increases CVD risk and might counterbalance these effects.  We conservatively 
assume a 5% relative reduction in the control group , even though their risk might not change or 
might increase over time.  
With these assumptions, our MDD is a 10.7% reduction in relative risk in global FRS.  
 Table 4 demonstrates the relation between baseline and 18 -month follow -up and absolute and relative 
changes in global FRS with the example of a percent risk reduction in the control group of 5% and an MDD of 
10.7% .  The reduction in relative risk ratio of 10.7% (MDD= 1 – RRR) is very similar in magnitude to the direct 
difference in relative risks [95% - 84.8% = 10.2%] at 18 months. If risk is unch anged or rises in the controls, 
our MDD will be lower.

Table 5  displays MDD for ranges  of follow -up rates and relative risk reduction in the control group. The MDD of 
10.7% is very achievable.  IDEAL will combine lifestyle/behavioral modification with improved  clinical 
management of CVD risk factors. In studies of lifestyle interventions, reported relative reductions in CV risk 
scores range from  9-16%,172,178,179  and for care management interventions,  91,174 from 12% -23%.  Table 6  
displays ranges of changes in individual CV risk factors and corresponding estimated changes in global FRS 
from interventions in the literature with components similar to IDEAL. Even with the understanding that 
intervention components will not likely be f ully additive, and that except for smoking cessation, these estimates 
are from studies in the general population and  not SMI , Table 6  provides support for many scenarios where the 
MDD  in FRS of 10.7% would be attainable.  We have precision for estimating cl inically significant intervention 
effects in secondary outcomes.  The 95%confidence interval (CI) for an effect estimate is +/ -1.96* sqrt(2/n)* , 
where n is the sample size per group and  the common SD for change in the measured outcome of interest for 
both groups. Assuming 90% follow -up, the 95% CI for the intervention effect of difference in change between 
groups would be: glucose 7.9 mg/dl; SBP 3.5mmHg, weight 4.0 lbs; total cholesterol 9.0 mg/dl; HDL 2.9mg/dl; 
SF-12 Physical Functioning 7.9. The SDs for  change are derived from the ACHIEVE Trial. For smoking 
cessation, we assume 75 smokers  per group with 1.3% quit rate in the controls (i.e., 1 of 75). We will have 
80% power to detect a quit rate of 14% or higher in the active group using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05.

14. SAFETY  
 
Safety Monitoring  
      
Participant safety will be closely monitored. Protection of research participants begins with the eligibility criteria, 
which are designed to exclude individuals with a serious medical condition that would preclude their ability to 
participate in a cardiovascular risk reduction program.  During the st udy, clinical care will be provided by [CONTACT_32346]’ usual specialty mental health providers and the primary care physician, not by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
 If a participant develops a medical or psychiatric issue, the safety of continuing or resuming the interve ntion 
will be ascertained by [CONTACT_285867]’s regular providers. Surveillance 
for serious adverse events and other relevant clinical event s will occur by [CONTACT_285868]. We may be c ome aware of medical problems including abnormal blood pressure or laboratory tests. 
Results of routine clinical labs and physical measures obtained as a part of data collection will be provided to 
participants and physicians at baseline and after study co mpletion. Measures meeting criteria for alert values 
will be commun icated more quickly .  
 
 
 
 
Potential Risks  
 
The study should not involve any major risk to screenees and trial participants.  Recommended treatments, 
both lifestyle and pharmacologic, are ba sed on prevailing national guidelines.  However, there are some risks.  
Sources of risk include medication -related adverse events, such as hypoglycemic events, side effects from 
medications for CVD risk factors prescribed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician  and side effects from 
nicotine withdrawal or over -the-counter nicotine replacement therapy . For example, improved health behaviors 
from the intervention (e.g., physical activity, weight loss) may lead to hypoglycemia or hypotension in those 
alrea dy taking medications and necessitate adjusting diabetes or blood pressure medications.  In addition, 
physical activity is associated with a small risk of cardiovascular complications (less than 1 per 187,500 
person -hours of exercise).180  Physical activity can also increase the risk of muscu loskeletal discomfort or 
injury.  Blood drawing may cause some discomfort and/or bruising at the site of the venipuncture. The methods 
that participants may use to restrict calories (e.g. extreme calorie restriction or unbalanced dietary pattern) may 
lead to inadequate energy intake or lower than recommended intake of essential nutrients. In addition,

 [ADDRESS_348721] Risks  
 
Informed  consent.   Procedures for recruitment, consent, intervention, data collection and analysis will be 
reviewed and  approved by [CONTACT_285869].  
We will use a two -stage consent procedure: one consent form will be signed upon entry that covers 
screening and baseline data collection for the study. Another will be signed at the time of randomization. The 
cons ent forms will detail the purpose of the study, the requirements for participation, and the potential benefits 
and risks. In consenting individuals to participate in the study, the following procedures will be used: 1) 
Procedures involved in the study will  be fully explained to participants by [CONTACT_285870]. 2) Participants will complete a brief test of 
comprehension of study procedures to demonstrate that they understand the risks  and benefits of study 
participation and clearly consent, before consent is accepted.  Any wrong answers are corrected and additional 
information given to clarify, until a person can easily answer all items successfully or they indicate they do not 
wish to  continue.  3) Those agreeing to participate will sign the consent form.  
 
Protection against risk: General  
The safety approach will be implemented similar to the investigators’ other trials (e.g., POWER Trial). We 
will have a medical safety officer who  will be in charge of developi[INVESTIGATOR_285827], and he will 
promote and monitor safety throughout the study. As in our previous studies, the safety officer does not 
provide direct medical care and is not involved in the intervention. We wil l use standardized materials including 
a manual of procedures and forms. NHLBI has considered materials that we developed in the POWER Trial as 
models which are now used in other NHLBI -supported lifestyle intervention trials.  
 
Hypoglycemia, hypotension or  other potential consequences of improved health behaviors or changes in 
medication:  These  will be minimized by [CONTACT_285871], exer cise participation and 
coordinate assistance for participants in blood sugar monitoring. For example, if an active intervention group 
participant is taking a sulfonylurea and has significantly increased exercise frequency, the intervention team 
will commun icate with the PCP and raise the suggestion of a glucose -lowering agent that would have lower 
risk of hypoglycemia , such as metformin. The interventionist will also ensure appropriate follow -up with the 
PCP after any medication changes.  
Physical activity:  The small risk of physical activity will be minimized by [CONTACT_285872] (as opposed to 
vigorous) activity, and by [CONTACT_285873].  Participants who wish to progress to vigorous activity will 
be advised to obtain approval from their primary care physician.  Risk of injury is further minimized by 
[CONTACT_285874], the importance of warm -up and cool -down exercises , and proper 
stretching techniques.  
Blood drawing:  All phlebotomy is performed by [CONTACT_285875]. Participants will be given 
information on how to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Daumit if complications occur.  
Extreme weight loss methods.  The interventionist and mental health  program staff will be aware of the 
possibility that intervention subjects  could use extreme methods to lose weight. Participants will be reminded 
regularly of the importance of safe weight loss. Those who have a sudden , marked weight reduction will be 
interviewed to determine if extreme measures hav e been taken. The intervention  staff will be trained to detect 
evidence of extreme measures and will be given strategies for responding.  
Nicotine replacement therapy and smok ing cessation. We will educate participants about symptoms of nicotine 
withdrawal and teach copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. NRT including in combination (patches and lozenges) is considered 
safe and risks are far less than those associated with tobacco use, even in smo kers with known cardiovascular 
disease and in those who continue smoking while using NRT.181-188 Certain plasma levels of medications 
including olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_285828].  We will discuss use 
of NRT with participants’ primary care physicians and psychiatrists and monitor symptoms carefully at each 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 24 weekly to bi -weekly intervention visit so that risks are minimized. We w ill communicate with providers regarding 
smoking cessation so that psychotropic medication dosage adjustment may be made if needed.  
 
Breach of confidentiality:  All participant information will be considered confidential. This confidentiality will be 
assure d through several mechanisms.  For the study, each participant will be assigned an anonymous study 
ID, which will be used on all study forms. In addition, all study forms and paper records that contain participant 
information will be kept in secured , locke d areas when not in use.  Such materials, when in use, will be kept 
away from public scrutiny.  Forms that need to be discarded will be destroyed.  Moreover, access to all 
participant data and information will be restricted to authorized personnel. In the case of computerized study 
data, acc ess will be password protected.  When the study database is ready for analysis, it will not contain 
actual identities of participants.  During active data collection, hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_285829] o nly by [CONTACT_4144].   Finally, neither the mental health  program s 
nor participants will be identifi ed by [CONTACT_62166].  Data will not be presented in such a way that 
the identity of individual partici pants can be inferred.  
 
Similarly, for staff semi -structured interviews, all information will be considered confidential. This confidentiality 
will be assured through several mechanisms. T ranscripts will not contain names and will be kept in a secure 
locat ion by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Daumit. Audiotapes will be destroyed after transcription is completed. Individuals  will not be 
identified by [CONTACT_285876]. Mosaic leadership agrees that staff p articipation in the interview  and any 
information shared will not affec t staff employment or evaluation.   
 
Participant reimbursement : At baseline and 6 months, for completing data collection activities, participants will 
receive 15 dollars. At 18 months, for completing data collection activities, participants will receive 25 dol lars. 
This increase in payment as participants’ time in the study progresses is to recognize their commitment to the  
study. Staff will receive a [ADDRESS_348722] for completing a semi -structured interview.  
 
 
Importance of knowledge to be gained : Persons with serious mental illness have high burdens of each major 
cardiovascular risk behavior, yet persons with SMI have been systematically excluded from interventions to 
decrease cardiovascular risk. If successful, this proposed cardiovascular risk reduction  intervention could be 
disseminated widely. The minimal health risks to participants are offset by [CONTACT_285877].  
 
Potential benefits to the study participants who receive  the active  intervention include improved health 
behaviors and improved cardiovascular risk factor profiles. The physical activity classes are available for active 
and control participants. Potential benefits to others include the possibility that t he research will lead to the 
dissemination of effective interventions to decrease CVD risk in persons with serious mental illness.  
There is no specific benefit to staff for participating in interviews. Information learned from their perspectives 
potential ly will help disseminate health interventions in mental health organizations in the future.  
Data  and safety monitoring plan:   Protection of research participants begins with the eligibility criteria, which 
are designed to exclude individuals with a seriou s medical condition that would preclude their ability to 
participate in a cardiovascular risk reduction program.  During the study, clinical care will be provided by [CONTACT_32346]’ usual specialty mental health providers and the primary care physician, not by [CONTACT_1758].  
Participants will be made aware of this delineation of responsibility.  However, recognizing the opportunity for 
early detection of clinical problems and the small risk of study -related morbidity, we will perform periodic  safety 
assessments.  W e will inquire about cardiovascular and musculoskeletal symptoms at [ADDRESS_348723] of a symptom questionnaire and the Rose Angina questionnaire.  Any positive 
responses to these questions will be review ed by [CONTACT_136379];  clinically significant results will lead to 
referral  to the primary care physician.  Information that comes to the attention of study personnel informally 
(e.g., through data collection or intervention activities at the center) ma y also lead to referral. Symptoms that 
will lead to referral include (but are not limited to) those that suggest cardiovascular disease (e.g., exertional 
chest pain, dyspnea, presyncope or syncope), uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes or 
Protocol: Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness (IDEAL)  
 
 [ADDRESS_348724] ications of physical activity.  Participants are also queried at these same timepoints about possible 
adverse events (defined below).  Positive responses trigger an adverse event (AE) record, which is reviewed 
and classi fied as either gastrointestinal, car diovascular, musculoskeletal, or other in nature.  This information is 
then reported to the DSMB.  Similar information reported by [CONTACT_285878] (e.g., during 
intervention classes) is duly noted and followed up with as needed  to assure partic ipant safety. The following 
constitute adverse events (AEs): heart attack, stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure, coronary 
angioplasty or by[CONTACT_4897], angina pectoris, broken bone, torn ligament, and any other serious injury to the 
bone or mu scle.  Evidence of the occurrence of these events is based on participant self -report that a health 
care professional has diagnosed the condition.  We will attempt to verify the diagnosis  through contact [CONTACT_285879].  Though not conside red AEs for this study, we also track and report the incidence of 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], gallb ladder disease, diabetes, cancer and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  All other outcomes that may be 
construed as being an adverse consequence of study participation, such as an injury  while performing a study 
measurement, are documented, reviewed, and followed up on as needed by a study clinician.  
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be  established and will meet at least annually during the study. 
The DSMB members will be research scientists not otherwise connected to the study whose expertise includes 
the disciplines and skills needed to initially review the protocol and then monitor intervention progress, quality 
of the data and safety of the participants.   Members will include ex perts in CVD prevention, mental health and 
clinical trials. Prevailing NIH and IRB policies will dictate the specific roles of this committee, which will review 
the protocol before the start of fieldwork. Adverse events will be reviewed initially by [CONTACT_285880]. 
Daumit and then reported locally to the IRB, the DSMB and the NIH project office according  to prevailing 
policies of these review bodies. This plan should ensure participant safety.

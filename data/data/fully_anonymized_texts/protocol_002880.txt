Clinical phase III
Trial rationale Acute myocardial infarction (MI) affects approximately [ADDRESS_1151592] of all MI patients having either died or developed heart failure (HF) after five years. The observed benefits of empagliflozin on mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15528] (HHF) in patients with T2D and established atherosclerotic CV disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial appeared independent of glucose control and provided a strong rationale to explore the effects of empagliflozin in populations with established HF. However, as these benefits were consistent in both patients with and without HF, a similarly strong rationale exists for exploring efficacy and safety of empagfliflozin in patients without established but at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_829946], frequently represented by [CONTACT_829990]. Further data with empagliflozin from animal studies have given additional support by [CONTACT_829991]-acute MI setting.This trial plans to evaluate efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in

Trial objective(s) The main objective of this event-driven trial is to demonstrate the superiority of empagliflozin [ADDRESS_1151595] heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829947]-cause mortality in high-risk patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829948].
Trial endpoints Primary endpoint:
∀Composite of time to first HHF or all-cause mortality 
Key secondary endpoints which are part of the testing strategy:
∀Total number of HHF or all-cause mortality
∀Total number of non-elective CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419766]-cause 
mortality
∀Total number of non-elective all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829947]-
cause mortality
∀Total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829949]-cause mortality
Other secondary endpoints:
∀Time to CV mortality
Trial design A streamlined, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multi-national and multicentre trial
Total number of patients
randomisedApproximately 5000 randomised.
If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slower accrual of primary 
outcome events over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 6500. Such a decision would be made during recruitment and before any unblinding. The number of primary outcome events required is not affected by [CONTACT_829992].
Number of patients on 
each treatmentApproximately 2500, but can be increased based on event accrual 
over time to approximately 3250
Diagnosis Patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829950]: 
∀Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with 
ICH-GCP and local legislation prior to admission to the trial
∀Diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (AMI): STEMI or NSTEMI with randomisation to occur no later than [ADDRESS_1151596] still occur within 14 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
Spontaneous AMI is defined as MI with a primary etiology of an acute coronary artery disease pathology (e.g., plaque rupture/erosion, in-stent restenosis, stent thrombosis) rather than MI caused by [CONTACT_829993]-

Spontaneous AMI is established when there is evidence of myocardial 
necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia due to primary coronary event. Under these conditions, the following criteria have to be met for the diagnosis of spontaneous AMI:Detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac enzymes (cardiac troponin, cTn or the MB fraction of creatinine kinase, CKMB) with at least one value above the 99
thpercentile of the upper reference limit (URL) or 
the local laboratory MI diagnosis cut-off value, together with evidence of myocardial ischemia with at least one of the following:
• Ischemic discomfort or other ischemia symptom(s)• Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of STEMI or NSTEMI including new or presumably new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes• Newly developed pathological Q waves or left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the ECG• Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormalityin a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology• Identification of a coronary thrombus by [CONTACT_89320]
∀High risk of HF, defined as EITHER
a) Symptoms (e.g. dyspnea; decreased exercise tolerance; 
fatigue), or signs of congestion (e.g. pulmonary rales, 
crackles or crepi[INVESTIGATOR_814]; elevated jugular venous pressure; congestion on chest X-ray), that require treatment (e.g. 
augmentation or initiation of oral diuretic therapy; i.v. diuretic therapy; i.v. vasoactive agent; mechanical intervention etc.) at any time during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].
OR
b) Newly developed LVEF < 45% as measured by 
[CONTACT_51541], ventriculography, cardiac CT, MRI or radionuclide imaging during index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].
∀In addition at least one of the following risk factors:
- Age > 65 years
- Newly developed LVEF < 35%
- Prior MI (before index MI) documented in medical records
- eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2(according to creatinine from 
most recent local lab during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829951]-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420])

Estimated trial duration is depending on event accrual and is projected to be approximately 26 months with a recruitment period of approximately 21 months. Therefore, individual treatment may range between approximately 5 and 26 months. The actual length of the recruitment may be extended beyond 21 months and the follow up may be adjusted to achieve the 532 primary endpoint events. The estimated total trial duration and length of the double-blind treatment period for each patient will vary accordingly.
Statistical methods A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied from the primary endpoint to the set of key secondary endpoints 1 and 2. If the primary 
endpoint is significant at α=5% (two-sided), then a Hochberg step-up 
procedure will be applied to test the family of two key secondary
endpoints of
∀Total number of HHF or all-cause mortality
∀Total number of non-elective CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause 
mortality
at α=5%. If the null hypotheses for both of these two key secondary 
endpoints can be rejected, only then the third key secondary endpoint 
of:
∀Total number of non-elective all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality
will be tested at α=5%. The fourth key secondary endpoint
∀Total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829954]-cause mortality
will only be tested if all the hypotheses for key secondary endpoints 1, [ADDRESS_1151600] been rejected.
The primary endpoint will be analysed using a Cox proportional 
hazards model with treatment, T2D at baseline (yes vs no), geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia), age at baseline (continuous), eGFR (CKD-EPI) at baseline (<45 vs45-<60 vs 60-<90 vs >=90 ml/min/1.73m
2), LVEF at baseline (<35% 
vs ≥35%), persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation at baseline (yes vs 
no), prior MI at baseline (yes vs no), PAD at baseline (yes vs no) and smoking at baseline (current vs non-current) as covariates. Theprimary analysis will be performed on the randomised (intention to treat) set.
It is planned that approximately 5000 patients will be randomised to 
accumulate a target of 532 primary outcome events within 21 months of recruitment and approximately additional 5 months of follow-up. If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slower accrual of primary outcome events over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 6500.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the most severe manifestation of ischemic heart disease, 
affecting approximately [ADDRESS_1151614] significant 
causes of death and poor health across the globe and results in more than 1 million 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829956], with associated costs exceeding 450 billion USD [ P20-[ZIP_CODE], R20-1515]. Heart Failure (HF) is the most common and severe 
complication of MI with over one third of all MI patients being either hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829957] [ R20-0201]. Moreover, MI constitutes the most important risk factor for 
HF with the risk of HF development at its highest immediately after and in the early (months) post-MI phase. The management of acute MI has improved in recent decades with the widespread implementation of early revascularization, dual antiplatelet treatment and intensification of secondary preventive measures, including cholesterol lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The resulting reduced mortality has left a larger population at risk of HF development [R20-
0393]. Given the central etiological role of MI in HF development overall, all patients with 
an MI can be perceived to be at elevated risk of HF, although the risk magnitude will depend on various background factors. One of the most important determinants of poor outcome and progression to HF are factors associated with extensive myocardial injury, in turn reflected as impaired systolic function and early signs and/or symptoms of HF. Other more general characteristics and comorbidities, such as age, poor renal function and type [ADDRESS_1151615] to both subsequent mortality and HF. As established chronic HF portends a particularly poor prognosis with high morbidity and mortality, early intervention in high-risk populations, including those with MI, to prevent progression to chronic HF would therefore be highly beneficial from the viewpoint of both patients and society.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal Sodium 
Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT-2) receptor. Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of sodium and glucose. This leads to both increased urinary sodium and glucose excretion. While urinary sodium excretion returns to near normal within a few days of empagliflozin administration, the effect on urinary glucose continues for as long as the medication is used.Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and has received marketing approval in various regions including for example the European Union, Latin American countries, [LOCATION_003] and Japan where it is marketed under the brand name [CONTACT_15648]®.For a more detailed description of the drug profile please refer to the current Investigator’sBrochure (IB) [ c01678844] and local prescribing information for empagliflozin.
The Residual Effect Period (REP) of empagliflozin is 7 days. This is the period after the lastdose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects are still likely to be present.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, among patients with established cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a significant reduction in the primary endpoint (CV death, MI, or stroke) was seen, driven by a 38% relative risk reduction in CV death[P15-[ZIP_CODE]]. In addition, there was a marked reduction of all-cause mortality (32%) and 
heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (HHF) (35%). The observed benefits on CV death and HHF were independent of levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), suggesting that the cardiovascular benefits were largely independent of its glucose-lowering mechanisms. The findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial provided a strong rationale to explore the effects of empagliflozin in populations with established HF, as currently investigated in the EMPEROR trials (BI trials 1245.110 and 1245.121). Recently, a reduced risk of HF and CV mortality was also observed for the SGLT2-inhibitor dapagliflozin in the DAPA-HF trial, extending previously observed benefits to patients with established HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and without T2D [ R19-3125]. Importantly, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial there was no interaction between patients’ HF status at baseline and the observed benefits on HF and mortality, indicating potential not only for the treatment of HF but also for the prevention of HF in patients at risk but without a prior HF diagnosis. The risk reduction for HHF associated with empagliflozin treatment was 0.75 (95% CI 0.48-1.19) in patients with investigator-reported HF at baseline and 0.59 (95% CI 0.43-0.82) in patients without investigator-reported HF at baseline, and for all-cause mortality 0.79 (95% CI 0.52-1.20) in patients with HF and 0.66 (0.51-0.81) in patients without HF at baseline. Moreover, in the overall trial population there was also a significant risk reduction with empagliflozin treatment for all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.96)) [ P17-[ZIP_CODE]]. There is 
currently equipoise with respect to efficacy and safety of empagfliflozin in the general acute MI population (including a majority of non-diabetic patients) as in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, only patients with T2D were included, and in order to be eligible for inclusion, a recent MI (< 2 months) was not allowed. Finally, among the included T2D patients in the study, only a small proportion had an MI < 1 year of inclusion.
This trial plans to address a significant unmet need in the large acute MI population, 
specifically related to the risk of HHF and mortality: The trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of T2D, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829958] a Type I acute MI [ R20-0005] and at high risk for subsequent HHF and 
mortality. The main hypothesis is that early intervention with empagliflozin on top of standard of care in this patient population reduces the subsequent risk of HHF and mortality, compared to placebo.

and HHF in T2D patients with established CVD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_829959] T2D patients, the observed benefits appeared to be independent of the glucose-lowering effects, thus providing a rationale to study empagliflozin as treatment in HF patients with and without T2D [ P16-

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_1151618]-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Recently, in the DAPA-HF trial, benefits of the SGLT2-inhibitor dapagliflozin in established HF were confirmed in patients with established HFrEF with and without T2D [ R19-3125]. 
The EMPEROR-Reduced trial, which studies the effects of empagliflozin in established HFrEF, is expected to complete in 2020. The benefits on HHF and mortality in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were similar in patients both with and without HF at baseline, indicating a potential for both treatment and prevention of HF. As patients with a high-risk MI (defined as signs or symptoms of HF or evidence of myocardial dysfunction resulting from the MI) are common and at high-risk of both HF and mortality, there is a strong reason to believe they could benefit from empagliflozin treatment. As patients with an acute or a recent MI were not included in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, there is equipoise for further trials in this important patient population.
In addition, several acute MI animal studies in rats and pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (both with and without T2D) 
showed multiple benefits from empagliflozin treatment in conjunction with and after the induced MI. Benefits included improved survival, less adverse remodelling, preserved cardiac contractility and less neurohormonal activation in animals treated with empagliflozin, compared to placebo [ c01678844, P18-[ZIP_CODE], P19-[ZIP_CODE], P19-[ZIP_CODE]]. Further, in the 
EMPA-HEART trial, patients with established T2D and established ischemic heart disease(IHD) experienced a reduction in left ventricular mass over time with treatment of empagliflozin, indicating that reverse remodelling as a result of empagliflozin treatment could be a likely mediator of the overall benefits [ P19-[ZIP_CODE]].
In addition to potential risk reductions for HF and mortality, empagfliflozin may provide other benefits in a high-risk post-MI population, especially related to prevalent CV and renal comorbidities. In patients with T2D, empagliflozin is known to improve glucose control over time and also have a positive influence on other CV risk factors, including reductions in blood pressure and body mass index. Importantly, marked benefits on hard renal outcomes as well as a stabilization of the eGFR slope (after an initial modest decrease) were observed for empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [ P16-[ZIP_CODE]].

Hypoglycaemia The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased 
only when empagliflozin was used concomitantly with insulin and/or 
sulfonylurea. The risk of hypoglycaemia in
patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered very low. In a mechanistic study [ c11963611-01 ], patients without 
DM had an increase of endogenous glucose production in response to glycosuria due to empagliflozin.Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are excluded from the study.  Investigators will advise 
patients on insulin or sulfonylureas 
to exercise additional caution in monitoring for hypoglycaemia when initiating trial medication.
Guidance for the investigator is 
provided in the IB.
Volume depletion Empagliflozin may selectively reduce interstitial volume with minimal change in intravascular volume.
Polyuria and consequent dehydration and 
hypotension were identified as risks in patients treated with empagliflozin, 
especially patients with known CV disease, 
history of hypotension, taking diuretics orother antihypertensive drugs, or elderly patients aged 75 years and older [ P19-
[ZIP_CODE] ]. In the EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF 
trial, empagliflozin was safe and well-
tolerated in patients with acute heart 
failure. [ P20-[ZIP_CODE] ]Congested patients with ongoing diuretic therapy can be randomized but haemodynamically unstable or hypotensive patients are excluded.
Guidance for the investigator is 
provided in the IB. Information 
and recommendations to patients
are provided in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) /Ketoacidosis (KA)Cases of DKA, including fatal cases, were reported in patients treated with SGLT2-inhibitors. In patients treated with SGLT2-inhibitors DKA may occur with lower than usual glucose values. The risk of DKA is 
increased in patients with lower than 
needed insulin intake, T1D, low carbohydrate intake, acute illness, major trauma, major surgery, severe dehydration or alcohol use.  In the recently published DAPA-HF trial that enrolled both diabetic 
and non-diabetic HF patients, the incidence 
of DKA in the DAPA arm was 0.1%.  Among non-diabetics, no ketoacidosis events were reported [R19-3125 ].Patients with T1D and prior KA are excluded from the trial.
Guidance for the investigator is

Hypersensitivity The risks of allergic skin reactions (e.g. 
rash, urticaria) and angioedema were identified for empagliflozin based on post-marketing experience.
As with all drugs, the risk of severe and 
unexpected allergic reactions cannot be excluded.Patients with hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or other SGLT2-inhibitors are excluded from trialparticipation.
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) No risk of DILI was identified for 
empagliflozin during the clinical development program. However, DILI can be severe and even lead to fatal outcome or 
need of liver transplant. Therefore, careful 
monitoring and assessment of patients for potential DILI is needed.Hepatic injury is an AESI and requires detailed reporting by [CONTACT_829997].
If DILI is suspected additional 
information will be collected 
according to the DILI checklist.
Unblinded review of potential 
DILI cases will be performed by [CONTACT_276746] (DMC).
Lower limb amputation (LLA)An increase of amputations in CANVAS (a clinical trial on canagliflozin) was observed. In a post-hoc analysis of all completed Phase II and III clinical trials of empagliflozin and its fixed dose combinations, including the ones with a
duration less than 3 months, the incidence 
of LLA in patients treated with empagliflozin was not higher compared to patients treated with placebo or other comparators.
No increase in the risk of LLA or 
potentially related AEs was observed in patients treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo in a meta-analysis of 3 large CV outcome trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, and EMPEROR-Preserved) [ c32096554-01 ].Risk of LLA has been described in the IB [ c01678844 ]. Like for all 
diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-care.LLA is an AESI and requires detailed 
reporting by [CONTACT_829998].
Renal safety In clinical trials with patients with T2D, 
the incidence of renal impairment was similar to placebo. An initial decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)was seen in patients treated with empagliflozin, which improved and 
stabilized during continuous treatment or 
discontinuation of empagliflozin.
Cases of renal impairment, including those
requiring dialysis, have been reported in Decreased renal function fulfilling 
the definition of a SAE or an AE 
leading to discontinuation must be reported.
Unblinded review of cases of acute 
kidney injury will be performed by

patients using SGLT2-inhibitors. In the EMPA-RESPONSE trial, empagliflozin was safe and well-tolerated in patients with 
acute HF, without evidence of 
empagliflozin being associated with renal impaiment [ P20-[ZIP_CODE]].
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)The safety of empagliflozin in pregnant women was not established.In accordance with international regulatory guidelines, WOCBP are excluded from trial participation unless they agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method.
All WOCBP will undergo 
pregnancy testing before randomisation.
Known or potential risks in patients without T2D:
In the empagliflozin HF program, which includes the two ongoing large EMPEROR outcome 
trials and the two EMPERIAL exercise capacity trials (with more than 10,000 patients being followed up as of May 2020), the frequencies of overall adverse events (AE), severe AE, serious AE, and AE leading to treatment discontinuation reported in patients without T2D were similar or lower than the ones reported in patients with T2D, consistent with the known safety reporting described in the IB.
As of May 2020 based on blinded data review from the EMPEROR outcome trials, no new 
safety concerns has been raised in population without T2D.
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be assigned to monitor the trial.   
The DMC will evaluate the unblinded data for potential safety signals on a quarterly basis.  They will also analyse, at the DMC chair’s discretion, unblinded data at any point during the trial if data from other studies of empagliflozin or other SGLT2-inhibitors reveal previously unknown risks. Please refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_1151626] of care for underlying conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the placebo controlled trial design should not constitute a risk for the population in this trial.
Patients with current or planned use of an SGLT2-inhibitor at baseline are excluded. 
Moreover, in enrolled patients, if a strong need to treat with an SGLT2-inhibitor developsduring the trial according to the investigator (anticipated in some T2D patients), trial medication can be discontinued and the patient can instead be treated with open-label empagliflozin or another SGLT2-inhibitor. Follow-up of the patient will continue as per the intention-to-treat principle.

In neighboring populations, empagliflozin has already demonstrated benefits on mortality and HF paired with a well established safety profile. The intended trial population for this trial is not considered to be at higher risk from a safety viewpoint as compared to previously or currently studied populations, thus allowing for a more streamlined trial approach, which includes focused safety reporting (serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest with respect to empagfliflozin and the post-MI setting), remote follow-up and blinded investigator event review instead of centralized adjudication, ultimately enabling continued evidence generation in an area of high unmet medical need.

However, one in-person visit at 6 months serves as an opportunity for a longer interaction with the patient to address any trial related topi[INVESTIGATOR_829965], comprehensive concomitant medication collection, and to provide additional supplies of trial medication. For the remote follow-up, all relevant trial information will be collected in a structuredquestionnaire and/or interview. If requested by a trial participant or deemed necessary by [CONTACT_670501], an on-site trial visit can be conducted, either in place of or in addition to a pre-specified remote visit. Similarly, as in any clinical trial, study sites should beready to address any concerns, questions or event reporting from patients outside the pre-specified follow-up time points.
All endpoints will be reviewed by [CONTACT_829999], incorporating clinical 
judgment and objective pre-defined event criteria structured in the CRF. No central adjudication of the endpoints will be performed. A meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_1151635] estimates were not different whether investigator reported or adjudicated events were used as a basis for the analysis, especially in trials where investigators were blinded [ P20-[ZIP_CODE]]. Moreover, further support to use investigator reports 
instead of central adjudication comes from the SHIFT study, a chronic HF trial where there was approximately 85% confirmation of investigator-reported HHF events by [CONTACT_830000] [ R20-0249].
Patients should be receiving appropriate care as defined by [CONTACT_830001]. For the acute MI, this may include, but is not limited to, myocardial revascularization, medication with anti-platelet agents, beta-blockers, RAAS-inhibitors and cholesterol lowering agents. Finally, adequate treatment, prevention and follow-up of relevant CV and non-CV comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, must also be ensured.
For details regarding the choice of a placebo control refer to Section 1.4.2 .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Approximately 5000 patients will be randomised into the trial. Approximately 450 sites are 
planned across multiple countries. Additional back-up countries and sites may be initiated, if deemed necessary.
The trial is event-driven and all randomised patients will remain in the trial until the total 
number of patients with investigator reported primary endpoint events will reach a target of 532. If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slower accrual of primary outcome events over calendar time than projected (i.e. target 532 events needed with a planned number of 5000 patients randomised), the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 6500, or trial duration may be prolonged.
Recruitment of T2D will be monitored on a regional level. Cappi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a regional level may 
be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to the categories of patients with and without T2D.

Recruitment of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening will stop at all sites at the 
same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened to deliver the required number of randomised patients. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will not be allowed to screen additional patients thereafter. The recruitment period may be extended for individual countries, if necessary, to achieve their reasonable contribution to the global trial population. For the same reason, recruitment may be ended in individual countries or regions.Re-screening (if a patient is not eligible initially) is allowed once. In case of re-screening, the patient should first be declared a screening failure in the eCRF and the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) with the original patient number. Upon re-screening, the IRT system will allocate a new screening number for the patient.

Spontaneous AMI is established when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a 
clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia due to primary coronary event. Under these conditions, the following criteria have to be met for the diagnosis of spontaneous AMI:Detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac enzymes (cardiac troponin, cTn or the MBfraction of creatinine kinase, CKMB) with at least one value above the 99
th
percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) or the local laboratory MI diagnosiscut-off value, together with evidence of myocardial ischemia with at least one of
the following:

∀Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of STEMI or NSTEMI including new or 
presumably new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes
∀Newly developed pathological Q waves or left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the

Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559]. Tubal ligation is NOT a method of permanent sterilisation. A woman who underwent tubal ligation is still considered as WOCBP. However tubal ligation is considered as a method of highly effective birth control.A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.

3.3.4 Withdrawal of patients from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications; please see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 
[IP_ADDRESS] below.
This is a long-term outcome trial and an excessive withdrawal rate can have a severe negative impact on the scientific value of the trial. The Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis requires that all randomised patients be followed until trial end even if the trial medication wastemporarily interrupted, discontinued or never started. Therefore, every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at least to collect important trialdata. Patients are encouraged to notify the site in cases of treatment discontinuation even outside regular follow-up time points, in order for a timely discussion and decision on whether treatment should be reinstated, re-evaluated or permanently stopped. Requests from patients for on-site visits should also be accommodated.
If a patient is withdrawn from the trial the sponsor/CRO should be informed immediately 
about each individual case.
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as theexplanation of the options for follow-up of patients in case of withdrawal.
The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the 
reason must be documented in the patient files and eCRF. If applicable, consider the requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see Sections [IP_ADDRESS].1 and 
[IP_ADDRESS]).

A patient should discontinue trial treatment if:
∀If it is the patient’s wish, without need for justification.
∀The patient has repeatedly demonstrated non-compliance with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_35915], is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future.
∀The patient needs to take a concomitant medication that interferes with the investigational medicinal product. Please see Section 4.3.2 .
∀The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons (such as surgery, adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy).
In all cases where a patient has discontinued trial medication, the possibility to restart therapy should be considered if medically justified. With the exception of short and temporary interruptions, patients are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_830002] a timely assessment of the potential to restart therapy can be performed by [CONTACT_1719]. If the patients do not notify the site, the assessment must be performed in conjunction with the regular follow-up visits. For further information, please see Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_1151645] a complete dataset without missing data. If a patient is not willing to return for the on-site visit after 6 months (visit 4), then this visit should be conducted by [CONTACT_648].
Patients that are not actively taking trial medication may be less motivated to adhere to the
scheduled trial visits. In potential cases where a patient is no longer willing to complete all follow-up measures, the following sequence of options should be considered and discussed if allowed by [CONTACT_427]:

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_1151656]-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul [ZIP_CODE].1.2 Selection of doses in the trial and dose modifications
Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg are approved for the treatment of T2D.
In the EMPA-REG-OUTCOME trial both doses were administered to patients with T2D and showed to be equally effective in reducing CV mortality, all-cause mortality, and HHF.In a subgroup analysis, empagliflozin improved the outcome of CV mortality and HHF with a similar magnitude in patients with low or high levels of HbA1c at baseline and irrespective of the dose of empagliflozin [ P18-[ZIP_CODE]]. This indicates the risk reduction for this outcome is 
independent of the degree of glycaemic control at baseline, suggesting that these benefits can be achieved with the 10 mg dose similar to the 25 mg dose in the non-diabetic population. The mechanism of action is supported by [CONTACT_830006] a glucosuria of about 50g per day.
Given the lower exposure with empagliflozin 10 mg and similar general safety, and similar 
observed CV, HHF and mortality effects for both doses, empagliflozin 10 mg once daily has been selected as the dose in this trial.For further details see current version of the IB [ c01678844].
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
After the assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be 
randomised to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo according to a randomisation plan in a 1:1 ratio.  The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion at visit 2avia IRT stratified by [CONTACT_123817] T2D (yes, no) and region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia). Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System).
To facilitate the use of the IRT, the Investigator or delegate will receive a manual including
all necessary instructions for using the system. A copy of the manual will be available in theISF.
Patient assignment to a treatment group will be determined by a computer generated random
sequence. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented - for furtherdetails please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] and4.1.5.2. For information on cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], please refer to 
Section 3.3.
Using this procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Patients who qualify will be randomised to treatment groups as described in Section 4.1.3 . 
Trial medication will be dispensed by [CONTACT_9916] a double-blind manner. 
IRT will be used to allocate trial medication to patients. At Visit 2a patients will be assigned
one medication kit for a 6 months treatment period and 6 weeks of reserve. At Visit 4 patientswill be assigned medication kits for a 6, 12 or 18 months treatment period, depending on

weeks of reserve.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be situations that would not allow a patient to 
come to the site for Visit 4. If the investigator judges it as favourable and safe to continue trial medication, trial medication might be shipped from the site to the patient (for more details see Section 6.2.2 ).
Additional medication kits can be assigned to patients, e.g. in the event of treatment prolongation. The trial medication may then be shipped by [CONTACT_830007], if legally acceptable according to local regulations.
Treatment starts on the day of Visit 2a and ends on the EoS visit (or in the event of premature 
discontinuation, the time when the permanent withdrawal takes place). For further details regarding packaging please refer to Section 4.1.6 . For return of trial medication please refer 
to Section 6.2.3.
From the start of the treatment period patients will be instructed to take the trial medicationonce daily with a glass of water. Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food.
To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, the medication should be taken in the morning at
approximately the same time every day including the days of study visits. If a dose is missedby [CONTACT_726] 12 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken asscheduled. No double doses should be taken.
In case trial medication was discontinued for a temporary reason or by [CONTACT_15613] a
medical indication, trial treatment can be resumed at any time until EoS. Trial medication should be restarted if and as soon as medically justified (see also Section [IP_ADDRESS]
and 4.3.1).

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients, investigators, and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other
interest in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database lock.
The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review efficacy and
safety and to fulfil their tasks as outlined in the DMC charter. An independent team, not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, will provide the unblinded results to the DMC.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the codeEmergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. Emergency unblinding 
should be rare and it must only be used in an emergency situation when the identity of the 
trial drug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trial participants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the Pharmacovigilance database system and not be shared further.
The patient could continue trial medication after unblinding.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1151669] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor/CRO within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Contrast induced acute kidney injury (AKI)
Contrast induced AKI in this trial is defined as a creatinine increase of >44 μmol/L (0.5 
mg/dl) or >25% increase within [ADDRESS_1151670] administration, in the absence of 
alternative more likely explanations. In the report the investigator will be asked to provide supporting information (creatinine values and time points in relation to contrast

Ketoacidosis
If metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA is suspected further investigations should be
done according to the medical judgment and the clinical course until a diagnosis is madeand/or the patient is recovered.
Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentially modify the clinical
presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients withDM and potentially also in non-diabetic patient population. The diagnosis of ketoacidosis inthese patients can be based on arterial pH ≤7.30, serum bicarbonate levels <15 mmol/L and
measurement of serum beta-hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic criteria which cansupport the diagnosis of ketoacidosis are urine ketones and anion gap >10 mmol/L.
Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need to apply for the diagnosis
of ketoacidosis, and clinical judgment should also be taken into consideration.
Events leading to lower limb amputation
Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of amputation, auto-amputation or
disarticulation as defined below is considered as an AESI.
“Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb
through a joint. Auto-amputation is a spontaneous separation of non-viable portion of thelower limb.
Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), procedures
on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and otherprocedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb(amputation or disarticulation).” (International Working Group of Diabetic Foot, 2015).
Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto-amputation should be reported
separately. The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputationor disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient hadsome of the known risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation, including the presence or development of lower extremity peripheral artery disease.
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by [CONTACT_35961]:
∀an elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥[ADDRESS_1151672] combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_1151673] measured in the same blood draw sample, or in samples drawn within 30 days of each other, or,

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs specified below in the 
patient files.The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by [CONTACT_36705]:
• From randomisation onwards until the individual patient’s end of trial (EoS) 
participation:
-all AESIs (serious and non-serious)-SAEs-AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication for at least 7 consecutive days (serious and non-serious)
The EoS visit coincides with individual patient’s last day of trial medication administration with the exception of patients with early treatment discontinuation.
• After the individual patient’s EoS:
-the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but must
report all SAEs and AESIs up to EoS + 7 days.
After this  EoS + 7 days period the investigator then should only report any 
occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_830011], e.g. phone call.
All AEs should be reported into the eCRF as long as the site has access to the EDC system.After that, the reporting  pursues on the BI paper SAE form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1).
The rules for Adverse Event Reporting exemptions still apply, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow chart . If any visit has 
to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule.
The remote visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_830012]/web-based application, telephone or 
telemedicine (Telehealth). The site personnel will discuss the different options with the patient during the screening to ensure the patients’ preferences are met. Patients are allowed to switch between the different remote contact [CONTACT_329006].
Patients using the mobile/web-based application to complete the questionnaire will receive 
push-notifications to remind of their upcoming visits. If the questionnaire has not been completed within the defined visit window site/call center personnel will be alerted and proceed to call the patient.
In cases where the patients using mobile/web-based application have indicated potential 
occurrence of an endpoint event, safety related or medication adherence issue, the site personnel will contact [CONTACT_830013].
In conjunction with all visits, remote or on-site, site personnel will additionally screen local 
medical records for endpoint events, SAEs and AESIs.
Should the patient during the structured interview or via the mobile/web-based application 
indicate that a safety related issue has occurred, site personnel will collect relevant information, e.g. from medical records needed for reporting the event/endpoint.The investigator is responsible for reviewing the endpoints. For further information seeSection 5.[ADDRESS_1151685] of or in addition to a pre-specified remote visit. Similarly, as in any clinical trial, trial sites should be ready to address any concerns, questionsor event reporting from patients outside the pre-specified follow-up time points.

visit window but do not need to be performed on the same day. The patient should beregistered in IRT as a screened patient.
The investigations for the main diagnosis for inclusion are to be completed and documented
per standard of care as a prerequisite to consideration for trial participation. Patients will beincluded in the trial based on patient interview and available information in the medical records.
Relevant medical history/baseline conditions will be documented using pre-specified 
categories as given in the eCRF.
If the patient meets the entry criteria, Visit 2a/randomisation must occur within 14 days of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829985]. If the patient does not meet the entry criteria following Visit 1/screeningprocedures, the patient should be registered as a screen failure in IRT.
A physical examination, including collection of vital signs will be performed at Visit 
2a/randomisation. Selected local laboratory tests will be collected if available as indicated in Section 5.3 .
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Randomisation can occur at the same day as the screening visit.
After a final check of all in- and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be randomised atVisit 2a using IRT. All Visit 2a assessments must be performed before the first dose is taken in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
For patients that are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829986] 2a assessment of safety, endpoints and 
updates of concomitant medication will take place at Visit 2b/ day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].
WOCBP will receive a pregnancy test to bring back home in order to perform the test at the

SAMPLE SIZE
Eligible patients will be randomised to receive empagliflozin or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified according to established T2D status (yes, no) and geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia). The primary endpoint is the composite of time to first HHF or all-cause mortality. The statistical model will be a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for stratification factors as well as further baseline covariates known to be prognostic for the primary endpoint, see Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1151693] ratio and its confidence 
limits will be determined for evaluating superiority of empagliflozin to placebo.
The key secondary endpoints are defined as:
1. Total number of HHF or all-cause mortality
2. Total number of non-elective CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality3. Total number of non-elective all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality4. Total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829960]-cause mortality
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied from the primary endpoint to the set of key 
secondary endpoints 1 and 2. If, and only if, the primary endpoint is significant at α=5% 
(two-sided) and shows superiority of empagliflozin versus placebo, then a Hochberg step-up procedure [ R20-0113] will be applied to test the family of two key secondary endpoints of
∀Total number of HHF or all-cause mortality
∀Total number of non-elective CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality

can be rejected and both show superiority of empagliflozin versus placebo, only then the third key secondary endpoint of:
∀Total number of non-elective all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality

will only be tested if all the hypotheses for the primary and key secondary endpoints 1, [ADDRESS_1151694] been rejected and all show superiority of empagliflozin versus placebo. This ensures strong control of the family-wise error rate, see Figure 7.1: 1.

7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the randomised set (RS) including all 
randomised patients. Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, with the use of all available data (on and off treatment) through the trial. This equates a treatment-policy estimand. Supplementary analyses investigating a hypothetical estimand using on-treatment data only will be specified below.
The safety analysis will be based on the treated set (TS) which consists of all patients treated 
with at least one dose of the trial medication.
For both efficacy and safety analyses, treatment will be evaluated as randomised.Baseline will be defined as the last available measurement before randomisation.Important protocol deviations will be defined in a separate document.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary endpoint will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model [ R07-4680] 
with treatment, T2D at baseline (yes vs no), geographical region (North America, Latin 
America, Europe, Asia), age at baseline (continuous), eGFR (CKD-EPI) at baseline (<45 vs 45-<60 vs 60-<90 vs >=90 ml/min/1.73m2), LVEF at baseline (<35% vs ≥35%), persistent or 
permanent atrial fibrillation at baseline (yes vs no), prior MI at baseline (yes vs no), peripheral artery disease (PAD) at baseline (yes vs no) and smoking at baseline (current vs non-current) as covariates. 
Breslow’s method for dealing with ties will be used. The hazard 
ratio for the effect of treatment (empagliflozin versus placebo) and its 95% confidence limits will be estimated and presented with the two-sided p-value for the null hypothesis of equality based on the Wald chi-squared statistic.
The time to the event will be calculated by (event date – randomisation date) + 1. All events 
observed after randomisation until end of trial will be included in the analysis. Patients who do not have an event during the trial will be censored at the individual day of trial completion or the last day that the patient was known to be free of the event, whichever is earliest. Time to censoring will be calculated by (individual day of trial completion or the last day known to be free of the event – randomisation date) + 1. For patients who have more than one primary endpoint event the time to first occurrence of these events will be considered for the primary analysis.
To detect any heterogeneity in the treatment effect among patients with established T2D and 
without established T2D, a subgroup analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_830016] T2D by [CONTACT_830017].

7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
Comparisons between treatment groups regarding the key secondary endpoint of total number 
of HHF or all-cause mortality will be performed using a negative binomial regression model. The negative binomial model will include factors for treatment and all covariates specified for the primary endpoint analysis model. The analysis will be adjusted for differences in observation time. Regression coefficients together with 95% confidence intervals will be used to quantify the effect of treatment, comparing empagliflozin to placebo.
The key secondary endpoints of total number of non-elective CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause 
mortality, total number of non-elective all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829953]-cause mortality and total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829960]-cause mortality will be analysed in the same way as the total number of HHF or all-cause mortality.

All treated patients (TS) will be included in the safety analysis and treatment will be analysed 
as randomised. In general, safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. Adverse events that start before first trial medication intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’.
Frequency and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT) after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock.Reasons for discontinuation of trial medication will be tabulated.
Adverse events of special interst as identified by [CONTACT_830018]. Adverse events of special interest are:
∀Contrast induced AKI
∀Ketoacidosis
∀Events leading to Lower limb amputation
∀Hepatic injury
The details of these analyses will be specified in the TSAP.

Missing data for time-to-event and all key secondary endpoints will be handled by [CONTACT_830019]-at-random assumption. Patients discontinuing the treatment prematurely will still be followed for the primary endpoint, all-cause mortality and all other endpoints including the key secondary endpoints.
7.4 RANDOMISATION
Patients will be randomized in blocks to double-blind treatment via interactive response 
technology (IRT). Approximately equal number of patients will be randomised to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo using a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by

The initial determination of sample size to reach the anticipated 532 primary outcome events is as follows:
The yearly event rate in the placebo group is assumed to be 12.5% based on previous similar 
trial populations and including that the standard of care changed over time with better prognosis to date [ R20-0260 , R20-0257, R20-0201]. Assuming a yearly event rate of 12.5% 
in the placebo arm and 9.77% in the empagliflozin arm, accounting for 1% yearly drop out, an estimated 12 months recruitment and an estimated minimum follow-up of 12 months, a number of 3312 patients would need to be randomised to provide the 532 primary outcome events.

The trial design is streamlined with extra work for collaborating site personnel being kept to a 
minimum. Only essential data will be collected with the focus being on readily identifiable and important clinical outcomes.
The primary data collected will be from carefully structured interviews.The following data will be recorded directly on the eCRF (i.e. no prior written or electronic 
record of data), and to be considered to be source data:
∀Data entered by [CONTACT_830020]/web-based application
∀Data collected from the structured telephone interview
Additional medical information will be sought for Enpoints, SAEs and AESIs, and may 
include the collection of records held the study site, other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or the patient’s own doctors, or from electronic sources and registries.
For the eCRF, data below must be derived from source documents, for example:
∀Patient identification: gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)
∀Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient was informed)
∀Dates of patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
∀Medical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
∀Medication history
∀AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, SAEs, AESIs and events exempted from 
expedited reporting (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available))
∀Concomitant therapy (start date, changes)
∀Originals or copi[INVESTIGATOR_23242], with proper 
documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
∀Completion of patient’s participation in the trial (end date; in case of premature discontinuation document the reason for it)
∀Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.[ADDRESS_1151724] access to source data and documents

The IEC / competent authority in each participating EU member state will be notified about 
the trial milestones according to the respective laws.
A final report of the clinical trial data will be written only after all patients have completed 
the trial in all countries (EU or non-EU) to incorporate and consider all data in the report.
The sponsor will submit to the EU database a summary of the final trial results within one 
year from the end of a clinical trial as a whole, regardless of the country of the last patient(EU or non-EU).
8.7 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL
The trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_23347] (BI).
A Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_562331]. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a contract.
An Executive Committee (EC) consisting of independent experts (including the Coordinating 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_639194]) and sponsor representatives will be established to support the sponsor in designing the trial and successful execution. The composition of the EC will be documented in the Trial Master File (TMF). The tasks and responsibilities will be agreed in contracts between the EC members and the sponsor and also summarised in an EC charter. The EC will assess the baseline characteristics of the patients in an ongoing blinded manner and if needed, may take appropriate steps, which may include restrictions to enrolment for certain subpopulations.
A National Coordinator Committee (NCC) will be established and will consist of the leading
expert(s) in each of the participating countries. The NCs will support the sponsor/CRO in thesuccessful execution of the trial. The NCC will have an advisory function in the trial. Thetasks and responsibilities will be agreed in contracts between the NCC member and the CRO.
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established. Members of the DMC are
independent of BI, they are physicians experienced in the treatment of the disease underinvestigation and a statistician. The DMC will evaluate safety data. While DMC membersmay be unblinded, measures are in place to ensure the blinding for everyone else involved inthe trial. Regular DMC meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC willrecommend continuation, modification or termination of the trial as detailed in the DMCcharter. DMC recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to theappropriate Regulatory Authorities (RAs)/ Health Authority (Has), IRBs/ECs, and toinvestigators as requested by [CONTACT_1769]. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC arespecified in a charter.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators (e.g. their curricula 
vitae) will be filed in the ISF.

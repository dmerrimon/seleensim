reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and reducing the use of hypoten sive medications in subjects 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.    
3.0 Rationale for the Study 
Trabeculectomy has been the surgical treatment of choice for primary open angle glaucoma since 
1970s (1), its success rates and complications however are less than ideal. Early hypotony and 
bleb infections are still of concern. The Ex-PRESS, a miniature stainless steel glaucoma device approved by [CONTACT_847463] 
2002, is widely used worldwide for open angle glauco ma patients. This procedure is theoretically 
more reproducible and simple to perform as we ll as less traumatic to the ocular tissue than 
traditional filtering surgery. With regard to the inclusion of subjects dia gnosed and being treated for ocular hypertension, 
several recently published studies demonstrate that in patients with elevated IOP, with or without 
the visual field loss or optic nerve damage of  glaucoma, lowering IOP provides benefit in long-
term outcome of subsequent visual  field loss (2-5).  In any case, all subjects enrolled in the study 
have the opportunity to be treated with ocul ar hypotensive medicati ons during the follow-up 
period as judged appropriat e by [CONTACT_093].  
4.[ADDRESS_1178239] been identified:   
 If the implant is effective and reduces intraocular pressure, the subject may reduce or eliminate glaucoma medication therapy.  
 If the implant is effective and reduces intr aocular pressure, the subject may not require 
additional glaucoma surgery.

 If the subject requires additional glaucoma surgery post Ex-PRESS implantation, this option 
requires a smaller conjunctival incision th an trabeculectomy, therefore sparing more 
conjunctival tissue..  
 This procedure is less invasive than other conventional glaucoma  surgeries, thus resulting in 
potentially fewer complications. 
 
5.0 Background 
 
Glaucoma filtering surgery is indicated when glaucomatous damage progresses despi[INVESTIGATOR_847452] (IOP)  obtained with pharmacological and/or laser 
treatment. In the past few years, filtering su rgery has improved, with an increased likelihood of 
successfully lowering the IOP while minimizing complications. While full thickness filtration 
procedures considerably reduced  the IOP, they were associ ated with early postoperative 
hypotony and related side effects and became pr ogressively less popular. Trabeculectomy has 
been the surgical treatment of choice for open angle glaucoma (OAG)  since the 1970s; its 
success rate and complication rate however are less than ideal. Ea rly hypotony and bleb 
infections are still of concern. The Ex-PRESS is a miniature stainless steel glau coma device, developed as an alternative to 
trabeculectomy and to the other types of glaucoma filtering surg ery for patients with OAG. The 
Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt is FDA a pproved since March 2002. This procedure is 
theoretically more reproducible and simple to pe rform as well as less traumatic to the ocular 
tissue than traditional filtering surgery.  
5.[ADDRESS_1178240] marketing studies were 
performed and presented in paper publications and meetings (1, 6-20). The Ex-PRESS was found 
to be safe and effective in the treatment of glaucoma subjects. A prospective randomized study 
comparing the Ex-PRESS to trabeculectomy in open angle glaucoma patients was performed in the Netherlands. A total of [ADDRESS_1178241] a more effective success rate, % IOP re duction and medication reduction compared to 
trabeculectomy (20).  
6.0 Device Description 
The Ex-PRESS is a miniature drainage device desi gned to regulate intraocular pressure in eyes 
suffering from glaucoma. The concept behind the Ex -PRESS is to divert aqueous humor through 
the implant from the anterior chamber to an intrascleral space - th e bleb. The Ex-PRESS 
glaucoma implant is manufactured from implantable stainless steel. It c onsists of a 2-3 mm long 
and 0.4mm outer diameter and 50 micron inner di ameter tube, which connects the anterior 
chamber to the intrascleral space. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_847453], the Ex-PRESS features several 
major structural elements (figure 1): 1. A cannula for draining aqueous humor fr om the anterior chamber to the 
intrascleral space.  
2. A plate to prevent excessive penetration. 
3. A spur to prevent extrusion of the Ex-PRESS
TM from the eye.

9.4.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment 
The informed consent/patient information sheet written in the subject’ s native language will be 
explained to each prospective subject by [CONTACT_256390] a trained clinical professional.  The 
final informed consent form must be approve d by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB).  
Once the subject has been informed of all aspects of the study, the subject will then be given a 
choice to voluntarily confirm hi s or her participation in the study as documented by [CONTACT_847464].  Afte r signing the Informed Consent and the HIPAA (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Ac t) authorization, the subject  can then proceed with the 
screening evaluation.       The subject has the right to w ithdraw from the study at any time without consequences, as 
indicated in the Patient In formed Consent documentation.

lamp biomicroscopy to review the overall health of the eye, vi sual acuity (VA) measurements, 
and a review of current medications  and prior surgeries.    All in formation should be compared to 
the specific inclusion and exclusi on criteria in order to determine if the subject is eligible to 
participate in the study.   The following criteria are provided below to assist  with appropriate screening for all subjects in 
this study:     Diagnosis  
Investigator is to provide the diagnosis in each eye, as either ocular hypertension (elevated IOP 
without evidence of visual field loss or cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_847456]) or glaucoma (elevated 
IOP with either glaucomatous vi sual field loss, as judged by [CONTACT_847465], or cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_847457].     Measurement of intraocular pressure  
Each time IOP is measured, the surgeon or te chnician is to utilize a Goldmann tonometer, 
however, an independent observer should read  the measurement and then record the 
measurement to minimize observer bias.   Two measurements should be taken and the mean  recorded on the case report form UNLESS 
they differ by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_1178247] measurement is taken and the median 
value is recorded.       Visual Field Examination

Visual fields are to be performed with a non-dilated pupil unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the pupil is so miotic that dilati on is required (e.g., < 3 mm).  If dilation was 
performed at baseline, it should be performed at all subsequent  visual field examinations.  
However, dilation should not be performed before the IOP measurement on the appropriate visits.    For OAG subjects and in accordan ce with the American Acad emy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 
Preferred Practice Patterns, the se verity of glaucoma damage can  be assessed as follows: (1) 
Mild – characteristic optic nerve abnormalities are consistent with glaucoma, but there is a normal visual field and (2) Moderate – visual field abnormalities are in one hemifield and not 
within [ADDRESS_1178248] be normal and re liable in the study eye.   
  Cup-to-Disc Ratio  
A numerical expression indicating the percentage of di sc occupi[INVESTIGATOR_847458].  A score 
from 0.1 to 0.9 (in 0.1 increments) should be indicated.   Visual Acuity 
Best corrected visual acuity will be measured at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Visual acuity will be measured using Snellen line method.   If a subject satisfies all inclusi on and exclusion criteria the subject will be enrolled into the study. 
The subject is then randomized to participate in either Group  A or Group B using the sealed 
envelope method of randomization.  Group A  Subjects will undergo implantation of the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt. 
Group B  Subjects will undergo sta ndard trabeculectomy.

Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Title:  Michigan Alcohol Improvement Network - Alcohol Reduction  and Treatment  
Tool (MAIN -ART) study  
Study Description:  This study a ims to perform  a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_266376] (AUD) 
treatment for alcohol -associated liver disease (ALD) patients . This study 
builds on existing research indicating that  ALD patients are motivated by 
[CONTACT_266395] . This study wi ll enhance our 
knowledge of how correction of AUD misconceptions and a tailored, preference -sensitive AUD treatment ma tching approach may increase 
treatment engagement and potentially improve alcohol cessation.  
Outcomes:  
 The primary goal of this trial is to examine the initial feasibility  and 
acceptability  of the behavioral  intervention compared to treatment -as-
usual . The primary outcome is feasibility and acceptibility  and the 
secondary outcome s are alcohol treatment engagemtn and alcohol 
reduction. Our exploratory outcomes are to determine if misconception 
correction improved willingness for AUD treatment and to determine if tailoring treatment to patient preferences influenced the decision to 
engage in treatment. This  trial is under -powered to detect statistically 
significant differences  in outcomes . 
Hypothesis: The MAIN -ART behavioral intervention will be both feasible 
and acceptable to patients . 
Intervention 
Information:  
 The MAIN -ART behavioral intervention i s an online web application with 
two modules: misconception correction and tailored, preference -sensitive 
AUD treatment matching. The intervention will be administered on a 
laptop or tablet to recruited outpatients with ALD . The intervention takes 
approximately 10 -15 minutes.  Recruited subjects will be followed up at 3- 
and 6 -month intervals to assess for AUD treatment engagement as well as 
alcohol reduction.  
Study Population:  The study population will be approximately 60 ALD  patients recruited from 
Michigan Medicine  hepatology  clinics .  Patients will be 18 years old  or 
older , any gender or race/ethnicity, and diagnosed with advanced ALD 
(cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis) .  
Locations: University of Michigan health system (Michigan Medicine) in Ann Arbor, M I  
Estimated Study Start 
Date: March 1st, 2020 . 
Study Duration:  Two years . 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   1 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
1.1 Background 
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) causes nearly half  the liver -related deaths in the US, and with recent increases 
in alcohol use disorders, ALD -related deaths are expected to increase(1 -3). Unfortunately, medical 
treatments to arrest liver dysfunction in ALD are of limited efficacy (4, 5) . Cessation of alcohol use, by 
[CONTACT_22242], is the only factor proven to curb long- term mortality, even in the most advanced stages of ALD (6, 
7). However, many patients, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_266377], never cease alcohol use.  While clinical 
interventions have focused on improving liver function, behavioral interventions to stop alcohol use have 
not been a large focus of hepatology research, despi[INVESTIGATOR_266378] . Motivational interviewing may have benefit, but alone may not be enough to stop 
these complex patients from continued drinking, even after experiencing severe negative consequences.  ALD patients are frequently motivated to stop drinking after a diagnosis of liver disease, but only 10% will access AUD treatment  at 1 year after their initial diagnosis (8-10).  Patient preferences f or alcohol use 
treatment are varied (8), but preference -sensitive treatment matching has not been tested in th is 
population as a means of increasing AUD treatment engagement and improving rates of alcohol reduction or cessation.  
1.[ADDRESS_324270] b een shown to be 
major barriers to engagement in AUD treatment in ALD patients (8). To correct these barriers, we propose 
to pi[INVESTIGATOR_266379], the Michigan Alcohol Improvement Network -Alcohol 
Reduction and Treatment (MAIN- ART) web application, in a population of recently drinking patients with 
alcohol- related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis. We hypothesize that the intervention will be effective in 
increasing alcohol treatment engagement via two mechanisms: 1) finding and correcting errors in how 
patients view the risks of alcohol use, liver disease, and alcohol relapse and 2) tailoring recommendations 
for alcohol use treatment to patient preferences.  Our primary outcome is alcohol use treatment engagement.  Secondary outcomes are alcohol use reduction.  
2 OUTC OMES  
2.1 Primary Outcome  
The primary goal of this trial is to determine feasibility and acceptability of the MAIN -ART web -
application. Feasibility will be determined by [CONTACT_266396].  Acceptability will be 
determined based on survey questions administered following administration of the interventio n.  
2.2 Secondary Outcomes  
The secondary outcome s of this trial are:  1) alcohol treatment engagement. Alcohol treatment 
engagement will be defined as at least one visit with formal, external assistance in alcohol 
cessation or reduction. This would include at least  one session of either in person or telehealth treatment with a n addiction treatment professional (either inpatient or outpatient), in person 
or telehealth attendance to at least 1 session of a communi ty-based support group for alcohol 
cessation (such as Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Refuge Recovery, faith -based 
support group via religious organization, for example), one -on-one or group counseling with an 
addiction treatment professional, counseling with a religious leader (such as a pastor or priest) 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   to address alcohol use)), etc .. 2) alcohol reduction or maintenance of abstinence. Alcohol reduction is 
defined as either a 1 - or 2-level reduction in alcohol use as detailed in the World Health Organization 
risk drinking levels (11, 12) . Alcohol use will be measured using the Timeline Followback method (13). 
2.3 Other Pre -Specified Outcomes  
All other outcome measures will be explorato ry. 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Design  
The study is a randomized clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_266380] a

[CONTACT_14716].    
3.4 Exclusion Criteria  
• Unable to provide voluntary informed consent for any reason (including incompetency);  
• Substantially cognitively impaired as evidenced by [CONTACT_266398], place, or time 
or lack of ability to repeat back and answer screening questions  
• Unable to read or understand English

the study  
• Lack of telephone access  
3.5 Recruitment  
Participants (n=60) will be recruited  in-p erson  or via phone from Michigan Medicine Hepatology Clinics . 
We will seek a waiver of informed consent to identify potentially eligible patients from the medical 
chart. This waiver will only apply to the initial medical pre-screen  for eligibility criteria.  Recrui tment 
letters or emails will be sent to identified patients explaining the study briefly and indicating that we will 
contact [CONTACT_266399]. When the screening survey is administered and patients are 
determined eligible for enrollment, patients will be asked to read the consent for screening on the tablet or 
the consent will be emailed to them for their review. The study team will then review the consent over the 
phone, ask the participants if there are any questions, and answer any questions prior to administering 
the intervention remotely.  
 
Research staff will be given tablets or laptops to complete the screening process via electronic data 
capture . Patients who are recruited remotely will use their own tablet, laptop, or smartphone to 
comple te the study questions and intervention. Paper study screening questionnaires will be used as 
backup , if needed,  and may be distributed by [CONTACT_266400]. The screening assessment will 
determine patient eligibility to participate in the randomize d control trial. The participant will be 
assigned a random screen ID number. If the participant is eligible and is interested in participating, we conduct th e consent process at that time.   
 All patients approac hed will be tracked in the study database .  To ensure generalizable recruitment, 
demographic and clinical information on severity of liver disease and other medical comorbidities will be retained for all subjects eligible to determine factors influencing enrollment. Identifiable information will o nly be retained for patients that enroll in the study.  We will save only medical record numbers 
(MRNs) and names  for all patients to ensure we do not attempt to recruit  them more than once (e.g. if 
an eligible patient declines enrollment but returns to clinic at a later date and enters our recruitment list 
again , MRN cross check will allow us to ensure we don’t contact [CONTACT_266401]). Recruitment outcomes , 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   including reasons for refusal or ineligibility  will also be tracked in the study database to document 
eligibility, refusals and those the research assistant is unable to reach.   
3.[ADDRESS_324273] consent read 
to them over the phone and emailed to them for review. Following screening, staff will document the 
outcome of screening , including: eligible, ineligible, refused,  reason for refusal etc.  Participants who 
meet  study eli gibility criteria and have not met any of the exclusion criteria, will be given the option to 
participate in the study. Eligible participants who complete the informed  consent  will review it with the 
study research assistant and be given time to read the consent and ask any questions.  Reasons for 
refusal will be documented.  Completion of informed consent will be documented and  tracked in the 
study database . Paper informed con sent documents will be stored in locked files.  Each participant will 
be a given unique patient identifier  (separate from the screening identifier)   
3.[ADDRESS_324274] the data as soon as the individual lets us 
know they wish to withdraw. We will continue to use data that was obtained prior to withdrawal date unless the  participant asks for it to be destroyed. The data will be kept secure until it is destroyed.  
4 STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
The MAIN -ART study will offer one intervention which will be given during the enrollment visit  (whether 
this occurs in -person or over the phone) .  The intervention is the MAIN -ART web -based behavioral tool, 
as described below and will be compared to usual care. The intervention  will be delivered by a trained 
member of the research team.  
4.1 Intervention Arm: MAIN -ART Behavioral Tool  
Participants randomized to the behavioral intervention condition will receive the intervention at the initial enrollment visit.  For those seen in clinic, it will be administered on a research tablet or computer.  
For those recruited over the phone, a link to the intervention website will be emailed to them or texted to their smartphone,  depending upon patient preference.  After completion of structured surveys and 
data collection, as detailed in the Schedule of Activities, participants randomized to the intervention will 
complete the online behavioral tool.  This will take approximately [ADDRESS_324275] screens.  They also enter their zip code, but this information is not stored in any manner and is used only to link to an external substance use treatment locator ( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/ ) which will aid in display of treatment locations 
near the subject ’s home.  The first module is a 10 question true/false survey assessing patient beliefs 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   about alcohol us e, liver disease, and risk of relapse. After each question, brief written education within 
the behavioral tool is given regarding the correct answer. The second module is a [ADDRESS_324276] approximately 30 -40 minutes.  
4.2 Delivery  
All intervention  sessions will be  delivered by a trained member of the research team .    
4.3 Intervention Targets  (mechanistic and clinical outcomes)  
The goal of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_266381].  This study is 
underpowered to assess mechanisms of change.  
4.[ADDRESS_324277]  medical care through the UMHS hepatology 
department.  Subjects randomized to the control condition will receive all necessary clinical care, as in the intervention condition, including labs and alcohol biomarkers and any alcohol use information provided b y the primary hepatology provider’s usual care strategy.  From research staff, they will receive 
a brochure about University of Michigan Addiction Treatment Services which contains information on alcohol treatment resources and a phone number for them to c all should they desire to do so.  
4.6 Addiction Treatment Brochure  
All randomized participants will receive a brochure for alcohol treatment referral options at the University of Michigan.  
4.7 Concomitant Treatment  
We will not exclude participants  enrolled in othe r studies and/or health program s except as specified in 
the edibility criteria  
4.8 Lifestyle Considerations  
None  
4.9 Intervention Discontinuation 
Withdrawal of consent will result in true study discontinuation with no  follow -up interview or other 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   assessment performed.   Any information collected before withdrawal will be kept as part of the 
subject’s  record. The study will document  the patient’s reason for withdrawal, if available, to track for 
study purposes.     
4.[ADDRESS_324278] or Provider Training  
All staff delivering sessions will be trained in administration of the Timeline Follow -back alcohol 
assessment (13) and will be given t raining in informed consent, best practices for  research, and data

tablet, or smartphone . 
[ADDRESS_324280]  of the MAIN -ART behavioral tool compared to usual care to 
increase alcohol treatment engagement in ALD patients.  The goal of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_266382], as a secondary goal, to determine if the tool 
increases alcohol treatment engagement.  Participants who agree to enroll in the study will be given the intervention at the initial, in- person study visit  or via a phone recruitment visit.   This is expected to take 
30-40 minutes for the total enr ollment visit.  Two follow -up phone assessments will be performed at 3 - 
and 6 -months after enrollment (see below for content of assessments).  We will be screening medical 
records to determine some patient eligibility criteria such as age and liver disease diagnosis. We are requesting a waiver of consent for recruitment purposes.  
 Due to the large number of patients receiving hepatology care in the liver clinics, it would be difficult to obtain consent from each patient prior to screening. The risk to patie nts is minimal in order to allow 
staff to pre -screen medical records. Patients who are interested in participating will provide informed 
consent before study activities begin.   Participants who appear eligible after medical record screening 
will be approac hed in person  or via letter or email to notify them of the study, then by [CONTACT_266402], for which they will provide verbal consent. These questions will further assess for eligibility based on recent drinking pattern (within 6 months) and recent alcohol 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   treatment (within past month).  Participants eligible after the screening survey will provide informed 
consent before performing any baseline study -related procedures.  
 Outcome assessments are performed three times across an individual’s time in the study: baseline, 3 
months after initial visit and 6 months after initial visit.  Assessments performed at each time point  are 
listed in the Schedule of Activities.  Follow -up assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_266403] a corresponding clinic visit during which the assessments could be done in -person. The 
schedule of assessments is indicated in the Schedule of Study Activities.  
5.1 Participant Incentives  
Participants will be compensated as follows:  $30 fo r the initial enrollment visit, $[ADDRESS_324281] phone 
follow -up, and $40 for the final phone follow -up for a total of $10 0 compensation for study completion.  
Subjects who do not complete a follow-up study visit will not be compensated for that visit.  
5.2 Randomization  
We will use c omputer -generated urn randomization  to ensure balanced groups based on gender. 
Research staff will be blind to participant study condition (with the exception of those delivering the intervention).  We will track participant recruitment and retention as a measure of study feasibility. Retention strategies include, collecting multiple forms of participant and collateral contact [CONTACT_3031], sending reminders by e -mail, phone, and text, and increasing incentive payments in a stepped fashion 
for completing all parts of the study.  We aim to retain 80% of patients (48/60) using these strategies and those reported in the literature for ALD patient research (14). 
5.[ADDRESS_324282] enrollment appointment will 
take up to 40 minutes for those randomized to receive the intervention (25 minutes for consent form review, eligibility assessment, completion of AUDIT -10 and additional questionnaires (see Schedule of 
Activitie s) (15) and Timeline Follow -Back assessment, and 15 minutes for intervention completion).  
 
All baseline and follow -up assessments will be designed and administered using an online survey 
platform like the University of Mich igan instances of Qualtrics Research Suite 
(http://www.qualtrics.com ) o
r REDCap .  These and similar systems  are protected with a researcher -
designated login name [CONTACT_2383]. They house the surveys and compi[INVESTIGATOR_266383] . There are security precautions in place to protect against unauthorized 
access, but there is a small risk of unauthorized access. Information regarding Q ualtrics security  and 
privacy statements can be found at http://www.qualtrics.com/security -statement  a nd 
http://www.qualtr ics.com/privacy -statement. 
5.3.2 Self-Report Measures  
Accepta bility will be assessed by [CONTACT_266404] 
a modified Systems Usability Scale ( https://www.usability.gov/how -to-a nd-tools/methods/system-
usability -scale.html ) to evaluate the usability of the intervention .  Alcohol treatment engagement will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_6270] -report. Alcohol use assessments administered at baseline and follow -up include  the 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (15) and the Alcohol Timeline Follow -back (TLFB)(13) . 
The secondary outcome  data for alcohol reduction (1 -level  or 2-level reduction in weekly alcohol use 
using World Health Organization risk drinking lev els) is gathered here. All other self- report measures are 
exploratory.  
 
Measures of  readiness to change and treatment readiness include the Stages of Change and Treatment 
Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES)(16)  and alcohol use pro blems  include the Short Inventory of Problems  
(SIP) (17). Health and functioning assessments include the Short -Form Survey 12 (SF -12)(18) . 
5.[ADDRESS_324283] and analyze de -identified data from patient’s medical records to evaluate 
the impact of the alc ohol brief intervention measures of liver function, alcohol use,  and health -care 
utilization .  These measures will include , but are  not limited to,  labs (to calculate Model for End -Stage 
Liver Disease Sodium (MELD -Na) score), clinical descriptions of worsening or improving portal 
hypertensive complications (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy) collected as part of routine clinical care, and things like ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] .  Of note, no labs will be drawn for 
research purposes.  We are underpowered to detect between group effects of interventions on these secondary outcomes    
 No HIPAA identifiers will be collected from the patient medical record, except dates of death (if 
applicable). Th is dataset will not be linked to patient identifying information. This measure is 
exploratory.  
5.[ADDRESS_324284] -Intervention Assessment  
Participants will also complete brief assessments
 following intervention completion regarding usefulness 
of the intervention, effectiveness of the two modules (misconception correction and treatment matching), and any improvements that should be made .  
5.5.2 Qualitative Exit Interview  
After the study is complete  (N = 1 0) participants that indicated willingness to be re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (in 
consent form) will be asked to complete an exit interview  (open -ended researcher -delivered questions)  
about why they did or did not change their alcohol use, and what the role of the interven tion was in that 
decision -making process. The purpose is to further refine the intervention conditions for further 
development and dissemination. This measure is exploratory.  
 Five who did respond and engage in treatment and 5 who did not will be selected for an interview at 
study completion. Selection will be balanced between intervention and control arm. Qualitative 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   interviews with patients will occur during a single interaction with research staff. Qualitative interviews 
will be audio recorded.  Interviews will focus on why patients did or did not engage in alcohol treatment, 
how the intervention did or did not play a role in their decision (for those who received the 
intervention), and what could be improved or changed about the intervention.

6 SAFETY 
6.1 Potential Risks  
There is a minor potential risk for breaches of confidentiality with  assessment data. The risk of a 
violation of confidentiality exists because human  participants will be disclosing personal information, 
both in assessments and  intervention sessions. This risk is related to the damage that could be caused 
by [CONTACT_266405] (e.g., psychiatric symptoms, substance use,  etc.). Our 
research team has considerable experience in maintaining the confidentiality of study datasets and will 
have procedures in place to ensure data confidentiality. (See  details of protections below) All 
investigators have completed training in the  requirements for handling protected health information as 
outlined by [CONTACT_266406] (HIPAA). Participants will be 
informed of the  procedures taken to protect their confidentiality. The focus of this study is not on  child   Pre-Screening

and/or dependence) these issues may arise. The consent form will  contain a statement explaining 
mandatory reporting requirements for information  regarding child abuse and intention to harm self or 
others prior to participating in the  study.  
 
There is also a slight risk of psychological discomfort to study participants as a result of being asked 
personal questions, particularly during the assessments. Participants may  also become anxious or upset 
during discussions about hazardous drinking that occur.   Study staff will be trained to respond to this 
emotional distress and to refer participants  to appropriate resources as necessary. All participants will 
be free to terminate the study at any time or refuse to respond to any questionnaire item.  We are not 
directly assessing for suicidality.  However, if study subjects make statements indicating an intent to self-harm, we will make a further clinical assessment and refer appropriately for follow -up. The study team 
contains a senior psychologist ([CONTACT_85630]) and a psychiatrist ([CONTACT_266416]) who will provide guidance in assessing risk.  
6.2 Potential Benefits  
Patients participating in the MAIN -ART trial may benefit as follows: 1) Improved knowledge of the risks of 
alcohol use and liver disease as well as the risks of alcohol relapse on their liver and overall health.  Correctly understanding these risks may allow for increased willingness to reduce or stop alcohol use and engage in alcohol use treatment, which has benefits for patients with ALD in reducing risk of decompensation and mortality.  2) Improved understanding of alcohol use treatment options available .  
Many patients with ALD do not understand the full range of alcohol treatment options available to them.  Completion of the tailored preference -sensitive alcohol treatment tool will allow them to view and 
contemplate different alcohol treatments and dete rmine what their own values and preferences are for 
engaging in alcohol treatment.  This may reduce barriers to participation in alcohol treatment, which may 
increase engagement in treatment resulting in reduction in or total cessation of alcohol use.  
6.3 Assessment of Potential Risks & Benefits  
The degree of risk to which study participants will be exposed in the proposed protocol is low. By 
[CONTACT_22242], the potential benefits to the individual and society are substantial, insofar as the results of this 
study will be used to develop and implement interventions  to improve alcohol use treatment uptake 
and reduce alcohol use in ALD patients . These interventions have the potential to assist ALD patients in 
reducing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266384], which would have substantial benefits on ALD morbidity and 
mortality as well as potential for improving healthcare utilization by [CONTACT_266407][INVESTIGATOR_266385] -term.  When considering the minimal risks 
entailed with the data collection and tests proposed, in combination with the extensive efforts to 
limit/eliminate these risks, we feel that the potential benefits to the research community and future 
interventions far outweigh the potential minimal risks.  
6.[ADDRESS_324285] (IRBMED) per standard reporting guidelines; and an annual report will be submitted to the 
NIAAA Project Officer summarizing all adverse events. Per standard reporting guidelines, related and unexpected S AEs will be reported as soon as possible but within [ADDRESS_324286]. Mellinger  will be responsible for determining the severity of an event, and whether 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   such adverse events were expected (i.e. listed as expected in the DSMP or in clude d in the info rmed 
consent). The person responsible for reporting adve rse events will be [CONTACT_266417]; she will also be 
respon sible for r eporting amendments to the protocol to IRBMED  prior to implementation of any 
changes. 
In the event that a participant either withdraws from the study or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_266386] a 
participant due to an AE or SAE, the participant will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mellinger , PI, via ongoing status 
assessment until (a) a resolution is reached (e.g., the problem has resolved or stabilized with no further change expected), (b) the SAE is determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or (c) the SAE results in death. Actions taken by [CONTACT_266408], as will reports of changes or amendments to the protocol resulting from an adverse event. Outcomes of AEs and SAEs will be regularly reported to NIH and IRB ( as outlined above) . A 
summary of the AEs and SAEs that occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to NIH and the annual IRB renewals at the University of Michigan . Events that do not 
meet the criteria of an AE or SAE w ill also be included in the project’s annual pr ogress reports to NIH . 
6.5 Definitions for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
6.5.1 Monitoring, Grading, Documentation, and Reporting of Adverse Events  
It is unlikely that the study protocol will lead to an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE). However, we have established procedures for dealing with these events. In the proposed study we will use the FDA definition of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). An adverse event is any undes irable experience, serious and non- serious, in a participant that may have a causal relationship 
with study participation. Symptoms or conditions present at or before the study that manifest themselves with the same intensity or frequency after study parti cipation will not be recorded as 
adverse events. At the time of each contact, all participants will be monitored for the development of 
adverse experiences. Any concerns will be immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_266387].  
6.5.2 Relationship to Participation 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_266388]: Definitely related, Probably related, Possibly related, Unlikely Related, and Unrelat ed. These definitions can be found at 
https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/guidance/adverse -event- reporting.  
6.5.3 Severity of Event  
The scale below will be used to estimate the grade of severity of the adverse event:  
• Grade 1 Mild : Transient or mild discomfort, no limitation of activity, no or minimal 
intervention/therapy required.  
• Grade 2 Moderate : Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or 
minimal intervention/therapy required.  
• Grade 3 Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
• Grade 4 Life –threatening: Extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance required; significant 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114956] (SAE)  
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   6.5.4 Expectedness  
Expected adverse events:  The study population consists of patients with advanced ALD (alcohol -related 
cirrhosis [compensated or decompensated] and acute alcoholic hepatitis) with recent alcohol use and 
minimal recent alcohol use tre atment involvement.  Such patients are expected to potentially have 
medical complications including, but not limited to, worsening liver disease, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, and acute kidney injury.  These adverse events are unlikely to be related to the intervention.  Study staff may become aware of these complications during review of 
medical charts, or from participant self- report  during follow up assessments.  
[ADDRESS_324287] udy data will be maintained in HIPAA -
compliant study and/or password -protected databases which are accessible only to project personnel 
and whose access is restricted based on role and responsibility.   
Files used in data analysis will not have any identifying information in them – just randomly assigned ID 
numbers. All paper data will be filed in locked cabinets inside locked rooms that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_266389]. No patient identifiable information will be released or published wit hout 
written permission un less required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].  
7.2 Data Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator (PI), [CONTACT_266417], ultimately will be responsible for monitoring the data safety and quality with involvement from all of the study investigators. Data will be collected using standardized paper or online forms.  Quality control and reliability of screening, baseline and follow -up 
assessments will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mellinger throughout the trial via regular meetings and observation o f the research staff conducting standardized assessments and throughout the study via 
regular meetings. Drs. Mellinger and Blow will monitor the quality of the data files via supervision of the data manager and through the use of regular audits and data qu eries.  
 The MAIN -ART behavioral tool itself does not collect any PHI.  Only numerical age (no dates) and gender 
are collected.  Responses to questions within the tool are stored in a secure environment which meets requirements set by [CONTACT_266409].  Additional demographic and chart review data is collected separately and stored in secure password protected files as noted above.  The MAIN -ART tool has been approved for use for research purposes by [CONTACT_266410].   
 Data will be entered in the computer independently by [CONTACT_208392], and discrepancies will be corrected by a supervisor, based on source documents. The quality of the data will be monitored throughout the study. Data will be analyzed using a  data analysis program, such as Stata software. Data 
quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_266411].  
 In terms of delivery of the intervention, clinicians who will be delivering the interventions will receive standardized training in conducting them. Adherence to intervention techniques and protocols will be monitored with individual supervision. All clinicians will receive ongoing training. Post -intervention 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   evaluative interviews will be performed by [CONTACT_3647]. The qualitative interviews will be audio -
recorded. The audio -recordings of the sessions and interviews will be destroyed after the files are 
uploaded to a password- protected, secure server with restricted access. Once collected, participant data 
will remain confidential.  
 
Because of the small size of this study, no DSMB will be utilized. Data and safety monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] (Dr . Mellinger) and overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Blow.  
7.3 Entities conducting monitoring  
The Michigan Medicine IRB (IRBMED) will review this protocol and all procedures and will provide 
oversight.  Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_978], men tors, and IRBMED.  
7.4 What is monitored?  
Monitoring is done of all procedures to ensure that they conform to approved protocol; of unforeseen 
circumstances that might arise and affect safety; of all reports of serious adverse events as defined in 38 CFR 46 (death, new prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
congenital anomaly/birth defect); of other significant adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by [CONTACT_3445], termination by [CONTACT_093], termination or reduction of treatment); of unexpe cted adverse events resulting from the study; and of expected adverse events.  
7.[ADDRESS_324288] staff adhere to the IRB policies 
including: (1) all participants will understand, agree to, and  sign a written consent form before 
participating; (2) strict adherence to a participant’s  right to withdraw or refuse to answer questions will 
be maintained; (3) the assessments  will be completely confidential; (4) consent forms w ill be kept 
separately from the  actual participant data; (5) identifying information will be  kept locked at all times 
and computer files will require passwords; (6) participants will be  informed in writing in the consent 
form how to contact [CONTACT_978], the pro ject manager, and  IRB office with any questions and/or concerns.  
 [CONTACT_85630] and [CONTACT_266417] will be responsible for providing training to all research staff working with 
participants with regard to procedures for managing issues that could arise  given the  patient population, 
including potential crisis situations and/or adverse events.   Specifically, this training will include 
information regarding evaluating warning signs of  distress that could occur as a result of the screening 
or assessment, and means of  addressing such issues and m inimizing distress. Such strategies will include  
maintaining an empathic response, a cknowledging the distress through reflection,  avoiding blame, 
processing in a non -blaming non -confrontational manner, intervening early, and eliciting or encouraging 
use of relaxation and cognitive calming strategies.   Crisis procedures, effective in previous projects 
conducted by [CONTACT_30967],  will also be utilized, including immediately paging Drs. Mellinger, 
Winder or Blow for consultation and conference call discussions with other investigators, as necessary.  
 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   In addition, staff will receive training from [CONTACT_85630] in crisis assessment and  management procedures in 
the event that participants reveal suicidal or homicidal  ideation, child physical/sexual abuse, or concerns 
about safety. These crisis procedures  will include a review of the study protocol regarding the limits of 
confidentiality, how to  liaison with University of Michigan staff (i.e., emergency department) to arrange 
for an  assessment, circumstances in which it may be necessary to notify authorities regarding  intent to 
harm self or others, and the development of safety plans and resources. Study  procedures also will 
include immediately paging [CONTACT_266417] in cases in which this may arise.  
 
Study staff will also be trained in safety procedures to ensure their own safety  when conducting follow -
ups interviews. The same crisis reporting procedures for staff safety concerns will apply in terms of immediately contact[CONTACT_266412]. Mell inger or Blow. As  part of our follow -up interview protocol, written 
safety procedures for conducting follow -ups, include informing other staff members about one’s 
whereabouts, positioning oneself to ensure a quick exit, if needed, and being appropriately a ssertive. All 
safety concerns regarding follow -up assessments will be reported immediately to Drs. Mellinger or Blow.  
 [CONTACT_266417] is responsible for reporting amendments to the protocol to the University of  
Michigan Institutional Review Board prior to implementation of any changes. The timing 
of the reporting of any adverse events to the IRB and DSMB by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mellinger will be  
dependent on the severity of the event, and whether such adverse events were expected (i.e., included in the informed consent). Any  SAE related to study intervention, will be reported to the IRB and DSMB 
according to their reporting guideline.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 Sample Size  
The sample size (N = 60 ) was primarily chosen to facilitate conclusions regarding study feasibility, 
acceptability, and provide experience with study protocol (e.g. recruitment, retention, assessment, and analysis ) in addition to preliminary data on the effectiveness of the intervention in improving alcohol use 
treatment engagement. Participant retention (n = 48 ; 80%) is achievable using methods utilized in 
mentor’s past research and described in the retention section. This study  is underpowered to detect  
effects. For this reason, hypothesis testing is considered ‘exploratory.’ Therefore, this study will 
primarily provide pragmatic information and experience with the study protocol to inform a fully -
powere d RCT.  
8.2 Data Preparation  
Prior to analyses,  we will examine patterns of missing data, research dropout, intervention fidelity, 
distributional properties of measures, and correlations among outcome measures. Given the small 
sample, we  will pay particular attention to data distribution and use transformations when appropriate.    
8.3 Data Analysis  
We will examine betw een group effects on alcohol treatment engagement using General Estimated 
Equations (GEE).   We expect balanced groups on key variables as a result of urn randomization but will 
test the following covariates for systematic effects on outcome; gender, age, degree of liver disease. 
These analyses will use regression modeling using GEE due to the correlated structure of our data from 
repeated measures at baseline and follow -up. The GEE methodology properly estimates the regression 
coefficient and variance of the regression coefficient when  correlated data are used in regression 
analysis will use all data available for participants including those subjects lost to attrition. Approp riate 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   distributions will be used based on the nature and distribution of the response variable. Relevant 
covariates will be included such as gender,  age, race/ethnicity, and degree of liver disease . 
8.3.[ADDRESS_324289] one session of either in -person or telehealth treatment with an 
addiction treatment professional (either inpatient or outpatient), in -person or telehealth attendance to  
at least 1 session of a community -based support group for alcohol cessation (such as Alcoholics 
Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Refuge Recovery, faith -based support group via religious organization, 
for example), one -on-one or group counseling with an addictio n treatment professional,  counseling with 
a religious leader (such as a pastor or priest) to address alcohol use) , etc. ). Our hypothesis is that 
patients who receive the MAIN -ART behavioral intervention will have greater engagement in AUD 
treatment compared to usual care.  
8.3.2 Qualitative Analysis  
All qualitative interviews will be digitally audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim using a HIPAA-
compliant transcription service. Transcripts and co des will be analyzed using MAXQDA  software. We will 
analyze data using applied thematic analysis.  Emerging themes and data interpretations will be used for intervention refinement.  
 
9 REGULATORY, ETHICAL AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Informed Consent Process  
Except for when identifying potential participants through  MiChart, data will be accessed and collected 
only with informed consent. Consent will be obtained in writing (either via paper or tablet) at the time 
of enrollment. Signed paper consents will be filed in a locked, confidential research file, or electronic ally 
on study provided tablet computers and stored in a secure database. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_266390]. Unique identification numbers will be assigned to participants who consent. All data forms will be coded with this number rather than with a name. Computer data files will be saved with passwords. Consent forms will be stored separately from other study data because they contain identifying information. Furthermore, we will receive a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH t o 
protect the confidentiality of our data from legal requests.  
9.2 Confidentiality and Privacy
 
To minimize the risk of breaches of confidentiality, every effort is made to ensure that study data are always confidential, and web- and paper -based data are store d to minimize the likelihood of information 
breach. Training of research staff will include information about the importance of confidentiality and techniques to maintain confidentiality of all information reported by [CONTACT_67036]. In addition, all research personnel will complete the required UM confidentially certification training.  
9.3 Future Use of Stored Data  
We will retain identifiers after study conclusion until publication of all results in order to provide the ability to confirm accuracy of data prior to publication.  After collection of study data, all identifiers will 
Protocol  v 2.0 
Behavior, Function & Pain CTSU   be stripped from research datasets and housed in separate password -protected files on secure UMich 
servers.  Only research staff will have access to identifiers.  
9.4 Quality Assurance & Quality Control  
Throughout the proposed research investigation, participants’ names and contact [CONTACT_266413] a secure,  restricted access,  password -protected database. Patient audio from intervention 
sessions and exit surveys will also be kept in a restricted access folder on a secure server.  All information collected will be accessible only to research staff who have completed and maintain mandatory training in the pro tection of human subjects (see 9.4.2)  
 Electronic data capture and database systems like REDCap  and/or Qualtrics  will be used to collect and 
house study related data and information (e.g. subject demographics, medical  details, study data, 
screening scores,  and level of study completion , etc .).  These systems use several methods to protect 
data from vulnerability and exploitation.  The study investigators will ensure that Research Assistants 
(RAs) and other study staff will only have access to the data and information they need to complete 
their work by [CONTACT_266414]  
 A project -specific Qualtrics site is protected with a researcher- designated login name [CONTACT_2383]. The 
site houses the surveys and compi[INVESTIGATOR_266391] r to a password protected  database 
on the D epartment of Medicine  secure network. There are systems in place that prevent the survey 
from being taken by [CONTACT_266415]. There are security precautions in place to protect against unauthorized access, but there is a small risk of unauthorized access. Information regarding Qualtrics security and privacy statements can be found at http://www.qualtrics.com/security -statement  
and http://www.qualtrics.com/privacy -s tatement. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_324290] practices; the investigators will keep 
current certifications up to date.  All members of the research team will also complete PEERRS training.   
All staff shall attend and successfully complete the University of Michigan Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_266392] [ADDRESS_324291] (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator will be responsible for knowing and adhe ring to the 
reviewing IRB requirements.

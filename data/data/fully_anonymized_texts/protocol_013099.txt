Trial  center(s):  
2 centers in the EU , 2 centers in the US , and 3 centers in Canada  
Planned trial period:  
First Patient First Visit: March [ADDRESS_588562] Visit: September 2017  Phase of Devel opment:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of dasiglucagon 
following subcutaneous ( s.c.) administration  compared with  s.c. GlucaGen in T1DM patients . 
The secondary objective is to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of repeated single doses of 
dasiglucag on following s.c. administration compared with s.c. GlucaGen in T1DM patients.  
Trial  design:  
This is a randomized, double -blind , parallel group trial comparing the immunogenicity of either  
dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administered to euglycemic T1DM patients. Patients will be randomized 
1:[ADDRESS_588563] 3 months from the day of the firs t dose to assess any immune response. A 
total of 90 patients are expected to complete  the trial. Handling, preparation and administration of trial 
medication will be done by [CONTACT_93400]. All trial assessments will be done by [CONTACT_460625].  However, exposure assessments and anti-drug antibody ( ADA) assessments will be 
performed by [CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical as say. 
Planned number of patient s: 
90 completed patients  (45 completed patients per treatment group) . Prematurely discontinued 
patients will be replaced in order to reach [ADDRESS_588564] blood drawn for 
the planned anti-drug antibody (ADA) analyses.  
Medical condition or disease under investigation:  
Given the role of the immune system in the pathog enesis of T1DM, the present trial is conducted in 
patients with T1DM. There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood 
glucose levels. Therefore, for the safety and well -being of the patients, they will not be brought into 
hypogly cemia  prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded 
from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded.  
Inclusion criteria:  
To be included in the trial, patients have to fulfi ll all of the following criteria:  
1. Informed consent obtained before any trial -related activities (trial -related activities are any 
procedure that would not have been performed during normal management of the patient)

Criteria for evaluation : 
Immunogenicity : 
Primary endpoint:  
• Overall ADA incidence  
This will be calculated as a percentage of the combined results of treatment -induced ADA -
positive patients and treatment -boosted ADA -positive patients and the total number of 
evaluable patients,  excluding baseline -positive patients without any samples available after 
drug administration.  
Key secondary endpoints:

negative at baseline  and ADA positive after drug administration and the total number of 
evaluable patients, excluding baseline positive patients without any samples available after 
drug administration.  
 Treatment -boosted ADA  
Incidence calculated as percentage of baseline ADA -positive patients with significant increases 
(≥5-fold) in ADA titer after drug administration and the total number of evaluable patients, 
excluding baseline -positive patients without any samples available after drug administration.  
Secondary endpoints:  
Characterization of ADA response:  
 Incidence and titer of neutralizing activity of ADA positive patients  
 Incidence of cross -reactivity of ADA positive patients towards endogenous glucagon

 Plasma glucose profiles over the period from 0 -90 min after dosing will be evaluated 
based on the following endpoints: AUE 0-30min, AUE 0-90 min, CEmax, tmax 
Statistical methods:  
All statistical ana lysis will be descriptive. Continuous variables will be summarized with means, 
standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums , and valid cases. Other summaries (e.g. 
quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. Categorical variabl es will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_460629] s in corresponding categories.  
 
Sample size calculation:  
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon, when used as a rescue therapy fr om severe hypoglycemia and with reference to the 
immunogenic potential of GlucaGen. The sample size is based on generating data to show that the 
90% confidence of the ADA incidence is no worse than 15% as the predefined acceptability criterion 
and with a r eference to similar data being generated for GlucaGen.  
Currently, no ADA  incidences have been detected in the completed clinical trials, where up to [ADDRESS_588573] been administered to the same patient s within a week. Across 
the two  phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, a 
total of [ADDRESS_588574] been  observed. The obtained data indicate that dasiglucagon has a lo w risk for induction of 
ADAs in the investigated settings and as a consequence the sample size is based on showing that 
the ADA incidence is no worse than the predefined margin of 15%.

of treatment of diabetes mellitus with especially insulin or sulfonylureas. It is more frequent in 
patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency, such as occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment of T2DM with insulin causes 
hypoglycemia progressively and more frequently over time, whereas in T1DM, hypoglycemia is 
experienced throughout the course of established disease. 
Symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific. Patients undergoing a hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_460616], sweating, hunger, tremors, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], paresthesia, nausea and pallor. Depending on its severity, the hypoglycemia may 
lead to mild confusion, behavioral changes, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, and death.2  
The incidence of hypoglycemic events or even the fear of hypoglycemia influences patients’ 
adherence to prescribed treatment regimens for diabetes mellitus. This leads to inadequate 
glycemic control, which in turn may lead to an increased risk of diabetic complications. 
Glucagon 
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone, secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic 
islets. Glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and is the 
counterpart of insulin for controlling blood glucose levels (i.e. i t acts in opposition to insulin in 
terms of effects on blood glucose levels). Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and 
gluconeogenesis in hypoglycemic states, thereby [CONTACT_93406]. Glucagon 
receptor agonism has also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, 
body adipose tissue mass and food intake. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and cases of 
hypoglycemia can be reversed by [CONTACT_41148]. Therefore, glucagon is indicated for the treatment 
of severe hypoglycemia.  
Antibodies against therapeutic peptides like glucagon and analogues hereof may develop when 
injected subcutaneously. Although important, glucagon is not considered to have a critical 
endogenous function since other counter regulatory hormones are also induced during 
hypoglycemia (e.g. growth hormone, cortisol, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). In addition, results from [ADDRESS_588583] conﬁrmed that 
glucagon action is dispensable for their development and survival. Also, in non-clinical toxicity 
studies performed with dasiglucagon (see below), no consequences of ADA formation have 
currently been observed. In summary, glucagon appears to have a partly redundant 
endogenous function. These non-clinical data are of importance when evaluating the 
consequences of ADA formation. 
Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon (ZP4207 ) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a ready- to-
use liquid formulation and is in development for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in insulin 
dependent patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon receptor 
agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and elimination 
(minutes). It is a peptide of 29 amino acids, with 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native 
glucagon. The main purpose of the substitutions is to increase the physical and chemical 
stability of the glucagon analog compared to marketed glucagon products such as Lilly 
Glucagon or GlucaGen®. Dasiglucagon exhibits improved physical and chemical stability and is 
available in an aqueous solution at neutral pH.3

comparable to 0.5 mg GlucaGen (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.8167; 1.0068) and 0.6 mg 
dasiglucagon was comparable to 1.0 mg GlucaGen (90% CI: 0.8850; 1.1991).3 At these dose 
levels, the total exposures (AUC 0-inf) were higher for dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen. 
At all dose levels in the phase [ADDRESS_588587]

[ADDRESS_588589] of glucagon agonism. All 
adverse events (AEs) recorded in the trials were of mild or moderate severity. The most 
frequently reported systemic AE was nausea, which is a known side effect following 
administration of glucagon. Headache was the next most frequently reported event, occurring in 
all dose groups in the phase 2 trial. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after 
administration with either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® and all were mild and transient. The most 
frequent injection site reaction was erythema, occurring in all treatment groups, including the 
placebo group, irrespective of dose. Therefore, the phase 1 and 2 results and the safety profile 
described to date do not give rise to specific safety concerns. For further information, please 
refer to the Investigator Brochure.3  
Immunogenicity of dasiglucagon  
To date, in the 3 clinical trials performed with dasiglucagon (described above), there have not 
been any anti-drug antibody (ADA) occurrences in a total of 141 subjects exposed to 1 or more 
doses. Data from the non-clinical toxicology program (7 non-clinical toxicity studies) show ed that 
ADAs were detected in mice, rats, and dogs, and were most frequent in animals in the highest 
dasiglucagon dose groups. A fraction of the ADAs from rats and dogs were able to cross-react 
with native glucagon. However, the ADAs did not appear to be associated with changes in the 
safety or toxicity profiles compared to ADA-negative animals. In rats, the average exposure 
(AUC) was increased following 13 and 26 weeks of treatment in dose groups with higher ADA 
frequency ( 8 mg/kg/day). The ADA frequency and titers of consistently ADA-positive rats were 
reduced from [ADDRESS_588590] with glucagon.3

18 Jan 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17/[ADDRESS_588591] a partially redundant endogenous function since hypoglycemia can also be corrected by 
[CONTACT_11174]. The overall immunogenicity risk of dasiglucagon in a clinical context is therefore 
considered to be low and the potential effects of induced ADAs judged to be of limited clinical 
consequence.  
As dasiglucagon contains 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native glucagon and historic 
data indicate that the immune system’s tolerance to glucagon can be impaired in the intended 
target population, there is an inherent risk for the induction of an ADA response against 
dasiglucagon. However, other product specific characteristics, i.e. dasiglucagon being a 
chemical synthetized product without host cell contaminants, a reduced potential for 
aggregation, a physiological compatible formulation, and a high bioavailability with a short half-
life, are all in favor of reducing the risk of dasiglucagon to induce an unwanted immune 
response. Considering the intended indication, in which dasiglucagon is administered as a 
single-dose rescue treatment on an infrequent basis (0.21 to 1.6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_460618]),4,[ADDRESS_588592] their safety and/or efficacy. Both transient and persistent antibody 
response should be combined to determine the overall immunogenicity of a product. Persistent 
antibodies are of importance since patients with persistent antibodies could experience clinical 
adverse reactions affecting safety and efficacy, while a transient antibody response can resolve 
without further consequence. 
The present trial aims to evaluate that immunogenicity risk with an assessment of the 
occurrence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs, and of cross-reactivity with native glucagon, 
following repeated single doses of dasiglucagon by s.c. administration in T1DM patients. The 
comparator in this trial is GlucaGen, a recombinant human glucagon approved for the treatment 
of the severe hypoglycemic reactions that may occur in the management of insulin-treated 
children and adults with diabetes mellitus .

limited degree in the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon. As with every novel drug 
substance, new and as yet unknown side effects also may occur.  
There are limited data available to assess the immunogenic potential of glucagon products 
available on the market, but the data available indicate that marketed glucagon only has a small

18 Jan 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18/48 immunogenic potential. Based on the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon to date 
(see Section 5.2), no anti-dasiglucagon or anti-glucagon antibodies have been detected.  
In relation to diabetes therapy, development of insulin-antibodies is documented more 
substantially and the route of administration has been shown to influence the immunogenic 
potential of insulins. However, antibodies against insulin do not generally have an impact on 
insulin action and are thus not clinically relevant. In terms of consequence, development of high 
titer antibodies against dasiglucagon could, in theory reduce the activity of endogenous 
glucagon, which, in theory , could influence hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Limited suppression of 
glucagon would, however, not be considered critical, since low glucose levels can also be 
corrected by [CONTACT_11174], including oral intake of glucose and the action of other endogenous 
hormones such as oxyntomodulin and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. 
Overall, dasiglucagon is judged to be a low-risk molecule, based upon the available clinical data 
as well as the outcome of the risk-based approach to the immunogenicity assessment. In line 
with the primary objective of this trial to assess the immunogenicity of dasiglucagon, sampling 
for measurement of antibodies against dasiglucagon will take place prior to first dosing (Visit 2), 
pre-dose at subsequent visits during the treatment period (Visits 3 and 4), and at all Follow-up 
visits (at 35, 60, and [ADDRESS_588594] dose of trial medication ; i.e. at Visits 5 , 6, and 7 
(End of Trial [EoT] visit), respectively).  
Administration of dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions similar to 
those observed for other therapeutic peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected 
allergies to the trial medications or related products will be excluded from the trial. Mild or 
moderate allergic reactions may include symptoms of rash, fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, 
headache, and myalgia. Acute generalized hypersensitivity reactions are usually very rare but 
may include symptoms of flushing, sweating, dizziness, change in blood pressure and 
difficulties in breathing. No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the [ADDRESS_588595] access to resuscitation equipment is ensured 
at the clinical trial sites. 
With the exception of medical examinations, a patient participating in this trial is not likely to 
derive any personal health-related benefits. The results of the trial may contribute to the future 
use of dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing severe hypoglycemic 
reactions. 
Overall, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering the ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] trial is considered 
acceptable.

7.1 Overall trial design and plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing the immunogenicity of 3 fixed 
doses of either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administered to euglycemic T1DM patients.  
Patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 to receive 3 s.c. injections of either dasiglucagon 
(0.6 mg) or GlucaGen (1 mg), with [ADDRESS_588597] dose to assess any immune response. Patients with 
previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded from the trial, but the information on 
previous glucagon administration will be recorded to enable subgroup analyses . A total of 
90 patients are expected to participate in and complete the trial (45 in each treatment arm) . To 
qualify as completed, the patient must be dosed according to protocol and have blood drawn for 
the ADA analyses (as scheduled in  
). Prematurely discontinued patients will be replaced in order to reach [ADDRESS_588598] reach a target plasma glucose level 
of 70- 150 mg/dL.  
The trial will include the following periods (as illustrated in Figure 7-1 , below). 
 A screening period from Day -30 to Day -3 
 A treatment period, from Day 0 (day of randomization) to Day 14 (day of third and final 
dosing with trial medication), with s.c. trial medication administered on Day 0, Day 7, and 
Day 14. Handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be done by 
[CONTACT_93400]. A ll trial assessments will be done by [CONTACT_93401].  
 A follow-up period, from the end of the Treatment Period, with follow-up visits at Day 35, 
Day 60, and Day 104 (the EoT visit) 
Time windows for each trial visit are given in  
.

18 Jan 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21/48 7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups 
The trial will be randomized and double-blind to increase trial validity and to reduce bias during 
evaluation of assessments with the two treatments. Since the 2 trial medications are not 
identical in appearance (dasiglucagon is a liquid formulation and GlucaGen is available as a 
powder for reconstitution), the handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be 
done by [CONTACT_460630]. All trial assessments performed at the trial site will be done by [CONTACT_460625]. However, exposure assessments and ADA assessments will be performed by 
[CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen 
administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.    
Euglycemic patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 in order to evaluate the immunogenicity 
of dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, 
with administration of 3 fixed consecutive doses of randomized trial medication (dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen) to the same patient will allow characterization of immunogenic potential and a 
relative comparison of immunogenicity between the 2 products. Treatment with the 3 repeated 
doses (each separated by 1 week), with follow-up visits at Days 35 (where potential immune 
responses are known to be most pronounced), and at [ADDRESS_588599] dose 
(following the patient for 2-3 antibody half-lives after expected peak titer), is deemed relevant 
and sufficient for evaluating any immunogenic response to treatment. Patients that test positive 
for ADA will be monitored until the ADA levels return to baseline, and samples from the ADA 
positive patients will be tested for neutralizing potential in an Nab (neutralizing antibody) assay. 
Dasiglucagon and GlucaGen will be administered at fixed doses independent of body weight 
because this is the intended therapeutic dosing regimen in the emergency treatment of 
hypoglycemia. The selected dose of 1 mg GlucaGen is the recommended dose for treatment of 
severe hypoglycemia. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that 
0.6 mg of dasiglucagon results in an initial pharmacodynamic response (i.e. acute glucose 
mobilization) comparable to 1 mg GlucaGen (see also Section 5.1).  
For the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into hypoglycemia prior to 
dosing. However, very high blood glucose levels at dosing will potentially impact the reporting of 
nausea and other associated AE’s. Therefore, to enable a more precise safety assessment, 
patients are required to be dosed while at a normal blood glucose level, and a pre-treatment 
plasma glucose level of 70- 150 mg/dL will be targeted. Plasma glucose levels may be adjusted 
by s.c. administration of a fast-acting insulin analog or by [CONTACT_460628]. Even with this 
precaution, it cannot be excluded that a higher frequency of nausea may be anticipated, if this 
AE is caused by [CONTACT_460631].  
The safety profile described to date does not give rise to specific safety concerns. In previous 
studies, dasiglucagon was associated with the AE ’s nausea, a known side effect following 
administration of glucagon, headache, and injection site reactions (erythema).  
7.3 Selection of trial population 
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Given 
the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial aims to evaluate 
the immune response of patients with T1DM taking repeated single doses of s.c. dasiglucagon 
compared to GlucaGen .  
There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood glucose levels, 
therefore, for the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into a 
hypoglycemic state prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not 
be excluded from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be 
recorded to enable subgroup analyses. 
The trial will enroll patients in centers in the EU, in the US, and in Canada .

the amount of missing data. This treatment can also be instituted immediately after the second 
dose administration (Visit 3), as pharmacodynamics will not be assessed at this visit.  
The following treatment modalities may be used, as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_093]:  
 patients will be allowed to eat and drink moderately to make them feel comfortable 
 a moderate and individualized corrective dose of insulin to convert the induced 
hyperglycemia to euglycemia, after agreement with the investigator 
 antiemetic treatment e.g. in the form of a n 8-mg slow intravenous (i.v.) dose of 
ondansetron (Zofran®) or alternatively a 10-mg slow i.v. dose of metoclopramide 
(Primperan®)  
Patients must be monitored for at least 5 h after dosing at the clinical site for safety 
observations, including blood glucose monitoring.  
Patients will not be discharged until they are considered stable and with a blood glucose level in 
the range of 70-180 mg/dL. Before discharge, the investigator will provide instructions to the 
patients on management of their blood glucose levels. Each trial medication will be administered 
s.c. 3 times in total, with 7 days between dosing (i.e. dosing occurs at Days 0, 7, and 14; Visits 
2, 3, and 4) .  
7.4.3  Selection of doses in the trial 
The selected dose of 1 mg GlucaGen is the recommended dose for treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that 0.6 mg 
of dasiglucagon results in an initial pharmacodynamic response (i.e. acute glucose mobilization) 
comparable to [ADDRESS_588610] given written 
informed consent will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen via an 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) that will assign a kit number to one of the 2 
aforementioned treatment arms. 
Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded from the trial, but the 
information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded, to enable subgroup analyses .  
In the event of an emergency, e.g., when it becomes necessary for the investigator to know 
which treatment the patient is taking, the code for that patient can be broken by [CONTACT_093] , 
preferably after consultation with the medical monitor. Emergency code breaks can be 
performed using the IWRS. 
7.4.6  Blinding 
This is a double-blind trial. Since dasiglucagon is available as a liquid formulation and GlucaGen 
is available as a powder for reconstitution, and they are therefore not identical in appearance, 
unblinded trial personnel will be responsible for handling, preparing, and administering the trial 
medication. To maintain double-blind conditions, all trial assessments at the trial site will be 
done by [CONTACT_460637]. However, 
exposure assessments and ADA assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_460638], to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administration is matched 
with the applicable bioanalytical assay.

[IP_ADDRESS]  will be determined using standard methods. 
The total volume of blood sampled per patient for safety analyses is 68 mL. 
7.6 Immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, tolerability and safety 
measurements 
Details of sampling for immunogenicity testing, plasma glucose concentrations, plasma trial 
medication concentrations , and safety laboratory testing are provided in a laboratory manual 
(see the Investigator site file).  
7.6.[ADDRESS_588623] dasiglucagon/glucagon will be measured at all visits after screening. During 
the treatment period (Visits 2, 3, and 4) samples will be collected pre-dose.  
The clinical ADA assays have been validated in accordance with existing guidelines and 
recommendations.6,7,8,9,10  
Confirmed positive anti- dasiglucagon antibody samples, (treatment-induced or treatment-
boosted) from anti-dasiglucagon antibody-positive patients will be evaluated for binding titer 
neutralizing potential and titer as well as cross-reactivity towards endogenous glucagon.  
No further serum sampling will be needed as the ADA samples can be used for Nab analysis. 
The in vitro neutralizing effect of antibodies will be measured using an assay9,12 based on 
glucagon receptor transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The calculated sensitivity in 
previous studies was about 51.8 ng/mL. The assay was also validated for recombinant glucagon 
with similar results.11,[ADDRESS_588624] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_460639], further investigation may be performed by [CONTACT_460640]. 
Residual and additional antibody serum samples may be stored until approval of market 
authorization by [CONTACT_93420]. Further characterization of the antibody response may be 
requested by [CONTACT_93420]. 
7.6.2  Plasma concentrations of dasiglucagon and GlucaGen  
The exposure to trial medication (dasiglucagon or GlucaGen) will be assessed based on plasma 
concentration data (AUC 0-30min , AUC 0-90 min , C max, tmax) from samples collected at Visits 2 and 4 
(after administration of the first and third doses of trial medication) .  
Samples will be collected p re-dose, and at 5, 10, 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_588625]-dosing. The actual 
time of blood sampling for exposure should not deviate from the nominal time by [CONTACT_726] ±1

QT intervals.   
8. Adverse events 
8.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient administered an investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP.  
Note: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the 
informed consent.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
18 Jan 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32/48 AEs include: 
 A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. 
 A clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. any abnormality that 
suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active 
management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for 
example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. 
 Hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (see Section 8.4) 
 Injection site reactions 
The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded at screening (on Screening Form or 
CRF): 
 Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the informed 
consent. 
 Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures (pre-existing conditions 
should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). 
Serious adverse event (SAE) 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 results in death  
 is life-threatening  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 is medically important 
Medical judgement must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to be 
‘medically important’. Medically important event may not be immediately life-threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467]. 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
An AE, fulfilling one of the criteria of seriousness and being assessed as related to IMP 
application, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable reference 
document (e.g. ZP4207 IB3 or package leaflet/SmPC for an approved product such as 
GlucaGen13). 
Intensity of an adverse event 
The maximum intensity (severity) of all AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_460641]. Severity should be graded when the AE outcome is known: 
Mild:  A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living. 
Moderate :  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant. 
Severe :  A type of adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
18 Jan 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33/48 A ‘severe’ reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as ‘serious’ and a SAE may not be 
‘severe’ in nature. 
Causality relationship to trial medication 
The causality of each AE should be assessed by [CONTACT_460642]: 
Probable: Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. 
Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. 
Unlikely: The event is most likely related to etiology other than the trial product. 
Not related :  No relationship to trial product 
Outcome of an adverse event 
The outcome of all AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_460643]/her staff. 
The following definitions should be used: 
Recovered/resolved :  The patient has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_460644]-related activity after the patient signed the 
informed consent.  
Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the patient is expected to 
recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the 
patient has completed the trial. 
Recovered/resolved with sequelae :  The patient has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or 
procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE 
must be reported as an SAE. 
Not recovered/ not resolved :  The condition of the patient has not improved and the 
symptoms are unchanged. 
Fatal :  This term is only applicable if the patient died from a 
condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other 
reported AEs in a patient before he/she died should be 
assessed as "recovered/resolved", "recovering/resolving", 
"recovered/ resolved with sequelae" or "not recovered/not 
resolved". An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as 
an SAE. 
Unknown :  This term is only applicable if the patient is lost to follow-
up. 
8.[ADDRESS_588628] with the site (visit or telephone, excluding safety 
visits, where the patient is not seeing the Investigator or his staff (e.g. visits to the laboratory)) 
the patient must be asked about AEs. All AEs, either observed by [CONTACT_460645], must be recorded by [CONTACT_460646]. 
The Investigator should record the diagnosis, if possible. If no diagnosis can be made the 
Investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs. 
All AEs must be recorded by [CONTACT_737]. One single Adverse Event Form must be used per 
AE from start to resolution. For SAEs, the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be completed.

Competent Authorities and IRBs/IECs in accordance with the local requirements in force and 
ICH guideline for GCP. The trial monitor must be informed accordingly. 
8.3 Follow-up of adverse events 
All AEs that are ongoing at the end of the patient’s participation in the study will be followed-up 
until the event is resolved or reaches a satisfactory outcome as deemed by [CONTACT_737].  
Follow-up actions for all SAEs will be performed according to appropriate clinical care practices 
and may depend on the nature of the event. These will be determined after internal review 
and/or sponsor review. 
The follow up information should only include new (updated and/or additional) information that 
reflects the situation at the time of the Investigator’s signature. 
Follow- up information on (S)AEs will be updated using the (S)AE Form. If a non-serious event 
becomes serious during the follow-up the AE Form and SAE Form have to be used and 
reporting timelines follow those of a SAE.

new information. 
8.4 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia will be regarded as an AE and recorded and documented on an AE Form. 
Hypoglycemia is defined as a fall of plasma glucose below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 
During the dosing visits, mild to moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia, or a blood glucose ( BG) 
value less than a threshold of <2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL), corresponding to a plasma glucose ( PG) 
value of <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), will be treated by i.v. glucose solution at the investigator’s 
discretion according to best available medical practice. Treatment is to be repeated until BG 
value stabilized above the threshold limit again. BG measurements will only be done due to 
safety concerns. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia should be recorded as an AE. 
8.[ADDRESS_588630] be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if their partner becomes 
pregnant or suspects to be pregnant. The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome 
of all pregnancies reported during the clinical trial. During an information meeting at the trial site, 
the patient’s partner will be fully informed by a physician of her participation in capturing th e 
outcome data, and will be asked to provide her written consent. 
The Investigator must report all information on pregnancies on the initial pregnancy form. The 
completed initial pregnancy form must be forwarded to the Sponsor according to the procedure 
stated in Section 8.2. Any (S)AEs in the mother, as well as other pregnancy complications 
(ectopic pregnancy) fulfilling the criteria of an (S)AE, must be reported on the (S)AE form.  
The following must be collected in the initial pregnancy form:  
 Medical history of the mother 
 Family history 
 Course of the pregnancy, including expected delivery date 
The Investigator must follow the pregnancy until the pregnancy outcome and the newborn 
infant(s) until the age of [ADDRESS_588631] information on the pregnancy 
and pregnancy complications as well as the pregnancy outcome including the health of the 
newborn infant(s) on the pregnancy outcome form. The completed pregnancy outcome form

the patients. During a patient’s participation in the trial, the Investigator should ensure that 
adequate medical care is provided to the patients for any AEs, including clinically significant 
laboratory values related to the trial. The Investigator should inform the patient when medical 
care is needed for intercurrent illnesses of which the Investigator becomes aware.  
For further information on safety precautions for ZP4207 and GlucaGen, please refer to the 
current version of the Investigator’s Brochure3 and the SmPC for GlucaGen13, respectively. 
8.7 Safety Committee 
The internal Zealand Pharma Safety Committee (SC) is constituted to perform ongoing safety 
surveillance of clinical trials with dasiglucagon, including this trial. 
If safety signals are observed, either based on reported SAEs, periodic review of laboratory 
parameters, review of all AEs reported between the SC meetings, or on notification of significant 
findings, the SC will take appropriate measures to safeguard the patients .  
The SC convenes every quarter to review relevant safety information, including AEs and 
laboratory data.

9.1 Case report forms 
All the information collected during the trial will be recorded in the eCRFs, which are identified 
by [CONTACT_56324]. Suitable eCRFs will be designed by [CONTACT_460648]. The investigator will 
ensure that the eCRFs are correctly completed. All key pages will be signed or initialed by [CONTACT_1275], signifying agreement with and responsibility for the recorded data. Key pages are 
the following: end- of-visit form, AE-reporting form, medication form, concomitant medication 
form an d trial-closure form.  
A trial specific list should be generated prior to the performance of the trial, which specifies 
which data fields in the Case Report Form will be used by [CONTACT_460649]. This means that these data fields in the CRF are source 
documents. For the other CRF data fields, the source data will be found in other documents 
(such as patients’ files, worksheets, etc.), that is, for these CRF data fields the “other” 
documents are the source documents. Should such a list be created, it should be submitted to 
the authorities together with the protocol.  
9.[ADDRESS_588633] access to source data /documents. Sponsor-authorized quality assurance 
personnel may carry out audits for which the investigator must provide support. 
The trial will be supervised by a monitor from SynteractHCR. The trial monitor will contact [CONTACT_460650].  
The trial monitor or a representative of the sponsor will cross-check the data entered in the 
eCRFs with the source data at the trial site and observe the trial procedures in order to verify 
adherence to the trial protocol. 
The eCRFs will be checked for completeness and correctness by [CONTACT_460651]. 
All of the clinical data will be captured via electronic data capture (EDC) using a web-based tool. 
The software Marvin from the company XClinical (www.xclinical.com/) is the preferred ED C 
software. Marvin is compliant with all legislation relevant to electronic data capture (FDA 21 
CFR Part 11, GCP). 
The investigator site staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access 
features (username [CONTACT_2383]). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The 
investigator will approve the data using an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11), and this 
approval is used to confirm the accuracy of the data recorded. 
eCRFs will be used for all patients. The investigator’s data will be accessible from the 
investigator’s site throughout the trial. The electronic CRFs must be kept current to reflect 
patient status at each phase during the course of the trial. The electronic CRF will not capture 
personalized data. The investigator must make a separate confidential record of personalized 
details (name [CONTACT_93459]) on the patient identification and enrollment log. All changes to data 
are done by [CONTACT_460652].  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460620]’s eCRF are also 
made on the patient’s medical records. 
The eCRFs for any patient leaving the trial should be completed at the time of the final visit or 
shortly thereafter.

10.1 Statistical and analysis plan 
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized that details the planned statistical 
analysis and may include necessary adaptations to the planned statistical analysis before 
unblinding of the data.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
trial report. 
10.1.1 General considerations 
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and summarized with 
statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all data collected 
up to that time point will be included into the analysis. 
Raw data listings and summary tables will be generated using the software SAS© Version [ADDRESS_588634] deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. 
Categorical efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_460653].  
10.1.2 Classification of patients to subsets 
For the statistical analysis the randomized patients will be divided up into the following datasets: 
The following definitions are applicable: 
Safety analysis set 
(SAS)  all patient s who were randomized and received at  least one dose of 
trial medication  
Full analysis set  
(FAS)  all patient s of the SA S with at least one measurement of the ADA 
titer 
Per Protocol set 
(PPS)  all patient s of the FA S for whom no relevant protocol deviations 
were documented  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. A secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint will be based on the PPS. Safety analysis will be based on the SAS. 
The decision whether a protocol deviation is relevant or not for the exclusion of patients from th e 
PPS set will be made case- by-case in a data review meeting. 
10.1.3 Immunogenicity data 
All immunogenicity parameters will be analyzed descriptively per treatment group. No statistical 
tests are planned. Baseline ADA-positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total 
number of patients whose baseline samples were tested for ADA. Titer will be reported as 
median and interquartile range. 
95% confidence intervals for incidence rates and for rate differences will be given. 
Secondary immunogenicity parameters will be described with appropriate descriptive statistics 
for dichotomous, categorical or continuous variables.

respective reference range. The number of values outside of the reference range will be 
counted. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after 
medical coding using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AE summary 
tables will include counts and percentages of patients who experienced adverse events 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). 
Other safety data 
Vital signs, physical examination, ECG and local tolerability data will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
10.1.6 Further data 
Baseline and demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Baseline ADA-
positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total number of patients whose 
baseline samples were tested for ADA.  
All other data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRF will be listed. 
10.1.7 Withdrawals, drop-outs and missing data 
In the case of drop-outs, no imputation of values for immunogenicity measurements will be 
done. Analysis is done on valid cases only i.e. no imputation technique like LOCF (last 
observation carried forward) will be applied. 
10.1.8 Baseline and center comparisons 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared. 
10.1.9 Subgroup analysis 
No subgroup analysis is currently planned. 
10.1.10 Interim analysis 
No interim analysis is currently planned. 
10.2 Determination of sample size 
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon, when used as a rescue therapy from severe hypoglycemia and with reference to 
the immunogenic potential of GlucaGen. The sample size is based on generating data to show 
that the 90% confidence of the ADA incidence is no worse than 15% as the predefined 
acceptability criterion and with a reference to similar data being generated for GlucaGen.

Across the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 PK/PD trial, a total of [ADDRESS_588637] 
been observed. The obtained data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of 
ADAs in the investigated settings and as a consequence the sample size is based on showing 
that the ADA incidence is no worse than the predefined margin of 15%.

CONFIDENTIAL 
                             Page 7 of 26 
4 Changes and rationale: 
4.1 Clarification on the statistical method and anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
assays 
The primary objective has been updated to clarify that GlucaGen is considered a reference 
product and the objective of the trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of both dasiglucagon and 
GlucaGen. It has been specified that the ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, 
but specific for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, respectively. Hence, the performance of the 
assays are not directly comparable and a formal statistical comparison or non-inferiority testing 
is not performed. The rationale for the sample size calculation has been adapted accordingly. 
These clarifications have  been implemented throughout the protocol including the protocol title. 
The rationale for the update is to clarify that the trial is not a non-inferiority trial and no formal 
statistical testing will be performed. 
 
4.2 Update of exclusion criterion on blood pressure 
Exclusion criterion number 10 has been adjusted to exclude patients with a systolic blood 
pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg at screening. 
The rationale for narrowing the limit of allowed blood pressure values at screening is to only 
include patients of good health, apart from having type 1 diabetes, in the trial. 
 
4.3 Update of exclusion criterion on alcohol/drug abuse 
Exclusion criterion number [ADDRESS_588654] during the trial will be a withdrawal criteria. 
The rationale of the update is to ensure patients with a history or current abuse of alcohol 
and/or drugs are not included in the trial.  
 
4.4 Specification of prohibited concomitant medication 
An additional exclusion criterion has been added to exclude patients using any non-prescription 
or prescription drugs known to cause QT prolongation. It has further been specified that 
metoclopramide (Primperan®) is the only allowed antiemetic treatment that can be used at the 
dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4.  
The rationale for the addition is due to the sporadic QTcB changes post 
dasiglucagon/GlucaGen administration observed in the phase [ADDRESS_588655] dosing at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, 
and 4.  
 
 
ZP4207 -[ADDRESS_588656] dasiglucagon/GlucaGen 
administration observed in the phase 2 trial. The updated time points for ECG assessments are 
to cover the range of t max for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen at all three dosing visits. 
 
4.6 Monitoring of patients’ electrolyte levels 
It has been added to exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_588657] added 
Changes in blood pressure and/or pulse after dosing will be considered a clinical event of 
interest. Additional vital sign assessments have been added.  
The rationale for the addition is due to the nonclinical and clinical findings in healthy volunteers 
of hemodynamic changes with dasiglucagon. Due to these findings additional information on 
such events  will be captured in a specific form in the case report form.  
 
4.8 Treatment of patients experiencing hypo- or hyperglycemia prior dosing 
It has been specified that at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4, the investigator should 
administer corrective doses of insulin if a patient has a plasma glucose >150 mg/dL before 
dosing. Likewise if a patient has a plasma glucose <70 mg/dL before dosing glucose ingestion 
should be provided to the patient. 
The rationale for this addition is to clarify how the investigator should ensure patients have a 
plasma glucose level on 70-150mg/dL before dosing.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_588658] will be performed at the site 
prior dosing at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4.  
If a female patient becomes pregnant in the period between the screening visit and the last 
dosing visit, she must be discontinued from trial treatment.  
The rationale for the change is to ensure that patients who have become pregnant in the period 
following the screening visit are not exposed to trial medication. 
 
4.10 Additional visits required for patients discontinuing treatment 
prematurely 
A patient prematurely discontinuing treatment will be asked to attend all three follow up visits; 5, 
6, and 7, to have all follow up assessments performed. Only in case a patient withdraw consent 
or is excluded before exposure to trial product the follow up visits can be omitted. 
The rationale for this addition is to avoid missing data for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
 
 
ZP4207 -[ADDRESS_588659]. 
 
4.12 Specification of the requirements at the dosing visits 
The requirements for fasting at the dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4, have been specified. Further, the 
instructions to patients prior dosing have been made more clear. 
The rationale for the addition is to clarify the procedures around the dosing visits. 
 
4.13 Responsibility of unblinded trial personnel 
The responsibility of the unblinded trial personnel has been clarified.  
The rationale for the addition is to clarify the procedures to maintain the double blinding.  
 
4.14 Randomization of replacement patients 
Replacement patients will not necessarily be randomized to the same treatment as the patient 
they are replacing.  
The rationale is that it is not technically possible nor needed to assign the replacement patients 
to the same treatment as the patient they are replacing. 
 
4.15 Clarification to the reporting of (Serious) Adverse Events 
It has been clarified that the investigator only needs to send the SAE form to the 
Pharmacovigilance unit (Safety CRO). Further, the text has been updated to make it more 
simple. 
The rationale for the changes is to make the process for SAE reporting more simple and to 
make the text more clear.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_588660] been updated (changes also 
applicable for Appendix 1) 
 
[ADDRESS_588661] the actual changes in the protocol text reflecting both the original and the 
new wording.

Sample size calculation: 
Updated text: 
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. , when used as a rescue therapy form severe hypoglycemia and 
with reference to the immunogenic potential of GlucaGen. The sample size is based on 
generating data to show that the 90% confidence of the ADA incidence is no worse than 15% as 
the predefined acceptability criterion and with a reference to similar data being generated for 
GlucaGen. The ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, but specific for GlucaGen 
and dasiglucagon, respectively, and the performance of the assays are thus not directly 
comparable. As a consequence, a formal comparison or non-inferiority analysis will not be 
performed.   
Currently, no ADA incidences have been detected in the completed clinical trials, where up to [ADDRESS_588662] been administered to the same patients within a week. 
Across the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, a total of [ADDRESS_588663] been observed. The obtained data 
indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of ADAs in the investigated settings and 
as a consequence the sample size is based on showing that the ADA incidence is no worse 
than the predefined margin of 15%. a meaningful sample size to compare both treatments 
cannot be estimated. 
The sample size is therefore based on a certain precision of the confidence interval for the 
overall ADA incidence if no events are observed, respectively to ensure a certain probability for 
observing one event. 
When no events are observed, to obtain an upper bound of 0.050 on the 90.0% confidence 
interval for the probability of such a rare event, would require a sample size of 45. Respectively, 
accepting a chance of observing at least one event of 90% and an actual probability of the 
event of 5% leads to a sample size of 45 patients completing the trial. In order to account for 
drop-outs, It is expected that 112 patients in total will be randomized and treated. 
 
Section 5.2 Trial rationale 
Updated text: 
The present trial aims to evaluate that immunogenicity risk with an assessment of the 
occurrence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs, and of cross-reactivity with native glucagon, 
following repeated single doses of dasiglucagon by s.c. administration in T1DM patients. The 
reference product  comparator in this trial is GlucaGen, a recombinant human glucagon 
approved for the treatment of the severe hypoglycemic reactions that may occur in the 
management of insulin-treated children and adults with diabetes mellitus.  Given the differences 
in ADA assay for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, a formal statistical comparison or non-inferiority 
testing is not performed.

Primary objective 
 To evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of dasiglucagon and 
GlucaGen  following s.c. administration compared with s.c. GlucaGen in T1DM patients. 
 
Section 7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups 
Updated text: 
Euglycemic patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 in order to evaluate the immunogenicity 
of dasiglucagon and compared to GlucaGen. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group 
design, with administration of 3 fixed consecutive doses of randomized trial medication 
(dasiglucagon or GlucaGen) to the same patient will allow characterization of immunogenic 
potential for and a relative comparison of the immunogenicity between the 2 products. 
 
Section 7.3 Selection of trial population 
Updated text: 
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Given 
the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial aims to evaluate 
the immune response of patients with T1DM taking repeated single doses of s.c. dasiglucagon 
and compared to GlucaGen.

In this trial hemodynamic changes, as defined below, are considered clinical event of interest: 
 Post-dose clinical signs, or measured vital signs, indicating a clinical significant drop 
in blood pressure including signs of orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal responses or 
bradycardia 
 Post-dose change in pulse or blood pressure considered an event of hypo- or 
hypertension as judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
Section 8.2 Collection, recording and reporting of adverse events 
Updated text: 
All AEs must be recorded by [CONTACT_737]. One single Adverse Event Form must be used per 
AE from start to resolution. For SAEs, the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be completed. 
For clinical events of Interest, the Clinical Event of Interest Form must also be completed.  
AE information should include the following: 
 Date and time of onset and resolution 
 Date and time of Investigator’s first information on the (S)AE 
 Seriousness 
 Severity 
 Causal relationship with IMP 
 Interruption or withdrawal of treatment with IMP and other measures taken 
 Outcome 
All AEs are coded; details are described in the trial specific Data Management Plan.  
If an event classifies as a clinical event of interest, the Investigator must tick the Clinical Event 
of Interest box on the AE form and complete the Clinical Event of Interest Form. The Clinical 
Event of Interest Form will capture if the event was associated with any signs or symptoms and 
capture the highest/lowest blood pressure and pulse measured during the event.

5.16 Clarification on case report forms 
Section 9.1 Case report forms 
Updated text: 
All key pages will be signed or initialed by [CONTACT_093], signifying agreement with and 
responsibility for the recorded data. Key pages are the following: endofvisit form, AE-reporting 
form, trial medication form, concomitant medication form and tri al-closure form.  
Data directly captured in the eCRF (i.e., data assigned or calculated automatically by [CONTACT_25751]) is called e-source . A trial specific list should be generated prior to the performance of 
the trial, which specifies which data fields in the Case Report Form will be used by [CONTACT_460670]. This means that these data fields 
in the CRF are source documents. For the other CRF data fields, which are entered by [CONTACT_460671],  the source data will be found in other documents (such as patients’ 
files, worksheets, etc.), that is i.e. for these CRF data fields the “other” documents are the 
source documents. Should such a list be created, it should be submitted to the authorities 
together with the protocol.

4 Changes and rationale: 
4.1 Clarification on the statistical method and anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
assays 
The primary objective has been updated to clarify that GlucaGen is considered a reference 
product and the objective of the trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of both dasiglucagon and 
GlucaGen. It has been specified that the ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, 
but specific for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, respectively. Hence, the performance of the 
assays are not directly comparable and a formal statistical comparison or non-inferiority testing 
is not performed. The rationale for the sample size calculation has been adapted accordingly. 
These clarifications have  been implemented throughout the protocol including the protocol title. 
The rationale for the update is to clarify that the trial is not a non-inferiority trial and no formal 
statistical testing will be performed. 
 
4.2 Update of exclusion criterion on blood pressure 
Exclusion criterion number 10 has been adjusted to exclude patients with a systolic blood 
pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg at screening. 
The rationale for narrowing the limit of allowed blood pressure values at screening is to only 
include patients of good health, apart from having type 1 diabetes, in the trial. 
 
4.3 Update of exclusion criterion on alcohol/drug abuse 
Exclusion criterion number [ADDRESS_588700] during the trial will be a withdrawal criteria. 
The rationale of the update is to ensure patients with a history or current abuse of alcohol 
and/or drugs are not included in the trial.  
 
4.4 Specification of prohibited concomitant medication 
An additional exclusion criterion has been added to exclude patients using any non-prescription 
or prescription drugs known to cause QT prolongation. It has further been specified that 
metoclopramide (Primperan®) is the only allowed antiemetic treatment that can be used at the 
dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4.  
The rationale for the addition is due to the sporadic QTcB changes post 
dasiglucagon/GlucaGen administration observed in the phase [ADDRESS_588701] dosing at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, 
and 4.  
 
 
ZP4207 -[ADDRESS_588702] dasiglucagon/GlucaGen 
administration observed in the phase 2 trial. The updated time points for ECG assessments are 
to cover the range of t max for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen at all three dosing visits. 
 
4.6 Monitoring of patients’ electrolyte levels 
It has been added to exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_588703] added 
Changes in blood pressure and/or pulse after dosing will be considered a clinical event of 
interest. Additional vital sign assessments have been added.  
The rationale for the addition is due to the nonclinical and clinical findings in healthy volunteers 
of hemodynamic changes with dasiglucagon. Due to these findings additional information on 
such events  will be captured in a specific form in the case report form.  
 
4.8 Treatment of patients experiencing hypo- or hyperglycemia prior dosing 
It has been specified that at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4, the investigator should 
administer corrective doses of insulin if a patient has a plasma glucose >150 mg/dL before 
dosing. Likewise if a patient has a plasma glucose <70 mg/dL before dosing glucose ingestion 
should be provided to the patient. 
The rationale for this addition is to clarify how the investigator should ensure patients have a 
plasma glucose level on 70-150mg/dL before dosing.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_588704] will be performed at the site 
prior dosing at all three dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4.  
If a female patient becomes pregnant in the period between the screening visit and the last 
dosing visit, she must be discontinued from trial treatment.  
The rationale for the change is to ensure that patients who have become pregnant in the period 
following the screening visit are not exposed to trial medication. 
 
4.10 Additional visits required for patients discontinuing treatment 
prematurely 
A patient prematurely discontinuing treatment will be asked to attend all three follow up visits; 5, 
6, and 7, to have all follow up assessments performed. Only in case a patient withdraw consent 
or is excluded before exposure to trial product the follow up visits can be omitted. 
The rationale for this addition is to avoid missing data for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
 
 
ZP4207 -[ADDRESS_588705]. 
 
4.12 Specification of the requirements at the dosing visits 
The requirements for fasting at the dosing visits; 2, 3, and 4, have been specified. Further, the 
instructions to patients prior dosing have been made more clear. 
The rationale for the addition is to clarify the procedures around the dosing visits. 
 
4.13 Responsibility of unblinded trial personnel 
The responsibility of the unblinded trial personnel has been clarified.  
The rationale for the addition is to clarify the procedures to maintain the double blinding.  
 
4.14 Randomization of replacement patients 
Replacement patients will not necessarily be randomized to the same treatment as the patient 
they are replacing.  
The rationale is that it is not technically possible nor needed to assign the replacement patients 
to the same treatment as the patient they are replacing. 
 
4.15 Clarification to the reporting of (Serious) Adverse Events 
It has been clarified that the investigator only needs to send the SAE form to the 
Pharmacovigilance unit (Safety CRO). Further, the text has been updated to make it more 
simple. 
The rationale for the changes is to make the process for SAE reporting more simple and to 
make the text more clear.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_588706] been updated (changes also 
applicable for Appendix 1) 
 
[ADDRESS_588707] the actual changes in the protocol text reflecting both the original and the 
new wording. 
 
New wording is marked in underlined italics  and deleted wording is marked with strikethrough .

Statistical methods: 
Updated text: 
All statistical analysis will be descriptive  i.e. no formal statistical testing will be performed . 
Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums, and valid cases. 
 
Sample size calculation: 
Updated text: 
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. , when used as a rescue therapy form severe hypoglycemia and 
with reference to the immunogenic potential of GlucaGen. The sample size is based on 
generating data to show that the 90% confidence of the ADA incidence is no worse than 15% as 
the predefined acceptability criterion and with a reference to similar data being generated for 
GlucaGen. The ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, but specific for GlucaGen 
and dasiglucagon, respectively, and the performance of the assays are thus not directly 
comparable. As a consequence, a formal comparison or non-inferiority analysis will not be 
performed.   
Currently, no ADA incidences have been detected in the completed clinical trials, where up to [ADDRESS_588708] been administered to the same patients within a week. 
Across the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, a total of [ADDRESS_588709] been observed. The obtained data 
indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of ADAs in the investigated settings and 
as a consequence the sample size is based on showing that the ADA incidence is no worse 
than the predefined margin of 15%. a meaningful sample size to compare both treatments 
cannot be estimated. 
The sample size is therefore based on a certain precision of the confidence interval for the 
overall ADA incidence if no events are observed, respectively to ensure a certain probability for 
observing one event. 
When no events are observed, to obtain an upper bound of 0.050 on the 90.0% confidence 
interval for the probability of such a rare event, would require a sample size of 45. Respectively, 
accepting a chance of observing at least one event of 90% and an actual probability of the 
event of 5% leads to a sample size of 45 patients completing the trial. In order to account for 
drop-outs, It is expected that 112 patients in total will be randomized and treated. 
 
Section 5.2 Trial rationale 
Updated text: 
The present trial aims to evaluate that immunogenicity risk with an assessment of the 
occurrence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs, and of cross-reactivity with native glucagon, 
following repeated single doses of dasiglucagon by s.c. administration in T1DM patients. The 
reference product  comparator in this trial is GlucaGen, a recombinant human glucagon 
approved for the treatment of the severe hypoglycemic reactions that may occur in the 
management of insulin-treated children and adults with diabetes mellitus.  Given the differences 
in ADA assay for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, a formal statistical comparison or non-inferiority 
testing is not performed.

Primary objective 
 To evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of dasiglucagon and

Section 7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups 
Updated text: 
Euglycemic patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 in order to evaluate the immunogenicity 
of dasiglucagon and compared to GlucaGen. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group 
design, with administration of 3 fixed consecutive doses of randomized trial medication 
(dasiglucagon or GlucaGen) to the same patient will allow characterization of immunogenic 
potential for and a relative comparison of the immunogenicity between the 2 products. 
 
Section 7.3 Selection of trial population 
Updated text: 
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Given 
the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial aims to evaluate 
the immune response of patients with T1DM taking repeated single doses of s.c. dasiglucagon 
and compared to GlucaGen.

New text: 
Clinical event of interest 
A clinical event of interest is an event which, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus 
(e.g. required by [CONTACT_21652]). 
In this trial hemodynamic changes, as defined below, are considered clinical event of interest: 
 Post-dose clinical signs, or measured vital signs, indicating a clinical significant drop 
in blood pressure including signs of orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal responses or 
bradycardia 
 Post-dose change in pulse or blood pressure considered an event of hypo- or 
hypertension as judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
Section 8.2 Collection, recording and reporting of adverse events 
Updated text: 
All AEs must be recorded by [CONTACT_737]. One single Adverse Event Form must be used per 
AE from start to resolution. For SAEs, the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be completed. 
For clinical events of Interest, the Clinical Event of Interest Form must also be completed.  
AE information should include the following: 
 Date and time of onset and resolution 
 Date and time of Investigator’s first information on the (S)AE 
 Seriousness 
 Severity 
 Causal relationship with IMP 
 Interruption or withdrawal of treatment with IMP and other measures taken 
 Outcome 
All AEs are coded; details are described in the trial specific Data Management Plan.  
If an event classifies as a clinical event of interest, the Investigator must tick the Clinical Event 
of Interest box on the AE form and complete the Clinical Event of Interest Form. The Clinical 
Event of Interest Form will capture if the event was associated with any signs or symptoms and 
capture the highest/lowest blood pressure and pulse measured during the event.

Trial  center(s):  
2 centers in the EU , 2 centers in the US , and 3 centers in Canada  
Planned trial period:  
First Patient First Visit: May [ADDRESS_588742] Visit: November  2017  Phase of Development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of dasiglucagon  and 
GlucaGen following subcutaneous ( s.c.) administration  in T1DM patients . 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated single doses of 
dasiglucag on following s.c. administration compared with s.c. GlucaGen in T1DM patients.  
Trial  design:  
This is a randomized, double -blind , parallel group trial evaluating  the immunogenicity of either 
dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administered to euglycemic T1DM patients. Patients will be randomized 
1:[ADDRESS_588743] dose to assess any immune response. A 
total of 90 patients are expected to complete  the trial. Handling, preparation and administration of trial 
medication will be done by [CONTACT_93400]. All trial assessments will be done by [CONTACT_460625].  However, exposure assessments and anti-drug antibody ( ADA) assessments will be 
performed by [CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen administration is ma tched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.  
Planned number of patient s: 
90 completed patients  (45 completed patients per treatment group) . Prematurely discontinued 
patients will be replaced in order to reach [ADDRESS_588744] blood drawn for 
the planned anti-drug antibody (ADA) analyses.  
Medical condition or disease under investigation:  
Given the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial is conducted in 
patients with T1DM. There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood 
glucose levels. Therefore, for the safety and well -being of the pati ents, they will not be brought into 
hypoglycemia  prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded 
from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded.  
Inclusion criteria:  
To be included in the trial, patients have to fulfill all of the following criteria:  
1. Informed consent obtained before any trial -related activities (trial -related activities are any 
procedure that would not have been performed during normal management of the patient)  
2. Availabil ity for the entire trial period

 Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations from 0 -90 min after dosing will be 
evaluated based on the following endpoints: AUC 0-30min, AUC 0-[ADDRESS_588753] doses of trial medication:  
 Plasma glucose profiles over the period from 0 -90 min after dosing will be evaluated 
based on the following  endpoints: AUE 0-30min, AUE 0-90 min, CEmax, tmax 
Statistical methods:  
All statistical analysis will be descriptive  i.e. no formal statistical testing will be performed . Continuous 
variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums , 
and valid cases. Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as 
appropriate. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_460629] s in 
corresponding categories.  
 
Sample size calcu lation:  
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon  and GlucaGen . The ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, but specific 
for GlucaGen and dasiglucagon, respectively,  and  the performance of the assays are thus not 
directly comparable. As a consequence, a formal comparison or non -inferiority analysis will not be 
performed.  
Currently, no ADA  incidences have been detected in the completed clinical trials, where up to [ADDRESS_588754] been administered to the same patient s within a week. Across 
the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, a 
total of [ADDRESS_588755] been  observed. The obtained data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of 
ADAs in the investigated settings and as a consequence a meaningful sample size to compare both 
treatments cannot be estimated.  
The sample size is therefore based  on a certain precision of the confidence interval for the overall 
ADA incidence if no events are observed, respectively to ensure a certain probability for observing 
one event.  
When no events are observed, to obtain an upper bound of 0.050 on the 90.0% confidence interval 
for the probability of such a rare event, would require a sample size of 45.  Respectively, a ccepting a 
chance of observing at least one event of 9 0% and an actual probability of the event of 5% leads to a 
sample size of 45 patients  completing the trial . In order to account for drop -outs, It is expected that 
112 patients in total will be randomized and treated.

of treatment of diabetes mellitus with especially insulin or sulfonylureas. It is more frequent in 
patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency, such as occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment of T2DM with insulin causes 
hypoglycemia progressively and more frequently over time, whereas in T1DM, hypoglycemia is 
experienced throughout the course of established disease. 
Symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific. Patients undergoing a hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_460623] s such as anxiety, sweating, hunger, tremors, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], paresthesia, nausea and pallor. Depending on its severity, the hypoglycemia may 
lead to mild confusion, behavioral changes, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, and death.2  
The incidence of hypoglycemic events or even the fear of hypoglycemia influences patients’ 
adherence to prescribed treatment regimens for diabetes mellitus. This leads to inadequate 
glycemic control, which in turn may lead to an increased risk of diabetic complications. 
Glucagon 
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone, secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic 
islets. Glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and is the 
counterpart of insulin for controlling blood glucose levels (i.e. i t acts in opposition to insulin in 
terms of effects on blood glucose levels). Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and 
gluconeogenesis in hypoglycemic states, thereby [CONTACT_93406]. Glucagon 
receptor agonism has also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, 
body adipose tissue mass and food intake. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and cases of 
hypoglycemia can be reversed by [CONTACT_41148]. Therefore, glucagon is indicated for the treatment 
of severe hypoglycemia.  
Antibodies against therapeutic peptides like glucagon and analogues hereof may develop when 
injected subcutaneously. Although important, glucagon is not considered to have a critical 
endogenous function since other counter regulatory hormones are also induced during 
hypoglycemia (e.g. growth hormone, cortisol, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). In addition, results from [ADDRESS_588773] conﬁrmed that 
glucagon action is dispensable for their development and survival. Also, in non-clinical toxicity 
studies performed with dasiglucagon (see below), no consequences of ADA formation have 
currently been observed. In summary, glucagon appears to have a partly redundant 
endogenous function. These non-clinical data are of importance when evaluating the 
consequences of ADA formation. 
Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon (ZP4207 ) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a ready- to-
use liquid formulation and is in development for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in insulin 
dependent patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon receptor 
agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and elimination 
(minutes). It is a peptide of 29 amino acids, with 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native 
glucagon. The main purpose of the substitutions is to increase the physical and chemical 
stability of the glucagon analog compared to marketed glucagon products such as Lilly 
Glucagon or GlucaGen®. Dasiglucagon exhibits improved physical and chemical stability and is 
available in an aqueous solution at neutral pH.3

dasiglucagon was comparable to 1.0 mg GlucaGen (90% CI: 0.8850; 1.1991).3 At these dose

adverse events (AEs) recorded in the trials were of mild or moderate severity. The most 
frequently reported systemic AE was nausea, which is a known side effect following 
administration of glucagon. Headache was the next most frequently reported event, occurring in 
all dose groups in the phase 2 trial. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after 
administration with either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® and all were mild and transient. The most 
frequent injection site reaction was erythema, occurring in all treatment groups, including the 
placebo group, irrespective of dose. Glucagon has been described to exert positive inotropic 
and chronotropic effects and may therefore cause tachycardia and hypertension. In the phase [ADDRESS_588780]

considered a safety concern, however hemodynamic changes post dosing will be considered a 
clinical event of interest. 
The phase 1 and 2 results and the safety profile described to date do not give rise to specific 
safety concerns. For further information, please refer to the Investigator Brochure.3  
Immunogenicity of dasiglucagon  
To date, in the 3 clinical trials performed with dasiglucagon (described above), there have not 
been any anti-drug antibody (ADA) occurrences in a total of 141 subjects exposed to 1 or more 
doses. Data from the non-clinical toxicology program (7 non-clinical toxicity studies) show ed that 
ADAs were detected in mice, rats, and dogs, and were most frequent in animals in the highest 
dasiglucagon dose groups. A fraction of the ADAs from rats and dogs were able to cross-react 
with native glucagon. However, the ADAs did not appear to be associated with changes in the 
safety or toxicity profiles compared to ADA-negative animals. In rats, the average exposure 
(AUC) was increased following 13 and 26 weeks of treatment in dose groups with higher ADA 
frequency ( 8 mg/kg/day). The ADA frequency and titers of consistently ADA-positive rats were 
reduced from [ADDRESS_588781] animals. It

08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18/[ADDRESS_588782] a partially redundant endogenous function since hypoglycemia can also be corrected by 
[CONTACT_11174]. The overall immunogenicity risk of dasiglucagon in a clinical context is therefore 
considered to be low and the potential effects of induced ADAs judged to be of limited clinical 
consequence.  
As dasiglucagon contains 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native glucagon and historic 
data indicate that the immune system’s tolerance to glucagon can be impaired in the intended 
target population, there is an inherent risk for the induction of an ADA response against 
dasiglucagon. However, other product specific characteristics, i.e. dasiglucagon being a 
chemical synthetized product without host cell contaminants, a reduced potential for 
aggregation, a physiological compatible formulation, and a high bioavailability with a short half-
life, are all in favor of reducing the risk of dasiglucagon to induce an unwanted immune 
response. Considering the intended indication, in which dasiglucagon is administered as a 
single-dose rescue treatment on an infrequent basis (0.21 to 1.6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_460618]),4,[ADDRESS_588783] their safety and/or efficacy. Both transient and persistent antibody 
response should be combined to determine the overall immunogenicity of a product. Persistent 
antibodies are of importance since patients with persistent antibodies could experience clinical 
adverse reactions affecting safety and efficacy, while a transient antibody response can resolve 
without further consequence. 
The present trial aims to evaluate that immunogenicity risk with an assessment of the 
occurrence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs, and of cross-reactivity with native glucagon, 
following repeated single doses of dasiglucagon by s.c. administration in T1DM patients. The 
reference product in this trial is GlucaGen, a recombinant human glucagon approved for the 
treatment of the severe hypoglycemic reactions that may occur in the management of insulin-
treated children and adults with diabetes mellitus . Given the differences in ADA assay for 
dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, a formal statistical comparison or non-inferiority testing is not 
performed. 
5.3 Assessment of anticipated benefits and risks 
As glucagon and its analogs belong to a well-known drug class with a known mode of action, 
dasiglucagon is not expected to be a high-risk molecule.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 2 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19/[ADDRESS_588784] also been observed to a 
limited degree in the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon. As with every novel drug 
substance, new and as yet unknown side effects also may occur.  
There are limited data available to assess the immunogenic potential of glucagon products 
available on the market, but the data available indicate that marketed glucagon only has a small 
immunogenic potential. Based on the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon to date 
(see Section 5.2), no anti-dasiglucagon or anti-glucagon antibodies have been detected.  
In relation to diabetes therapy, development of insul in-antibodies is documented more 
substantially and the route of administration has been shown to influence the immunogenic 
potential of insulins. However, antibodies against insulin do not generally have an impact on 
insulin action and are thus not clinically relevant. In terms of consequence, development of high 
titer antibodies against dasiglucagon could, in theory reduce the activity of endogenous 
glucagon, which, in theory , could influence hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Limited suppression of 
glucagon would, however, not be considered critical, since low glucose levels can also be 
corrected by [CONTACT_11174], including oral intake of glucose and the action of other endogenous 
hormones such as oxyntomodulin and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. 
Overall, dasiglucagon is judged to be a low-risk molecule, based upon the available clinical data 
as well as the outcome of the risk-based approach to the immunogenicity assessment. In line 
with the primary objective of this trial to assess the immunogenicity of dasiglucagon, sampling 
for measurement of antibodies against dasiglucagon will take place prior to first dosing (Visit 2), 
pre-dose at subsequent visits during the treatment period (Visits 3 and 4), and at all Follow-up 
visits (at 35, 60, and [ADDRESS_588785] dose of trial medication ; i.e. at Visits 5 , 6, and 7 
(End of Trial [EoT] visit), respectively).  
Administration of dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions similar to 
those observed for other therapeutic peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected 
allergies to the trial medications or related products will be excluded from the trial. Mild or 
moderate allergic reactions may include symptoms of rash, fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, 
headache, and myalgia. Acute generalized hypersensitivity reactions are usually very rare but 
may include symptoms of flushing, sweating, dizziness, change in blood pressure and 
difficulties in breathing. No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the [ADDRESS_588786] access to resuscitation equipment is ensured 
at the clinical trial sites. 
With the exception of medical examinations, a patient participating in this trial is not likely to 
derive any personal health-related benefits. The results of the trial may contribute to the future 
use of dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing severe hypoglycemic 
reactions. 
Overall, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering the ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] trial is considered 
acceptable.

7.1 Overall trial design and plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing the immunogenicity of 3 fixed 
doses of either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administered to euglycemic T1DM patients.  
Patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 to receive 3 s.c. injections of either dasiglucagon 
(0.6 mg) or GlucaGen (1 mg), with [ADDRESS_588788] dose to assess any immune response. Patients with 
previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded from the trial, but the information on 
previous glucagon administration will be recorded to enable subgroup analyses . A total of 
90 patients are expected to participate in and complete the trial (45 in each treatment arm) . To 
qualify as completed, the patient must be dosed according to protocol and have blood drawn for 
the ADA analyses (as scheduled in Table 2-1 ). Prematurely discontinued patients will be 
replaced in order to reach [ADDRESS_588789] reach a target plasma glucose level 
of 70- 150 mg/dL.  
The trial will include the following periods (as illustrated in Figure 7-1 , below). 
 A screening period from Day -30 to Day -3 
 A treatment period, from Day 0 (day of randomization) to Day 14 (day of third and final 
dosing with trial medication), with s.c. trial medication administered on Day 0, Day 7, and 
Day 14. Handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be done by 
[CONTACT_93400]. A ll trial assessments will be done by [CONTACT_93401].  
 A follow-up period, from the end of the Treatment Period, with follow-up visits at Day 35, 
Day 60, and Day 104 (the EoT visit) 
Time windows for each trial visit are given in Table 2-1 . 
Figure 7-1 Overview of the trial design 
 
An overview on the trial procedures is given in the flow chart ( Table 2-1 ). Patients should be 
seen for all visits on the designated day or as close to it as possible.  
7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups 
The trial will be randomized and double-blind to increase trial validity and to reduce bias during 
evaluation of assessments with the two treatments. Since the 2 trial medications are not 
identical in appearance (dasiglucagon is a liquid formulation and GlucaGen is available as a 

 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 2 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22/49 powder for reconstitution), the handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be 
done by [CONTACT_460674] d 
assessments. All trial assessments performed at the trial site will be done by [CONTACT_460625]. However, exposure assessments and ADA assessments will be performed by 
[CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen 
administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.    
Euglycemic patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 in order to evaluate the immunogenicity 
of dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, with 
administration of 3 fixed consecutive doses of randomized trial medication (dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen) to the same patient will allow characterization of immunogenic potential for the 2 
products. Treatment with the 3 repeated doses (each separated by 1 week), with follow-up visits 
at Days 35 (where potential immune responses are known to be most pronounced), and at [ADDRESS_588790] dose (following the patient for 2-3 antibody half-lives after expected 
peak titer), is deemed relevant and sufficient for evaluating any immunogenic response to 
treatment. Patients that test positive for ADA will be monitored until the ADA levels return to 
baseline, and samples from the ADA positive patients will be tested for neutralizing potential in 
an N ab (neutralizing antibody) assay. 
Dasiglucagon and GlucaGen will be administered at fixed doses independent of body weight 
because this is the intended therapeutic dosing regimen in the emergency treatment of 
hypoglycemia. The selected dose of 1 mg GlucaGen is the recommended dose for treatment of 
severe hypoglycemia. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that 
0.6 mg of dasiglucagon results in an initial pharmacodynamic response (i.e. acute glucose 
mobilization) comparable to 1 mg GlucaGen (see also Section 5.1).  
For the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into hypoglycemia prior to 
dosing. However, very high blood glucose levels at dosing will potentially impact the reporting of 
nausea and other associated AE’s. Therefore, to enable a more precise safety assessment, 
patients are required to be dosed while at a normal blood glucose level, and a pre-treatment 
plasma glucose level of 70- 150 mg/dL will be targeted. Plasma glucose levels may be adjusted 
by s.c. administration of a fast-acting insulin analog or by [CONTACT_460628]. Even with this 
precaution, it cannot be excluded that a higher frequency of nausea may be anticipated, if this 
AE is caused by [CONTACT_460631].  
The safety profile described to date does not give rise to specific safety concerns. In previous 
studies, dasiglucagon was associated with the AE ’s nausea, a known side effect following 
administration of glucagon, headache, and injection site reactions (erythema).  
7.3 Selection of trial population 
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Given 
the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial aims to evaluate 
the immune response of patients with T1DM taking repeated single doses of s.c. dasiglucagon 
and GlucaGen .  
There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood glucose levels, 
therefore, for the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into a 
hypoglycemic state prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not 
be excluded from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be 
recorded to enable subgroup analyses. 
The trial will enroll patients in centers in the EU, in the US, and in Canada .

2, 3, and 4) . Should the patient experience vomiting following the first or second dasiglucagon 
or GlucaGen administration, the investigator must ensure normal electrolytes prior to the next 
dosing day. An electrolyte imbalance can be corrected by [CONTACT_460676].    
7.4.3  Selection of doses in the trial 
The selected dose of 1 mg GlucaGen is the recommended dose for treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that 0.6 mg 
of dasiglucagon results in an initial pharmacodynamic response (i.e. acute glucose mobilization) 
comparable to 1 mg GlucaGen. 
7.4.4  Treatment compliance 
All trial medications will be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_93400].

08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28/[ADDRESS_588802] given written 
informed consent will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen via an 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) that will assign a kit number to one of the 2 
aforementioned treatment arms. 
Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded from the trial, but the 
information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded, to enable subgroup analyses .  
In the event of an emergency, e.g., when it becomes necessary for the investigator to know 
which treatment the patient is taking, the code for that patient can be broken by [CONTACT_093] , 
preferably after consultation with the medical monitor. Emergency code breaks can be 
performed using the IWRS. 
7.4.6  Blinding 
This is a double-blind trial. Since dasiglucagon is available as a liquid formulation and GlucaGen 
is available as a powder for reconstitution, and they are therefore not identical in appearance, 
unblinded trial personnel will be responsible for handling, preparing according to the prescription 
from the IWRS, administering the trial medication and keep the records strictly confidential and 
accessible only for unblinded staff until after database lock . To maintain double-blind conditions, 
all trial assessments at the trial site will be done by [CONTACT_460677]. However, exposure assessments and ADA assessments will 
be performed by [CONTACT_460626], to make sure that 
dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.   
7.4.7  Drug accountability and disposal 
Handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be done by [CONTACT_460634]. Each center will keep accurate records of the trial supplies received, stored, and 
dispensed, using appropriate forms. The trial supplies will be stored under appropriate 
conditions, locked and with restricted access.  
All unused supplies and all empty and partially empty containers of trial medication will be 
stored until the trial closure visit has been performed and then sent to the sponsor.  
7.4.8  Prior and concomitant therapy 
Prior glucagon exposure will be recorded in the e CRF at screening . All concomitant medications 
will be recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Patients using any new concomitant medication resulting in fulfillment of a dosing day exclusion 
criterion will be excluded from the dosing visit, but can be rescheduled to one of the following 
days. Each dosing visit can only be rescheduled once. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for possible reasons 
for patient discontinuation. 
7.4.9  Treatment after end of trial  
Not applicable in this trial .  
7.5 Assessments and schedule of measurements (overview) 
The following assessments and measurements will be carried out at the times specified in the 
trial flow chart ( Table 2-1 ).

the treatment period (Visits 2 , 3, and 4) samples will be collected pre-dose.  
The clinical ADA assays have been validated in accordance with existing guidelines and 
recommendations.6,7,8,9,10  
Confirmed positive anti- dasiglucagon antibody samples, (treatment-induced or treatment-
boosted) from anti-dasiglucagon antibody-positive patients will be evaluated for binding titer 
neutralizing potential and titer as well as cross-reactivity towards endogenous glucagon.  
No further serum sampling will be needed as the ADA samples can be used for Nab analysis. 
The in vitro neutralizing effect of antibodies will be measured using an assay9,12 based on 
glucagon receptor transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The calculated sensitivity in 
previous studies was about 51.8 ng/mL. The assay was also validated for recombinant glucagon 
with similar results.11,[ADDRESS_588818] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_460639], further investigation may be performed by [CONTACT_460640].

8. Adverse events 
8.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient administered an investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP.  
Note: This includes events from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the 
informed consent.  
AEs include: 
 A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. 
 A clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. any abnormality that 
suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active 
management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for 
example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. 
 Hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (see Section 8.4) 
 Injection site reactions 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 2 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34/49 The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded at screening (on Screening Form or 
CRF): 
 Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the informed 
consent. 
 Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures (pre-existing conditions 
should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). 
Serious adverse event (SAE) 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 results in death  
 is life-threatening  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 is medically important 
Medical judgement must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to be 
‘medically important’. Medically important event may not be immediately life-threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467]. 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
An AE, fulfilling one of the criteria of seriousness and being assessed as related to IMP 
application, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable reference 
document (e.g. ZP4207 IB3 or package leaflet/SmPC for an approved product such as 
GlucaGen13).  
Clinical event of interest 
A clinical event of interest is an event which, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus (e.g. 
required by [CONTACT_21652]). 
In this trial hemodynamic changes, as defined below, are considered clinical events of interest: 
 Post-dose clinical signs or measured vital signs indicating a clinical significant drop in 
blood pressure including signs of orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal responses or 
bradycardia. 
 Post-dose change in pulse or blood pressure considered an event of hypo- or 
hypertension as judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
Intensity of an adverse event 
The maximum intensity (severity) of all AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_460641]. Severity should be graded when the AE outcome is known: 
Mild:  A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living. 
Moderate :  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant. 
Severe :  A type of adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 2 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35/49 A ‘severe’ reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as ‘serious’ and a SAE may not be 
‘severe’ in nature. 
Causality relationship to trial medication 
The causality of each AE should be assessed by [CONTACT_460642]: 
Probable: Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. 
Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. 
Unlikely: The event is most likely related to etiology other than the trial product. 
Not related :  No relationship to trial product 
Outcome of an adverse event 
The outcome of all AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_460643]/her staff. 
The following definitions should be used: 
Recovered/resolved :  The patient has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_460644]-related activity after the patient signed the 
informed consent.  
Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the patient is expected to 
recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the 
patient has completed the trial. 
Recovered/resolved with sequelae :  The patient has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or 
procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE 
must be reported as an SAE. 
Not recovered/ not resolved :  The condition of the patient has not improved and the 
symptoms are unchanged. 
Fatal :  This term is only applicable if the patient died from a 
condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other 
reported AEs in a patient before he/she died should be 
assessed as "recovered/resolved", "recovering/resolving", 
"recovered/ resolved with sequelae" or "not recovered/not 
resolved". An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as 
an SAE. 
Unknown :  This term is only applicable if the patient is lost to follow-
up. 
8.[ADDRESS_588822] with the site (visit or telephone, excluding visits, 
where the patient is not seeing the Investigator or his staff (e.g. visits to the laboratory)) the 
patient must be asked about AEs. All AEs, either observed by [CONTACT_460678], must be recorded by [CONTACT_460646]. 
The Investigator should record the diagnosis, if possible. If no diagnosis can be made the 
Investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs.

08 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36/[ADDRESS_588823] also be completed. 
AE information should include the following: 
 Date and time of onset and resolution 
 Date and time of Investigator’s first information on the (S)AE 
 Seriousness 
 Severity 
 Causal relationship with IMP 
 Interruption or withdrawal of treatment with IMP and other measures taken 
 Outcome 
All AEs are coded; details are described in the trial specific Data Management Plan.  
If an event classifies as a clinical event of interest, the Investigator must tick the Clinical Event 
of Interest box on the AE form and complete the Clinical Event of Interest Form. The Clinical 
Event of Interest form will capture if the event was associated with any signs or symptoms and 
capture the highest/lowest blood pressure and pulse measured during the event. 
The Investigator must report initial information in writing (fax or email) on all SAEs to the 
Sponsor’s responsible pharmacovigilance unit (Safety CRO ) immediately (within 24 hours) after 
obtaining knowledge about the event. Please refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_588824] details. The Safety 
CRO will inform the medical monitor and the sponsor about the reported SAEs. 
It is the responsibility of the Safety CRO to report all S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occur in this trial to the 
Competent Authorities and IRBs/IECs in accordance with the local requirements in force and 
ICH guideline for GCP. The trial monitor must be informed accordingly. 
8.3 Follow-up of adverse events 
All AEs that are ongoing at the end of the patient’s participation in the study will be followed-up 
until the event is resolved or reaches a satisfactory outcome as deemed by [CONTACT_737].  
Follow-up actions for all SAEs will be performed according to appropriate clinical care practices 
and may depend on the nature of the event. These will be determined after internal review 
and/or sponsor review. 
The follow up information should only include new (updated and/or additional) information that 
reflects the situation at the time of the Investigator’s signature. 
Follow-up information on (S)AEs will be updated using the (S)AE Form. If a non-serious event 
becomes serious during the follow-up the AE Form and SAE Form have to be used and 
reporting timelines follow those of a SAE. 
The Investigator must forward follow-up information on SAEs and if previously non-serious AEs 
become SAEs to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours) after obtaining knowledge about the 
new information. 
8.4 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia will be regarded as an AE and recorded and documented on an AE Form. 
Hypoglycemia is defined as a fall of plasma glucose below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 
During the dosing visits, mild to moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia, or a blood glucose ( BG) 
value less than a threshold of <2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL), corresponding to a plasma glucose ( PG) 
value of <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), will be treated by i.v. glucose solution at the investigator’s 
discretion according to best available medical practice. Treatment is to be repeated until BG

pregnant or suspects to be pregnant. The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome 
of all pregnancies reported during the clinical trial. During an information meeting at the trial site, 
the patient’s partner will be fully informed by a physician of her participation in capturing the 
outcome data, and will be asked to provide her written consen t. 
The Investigator must report all information on pregnancies on the initial pregnancy form. The 
completed initial pregnancy form must be forwarded to the Sponsor according to the procedure 
stated in Section 8.2. Any (S)AEs in the mother, as well as other pregnancy complications 
(ectopic pregnancy) fulfilling the criteria of an (S)AE, must be reported on the (S)AE form.  
The following must be collected in the initial pregnancy form:  
 Medical history of the mother 
 Family history 
 Course of the pregnancy, including expected delivery date 
The Investigator must follow the pregnancy until the pregnancy outcome and the newborn 
infant(s) until the age of [ADDRESS_588826] information on the pregnancy 
and pregnancy complications as well as the pregnancy outcome including the health of the 
newborn infant(s) on the pregnancy outcome form. The completed pregnancy outcome form 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor according to the procedure stated in Section 8.2. Any (S)AEs 
in the newborn must be reported on the (S)AE form. 
The SAEs that must be reported including abnormal outcome - such as congenital anomalies, 
fetal death and termination of pregnancy (spontaneous or elective abortion), including any 
anomalies of the fetus observed at gross examination or during autopsy.  
The following must be collected in the pregnancy outcome form:  
 Course of the pregnancy 
 Outcome of the pregnancy 
 Condition of the newborn 
 Any AEs in the newborn infant must be followed till the age of [ADDRESS_588827] 
the patients. During a patient’s participation in the trial, the Investigator should ensure that 
adequate medical care is provided to the patients for any AEs, including clinically significant 
laboratory values related to the trial. The Investigator should inform the patient when medical 
care is needed for intercurrent illnesses of which the Investigator becomes aware.  
For further information on safety precautions for ZP4207 and GlucaGen, please refer to the 
current version of the Investigator’s Brochure3 and the SmPC for GlucaGen13, respectively.

9.1 Case report forms 
All the information collected during the trial will be recorded in the eCRFs, which are identified 
by [CONTACT_56324]. Suitable eCRFs will be designed by [CONTACT_460648]. The investigator will 
ensure that the eCRFs are correctly completed. All key pages will be signed or initialed by [CONTACT_1275], signifying agreement with and responsibility for the recorded data. Key pages are 
the following: AE-reporting form, trial medication form, concomitant medication form and trial-

Data directly captured in the eCRF (i.e., data assigned or calculated automatically by [CONTACT_25751]) is called e-source. This means that these data fields in the CRF are source documents. 
For the other CRF data fields, which are entered by [CONTACT_460679], the 
source data will be found in other documents (such as patients’ files, worksheets, etc.), i.e. for 
these CRF data fields the “other” documents are the source documents.  
9.[ADDRESS_588828] access to source data /documents. Sponsor-authorized quality assurance 
personnel may carry out audits for which the investigator must provide support. 
The trial will be supervised by a monitor from SynteractHCR. The trial monitor will contact [CONTACT_460650].  
The trial monitor or a representative of the sponsor will cross-check the data entered in the 
eCRFs with the source data at the trial site and observe the trial procedures in order to verify 
adherence to the tri al protocol. 
The eCRFs will be checked for completeness and correctness by [CONTACT_460651]. 
All of the clinical data will be captured via electronic data capture (EDC) using a web-based tool. 
The software Marvin from the company XClinical (www.xclinical.com/) is the preferred EDC 
software. Marvin is compliant with all legislation relevant to electronic data capture (FDA 21 
CFR Part 11, GCP). 
The investigator site staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access 
features (username [CONTACT_2383]). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The 
investigator will approve the data using an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11), and this 
approval is used to confirm the accuracy of the data recorded. 
eCRFs will be used for all patients. The investigator’s data will be accessible from the 
investigator’s site throughout the trial. The electronic CRFs must be kept current to reflect 
patient status at each phase during the course of the trial. The electronic CRF will not capture 
personalized data. The investigator must make a separate confidential record of personalize d 
details (name [CONTACT_93459]) on the patient identification and enrollment log. All changes to data 
are done by [CONTACT_460652].  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460624]’s eCRF are also 
made on the patient’s medical records. 
The eCRFs for any patient leaving the trial should be completed at the time of the final visit or 
shortly thereafter.

10.1 Statistical and analysis plan 
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized that details the planned statistical 
analysis and may include necessary adaptations to the planned statistical analysis before 
unblinding of the data.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
trial report. 
10.1.1 General considerations 
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and summarized with 
statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all data collected 
up to that time point will be included into the analysis. 
Raw data listings and summary tables will be generated using the software SAS© Version [ADDRESS_588829] deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. 
Categorical efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_460653].  
10.1.2 Classification of patients to subsets 
For the statistical analysis the randomized patients will be divided up into the following datasets: 
The following definitions are applicable: 
Safety analysis set 
(SAS)  all patient s who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
trial medication  
Full analysis set  
(FAS)  all patient s of the SA S with at least one measurement of the ADA 
titer at baseline  
Per Protocol set 
(PPS)  all patient s of the FA S for whom no relevant protocol deviations 
were documented  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. A secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint will be based on the PPS. Safety analysis will be based on the SAS. 
The decision whether a protocol deviation is relevant or not for the exclusion of patients from the 
PPS set will be made case- by-case in a data review meeting. 
10.1.3 Immunogenicity data 
All immunogenicity parameters will be analyzed descriptively per treatment group. No statistical 
tests are planned. Baseline ADA-positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total 
number of patients whose baseline samples were tested for ADA. Titer will be reported as 
median and interquartile range. 
95% confidence intervals for incidence rates and for rate differences will be given. 
Secondary immunogenicity parameters will be described with appropriate descriptive statistics 
for dichotomous, categorical or continuous variables.

Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations 0-90 min from dosing: AUC 0-30min , AUC 0-90 
min, Cmax, and t max will be summarized with descriptive statistics. 
Plasma glucose profiles 0-90 min from dosing: AUE 0-30min , AUE 0-[ADDRESS_588830] results will be marked whether the result is below, within or above the 
respective reference range. The number of values outside of the reference range will be 
counted. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after 
medical coding using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AE summary 
tables will include counts and percentages of patients who experienced adverse events 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). 
Other safety data 
Vital signs, physical examination, ECG and local tolerability data will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
10.1.6 Further data 
Baseline and demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Baseline ADA-
positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total number of patients whose 
baseline samples were tested for ADA.  
All other data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRF will be listed. 
10.1.7 Withdrawals, drop-outs and missing data 
In the case of drop-outs, no imputation of values for immunogenicity measurements will be 
done. Analysis is done on valid cases only i.e. no imputation technique like LOCF (last 
observation carried forward) will be applied. 
10.1.8 Baseline and center comparisons 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared. 
10.1.9 Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses for the primariy endpoint (voerl ADA incidence) by [CONTACT_547], age, and race 
will be performed. 
10.1.10 Interim analysis 
No interim analysis is currently planned. 
10.2 Determination of sample size 
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. The ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, but 
specific for GlucaGen and dasiglucagon, respectively,  and the performance of the assays are 
thus not directly comparable. As a consequence, a formal comparison or non-inferiority analysis 
will not be performed

Across the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 PK/PD trial, a total of [ADDRESS_588832] 
been observed. The obtained data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of 
ADAs in the investigated settings and as a consequence  a meaningful sample size to compare 
both treatments cannot be estimated. 
The sample size is therefore based on a certain precision of the confidence interval for the 
overall ADA incidence if no events are observed, respectively to ensure a certain probability for 
observing one event. 
When no events are observed, to obtain an upper bound of 0.050 on the 90.0% confidence 
interval for the probability of such a rare event, would require a sample size of 45. Respectively, 
accepting a chance of observing at least one event of 90% and an actual probability of the event 
of 5% leads to a sample size of 45 patients completing the trial. In order to account for drop-
outs, It is expected that 112 patients in total will be randomized and treated.

Trial center(s): 
2 centers in the EU, 2 centers in the US, and 3 centers in Canada 
Planned trial period: 
First Patient First Visit: May [ADDRESS_588850] Visit: November 2017 Phase of Development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives: 
The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of dasiglucagon and 
GlucaGen following subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in T1DM patients. 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic response of 
repeated single doses of dasiglucagon following s.c. administration compared with s.c. GlucaGen in 
T1DM patients. 
Trial design: 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial evaluating the immunogenicity of either 
dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administered to euglycemic T1DM patients. Patients will be randomized 
1:[ADDRESS_588851] dose to assess any immune response. A 
total of 90 patients are expected to complete the trial. Handling, preparation and administration of trial 
medication will be done by [CONTACT_93400]. All trial assessments will be done by [CONTACT_460625]. However, exposure assessments and anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessments will be 
performed by [CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay. 
Planned number of patients: 
90 completed patients (45 completed patients per treatment group). It is expected that [ADDRESS_588852] blood drawn for 
the planned anti-drug antibody (ADA) analyses. 
Medical condition or disease under investigation: 
Given the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial is conducted in 
patients with T1DM. There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood 
glucose levels. Therefore, for the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into 
hypoglycemia prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not be excluded 
from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded. 
Inclusion criteria: 
To be included in the trial, patients have to fulfill all of the following criteria: 
1. Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities (trial-related activities are any 
procedure that would not have been performed during normal management of the patient) 
2. Availability for the entire trial period 
3. Age between [ADDRESS_588853] 1 year. Diagnostic criteria as defined by [CONTACT_460627], final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE])

[ADDRESS_588880] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16/[ADDRESS_588881] 
of treatment of diabetes mellitus with especially insulin or sulfonylureas. It is more frequent in 
patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency, such as occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment of T2DM with insulin causes 
hypoglycemia progressively and more frequently over time, whereas in T1DM, hypoglycemia is 
experienced throughout the course of established disease. 
Symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific. Patients undergoing a hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_460616], sweating, hunger, tremors, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], paresthesia, nausea and pallor. Depending on its severity, the hypoglycemia may 
lead to mild confusion, behavioral changes, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, and death.2  
The inc
idence of hypoglycemic events or even the fear of hypoglycemia influences patients’ 
adherence to prescribed treatment regimens for diabetes mellitus. This leads to inadequate 
glycemic control, which in turn may lead to an increased risk of diabetic complications. 
Glucagon 
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone, secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic 
islets. Glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and is the 
counterpart of insulin for controlling blood glucose levels (i.e. it acts in opposition to insulin in 
terms of effects on blood glucose levels). Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and 
gluconeogenesis in hypoglycemic states, thereby [CONTACT_93406]. Glucagon 
receptor agonism has also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, 
body adipose tissue mass and food intake. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and cases of 
hypoglycemia can be reversed by [CONTACT_41148]. Therefore, glucagon is indicated for the treatment 
of severe hypoglycemia.  
Antibodies against therapeutic peptides like glucagon and analogues hereof may develop when 
injected subcutaneously. Although important, glucagon is not considered to have a critical 
endogenous function since other counter regulatory hormones are also induced during 
hypoglycemia (e.g. growth hormone, cortisol, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). In addition, results from [ADDRESS_588882] con rmed that 
glucagon action is dispensable for their development and survival. Also, in non-clinical toxicity 
studies performed with dasiglucagon (see below), no consequences of ADA formation have 
currently been observed. In summary, glucagon appears to have a partly redundant 
endogenous function. These non-clinical data are of importance when evaluating the 
consequences of ADA formation. 
Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon (ZP4207) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a ready-to-
use liquid formulation and is in development for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in insulin 
dependent patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon receptor 
agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and elimination 
(minutes). It is a peptide of 29 amino acids, with 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native 
glucagon. The main purpose of the substitutions is to increase the physical and chemical 
stability of the glucagon analog compared to marketed glucagon products such as Lilly 
Glucagon or GlucaGen®. Dasiglucagon exhibits improved physical and chemical st a bility and is 
available in an aqueous solution at neutral pH.3

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
[ADDRESS_588895] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18/[ADDRESS_588896] a partially redundant endogenous function since hypoglycemia can also be corrected by 
[CONTACT_11174]. The overall immunogenicity risk of dasiglucagon in a clinical context is therefore 
considered to be low and the potential effects of induced ADAs judged to be of limited clinical 
consequence.  
As dasiglucagon contains 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native glucagon and historic 
data indicate that the immune system’s tolerance to glucagon can be impaired in the intended 
target population, there is an inherent risk for the induction of an ADA response against 
dasiglucagon. However, other product specific characteristics, i.e. dasiglucagon being a 
chemical synthetized product without host cell contaminants, a reduced potential for 
aggregation, a physiological compatible formulation, and a high bioavailability with a short half-
life, are all in favor of reducing the risk of dasiglucagon to induce an unwanted immune 
response. Considering the intended indication, in which dasiglucagon is administered as a 
single-dose rescue treatment on an infrequent basis (0.21 to 1.6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_460618]),4,[ADDRESS_588897] their safety and/or efficacy. Both transient and persistent antibody 
response should be combined to determine the overall immunogenicity of a product. Persistent 
antibodies are of importance since patients with persistent antibodies could experience clinical 
adverse reactions affecting safety and efficacy, while a transient antibody response can resolve 
without further consequence. 
The present trial aims to evaluate that immunogenicity risk with an assessment of the 
occurrence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs, and of cross-reactivity with native glucagon, 
following repeated single doses of dasiglucagon by s.c. administration in T1DM patients.  The 
trial further aims to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic responses and to 
correlate the consequence of an antibody response, if any, to pharmacodynamic and 
pharmacokinetic endpoints. The reference product in this trial is GlucaGen, a recombinant 
human glucagon approved for the treatment of the severe hypoglycemic reactions that may 
occur in the management of insulin-treated children and adults with diabetes mellitus. Given the 
differences in ADA assay for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen, a formal statistical comparison or 
non-inferiority testing is not performed. 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
[ADDRESS_588898] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19/[ADDRESS_588899] also been observed to a 
limited degree in the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon. As with every novel drug 
substance, new and as yet unknown side effects also may occur.  
There are limited data available to assess the immunogenic potential of glucagon products 
available on the market, but the data available indicate that marketed glucagon only has a small 
immunogenic potential. Based on the 3 clinical studies conducted with dasiglucagon to date 
(see Section 5.2), no anti-dasiglucagon or anti-glucagon antibodies have been detected.  
In relation to diabetes therapy, development of insulin-antibodies is documented more 
substantially and the route of administration has been shown to influence the immunogenic 
potential of insulins. However, antibodies against insulin do not generally have an impact on 
insulin action and are thus not clinically relevant. In terms of consequence, development of high 
titer antibodies against dasiglucagon could, in theory reduce the activity of endogenous 
glucagon, which, in theory, could influence hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Limited suppression of 
glucagon would, however, not be considered critical, since low glucose levels can also be 
corrected by [CONTACT_11174], including oral intake of glucose and the action of other endogenous 
hormones such as oxyntomodulin and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. 
Overall, dasiglucagon is judged to be a low-risk molecule, based upon the available clinical data 
as well as the outcome of the risk-based approach to the immunogenicity assessment. In line 
with the primary objective of this trial to assess the immunogenicity of dasiglucagon, sampling 
for measurement of antibodies against dasiglucagon will take place prior to first dosing (Visit 2), 
pre-dose at subsequent visits during the treatment period (Visits 3 and 4), and at all Follow-up 
visits (at 35, 60, and [ADDRESS_588900] dose of trial medication; i.e. at Visits 5, 6, and 7 
(End of Trial [EoT] visit), respectively).  
Administration of dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions similar to 
those observed for other therapeutic peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected 
allergies to the trial medications or related products will be excluded from the trial. Mild or 
moderate allergic reactions may include symptoms of rash, fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, 
headache, and myalgia. Acute generalized hypersensitivity reactions are usually very rare but 
may include symptoms of flushing, sweating, dizziness, change in blood pressure and 
difficulties in breathing. No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the [ADDRESS_588901] access to resuscitation equipment is ensured 
at the clinical trial sites. 
With the exception of medical examinations, a patient participating in this trial is not likely to 
derive any personal health-related benefits. The results of the trial may contribute to the future 
use of dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing severe hypoglycemic 
reactions. 
Overall, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering the ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] trial is considered 
acceptable.

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
[ADDRESS_588909] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23/50 done by [CONTACT_460630]. All trial assessments performed at the trial site will be done by [CONTACT_460625]. However, exposure assessments and ADA assessments will be performed by 
[CONTACT_460626], to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen 
administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.    
Euglycemic patients with T1DM will be randomized 1:1 in order to evaluate the immunogenicity 
of dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group design, with 
administration of 3 fixed consecutive doses of randomized trial medication (dasiglucagon or 
GlucaGen) to the same patient will allow characterization of immunogenic potential for the 2 
products. Treatment with the 3 repeated doses (each separated by 1 week), with follow-up visits 
at Days 35 (where potential immune responses are known to be most pronounced), and at [ADDRESS_588910] dose (following the patient for 2-3 antibody half-lives after expected 
peak titer), is deemed relevant and sufficient for evaluating any immunogenic response to 
treatment. Patients will be monitored until the ADA levels return to baseline, and samples from 
the ADA positive patients will be tested for neutralizing potential in a NAb (neutralizing antibody) 
assay. Further, a patient with a treatment induced or treatment boosted ADA response will be 
called in for an additional (unscheduled) visit to evaluate the clinical effect of immunogenicity of 
the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic reponses.  
Dasiglucagon and GlucaGen will be administered at fixed doses independent of body weight 
because this is the intended therapeutic dosing regimen in the emergency treatment of 
hypoglycemia. The selected dose of 1 mg GlucaGen is the recommended dose for treatment of 
severe hypoglycemia. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that 
0.6 mg of dasiglucagon results in an initial pharmacodynamic response (i.e. acute glucose 
mobilization) comparable to 1 mg GlucaGen (see also Section 5.1).  
For the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into hypoglycemia prior to 
dosing. However, very high blood glucose levels at dosing will potentially impact the reporting of 
nausea and other associated AE’s. Therefore, to enable a more precise safety assessment, 
patients are required to be dosed while at a normal blood glucose level, and a pre-treatment 
plasma glucose level of 70-150 mg/dL will be targeted. Plasma glucose levels may be adjusted 
by s.c. administration of a fast-acting insulin analog or by [CONTACT_460628]. Even with this 
precaution, it cannot be excluded that a higher frequency of nausea may be anticipated, if this 
AE is caused by [CONTACT_460631]. 
The safety profile described to date does not give rise to specific safety concerns. In previous 
studies, dasiglucagon was associated with the AE’s nausea, a known side effect following 
administration of glucagon, headache, and injection site reactions (erythema).  
7.3 Selection of trial population 
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. Given 
the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of T1DM, the present trial aims to evaluate 
the immune response of patients with T1DM taking repeated single doses of s.c. dasiglucagon 
and GlucaGen.  
There are no data indicating an altered immune response with varying blood glucose levels, 
therefore, for the safety and well-being of the patients, they will not be brought into a 
hypoglycemic state prior to dosing. Patients with previous exogenic glucagon exposure will not 
be excluded from the trial, but the information on previous glucagon administration will be 
recorded to enable subgroup analyses.

information on previous glucagon administration will be recorded, to enable subgroup analyses.  
In the event of an emergency, e.g., when it becomes necessary for the investigator to know 
which treatment the patient is taking, the code for that patient can be broken by [CONTACT_093], 
preferably after consultation with the medical monitor. Emergency code breaks can be 
performed using the IWRS. 
7.4.6 Blinding 
This is a double-blind trial. Since dasiglucagon is available as a liquid formulation and GlucaGen 
is available as a powder for reconstitution, and they are therefore not identical in appearance, 
unblinded trial personnel will be responsible for handling, preparing according to the prescription 
from the IWRS, administering the trial medication and keep the records strictly confidential and 
accessible only for unblinded staff until after database lock. To maintain double-blind conditions, 
all trial assessments at the trial site will be done by [CONTACT_460680]. However, exposure assessments and ADA assessments will 
be performed by [CONTACT_460626], to make sure that 
dasiglucagon or GlucaGen administration is matched with the applicable bioanalytical assay.   
7.4.7 Drug accountability and disposal 
Handling, preparation and administration of trial medication will be done by [CONTACT_460634]. Each center will keep accurate records of the trial supplies received, stored, and 
dispensed, using appropriate forms. The trial supplies will be stored under appropriate 
conditions, locked and with restricted access.  
All unused supplies and all empty and partially empty containers of trial medication will be 
stored until the trial closure visit has been performed and then sent to the sponsor.  
7.4.8 Prior and concomitant therapy 
Prior glucagon exposure will be recorded in the eCRF at screening. All concomitant medications 
will be recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Patients using any new concomitant medication resulting in fulfillment of a dosing day exclusion 
criterion will be excluded from the dosing visit, but can be rescheduled to one of the following 
days. Each dosing visit can only be rescheduled once. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for possible reasons 
for patient discontinuation. 
7.4.9 Treatment after end of trial  
Not applicable in this trial.  
7.5 Assessments and schedule of measurements (overview) 
The following assessments and measurements will be carried out at the times specified in the 
trial flow chart (Table 2-1).  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to any trial-related procedures; see Section 11.3.

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
[ADDRESS_588956] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33/[ADDRESS_588957] Operating Procedures. The parameters listed in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] will be determined using standard methods. 
The total volume of blood sampled per patient for safety analyses is 68 mL. 
7.6 Immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, tolerability and safety 
measurements 
Details of sampling for immunogenicity testing, plasma glucose concentrations, plasma trial 
medication concentrations, and safety laboratory testing are provided in a laboratory manual 
(see the Investigator site file).  
7.6.[ADDRESS_588958] dasiglucagon/glucagon will be measured at all visits after screening. During 
the treatment period (Visits 2, 3, and 4) samples will be collected pre-dose as well as at 
unscheduled dosing visits for ADA positive patients.  
The ADA samples will be analyzed at a special laboratory (refer to Appendix 1). Samples 
collected at the planned visits will be analyzed in batches at three occasions during the trial and 
any positive results will immediately be communicated to the investigator in a blinded manner. 
The clinical ADA assays have been validated in accordance with existing guidelines and 
recommendations.6,7,8,9,10  
Confirm
ed positive anti- dasiglucagon antibody samples, (treatment-induced or treatment-
boosted) from anti-dasiglucagon antibody-positive patients will be evaluated for binding titer 
neutralizing potential and titer as well as cross-reactivity towards endogenous glucagon.  
No further serum sampling will be needed as the ADA samples can be used for Nab analysis. 
The in vitro neutralizing effect of antibodies will be measured using an assay9,12 based on 
glucago
n receptor transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The calculated sensitivity in 
previous studies was about 51.8 ng/mL. The assay was also validated for recombinant glucagon 
with similar results.11,[ADDRESS_588959] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_460639], further investigation may be performed by [CONTACT_460640]. 
Residual and additional antibody serum samples may be stored until approval of market 
authorization by [CONTACT_93420]. Further characterization of the antibody response may be 
requested by [CONTACT_93420]. 
7.6.2 Plasma concentrations of dasiglucagon and GlucaGen  
The exposure to trial medication (dasiglucagon or GlucaGen) will be assessed based on plasma 
concentration data (AUC 0-30min , AUC 0-90 min , C max, tmax) from samples collected at Visits 2 and 4 
(after 
administration of the first and third doses of trial medication).  
Samples will be collected pre-dose, and at 5, 10, 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_588960]-dosing. The actual 
time of blood sampling for exposure should not deviate from the nominal time by [CONTACT_726] ±1 
min. Pre-dose is defined as within 5 min prior to dosing.

[ADDRESS_588979] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40/50 9. Data management and quality control 
9.1 Case report forms 
All the information collected during the trial will be recorded in the eCRFs, which are identified 
by [CONTACT_56324]. Suitable eCRFs will be designed by [CONTACT_460648]. The investigator will 
ensure that the eCRFs are correctly completed. All key pages will be signed or initialed by [CONTACT_1275], signifying agreement with and responsibility for the recorded data. Key pages are 
the following: AE-reporting form, trial medication form, concomitant medication form and trial-
closure form. 
Any information (e.g. results from the neutralizing antibody assay or additional unscheduled 
visits) may be reported separately pending availability of the results. 
Data directly captured in the eCRF (i.e., data assigned or calculated automatically by [CONTACT_25751]) is called e-source. This means that these data fields in the CRF are source documents. 
For the other CRF data fields, which are entered by [CONTACT_460679], the 
source data will be found in other documents (such as patients’ files, worksheets, etc.), i.e. for 
these CRF data fields the “other” documents are the source documents.  
9.[ADDRESS_588980] access to source data /documents. Sponsor-authorized quality assurance 
personnel may carry out audits for which the investigator must provide support. 
The trial will be supervised by a monitor from SynteractHCR. The trial monitor will contact [CONTACT_460650].  
The trial monitor or a representative of the sponsor will cross-check the data entered in the 
eCRFs with the source data at the trial site and observe the trial procedures in order to verify 
adherence to the trial protocol. 
The eCRFs will be checked for completeness and correctness by [CONTACT_460651]. 
All of the clinical data will be captured via electronic data capture (EDC) using a web-based tool. 
The software Marvin from the company XClinical (www.xclinical.com/) is the preferred EDC 
software. Marvin is compliant with all legislation relevant to electronic data capture (FDA 21 
CFR Part 11, GCP). 
The investigator site staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access 
features (username [CONTACT_2383]). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The 
investigator will approve the data using an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11), and this 
approval is used to confirm the accuracy of the data recorded. 
eCRFs will be used for all patients. The investigator’s data will be accessible from the 
investigator’s site throughout the trial. The electronic CRFs must be kept current to reflect 
patient status at each phase during the course of the trial. The electronic CRF will not capture 
personalized data. The investigator must make a separate confidential record of personalized 
details (name [CONTACT_93459]) on the patient identification and enrollment log. All changes to data 
are done by [CONTACT_460652].  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460620]’s eCRF are also 
made on the patient’s medical records.

[ADDRESS_588981] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41/50 The eCRFs for any patient leaving the trial should be completed at the time of the final visit or 
shortly thereafter. 
9.3 Data management 
Data management will be performed according to SynteractHCR SOPs.

[ADDRESS_588982] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42/50 10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size 
10.1 Statistical and analysis plan 
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized that details the planned statistical 
analysis and may include necessary adaptations to the planned statistical analysis before 
unblinding of the data.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
trial report. 
10.1.1 General considerations 
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and summarized with 
statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all data collected 
up to that time point will be included into the analysis. 
Raw data listings and summary tables will be generated using the software SAS© Version [ADDRESS_588983] deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. 
Categorical efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_460653].  
10.1.2 Classification of patients to subsets 
For the statistical analysis the randomized patients will be divided up into the following datasets: 
The following definitions are applicable: 
Safety analysis set 
(SAS) all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
trial medication 
Full analysis set 
(FAS) all patients of the SAS with at least one measurement of the ADA 
titer at baseline 
Per Protocol set 
(PPS) all patients of the FAS for whom no relevant protocol deviations 
were documented 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. A secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint will be based on the PPS. Safety analysis will be based on the SAS. 
The decision whether a protocol deviation is relevant or not for the exclusion of patients from the 
PPS set will be made case-by-case in a data review meeting. 
10.1.3 Immunogenicity data 
All immunogenicity parameters will be analyzed descriptively per treatment group. No statistical 
tests are planned. Baseline ADA-positive patients will be calculated as a percentage of the total 
number of patients whose baseline samples were tested for ADA. Titer will be reported as 
median and interquartile range. 
95% confidence intervals for incidence rates and for rate differences will be given. 
Secondary immunogenicity parameters will be described with appropriate descriptive statistics 
for dichotomous, categorical or continuous variables.

[ADDRESS_588984] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43/50 10.1.4 Exposure and PD endpoints 
Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations 0-90 min from dosing: AUC 0-30min , AUC 0-90 
min, Cmax,
 and t max will be summarized with descriptive statistics. 
Plasma 
glucose profiles 0-90 min from dosing: AUE 0-30min , AUE 0-90 min , CE max, and t max will be 
summari
zed with descriptive statistics. 
Achieving a plasma glucose increase of ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/mL) within [ADDRESS_588985] results will be marked whether the result is below, within or above the 
respective reference range. The number of values outside of the reference range will be 
counted. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after 
medical coding using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AE summary 
tables will include counts and percentages of patients who experienced adverse events 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). 
Other safety data 
Vital signs, physical examination, ECG and local tolerability data will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.

All other data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRF will be listed. 
10.1.7 Withdrawals, drop-outs and missing data 
In the case of drop-outs, no imputation of values for immunogenicity measurements will be 
done. Analysis is done on valid cases only i.e. no imputation technique like LOCF (last 
observation carried forward) will be applied. 
10.1.8 Baseline and center comparisons 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared. 
10.1.9 Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses for the primariy endpoint (voerl ADA incidence) by [CONTACT_547], age, and race 
will be performed. 
10.1.10 Interim analysis 
No interim analysis is currently planned. 
10.2 Determination of sample size 
The purpose of the present trial is to generate data describing the immunogenic potential of 
dasiglucagon and GlucaGen. The ADA assays to be used in this trial are both validated, but 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3 ZP4207-[ZIP_CODE] (ZEA-DNK-[ZIP_CODE]) 
 
[ADDRESS_588986] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44/[ADDRESS_588987] been administered to the same patients within a week. 
Across the two phase 1 clinical trials and a completed phase 2 PK/PD trial, a total of [ADDRESS_588988] 
been observed. The obtained data indicate that dasiglucagon has a low risk for induction of 
ADAs in the investigated settings and as a consequence  a meaningful sample size to compare 
both treatments cannot be estimated. 
The sample size is therefore based on a certain precision of the confidence interval for the 
overall ADA incidence if no events are observed, respectively to ensure a certain probability for 
observing one event. 
When no events are observed, to obtain an upper bound of 0.050 on the 90.0% confidence 
interval for the probability of such a rare event, would require a sample size of 45. Respectively, 
accepting a chance of observing at least one event of 90% and an actual probability of the event 
of 5% leads to a sample size of 45 patients completing the trial. In order to account for drop-
outs, It is expected that 112 patients in total will be randomized and treated.

Exploratory
Part A
Overview of Study Design : This is an open- label, multicenter, parallel group , 2-arm,phase 1 study 
of MLN4924 designed to assess drug-drug interactions ( DDIs)with the moderate and strong CYP3A 
inhibitors fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively, in patients with advanced solid tumors . In the 
Fluconazole Arm, approximately 12 PK -evaluable patients will be enrolled . In the Itraconazole Arm, 
approximately 12 PK -evaluable pat ients will be enrolled in the 8- mg/m2and 20- mg/m2MLN4924 
cohorts, and 3 additional PK -evaluable patients will be needed in the safety lead -in cohort.

Confidential 5Part A : Drug-Drug Interaction Assessment
Fluconazole Arm : Patients will receive a single 8 -mg/m2 dose of MLN4924 given as a 1- hour 
(5minutes) IV infusion on Day [ADDRESS_187757] of fluconazole on the 
PK of MLN4924. Additional samples for determination of MLN4924 concentrations in whole blood 
will be collected on Day 1 only.
Itraconazole Arm: Patients will receive a sin gle dose of MLN4924 given as a 1 -hour (5minutes) 
IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 (see dose cohorts defined below) . Patients will receive concomitant 
oral itraconazole at a dose of 200 mg once daily on Days 4 through 10 . Pharmacokinetic samples 
will be ta ken after the MLN4924 dose on Day 1 and after the Day 8 dose of MLN4924 with 
itraconazole at predetermined time points (up to 72 hours after dosing) to assess the effect of 
itraconazole on the PK of MLN4924 . Additional samples for determination of MLN4924 
concentrations in whole blood will be collected on Day 1 only . The following dose cohorts will be 
enrolled sequentially within the Itraconazole Arm:
Itraconazole Arm, 8 -mg/m2MLN4924 Cohort : Patients will receive a single 8 -mg/m2dose 
of MLN4924 given as a 1-hour ( 5minutes) IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 . This low 
dose of MLN4924 is anticipated to provide an adequate safety margin for DDI assessment . 
Itraconazole Arm, Safety Lead-in 15-mg/m2MLN4924 Cohort : Patients will receive a single 
15-mg/m2dose o f MLN4924 given as a 1- hour ( 5minutes) IV infusion on Day 1 and 
Day 8. Data from this safety lead-in cohort will confirm the anticipated safety margin is 
adequate before any patients are enrolled in the 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 cohort . 
Itraconazole Arm, 20- mg/m2MLN4924 Cohort : Patients will receive a single 20 -mg/m2dose
of MLN4924 given as a 1 -hour ( 5minutes) IV infusion on Day [ADDRESS_187758] dose of fluconazole or itraconazole . 
For both the Flucon azole and Itraconazole Arm s, all doses of fluconazole and itraconazole will be 
administered on an empty stomach with the patient fasting from food and fluids, except water and 
prescribed medications, for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose . Patients are encouraged to 
take fluconazole or itraconazole doses at approximately the sa me time each morning and 
approximately 24 hours apart . On Day 8, patients will take fluconazole or itraconazole together with 
MLN4924 in the morning at the clinic.
In addition to blood sampling for PK ,blood samples in the 24 -hour postdose window of each a rm 
following dosing on Day 1 and Day 8 will be collected to measure pharmacodynamic effects of 
MLN4924. These data will be pooled with data from other MLN4924 clinical studies to contribute to 
an integrated PK -pharmacodynamic analysis across the program.
Part B : Continued Treatment With MLN4924 in Combination With Standard of Care
After completion of the DDI assessment portion of the study, patients will have the opportunity to 
continue in the study by [CONTACT_161765] B . Patients will receive MLN4924 in combination with 
either docetaxel or carboplatin +paclitaxel at adose regimen informed from Study C15010 that has 
been deemed tolerable ( eg, no dose-limiting toxicities [ DLTs ]in 3 patients or no more than 1 DLT in 
6 patients) . The selected dose may be adjusted based on information obtained from the ongoing 
review of safety data . Safety and disease assessments will be conducted in Part B of the study.

expressed developmentally  down -regulated protein 8 )-activat ing enzyme (NAE) that is 
being developed for the treatment of malignancies . NEDD8- activat ing enzyme is an 
E1-activating enzyme and is an essent ial component of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, 
which controls the activit y of a subset of ubiquit in E3ligases, mult iprotein co mplexes that 
transfer ubiquit in molecules to protein substrates that are then targeted to the proteasome for 
degradation . Cullin -dependent ubiquit in E3 ligases (CDLs) require conjugat ion to NEDD8 
to be activated . Cullin -dependent ubi quitin E3 ligases control  thetimely ubiquit ination and 
consequent proteasomal degradat ion of proteins with important roles in cell cycle 
progression and signal transduction, cellular processes that are integral to tumor cell growth, 
proliferat ion, and survival . Inhibitors of NAE acti vity may be of therapeut ic value in the

MLN4924 treatment of cultured tumor cells resulted in growth inhibit ion of a wide variety  
of cell lines . Changes in protein levels observed in cultured cells treated with MLN4924 
were consistent with the inhibit ion of NAE, in particular a decrease i n NEDD8 -cullin levels 
and a reciprocal increase in the levels o f known CDL substrates, including NFE2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2) and chromat in-licensing and DNA -replicat ion factor -1 (Cdt -1). In most cell 
lines evaluated, NAE inhibit ion by [CONTACT_161767]4924 led to DNA r e-replicat ion and accumulat ion 
of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle; this resulted in DNA damage and subsequent cell 
death through apoptosis.(1, 2, 3)  
MLN4924 demo nstrated pharmacodynamic and antitumor activit y in so lid tumor, 
lympho ma, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) xenograft models when ad ministered 
to immunocompro mised mice by [CONTACT_51211] (SC) route . 
Detailed informat ion regarding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxi cology of MLN4924
may be found in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) .

Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment [ADDRESS_187790] been 
studi ed in Sprague -Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomo lgus mo nkeys, and chimpanzees . 
Hepati c metabolism appears to be the major route of eliminat ion for MLN4924 in animal 
species . Urinary  excretion of  unchanged MLN4924 was found to be low (< 5%) in rats and 
primates . 
MLN4924 is metabolized in vitro via hydroxylat ion oxi dation, predominant ly by 
[CONTACT_161770] e P450 (CYP) 3A4 with a small (3%) contribut ion from CYP2D6 . In vitro studies 
with efflux pum p inhibitors dem onstrated that MLN4924 is a substrate for P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and mult idrug resistance associated protein 
2 (MRP2) . However, MLN4924 is a weak inhibitor of P -gp (concentration producing 
50% inhibit ion [IC50][paclitaxel and digoxin] of 41.2 -56.0 M) and BCRP (IC 50[estrone -
3-sulfate ] of 6.3 M) but is not likely to inhibit MRP2 (IC 50200M). Addit ional studi es 
with organ ic anio n-transporting polypeptides (OATP) in sandwich -cultured human 
hepatocy tes showed that MLN4924 can inhibit the hepat ic uptake of estrone -
3-sulfate (IC 50
of 29.1 M) andof simvastatin (IC 50 of 0.4-4.9 M) and lovastatin (IC 50of 0.9 M) from 
some, bu t not all, donors . Taking these data together and based on observed single -dose 
maximum (peak) concentration (C max)values at doses ≤ 110 mg/m2, MLN4924 is unlikely  to 
interact wi th P-gp substrates, butthe potenti al exists, albei t low, f or drug interactio ns with 
BCRP and OATP substrates at clinical concentrations.
1.3.2 Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinet ics (PK) of MLN4924 administered as an 1
-hour intravenous ( IV)
infusio n have been evaluated fo llowing single and mult iple doses in adult patients with 
nonhematologic malignancies (Study C15001) ;adult pati ents wi th lympho ma or mult iple 
myelo ma (Study C15002) ;adult pati ents wi th AML, hi gh-grade myelodysplasti c syndrom es 
(MDS ), or acute lymphoblast ic leukemia ( ALL ) (Study  C15003) ;and adul t pati ents wi th 
melano ma (Study C15005) . 
Pharmacokinet ic results showed that MLN4924 PK is linear over the dose range studied as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_161771] t ime zero to 
24hours ( AUC 0-24hr)increasing proportionately with dose sfrom 25 to 261 mg/m2. The p eak 
concentration (theoretically end -of-infusio n concentration) generally  appeared to increase in 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 31proporti on wi th dose, al though m oderate to l arge interindividual variabilit y (IIV) was 
apparent . MLN4924 plasma concentrations de clined in a bi -exponent ial manner at the end of 
infusio n, wi th little or no notabl e drug accum ulation following once -daily dosing for 
5consecutive days or more intermittent dosing (ie, Day s 1, 3, and 5; Days 1, 2, 8, and 9; 
Days 1, 8, and 15; Days 1 and 8 ; or Day s 1, 4, 8, and 11) . Thi s is consistent with a mean 
terminal eliminat ionhalf-life(t1/2)of approximately  10to 11 hoursestimated across doses 
and schedules . Addit ionally , a preliminary  popul ation PK analysis indicated that MLN4924 
systemic cleara nce(CL) (IIV in CL~ 27% coefficient of variation [ CV]) and vo lume o f 
distribut ion(Vss)(IIV central vo lume ~ 43% CV; IIV peripheral vo lume ~ 28% CV) appear 
to increase wit h increasing body size ( body  surface area [ BSA ] range 1.48- 2.72 m2) 
supporting BSA -norm alized dosing in minimizing variabilit y in exposure.
Addit ional information on the non clinical and clinical PK of MLN4924 is provided in the 
IB.
1.4 MLN4924 Clinical Experience
Single-agent MLN4924 has been studied in 4 phase 1 clinical trials in pat ients wi th 
advanced nonhematologic malignancies (Study  C15001); lymphom a and m ultiple myelo ma 
(Study  C15002); AML, MDS, or ALL (Study  C15003); and melanoma (Study  C15005) . 
These were all single -agent, dose -escalation studies . Based on informat ion available as of 
02April 2013, 22 7patients were enrolled into these studies, and safet y data are available 
and summarized for 2 24of these pati ents (i e, those included in the Safety popul ation). 
MLN4924 was administered as a 1 -hour IV infusio n in these protocols . Six dosing schedules 
using a 21 -day cycle were assessed across these studies (dosing on Days 1 -5; Days 1, 3, and 
5; Days 1 and 8; Days 1, 2, 8, and 9; Days 1, 8, and 15; and Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) in a 
coordinated fashio n. 
Study  C15001 was conducted in 62 pa tients wi th solid tum ors. The median age o f the 
patients included in the Safety popul ation was 59.5 years, with a rangefrom 34 to 84 y ears. 
One pat ient (a 45 -year-old man wi th metastati c melanom a and bone and lung involvement) 
had a partial response (PR) on Schedule A (Days 1 -5) at a dose of 25 mg/m2. In addit ion, 
13patients wi th the f ollowing solid tum ors rem ained on treatm ent for at l east [ADDRESS_187791] response of stable disease (SD) that lasted for up to 9cycles : colorectal  
carcino ma(6),melanoma (3), breast cancer (2), and small cell lung cancer ( SCLC )and head 
and neck cancer (1 each) (C15001 Clinical Study  Report [CSR ]).

Confidential 32Study  C15002 began in June 2008, and 5 6patients wi th multiple myel oma (21) or 
lympho ma (3 5) were enrolled . The median age of the pat ients included in the Safety 
popul ation was 60.0 y ears, with a rangefrom 26 to 9 0years . As of 30 September 2013, 
3PRs were observed in this study  at doses of 110 to 196 mg/m2: 1 pati ent each wi th diffuse 
large B -cell lymphom a (DL BCL), Hodgkin lymphoma, and peripheral T- cell lympho ma. 
The patient with DLBCL achieved PR in Cycle 3, and the duration of this response was 
134days. 
Study  C15003 began in July  2009, and 72 pati ents were enrolled as of 28 October 2013 in 
this phase 1 stu dy evaluat ing single -agent MLN4924 in several 21- day dosing schedules in 
patients wi th AML (patients with MDS and ALL were also evaluated in this study ). For 
Schedule A (Days 1, 3, and 5), 4 dose levels were determined safe : 25, 33, 44, and 
59mg/m2. The m aximum  tolerated dose (MTD) for Schedule A was established at 59 mg/m2
based on a dose-limiting toxici ty 
(DLT) of increased transaminases observed at a dose level 
of 78 mg/m2. Dosing in Schedule B (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) was de- escalated to 110 mg/m2
based on 2 serious adverse events (SAEs) for patients dosed at 147 mg/m2: 1fatal (acute 
renal failure) and 1 life threatening (cardiac failure) . The dose was subsequently reduced to 
83 m g/m2to further enhance the safet y margin . Schedule C (Days 1, 8, and 15) w as tested in 
2 pati ents (both received only 1 cycle of treatment), and Schedule D (Day s 1, 4, 8, and 11 in

A co mprehensive review of the clinical trial safet y data has shown that toxicit y involving 
multi-organ failure on Cy cle 1, Day  1, including SAE s of renal, hepat ic, and cardiac failure, 
some wi th a fatal outcome, has been observed in MLN4924 studies . Based on the 
observat ion that these events are associated with higher MLN4924 doses, the s ponsor has 
determined that newly enrolling patients will receive MLN4924 at doses equal to or below 
100 m g/m2. Our current understanding of the renal toxicit y observed wit h MLN4924 
suggests that it is not a primary event ;itis likely secondary to hemodyna mic changes 
occurring in the setting of a t ype of acute phase response . Pati ents will be monitored closely  
for events of m ulti-organ failure after MLN4924 dosing . 
In October 2012, a revised risk mit igation strategy  including dose reduction was 
implemented across the MLN4924 program . As of January 2014, approximately

Confidential 361.5 Study Rationale
1.5.1 Ration ale for Drug -drug Interaction Assessment (Part A)
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Rationale
Hepati c metabo lism appears to be the major route of eliminat ion for MLN4924. While no 
definit ive informat ion is current ly available on the eliminat ion pathways of MLN4924 in 
humans, urinar y excreti on of  unchanged MLN4924 was found to be low (< 5%) in rats and 
primates . In vitro drug metabo lism data indicate that MLN4924 is metabo lized via 
hydroxylation and oxidation, predominant ly by [CONTACT_097]3A4 . The estimated contribut ion of 
CYP3A4 to MLN4924 b iotransform ation(97%) is largely above the 25% threshold o f 
potenti al clinical  relevance for drug -drug interactions (DDI s) based on [LOCATION_002] (US)
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency guidance 
docum ents.(5, 6)
MLN4924 is in fact considered to be a sensit ive CYP3A substrate as phy siologically based 
PK m odeling and simulat ion predict an 8 -to12-fold increase in area under the plasma 
concentration versus t ime curve (AUC) when co -administered with the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor probe , ketoconazole . CYP3A i s a maj or subclass of the CYP enzymes ,accounting 
for morethan 30% of total CYP proteins in the liver . Given the likelihood of a posit ive 
interact ion between MLN4924 and a strong CYP3A inhibitor that may result in a clinically 
meaningful increase in MLN4924 exposure due to inhibit ion of CYP3A -mediated hepat ic 
metabolism following IV administrati on, the impact of a less strong (or moderate) CYP3A 
inhibitor will also be evaluated . 
For drugs that distribute into red blood cells, the blood to 
plasma (B/P) rati o is important for estimat ion of in vivo hepat ic metabo licclearance; 
however, the value is not always available . In vi tro studi es showed that MLN4924 
partitioned extensively  into ery throcytes wi th a B/P rati o that i s concentrati on-depend ent and 
saturable . Limi ted bl ood sam pling will be performed in this study  for in vivo determinat ion 
of B/P ratio and to inform est imation of human blo od cl earance . Unt il the magnitude of such 
potenti al interact ions is characteri zed in a clinical DDI study , co-administration of moderate 
and strong CYP3A inhibitors is not currently permi tted in the ongoing clinical studies of 
MLN4924 . 
Fluconazo le and i traconazol e, [ADDRESS_187805] ively, that are recom mended in regulatory  
guidelines.(5, 6)Fluconazo le is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes

Confidential 37[QD]) administration o f fluconazo le has been shown to increase the AUC of orally 
administered midazo lam up to 3.9 -fold, which meets the criterion for a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor.(7)  There is no effect of food on the oral bioavailabilit y of fluconazole tablets.(8)  
Itraconazole (200 mg QD), another validated inhibitor probe, was in fact chosen in place of 
ketoconazo le based on recent FDA communicat ions advising against its use for drug 
interact ion studies due serious side ef fects (fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety /ucm 371017.ht m, 
FDA advises against using oral ketoconazole in drug interaction studies due to serious 
potenti al side effects, Accessed 13 January  2014) .(9)  Itraconazo le is commercially available 
as an oral solution or as capsules.(10)  Results from a cross -study co mpar ison of so lution and 
capsules indicated that when these 2 oral formulat ions are administered under opt imal 
condi tionsfor absorpti on, the bi oavailabilit y of the oral  solution relative to the capsules is 
higher . Consequent ly, and in accordance wit h the FDA DDI Guidance for Industry , the oral  
solution of itraconazo le administered on an empt y stomach is selec ted for thi s study .(5)  Use 
of these CYP3A4 inhibitor probes belo nging to the class of azo le ant ifungal agents in this 
study  is most appropri ate as they  are relevant to the target (A ML) patient populat ion.
Results fro m this study  will inform strategi es for manag ingpotenti al DDI swith moderate
and strong CYP3A inhibitors in future clinical studies of MLN4924 and addit ionally 
contribute to the long -term clinical  pharm acology objectivesof the MLN4924 development

[IP_ADDRESS] MLN4924 Dose Rationale for Part A
In phase [ADDRESS_187806] been receiving MLN4924 administered IV at doses 
ranging from 25 to 278 mg/m2on m ultiple schedules for up to [ADDRESS_187807] igated in patients with solid tumors in 2 phase 1 studi es:

In Study C15001, sequent ial cohorts of pat ients received MLN4924 as a 1-hour infusion on 
4different schedules . Of these schedules, the 2 in which MLN4924 was administered on 
Days 1, 3, and 5 on a 21 -day cycle were generally better tolerated than those wi th once -daily  
dosing on 5 consecut ive days at lower doses ,or higher doses adminis tered once weekly  with 
a longer infusio n. Commo n toxi cities were di arrhea, nausea, vo miting, and increased LFT s.

Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 38After cross -program review, patients in ongoing and future studies will receive MLN4924 at 
doses equal to or below 100 mg/m2. 
The IV dose of M LN4924 (8 mg/m2) selected for the study  is approximately 14 -fold lower 
than starting doses of MLN4924 equal to or above 110 mg/m2,which were associated with 
an increased frequency o f severe Cycle 1 ,Day 1 adverse events (AEs) in phase [ADDRESS_187809] of this DDI assessment, based on the predicted 8 -to 12 -fold increase in MLN4924 
systemic exposure (AUC) upon strong CYP3A inhibit ion by [CONTACT_161774]. The expectation is based on model- based simulations of DDI potential 
(SimCYP®) using in vitro data on relat ive contribution of CYP3A to overall metabo lism, in 
vivo precli nical informat ion on drug disposit ion, and clinical PK data available to date on 
MLN4924 . 
On the basis of emerging data from this study, the primary purpose of Amendment [ADDRESS_187810] 4924 PK at 
the clinically  relevant dose of 20 mg/m2. The informat ion from this addi tional Itraconazol e 
Arm will provide further understanding of the contribution of CYP3A metabolism to the 
disposi tion of  MLN4924 in humans within the clinically relevant dos e range in support of 
adequate labeling. 
The proposed single IV dose of MLN4924, 20 mg/m2, is approximately 5 -fold lower than 
doses of MLN4924 equal to or above 110 mg/m2, which were associated with more severe 
Cycle 1 Day  1 adverse events in phase 1 stud ies of MLN4924 . Also, based on the 
dose-linear PK of MLN4924 and observed 23% increase in MLN4924 plasma systemic 
exposur e by [CONTACT_161775] e at a single 8- mg/m2dose, i t can be inferred that exposures of 
MLN4924 w hen administered at a single 20 -mg/m2dose wi th itraconazol e can be expected 
to be well below exposures seen at doses ≥ 110 mg/m2. Conservat ively, enro llment into the 
Itraconazole Arm, 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 C ohort will  begin once Part A PK and safet y data 
from 3 PK-evaluable patients treated with 15 -mg/m2MLN4924 +itraconazo le, as an 
intermediate safet y lead-in step, have confi rmedthat the anticipated safet y margin is 
adequate for the proposed evaluation o f the drug interaction with itraconazo le at the 
20-mg/m2dose of MLN4924 .

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Rat ionale
After complet ingPart A, pati ents are given the opportunit y to parti cipate in Part B where 
theywill receive co mbinat ion treatment with MLN4924 and SoC chemotherapy . 
Two chemotherapy regimens ,docetaxel and carbopl atin+pacli taxel ,will be used in th is 
study  as combinat ion partners with MLN4924. These regimens have been approved and are 
considered SoC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_161734] -line or relapsed/refractory 
settings.
Docetaxel is indicated as a single agent for locally advanced or metas tatic breast cancer and 
for locally  advanced or m etastati c NSCLC after platinum therapy failure . 
Paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of co mbinat ion 
chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse wit hin [ADDRESS_187813] atin is indicated for the init ial treatment of advanced ovarian carcino ma in 
combinat ion with other approved chemotherapeut ic agents (one established co mbinat ion 
regimen consists of carboplat in and cyclophosphamide) . Carbopl atin is also indicated for the 
palliat ive treatment of patients wit h ovarian carcinoma recurrent after prior chemotherapy , 
including patients who have been previously  treated wi th cisplat in.
Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and carboplatin are also approved in co mbinat ion with other 
chemotherapeut ic agents to treat other indicat ions; refer to package inserts for addit ional 
inform ation. 
In addit ion to the approved indicat ions outlined above, these agents are widely used in a 
variet y of malignancies in pat ients for whom  prior therapi [INVESTIGATOR_161733]. Carbopl atin/
paclitaxel is also wid ely used f or treatm ent of newly  diagnosed NSCLC.
For a detailed description o f each of these medicat ions, please see Section 6.11. The choice 
of the above chemotherapy
 agents in combinat ion with MLN4924 in this study  is based on 
the following considerat ions:
These agents have been well recognized as SoC in a number of malignancies in 
front -line (carboplat in+pacli taxel) or i n various relapse settings (both regimens) . 
Their safet y profiles, ri sks, and benefit s have been wi dely studi ed and reported.
Addit ive/synergist ic effect of these agents in combinat ion with MLN4924 has been 
studi ed in a number of in vitro and in vivo models in house.
Therefore, it is thought that the above SoCs will serve as reasonable partners in combinat ion 
with MLN4924 for invest igations in patients with various so lid tumors in this study . 
As di scussed in Sect ion 1.4,MLN4924 in co mbination with SoC is current ly being

Potenti al risks that are derived from findings in animal studies in rats and dogs include:
Cardi ovascular changes that could result in tachycardia, decreased or increased 
systolic blood pressure, and increased diastolic blo od pressure .
Myocardial  degenerat ion and thrombosis .
Pulmo nary hypertensio n.
Effects on the testes and ovaries that represe nt a reproductive hazard, including 
sterilit y.
Increased developmental risk to the fetus or embryo.
Decreased trabecular bone (graded minimal to moderate) was noted in the femur and 
in the sternum in rats at all dose groups (low, medium, andhigh) . This fi nding was 
considered adverse in the high -dose group; however, no bone fractures were noted at 
any of the doses.
Prolongati on of  the act ivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) .
Local  tissue injury when administered SC .
Hepatotoxicit y has been noted fo llowing administration of MLN4924 in pat ients with 
advanced malignancy, including elevat ions of liver transaminases, ALP, and bilirubin
(seeSecti on 1.4). Liver enzymes and liver funct ion are frequently mo nitored du ring clinical 
studi es of  MLN4924 . Acetaminophen and acetaminophen -containing compounds may not 
be used in Part A; however, they  may be used judiciously in Part B and should not exceed a 
dose of 2 g of acetaminophen in a
24-hour period (see Section 6.5).
Patients m ust be carefully  evaluated at screening and before each MLN4924 dose for early 
symptoms and signs of hemodynamic co mpromise or active infect ion. Parti cular attenti on 
shoul d be paid to unexplained fever, tachy cardi a, hypotensi on, orthostasi s, tachypnea, recent

1.6.2 Risks of Fluconazole Treatment 
Anaphylaxis
In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported in patients who received fluconazo le (brand 
name [CONTACT_161823]®). Patients have r arely  devel oped exfo liative skin disorders during 
treatm ent wi th fluconazo le. In pati ents wi th serious underlying di seases (predominant ly 
acqui red immunodeficiency syndrome and m alignancy), these have rarely  resul ted in a fatal  
outcom e. 
Cardiac Dysrhythmi as
Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated w ith prolongation of the 
QT interval on the electrocardiogram . During post -marketing surveillance, there 
have been rare cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients taking 
fluconazo le. Most of these reports involved seriously ill patients w ith multiple 
confounding risk factors, such as structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, 
and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.(8)
Hepatotoxicity Warning
DIFLUCAN should be administered w ith caution to patients w ith liver dysfunction . 
DIFLUCAN has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, 
including fatalities primarily in patients w ith serious underlying medical conditions . 
In cases of DIFLUCAN -associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total 
daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. 
DIFLUCAN hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on 
discontinuation of therapy . Patients w ho develop abnormal liver function tests 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 46during DIFLUCAN therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe 
hepati c injury . Fluconazole should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to DIFLUCAN.(8)

Drug Interaction Precautions
See the DIFLUCAN USPI [INVESTIGATOR_161736]: Drug Interaction 
Studi es and CONTRAINDICATIONS for addit ional informat ion.
Fluconazo le is a potent inhibitor of CYP isoenzyme 2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of 
CYP 3A4; therefore, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other 
compounds m etabo lized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 and CYP3A4 co -administered with fluconazole
(seeSecti on6.5). 
Risks of MLN4924 and Fluconazole as Comb ination Therapy
Based on the known individual safet y profiles of MLN4924 and fluconazo le, the fo llowing 
potenti al risks of combinati on therapy  may apply : headache, abdo minal pain, nausea, 
diarrhea, and serum transaminase elevat ions. 
1.6.3 Risks of Itraconazole Treatment
Congestive Heart Failure and Cardiac Effects 
When itraconazo le(SPORANOX®)was administered intravenously to dogs and healt hy 
human volunteers, negat ive inotropic effects were seen . 
SPORANOX®(itraconazole) oral solution should not be administered to patients 
with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a 
history of CHF except for the treatment of life -threatening or other serious 
infections.(10)  
If signs or symptom s of congest ive heart failure occur during administration of itraconazole 
oral solution, continued use should be reassessed.

pulmo nary edema), and addit ional information on the negat ive inotropic effects of 
itraconazo le when co -administered with calcium channel blockers.
Hepatotoxicity Warning
SPORANOX®has been associated w ith rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, 
including liver failure and death . Some of thes e cases had neither pre -existing liver 
disease nor a serious underlying medical condition and some of these cases 
developed w ithin the first w eek of treatment . If clinical signs or symptoms develop 
that are consistent w ith liver disease, treatment should b e discontinued and liver 
function testing performed. Continued itraconazole oral solution use is strongly 
discouraged unless there is a serious or life -threatening situation w here the expected 
benefit exceeds the risk .(10)

Premedication for Docetaxel -Associated Hypersensitivity or Other Acute Reactions 
Guidelines
Prem edicat ion to prevent docetaxel- associated (hypersensit ivity or other) reactions is 
recommended according to inst itutional guidelines or l ocal practices. For example, patients 
may be treated with dexamethasone (Decadron, 4 mg twice da ilyfor 3 days), which should 
start [ADDRESS_187848] atin administration.(12)
If a patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is estimated based on serum 
creatinine measurements by [CONTACT_161790], FDA recommends that physicians consider cappi[INVESTIGATOR_161742] (AUC) to avoid potential toxicity due to overdosing . Based on 
the Calvert formula described in the carboplatin label, the maximum doses can be 
calcula ted as:
Total Carboplatin Dose (mg)= (target AUC) (GFR +25) [Calvert formula]
Maximum Carboplatin Dose (mg) =target AUC (mg min/mL) (150 mL/min)
The maximum dose is based on a GFR estimate that is capped at 125 mL/min for 
patients w ith normal renal func tion. No higher estimated GFR values should be 
used.

6.7.2 Fluconazole
Pregnancy
Fluconazo le single 150 -mg tablet when used for candidiasis is classified as Pregnancy 
Category  C. For all other indicat ions, fluconazo le isclassified as Pregnancy Category  D. 
Use in Pregnancy : There are no adequate and w ell-controlled studies of DIFLUCAN
in pregnant w omen . Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of 
congenital anomalies follow ing a single maternal dose of [ADDRESS_187869] congenital anomalies in infants 
exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400 –800 mg/day) during most 
or all of the first trimester . The features seen in these infants include: b rachycephaly, 
abnormal facies, abnormal calvarial development, cleft palate, femoral bow ing, thin 
ribs and long bones, arthrogryposis, and congenital heart disease . These effects are 
similar to those seen in animal studies . If this drug is used during preg nancy or if the 
patient becomes pregnant w hile taking the drug, the patient should be informed of 
the potential hazard to the fetus (See PRECAUTIONS, Pregn ancy ).(8
)
Geriatric Use 
Of the most frequently reported (> 1%) side effects, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea 
occurred in greater proportions of older patients.
Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients 
aged 65 and older to evaluate w hether they respond differently from younger 
patients in each indication . Other reported clinical experience has not identified 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.(8)

Confidential 786.7.3 Itraconazole 
Pregnancy
Itraconazole is a pregnancy Cate gory C drug . Please refer to the itraconazole USPI(10)for 
more inform ation.
Itraconazole was found to cause a dose -related increase in maternal toxicity, 
embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 
40-160 mg/kg/day (5–20x MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 
80mg/kg/day (10x MRHD) . In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal 
defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia . 
There are no studies in pregnant w omen . 
SPORANOX should be used in pregnancy 
only if the benefit outw eighs the potential risk . 
During post -marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been 
reported . (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience.)(10)
Geriatric U se 
Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving 
treatment w ith itraconazole . Several of these reports included concurrent 
administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (see BOX WARNING : Drug 
Interactions, CONT RAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Drug Interactions) . Itraconazole should be used w ith care in elderly patients (see 
PRECAUTIONS).(10)
6.7.4 Docetaxel
Pregnancy
TAXOTERE is a pregnancy Category  D drug . Please refer to the TAXOTERE USPI [INVESTIGATOR_161751].
TAXOTERE can cause fetal harm w hen administered to a pregnant w oman . 
Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxic ities including intrauterine mortality w hen 
administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis . 
Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low  as 1/50 and 1/[ADDRESS_187870] to the fetus . Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant during therapy w ith TAXOTERE.(11)  
Geriatric Use
In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the 
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of 
concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients.
Please see the Docetaxel USPI(11)for addi tional inform ation on geri atric use in different 
types of  cancer.

Geriatric Us e
Of the 789 patients in initial treatment combination therapy studies (NCIC and 
SWOG), 395 patients w ere treated with carboplatin in combination w ith 
cyclophosphamide . Of these, 141 w ere over 65 years of age and 22 w ere 75 years or 
older . In these trials, age w as not a prognostic factor for survival . In terms of safety, 
elderly patients treated w ith carboplatin were more likely to develop severe 
thrombocytopenia than younger patients . In a combined database of 1,942 patients 
(414 were 65 years of age) tha t received single -agent carboplatin for different 
tumor types, a similar incidence of adverse events was seen in patients 65 years and 
older and in patients less than 65 . Other reported clinical experience has not 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 80identified differences in responses betwee n elderly and younger patients, but greater 
sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out . Because renal function is 
often decreased in the elderly, renal function should be considered in the selection of 
carboplatin dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMI NISTRATION).
Please see the Carboplat in USPI(12)for addi tional information.
6.7.[ADDRESS_187872] ion USPI [INVESTIGATOR_161751].
Paclitaxel Injection, USP can cause fetal harm w hen administered to a pregnant 
woman . Administration of paclitaxel during the period of organogenesis to rabbits at 
doses of 3 mg/kg/day (about 0.2 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a 
mg/m2basis) caused embryo- and fetotoxicity, as indicated by [CONTACT_161798], 
increased resorptions and increased fetal deaths.
Maternal toxicity w as also observed at this dose . No teratogenic effects w ere 
observed at 1 mg/kg/day (about 1/15 the daily maximum recommended human dose 
on a mg/m2basis); teratogenic potential could not be assessed at higher doses due to 
extensive fetal mortality.
There are no adequate and well -controlle d studies in pregnant w omen . If Paclitaxel 
Injection, USP, is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant w hile 
receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the 
fetus . Women of childbearing potential should b e advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant.(13)  
Geriatric Use 
Of [ADDRESS_187873] cancer study, 649 patients (17%) w ere 65 years or older and 
49 patie nts (1%) w ere [ADDRESS_187874] studies, severe myelosuppression 
was more frequent in elderly patients; in some studies, severe neuropathy was more 
common in elderly patients . In tw o clinical studies in NSCLC, the elderly patients 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 81treated w ith pac litaxel had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events . Estimates of 
efficacy appeared similar in elderly patients and in younger patients; how ever, 
comparative efficacy cannot be determined w ith confidence due to the small number 
of elderly patients stud ied. In a study of first -line treatment of ovarian cancer, 
elderly patients had a low er median survival than younger patients, but no other 
efficacy parameters favored the younger group.
Please see the Paclitaxel USPI(13)for addi tional inform ation.
6.8 Guidance for Clinical Assessmen t and Management of Hemodynamic 
Compromise (Part A and Part B)
It is essential that the patient is carefully evaluated at screening and before each 
MLN4924 dose for early symptoms and signs of hemodynamic compromise and active 
infection . Particular attention should be paid to unexplained fever, tachycardia, 
hypotension, orthostasis, tachypnea, recent nausea and vomiting, and clinical evidence 
of dehydration . 
For those patients for whom there is a concern of dehydration, the following guidance 
for rehydration before MLN4924 dosing may be considered : 500 mL/hour of 0.5 N 
saline given over 2 to 4 hours for a total of 1 to 2 L of fluid as clinically appropriate; 
each infusion of IV fluids should be recorded in the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs).
For all patients with anemia, and especially for patients with hemoglobin values 
< 9g/dL at screening or during the conduct of the study, red blood cell transfusions 
should be considered before MLN4924 dosing based on the patient’s risk of inadequate 
oxygenation, underlying cardiopulmonary status, clinical judgment, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159698]; each red blood cell transfusi on should be recorded in the eCRFs .
Patients who experience signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise after 
MLN4924 dosing (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, changes in mental status, 
syncope, and dizziness) should be followed closely and manag ed with supportive care ,
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161752] . 
Patients who experience an untoward reaction with MLN4924 should be followed 
closely on subseque nt dosing.

of similar or other AEs upon subsequent dosing of MLN4924.
6.9.1 Guidance for Use of Granulocyte -Colony Stimulating Factor
Use of growth factors such as granulocyte -colony stimulat ing factor (G -CSF) are permitted 
at the investigator’s discret ion. If G -CSF is used, it should be used in accordance wit h the 
Revised American Societ y of Clinical Oncol ogy guidelines.(16
)
6.9.2 Guidance fo r Clinical Assessment and Management of Anemia
Transfusio n and/or ery thropoi etin may be given as clinically indicated for the treatment of 
anemia . These shoul d be recorded in the eCRFs.
For all patients with anemia, and especially  for patients wi th hemoglo bin values < 9 g/dL at 
screening or during the conduct of the study , red blood cell transfusio ns shoul d be 
considered before MLN4924 dosing based on the patient’s risk of inadequate oxy genati on, 
underlying cardiopulmo nary status, clinical judgment, and hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]; each red 
blood cell transfusio n should be recorded i n the eCRFs . Transfusions should be conducted 
before study  drug administrati on (ie,at least 1 day before dosing).

8.1.1 Drug -Drug Interaction Assessment
Assessments for the DDI portion of the study  (Part A) will include the fo llowing:
For the MLN4924 -fluconazo le DDI assessment, the ratios of geometric mean Cmax, 
AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-infof MLN4924 (in the presence of fl uconazo le on Day 8 vs in 
the absence of fluconazole on Day  1) and associated 2-sided 90% CIs will be 
calculated based on the within- patient variance calcul ated by [CONTACT_134245] .
For the MLN4924 -itraconazole DDI assessment, the ratios of geometric mean Cmax, 
AUC 0-last,and AUC 0
-infof MLN4924 (in the presence of itraconazole on Day  8 vs in 
the absence of itraconazole on Day  1) and associated 2-sided 90% CIs will be 
calculated based on the within- patient variance calcul ated by[CONTACT_134245] . 
Individual values and descript ive stati stics of MLN4924 plasma concentration time 
data and PK parameters will be listed and tabulated (see Section 8.1.8 )
 by [CONTACT_53813], 
in the presence and absence of the inhibitor ( fluconazo le or itraconazole).
8.1.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is ant icipated that as many as approximately  52patients will  be enrolled in this study .
The sample size calculat ion is based on the expected 2 -sided 90% CI for the difference in 
the pai red, l og transform ed AUC (or C max) means of MLN4924 on Day  1 (MLN4924 al one) 
and Day 8 (MLN4924 co -administered with CYP3A inhibitor) . Based on the PK 
inform ation obtained from Schedules B and C of Study  C15001, the within -subject CVwas 
estimated to be 0.12 for AUC and 0.17 for C max, respec tively. Assuming thatthe AUC (or 
Cmax) rati o in the presence of fluconazole versus in the absence of fluconazo le or in the 
presence of itraconazo le versus in the absence of itraconazole is 2.0, with a sample size of 
12 evaluable patients per arm, the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means is expected to be 
(1.833, 2.182) for AUC and (1.759, 2.274) for C max based on the above discussed variance 
assumpt ions. If the geo metric mean AUC (or C max) rati o isX, the corresponding 90% CI is 
expected to be (1.833X/2, 2.182X/2) (or [1.759X/2, 2.274X/2]).
In the Fluconazo le Arm, approximately  12 PK -evaluable pat ients will be enrolled. In the 
Itraconazole Arm, approximately 12 PK -evaluable pat ients will be enrolled in the 8 -mg/m2
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 99and 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 cohorts, and 3 addit ional PK -evaluable pat ients will be needed in

specified dosing and PK assessments without dose reductions in Part A . Patients who are not 
PKevaluable (see Section 8.1.4 ) will be replaced . Assuming that 25% of the enrolled 
patients will  not be PK evaluable, approximately 52patients will be enrolled to provide the 
total intended number of PK-evaluable pat ients in each arm of Part A.

and PK parameters will be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_161810] 1 of 
Part A (MLN4924 alone) and Day 8 of Part A (MLN4924 co -administered with either 
fluconazo leor itraconazole ). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of MLN4924 with and without the 
inhibitor (fluconazo le or itraconazole )in individual patients will be ca lculated using 
nonco mpart mental methods . Pharmacokinetic parameters include ,but are not limited to ,
Cmax, Tmax, AUC 0-last, t1/2(as permitted by  [CONTACT_26739]), CL, V ss,and AUC 0-inf(as permitted by  
[CONTACT_26739]) . The B/P ratio of MLN4924 will also be derived fro m plasma and whol e blood 
concentration data.
Descript ive statistics of MLN4924 plasma concentration time data and PK parameters will 
be tabulated by  [CONTACT_161811] (i e, Day  1 or Day  8 wi th or wi thout the

No formal interim analysis is planned . There will be an ongoing review of safet y data wi th 
the medical mo nitor and study  invest igators . 
A preliminary  PK analysis will be conducted af ter the first 4to 8patients have co mpleted 
the Fluconazol e Arm(MLN4924 +fluco nazole) of Part A . After review of the emerging data
from the Fluconazo le Arm, pati ent assi gnment to the first cohort in the Itraconazo le Arm 
(8-mg/m2MLN4924 +itraconazole) will be init iated. Dose modificat ions of MLN4924 in the 
Itraconazole Arm may be reconsidered based on the magnitude of the interaction with the 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor fluconazo le and the abilit y to accurately  estimate PK param eters 
for DDI eval uation.
Following complet ion of th efirst 3 pati ents in the Itraconazole Arm, 
8-mg/m2MLN4924 
Cohort , preliminary PK data will be reviewed to guide expansio n of the Itraconazole Arm to 
the total intended number of 12 PK -evaluable pat ients. If these emerging preliminary PK 
data indicate that the magnitude of the interaction with the strong CYP3A inhibitor 
itraconazo le reaches the ant icipated approximately 10
-fold change, and individual drug 
exposures do not exceed those seen at doses of MLN4924 110mg/m2, then up to 
[ADDRESS_187907] 4 to 6 PK -evaluable pat ientswill be enrolled . If the 
magnitude of the interaction with the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole is much greater 
than ant icipated (greater than the predefined safet y margin of 14 -fold),with individual 
MLN4924 exposures exceeding those seen at doses of MLN4924 110 m g/m2, then no 
additional patients will be enrolled in the Itraconazol e Armof Part A .

data will be reviewed to inform expansio n of the Itraconazole Arm to the total intended 
number of 12 PK -evaluable patients in the 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 Cohort . If the preliminary 
PK data fr om the safet y lead-in cohort indicate that the magnitude of the inte raction between 
the proposed 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 dose and the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole would 
be greater than the predefined safet y margin (5 -fold, with individual MLN4924 exposures
potenti ally exceeding those seen at doses of MLN4924 110 m g/m2), then no pati ents will  
be enrolled in the 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 Cohort . Dosing wit h intermediate doses of 
MLN4924 and/or evaluat ion of the drug interaction wi th the m oderate CYP3A inhibitor,

Confidential [ZIP_CODE].1.2 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product . This incl udes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous condi tion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c interv ention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline . 
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to a n AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event . It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct no rmal life functi ons).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropr iate medical  judgment, m ay jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent [ADDRESS_187909] ious agent . 
Examples of such medical events includ e allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 106treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious particle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent . 
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010.(15)  Clar ification should be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous . The general term severe
is often used to describe the inte nsity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). Thi s is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious . For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considere d Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious . Seri ousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously repo rted by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  [CONTACT_16037], physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 10.3 for the 
period of  observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE . When possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted a s 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion10.1)
 
must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation) by  [CONTACT_53342] (contact [CONTACT_53343]) . This shoul d be done by [CONTACT_51260] [ADDRESS_187910] Information
Planned hospi [INVESTIGATOR_161757] t existed
before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condit ion 
deteri orated in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery  was perform ed earlier or 
later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, t he invest igator must determine both the intensit y of 
the event and the relat ionship of the event to study  drug administrati on. For serious 
pretreatm ent events, the invest igator must determine both the intensit y of the event and the 
relationship of the even t to study  procedures.
Intensit y for each AE, including any lab abnormality , will  be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 .(15)  The criteria are provided in the 
Study  Manual.
Relationship to study  drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_161815] : Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the AE is associ ated wi th the 
study  drug?
10.3 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study as fo llows: 
AEs will be reported from the first dose of study  drug through 30 day s (+ 10 day s)
after administrati on of  the l ast dose of study  drug and recorded in the eCRFs . 
Serious pretreatm ent events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) up to first dose of study  drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to the Millennium Department of

Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete response 
(CR)Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive disease 
(PD)At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as refer ence 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study) . In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm . The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is a lso 
considered progression.
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
CR Disappearance of all no ntarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level . All 
lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (< 10 mm short axis) . 
Non-CR/ non-PD Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker

aHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interactio n with the investigational medicinal product, which 
may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method.
bContraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency.
cVasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential participant of the study and that the vasectomised partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success.
dIn the context of t his guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be eval uated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
eA combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier 
methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly  effective birth control methods.

on MLN4924 pharmacokinet ics (PK) at the clinically  relevant dose of MLN4924, 20 mg/m2. 
On the basis of preliminary assessments fro m 26 pati ents (13 fluconazo le, 13 itraconazole) 
who have co mpleted Part A to date, steady -state exposures of fluconazo le (cl assified as a 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor) had minimal effect (average 13% increase in area under the 
plasma concentration versus t ime curve fro m time zero to infinit y) on the single -dose 
MLN4924
Clinical Study Protocol C15011 Am endment 2
Confidential 126intravenous (IV) PK of MLN4924, while MLN49 24 sy stemic exposure increased by 23% on 
average in the presence of itraconazole (classified as a strong CYP3A inhibitor) . These 
modest drug interaction effects observed wit h 2 validated moderate and strong CYP3A 
inhibitor probes, respectively, appear inco nsistent wi th the currently available in vitro 
metabo lism data indicating a major role o f CYP3A in MLN4924 metabolism . The 
inform ation from these addit ional pat ients will provide further understanding of the 
contribution o f CYP3A metabo lism to the disposit ion of MLN4924 in humans within the 
clinically relevant dose range in support of adequate labeling.
On the basis of the emerging safet y informat ion in the 26 patients, co -administration of 
MLN4924 with fluconazo le or itraconazole was generally well tolerat ed. The proposed 
single IV dose of MLN4924, 20 mg/m2, is approximately 5 -fold lower than doses of 
MLN4924 equal to or above 110 mg/m2, which were associated with more severe Cycle 1 
Day 1 adverse events in phase 1 studies of MLN4924 . Also, on the basis o f the dose -linear 
PK of MLN4924 and observed 23% increase in MLN4924 systemic exposure by 
[CONTACT_161819] a single 8- mg/m2dose, i t can be inferred that plasma exposures of MLN4924 
when administered at a single 20 -mg/m2dose wi th itraconazol e can be expected to be well 
below exposures seen at doses ≥ 110 mg/m2. 
Before enrolling patients at the target dose of 20 mg/m2MLN4924, an intermediate dose of 
15 m g/m2MLN4924 +itraconazo le will be evaluated as a safet y lead-in cohort . If the review 
of safet y and PK data from 3 PK -evaluable pat ients in this saf ety lead-in cohort confirms 
that the ant icipated safet y margin is adequate, enrollment into the 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 arm  
will begin . Thus, this amendment is adding a total of approximately 20 pat ients to the 
Itraconazole Arm : approximately 4 patients (for 3 PK evaluable) in the safety  lead-in cohort 
and approximately 16 patients (for 12 PK evaluable) in the 20 -mg/m2MLN4924 cohort.
The 3 -hours postdose vital sign assessment will no longer be required in Part B . This change 
is based on the available safet y data from the MLN4924 program; at the doses to be 
explored in this study , there have been no significant alteratio ns of vital signs reported at 
3hours postdose . Furthermore, the change is aligned with the current Study C15010 on 
which Part B of this study  is based. Study  C15010 does not require 3- hours postdose vital 
signs f or the sam e safety considerat ions. 
Dose m odificat ions related to platelet counts have been clarified to ensure that MLN4924 
dosing is delayed if the platelet count is < 100,000/ µL during Cy cle 2 and bey ond.

The purposes of this amendment are as follows:
Add [ADDRESS_187931] of itraconazo le on MLN4924 PK at the clinically relevant dose of

Confidential 136Rationale for Change:
Assessment of gamma glutamyl transferase is no lo nger considered necessary for patients 
continuing bey ond 12 cy cles o f treatm ent. 
Change 1 4: Remove known breast cancer resistance protein substrates , moderate and strong
inhibitors of cytochrom e P450 3A4, and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein from the list of 
excluded conco mitant medicat ions.
The primary  change occurs in Section 6.5.2 Excluded Concomitant Medicat ions and 
Procedures (Part B) :
Descript ion 
of ChangeKnown BCRP substrates , moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and 
inhibitors of P -gp were removed from the list of excluded conco mitant 
medicat ions. 
Rationale for Change :
Known BCRP substrates , moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and inhibitors of P -gp
are no l onger prohibited for MLN4924 therapy . Preliminary  data from  11patients who 
completed protocol -specified dosing and PK evaluations to assess the effect of itr aconazole, 
a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P -gp inhibitor ,on pevonedistat PK indicated that systemic 
exposures of pevonedistat following IV administration at 20 mg/m2in the presence of 
itraconazo le were similar to th osein the absence of itraconazo le. The d ata support rem oving 
strong CYP3A inhibitors and P -gp inhibitors from the list of prohibited conco mitant 
medicat ions in ongoing and planned pevonedistat clinical studies . The rati onale f or 
removing substrates of BCRP from excluded concomitant medications i s based on an 
assessment of the DDI potential o f MLN4924. When viewed in the context of the MLN4924 
mean C maxvalue observed at the established MTD of 20 mg/m2for the combinat ion of 
MLN4924 plus azacit idine in Study  C15009, MLN4924 is unlikely to inhibit the drug efflux 
transporter, and hence affect the PK of other drugs that are known BCRP substrates.

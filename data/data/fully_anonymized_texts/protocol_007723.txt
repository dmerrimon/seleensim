Study Title:  Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo -Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of  HORIZANT® 
(Gabap entin Ena carbil ) Extended -Release Tablets for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder  
NIAAA Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_566015], Ph.D.  
Study Center s: 10 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Study Period:  Phase of Development:  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: May [ADDRESS_1235623] completed: October  2016  2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of HORIZANT  (gabapentin enacarbil) 
Extended -Release Tablets 600  mg twice daily ( BID) with matched placebo on the primary alcohol consumption 
outcome endpoint , percent age of  subjects with no heavy drinking days  (PSNHDD) during the last 4 weeks of 
treatment , among patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).  
Secondary:  Secondary objectives are separated into two categories: key secondary objectives and supportive 
secondary  objectives . The key seco ndary objective is to compare HORIZANT to placebo on the percentage of 
subjects abstinent from alcohol during the last 4 weeks  of treatment. The supportive secondary study objectives are 
to assess other treatment benefits  including: reduction in other alcohol consumption endpoints , alcohol -related 
craving and consequences, mood , sleep quality, smoking quantity and frequency, and safety . 
Methodology:  This study is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, multi -site study 
designed to assess the efficacy of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  compared with placebo to reduce drinking 
in 346 subjects ( 173 in each group)  who report 4 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 
Fifth Edition ( DSM -5™) symptoms of AUD and who meet the drinking criteria outlined hereafter. This study will be 
conducted at 10 clinical sites. If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized  using a stratified permuted block 
randomization procedure with “clinical site” as the stratification variable  in an approximate 1:1 ratio (targeting 173 
subjects per group ) to receive either HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  or placebo for 2 6 weeks (1 week 
escalation; 2 4 weeks maintenance; 1 week taper).  
Subjects will be seen in the clinic at screening, at randomization and 11 other times during the study. During the 
Week 1 dose escalation period (midway through the week) and during the maintenance period (Weeks 2 to 25) , 
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_883275]-clinic visit weeks  to encourage study drug compliance 
and to assess withdrawal, adverse events ( AEs), and concomitant medications. A final follow -up telephone interview 
will occur during Weeks 2 8 to 29 (1 to 2 weeks after the end of dosing ). 
Number of Subjects (Planned): 346 
Main Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  Subjects will be male and female at least 21 years of age with 4 or more 
DSM -5™ symptoms of AUD . They must also be seeking treatment for alcohol dependence and if male, report 
drinking an average of [ADDRESS_1235624] 
one heavy drinking day per week for the 28- day period prior to consent , and be abstinent for the 3 consecutive days 
prior to the day of randomization . A “heavy drinking day” is 4 or more drinks per drinking day for women and 5 or 
more drinks per drinking day for men.

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235625], Dosage and Mode o f Administration: 
Dose titration, maintenance and taper will occur as scheduled below. The target maintenance dose of HORIZANT  
Extended -Release Tablets is 600 mg BID. Subjects in the  placebo group will take the equivalent number of  placebo 
tablets . 
Study Period  Time Period  AM Dose  
(# of tablets ) PM Dose

Titration  Week 1, Days 1 -3 600 mg (1)  None  
Titration  Week 1, Days 4 -7 600 mg (1)  600 mg (1)  
Maintenance  Week s 2-25 600 mg (1)  600 mg (1)  
Taper  Week 26 600 mg (1)   None  
 
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Identically debossed placebo tablets will be 
administered according to the same schedule as HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets . 
Duration of Study:  Each subject will participate in the study for up to approximately [ADDRESS_1235626] 1 to 2 weeks after completing treatment . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary : The primary outc ome measure examines the hypothesis that HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  will 
increase the PSNHDD compared to placebo during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance period ( Study Weeks 22-25) . 
A “heavy drinking day” is 4 or more drinks per drinking day for women and 5 or more drinks per drinking day for 
men. Drinking data will be collected by [CONTACT_883276] (TLFB) m ethod. If during the last [ADDRESS_1235627] will be asked if there were any heavy drinking days during the final study period.  
These data will be used to determine the primary efficacy endpoint when TLFB data are missing, otherwise the data 
will be imputed as having a heavy drinking day during this period.  
Secondary : Secondary efficacy endpoints  will also be analyzed over the last 4 weeks of treatment .

Compliance:  Self report of compliance with investigational products and gabapentin plasma levels.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK): A population PK /pharmacodynamics (PD)  analysis will be performed using gabapentin 
plasma levels  determined from blood samples collected at Weeks 12, 20, and [ADDRESS_1235628] s at different time s at each PK visit (pre -
dose and up to [ADDRESS_1235629] dose).  
Exploratory Analysis: An exploratory analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints  will test treatment 
effects over varying time intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly, and by [CONTACT_883277]) and by [CONTACT_883278]; in 
addition, these endpoints will be analyzed within the evaluable population . The MINI AUD number of symptoms , 
blood phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels , and abstinence from cigarette smoking will also be tested as endpoints . 
Potential moderators of the treatment effect will be tested using the primary endpoint, PSNHDD.  
Statistical Metho ds (Data Analysis):   
Analysis Populations:  
Modified intention- to-treat (mITT) Analysis Set:  The mITT set is defined as subjects randomized to participate in 
the study who took at least one dose of investigational product.  
Evaluable Analysis Set:  The evalua ble analysis set is defined as those subjects randomized to the study who took at 
least 80% of the per-protocol prescribed dose of tablets during the maintenance period (Weeks 2 -25) and did not 
have a major protocol violation .  
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted on both the mITT and evaluable analysis sets.  
Exploratory analyses will be performed on the mITT analysis set, unless otherwise specified.  Safety analyses will be 
conducted on the mITT  analysis set.  
Analysis of the Prima ry Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary analysis will be conducted via a fully covaried  logistical regression  of the PSNHDD during Study 
Weeks 22 to 25 (last 4 weeks of the maintenance period) on the mITT population. The model includes treatment 
group, clinical site, pre -randomization drinking goal (abstinence versus not abstinent), and baseline percent heavy 
drinking days as covariates.  Subjects with any missing drinking data during Weeks 22 to 25 will be considered 
heavy drinkers. Treatment group  differences w ill be tested for significance using the Wald statistic and will be 
considered statistically significant at a two -tailed  p <0.05. 
Analysis of the Key Secondary Endpoint:  
The key secondary endpoint is the p ercentage of subjects abstinent during Weeks 22 through 25  on the mITT 
population . The analysis will be performed using a fully covaried logistic regression  that includes treatment group, 
clinical site, pre -randomization drinking goal (abstinence versus not abstinent), and baseline percent days abstinent 
as covariates ; however, fewer covariates may be included given a limited  number of observed events. Subjects with 
any missing drinking data during Weeks 22 to 25 will be considered non -abstinent.  Statistical significance will be 
evaluated if and only if the primary endpoint (PSNHDD) is statistically significant (p<0.05). The testing procedure 
utilizes serial gate  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_234255] (Dmitrienko and Tamhane 2009). If statistical significance for the primary 
endpoint of PSNHDD is met then the Wald statistic  from the fully covaried logistic regression will be used to test 
treatment differences in the percentage of subjects abstinent  with statistical significance identified with a two -tailed 
p-value below 0.05.  
Analysis of the Supportive Secondary Endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints will compare the HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  group with the placebo group  using 
mixed -effects models . Covariates for continuous secondary efficacy endpoints include the baseline equivalent of the 
endpoint, clinical site, treatment, time and the treatment by [CONTACT_6491]. Additional covariates for the secondary 
efficacy endpoints may include baseline characteristics with a theoretical and/or empi[INVESTIGATOR_883251] a relationship with a particular secondary endpoint . In general, every continuous secondary efficacy endpoint is analyzed using a 
repeated measures mixed effects model where subjects are random effects; factors and covariates are fixed effects.  
The overall least squares means and least square means for each time point along with the 95% confidence intervals will be presented for the untransformed endpoint only, while two -tailed p -values and Cohen’s d will be presented for 
both the untransformed and transformed data.  Inference and Cohen’s d will be based upon the r esults using

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235630] 4 weeks of the maintenance period. No imputation will be used for the analysis of 
secondary endpoints.  
PK Analyses:  Population PK /PD analyses will be conducted under a separate population PK/PD SAP.  
Safety Analyses:  
The severity, frequency, and relat ionship of AEs to investigational product will be presented by [CONTACT_144420] (MedDRA) System Organ Class ( SOC ) and Preferred Term (PT) groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Listings of 
each individual AE including start date, stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided.  
Clinical chemistry , urine drug screen results, pregnancy test results, and BAC results, will be reported as summary 
statistics. Vital signs will be presented as summary statistics and change from baseli ne. The proportions of ECG 
results considered clinically significant will also be provided. CIWA -AR scores will be analyzed  in a manner  similar 
to the efficacy endpoints: mixed effects models with and without baseline characteristics. In addition, change f rom 
baseline (shift tables) will also be presented for clinical chemistry  data. The numbers and proportion of subjects who 
reported CIWA -AR scores ≥ 10 at any time after the start of dosing will be presented.  
Compliance and Retention Analyses:  
Medication compliance, defined as the amount of investigational product taken as a proportion of the total amount 
prescribed  per protocol , will be evaluated for the HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  and placebo groups. Self-
reported compliance with HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  will be compared against plasma samples 
collected at Weeks 12, 20, and [ADDRESS_1235631] taken overall and weekly will be reported for the HORIZANT Extended -Release 
Tablets  and placebo groups. The research participation rate, defined as percentage of subjects with complete 
drinking data, will be compared between treatment groups. In addition, the percentage of subjects discontinuing 
medication or early withdrawal from the study and a listing of the se reasons for discontinuation will be provided.  
Baseline Descriptive Statistics: 
Summaries of the characteristics of the subjects in each of the study groups at baseline will be prepared for both the 
mITT and evaluable analysis sets. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the HORIZANT 
Extended -Release Tablets  and placebo groups using appropriate statistical methods .

4.1. Alcohol Use Disorder  
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) (alcohol dependence and abuse) affects 76 million adults world-
wide, including 18 million Americans, and is responsible for a myriad of medical, psychological, 
social, economic and personal problems ( Litten et al -2012 ). Tragically, more than 2.[ADDRESS_1235647] to society is a staggering $224 billion each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US) (
NIAAA -2014 ).  
4.2. Current Treatments for Alcohol Use Disorder  
Pharmacologic treatment of AUD has mostly focused on altering the reinforcing effect s of 
alcohol use. Medication development has focused on se veral  neurotransmitter systems that 
interact with the corticomesolimbic dopamine pathway, which can mediate reinforcement. Many 
available or promising compounds appear to act by [CONTACT_566057][INVESTIGATOR_2438], glutamate (with or without gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA), and serotonin (5- HT) (
Heilig and 
Egli-2006 ). 
During the past decade, advances have been made in medications development. Currently, there are four medications approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) to treat alcohol 
dependence:  disulfiram, oral naltrexone, long- acting injectable (depot) naltrexone, and 
acamprosate. Last year, nalmefene was approved by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) to 
treat alcohol dependence. The indications and efficacy  of the drugs for the treatment of alcohol 
dependence is shown in Table 1.

As these medications  do not work for everyone or in all situations, a dditional research is vital to 
develop more efficacious and safe medications to treat AUD . 
4.3. HORIZANT  (Gabapentin Enacarbil ) Extended- Release Tablets  
Gabapentin  is a GABA analog that was originally developed to treat epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Neurontin®) and 
more recently has been approved for the t reatment of postherpetic neural gia (Neurontin and 
Gralise®). HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is an actively transported prodrug of 
gabapentin that undergoes rapid post absorption hydrolysis to gabapentin that was designed to 
produce dose proportional gabapentin blood level exposure. HORIZANT  Extended -Release 
Tablets is approved for the treatment of moderate -to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome in 
adults and management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults. HORIZANT overcomes some of the 
limitations of oral gabapentin including highly variable and dose dependent bioavailability 
among patients and fluctuations in gabapentin blood levels over 24 hours. 
HORIZANT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235649] shown gabapentin to be a promising medication to treat alcohol 
dependence.  Mason et al (2014)  conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
randomized trial of gabapentin (900 mg or 1800 mg/day) in 150 alcohol dependent patients. Gabapentin significantly improved rates of abstinence and no heavy drinking as well as alleviated relapse- related symptoms of insomnia, dysphoria, and alcohol craving. Patients treated 
with gabapentin exhibited no serious adverse events (SAEs) with  a favorable safety profile. The 
results of this randomized controlled trial are supported by [CONTACT_883280]. 
Mason et al (2009)  demonstrated in a human laboratory paradigm that gabapentin (1200 mg/day) 
was effective in reducing alcohol craving and improving measures of sleep quality. Gabapentin was also effective in reducing alcoh ol withdrawal symptoms (
Myrick et al - 2009 ). In addition, 
several single- site clinical trials have also yielded promising results for gabapentin in treating 
alcohol dependence. In a small clinical trial, Brower et al (2008)  reported that gabapentin (1500 
mg/day) significantly delayed the onset to heavy drinking and improved the symptoms of insomnia in alcohol dependent patients. 
Furieri and Nakamura-Palacios (2007)  conducte d a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin (600 mg/day) in 60 alcohol dependent patients and found gabapentin effective in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol craving. 
Anton et al (2009)  reported that a combination of gabapentin (1200 mg/day) and flumazenil was  
efficacious in increasing percent days abstinent and time to first heavy drinking in alcohol dependent patients with pretreatment alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In another clinical trial, 
Anton et al (2011)  found that the addition of gabapentin (1200 mg/day) to naltrexone improved 
drinking outcomes over naltrexone alone. With these positive efficacy and safety results from the single site studies above, gabapentin is now ready to be tested in a multi- site clinical trial. 
HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets  was selected over other oral gabapentin products due to 
more uniform bioavailability , faster time to titrating to full therapeutic dose, and less fluctuating 
gabapentin blood levels with twice daily administration.  
4.3.2. HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablet s Pharmacodynamics 
Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA but has no effect on GABA 
binding, uptake, or degradation. HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  and gabapentin have 
been tested in radioligand binding assays, and neither exhibited affinity for a number of other 
common receptor, ion channel, or transporter proteins. In vitro studies have shown that gabapentin binds with high affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage- activated calcium channels; 
however, the relationship of this binding to the therapeutic effects of HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets  in R estless Legs Syndrome and postherpe tic neuralgia is unknown. 
4.3.3. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
Gabapentin pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were compared within the same postherpetic 
neuralgia patient s taking gabapentin  and HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  by 
[CONTACT_883281] (2011) . As shown in Table 2 and  Figure  1, average steady -state gabapentin concentrations in 
plasma when patients received 1468 mg-equivalents in divided doses of 1200 mg tablets  twice 
daily of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  were increased 17 % when compared with 1800 
mg of gabapentin given as 600 mg tablets 3 times per day (p = 0.005; paired t- test).

(HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets Product Label).  
Absorption:  The pathway for absorption of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is believed 
to include active transport via a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter, MCT-1. This 
transporter is expressed at high levels in the intestinal tract and is not saturated by [CONTACT_883282] -Release Tablets . Mean bioavailability of gabapentin

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 20 NIAAA Confidential   (based on urinary recovery of gabapentin) for HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  in the fed 
state is about 75%. Bioavailability under fasting conditions has been estimat ed by [CONTACT_883283] 42% to 65%. In a food effect study, the exposure of gabapentin increased 
by 24%, 34%, and 44% with low, moderate, and high fat meals, respectively. The T max of 
gabapentin after administration of 600 mg of HORIZANT Ex tended -Release Tablets  was 5.0 
hours in fasted subjects and 7.3 hours in fed subjects. Steady state is reached in 2 days with daily administration.  
Metabolism: Neither HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  nor gabapentin are substrates, 
inhibitors, or inducers of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets  is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in vitro . 
4.3.4. Drug Interactions  
Alcohol: Gabapentin  enacarbil is released faster from HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets in 
the presence of alcohol.  This was determined in an in vitro dissolution study which was 
conducted to evaluate the impact of ethanol (5, 10, 20, and 40%) on the extended- release 
charact eristics of HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets . The in vitro study showed that about 
63% of the total gabapentin dose was released at [ADDRESS_1235650] alcohol level (40%), and about 43% of total drug was released at 1 hour with 5% alcohol. Ethanol caus es a more rapid 
release of gabapentin enacarbil from the Extended -Release Tablets  that may increase the risk for 
AEs associated with HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets . Based on this data, consumption of 
alcohol is not recommended when taking HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets . 
Morphine: HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets taken in conjunction with morphine causes 
increased somnolence/  sedation, dizziness, and nausea when compared with either drug alone. 
This was determined via the administration of a sin gle 600 mg dose of HORIZANT Extended - 
Release Tablets 2 hours after a single 60 mg dose of extended-release morphine sulfate in 18 
subjects and was associated with increased somnolence/sedation, dizziness and nausea for the 
combination compared to HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets or morphine alone as measured 
by [CONTACT_224968]. No changes in C
max and AUC of gabapentin, morphine or its active 
metabolite morphine -6-glucuronide were observed. 
4.3.5. Contraindicated Medications  
No medications are contraindicated in patients taking HORIZANT  Extended- Release Tablets . 
4.3.6. Warnings and Precautions for Subjects Taking HORIZANT  Extended -Release 
Tablets  
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is not recommended for patients who are required to 
sleep during the daytime and remain awake at night. 
Driving impairment: Patients  should be warned not to drive until they have gained sufficient 
experience with HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  to asses s whether it will impair  their 
ability to drive.  
Somnolence/sedation and dizziness: HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  may impair the 
patient’s ability to  operate complex machinery.

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 21 NIAAA Confidential   Suicidal thoughts or behaviors:  HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is a prodrug of 
gabapentin,  an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551]. A ntiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551] s increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or 
behaviors. Subjects will be monitor ed for suicidal thoughts or behaviors in this study.  
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : This is also known as 
multiorgan hypersensitivity and has been reported in patients taking antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], 
including gabapentin. HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is a prodrug of gabapentin, and 
therefore carries this risk.  
4.3.7. Clinical Studies of Gaba pentin in Alcohol Use Disorder  
Three randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials have evaluated the effects of gabapentin 
on heavy alcohol drinking in alcohol dependent subjects.  
In the study by [CONTACT_883284] (2008) , 21 subjects with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and 
insomnia underwent a 1- 2 week single-blind placebo lead-in period, a 6-week randomized 
double-blind, parallel group period of gabapentin (1500 mg/day) vs placebo, then were followed 
by a [ADDRESS_1235651] drinks in a day for men, or presenting to a ny 
study visit with a blood alcohol level > .08% as measured by [CONTACT_27473]. Altogether, among the 
gabapentin group, 3 (30.0%) of 10 were categorized as having relapsed to heavy drinking during 
the 6 -week trial vs 9 (81.8%) of 11 in the placebo group (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.03). A 
survival analysis of time to heavy drinking by [CONTACT_883285] a statistically significant 
difference (log rank p= 0.03) favoring the gabapentin group. Insomnia improved in both 
treatment groups during the medication phase, but gabapentin had no differential effects on sleep as measured by [CONTACT_883286].  
Furieri and Nakamura-Palacios (2007)  conducted a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 
gabapentin i n 60 alcohol dependent Brazilian males who received 7 days of diazepam for acute 
withdrawal  then were randomized to gabapentin (600 mg/day) or placebo for 28 days. T he 
gabapentin group showed a significant reduction in both number of drinks per day and mean 
percentage of heavy drinking days (p = 0.02 for both), and an increase in the percentage of days 
of abstinence ( p = 0.008), compared to the placebo group. Additionally, some improvement in 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms was noted in both groups after the treatment, but it resulted in a more pronounced decrease in automaticity of drinking and aspects of craving in the gabapentin 
group than in the placebo group. 
Mason et al (2014)  conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 
gabapentin (900 mg or 1800 mg/day) in 150 alcohol dependent patients who had to be abstinent for 3 days prior to randomization. The co -primary endpoints were rates of complete abstinence 
and no heavy drinking days over the 12- week period. A heavy drinking day was defined as 4 or 
more drinks per day for women and 5 or more drinks per day for men. Gabapentin significantly improved rates of abstinence and no heavy drinking in a dose dependent manner. The rate of sustained abstinence was 4.1% (95% CI, 1.1%-13.7%) in the placebo group, 11.1% (95% CI, 
5.2%-22.2%) in the 900 mg group, and 17.0% (95% CI, 8.9%-30.1%) in the 1800 mg group. The no heavy drinking rate was 22.5% (95% CI, 13.6%-37.2%) in the placebo group, 29.6% (95% CI, 19.1%-42.8%) in the 900 mg group, and 44.7% (95% CI, 31.4%-58.8%) in the [ADDRESS_1235652] on reduction in log-transformed

dysfunction that significantly impr oved with gabapentin relative to placebo. No evidence of drug 
substitution or misuse of gabapentin was detected.  
4.3.8. Safety of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  in Clinical Studies of Restless 
Legs Syndrome  
The safety of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  in doses ranging from 600 to 2,400 mg has 
been evaluated in 515 patients with restless leg syndrome in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
12-week clinical trials. The 600 -mg dose was studied in 2 of the 3 studies. Eleven out of 163 
(7%) patients treated with 600 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets discontinued 
treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10 of the 245 (4%) patients who received placebo. The most commonly observed adverse reactions (≥5% and at least 2 times the rate of 
placebo) in these trials for the 600 -mg BID dose of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  were 
somnolence/sedation (27%) and dizziness (22%). 
4.3.9. Safety of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  in Clinical Studies of 
Postherpetic Neuralgia  
The safety of HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets  in doses ranging from 1,200 to 3,600 mg 
has been evaluated in 417 patients with postherpetic neuralgia in 3 clinical studies. The principal 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets  in the 
management of postherpetic neuralgia was a 12 -week, double- blind, multicenter study 
comparing 1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day and 3,600 mg/day to placebo. Six out of 107 (6%) patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets discontinued treatment 
due to AEs compared with 12 of the 95 (13%) patients who received placebo. 
During the 12-week, controlled study in patients with postherpetic neuralgia , somnolence was 
reported in 10% of patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  per 
day compared with 8% of patients receiving placebo. Fatigue/asthenia was reported in 6% of 
patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  per day compared with 
1% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated  with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT 
Extended -Release Tablets  per day who reported somnolence (10%), the somnolence persisted 
during treatment in about 27%. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved within 4 to 5 
weeks. Dizziness was reported in 17% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets  per day compared with 15% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients 
treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  per day who reported dizziness, 
symptoms persisted during treatment in about 6%.  
Somnolence led to withdrawal in <1% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets  per day compared with 2% of patients receiving placebo. Dizziness led to 
withdrawal in 2% of patients  receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT Exte nded- Release Tablets  per 
day compared with 3% of patients receiving placebo.

AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any 
indication. Because HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is a prodrug of gabapentin, 
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  also increases this risk . 
Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk ( adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior 
compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,[ADDRESS_1235655] trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. 
The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data 
analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a 
range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. Th e risk 
did not vary substantially by [CONTACT_654] (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.  
4.3.12. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 
DRESS, also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], including gabapentin.  HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is a prodrug of 
gabapentin, and therefore carries this risk. Some of these events have been fatal or  life-
threatening. DRESS typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymp hadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, 
nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute  
viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is vari able in its expression,  
other organ systems not noted here may be involved. 
It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or  
lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms a re 
present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  
should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235656] single dose of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  administered to date is 6,000 
mg in healthy subjects. At this supratherapeutic dose there were no SAEs . The incidence of 
central nervous system adverse reactions, particularly dizziness and somnolence/ sedation, is 
increased with doses greater than 600 mg daily. 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate 
monitoring as necessary. Gabapentin derived from HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  can 
be removed from plasma by [CONTACT_121264]. The mean percenta ge of gabapentin recovered 
following hemodialysis in patients with end -stage renal disease was 29% (expressed as a 
proportion of the gabapentin released from HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets ). Further 
management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by a poison control center. 
4.3.14. HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  in Pregnant Women  
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  is considered a Pregnancy Category C drug and should 
only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies with HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  
in pregnant women. In nonclinical studies in rat and rabbits, administration of HORIZANT 
Extended -Release Tablets  was developmentally toxic when administered to pregnant animals at 
doses and gabapentin exposures greater than those used clinically. 
4.3.15. Summary of Safety in Restless Leg s Syndrome and Postherpetic Neur algia 
In all controlled and uncontrolled trials across various patient populations with Restless L egs 
Syndrome or postherpetic neuralgia, more than 2,[ADDRESS_1235657] 
commonly observed adverse reactions in 12- week studies of patients with  Restless Leg s 
Syndrome (≥ 2% of patients and numerically greater than  placebo) in trials for the 1200- mg total 
daily dose of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  were somnolence/sedation  (27% vs 6% for 
placebo),  dizziness (22% vs 4% for placebo), and headache (15% vs 11%) . Adverse reactions 
reported in these studies in <2% of patients treated with 600 mg of HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets  and numerically greater than placebo were balance disorder, blurred vision, 
disorientation, feeling drunk, lethargy, and vertigo. Eleven out of 163 (7%) patients treated with 
600 mg of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  discontinued treatment due to adverse 
reactions compared with 10 of the 245 (4%) patients who received placebo. 
In studies of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  for the treatment of postherpe tic neuralgia 
(600 mg BID), 6 out of 107 (6%) patients treated with HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  
discontinued treatment due to AEs  compared with 12 of the 95 (13%) patients who received 
placebo. The most commonly observed adverse reactions (≥2% and numerically greater than 
placebo) in this trial for the 1,200 mg dose of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  compared 
with placebo were dizziness  (17% vs 15%), somnolence (10% vs 8%), and headache (10% vs 
9%). The following adverse reactions were also reported as ≥2% at 2,400 mg/day and/or 3,600 
mg/day and appeared to be dose-related but were <2% at 1,200 mg/day: balance disorder, 
confusional state, depression, dry mouth, flatulence, increased appetite, irritability, and vertigo. Dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and insomnia appeared to show a dose relationship. 
HORIZANT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 25 NIAAA Confidential   In the randomized controlled trial of 150 alcohol dependent subjects receiving 900 mg (54 
subjects) or 1800 mg of gabapentin per day (47 subjects) or placebo (49 subjects), gabapentin 
was well tolerated, with no deaths and no drug -related SAEs ( Mason et al -2014 ). Nine 
participants discontinued the study due to AEs . Of these, 5 were rated as drug related by [CONTACT_883287]: 2 complaints of headache (900 mg), 2 complaints of fatigue (1 in the 900- mg 
group and 1 in the 1800-mg group), and 1 complaint of euphoria and feeling “on speed” (placebo 
group). No differences were found among groups in type of AEs with10% or more of the sample 
complaining of fatigue (23%), insomnia (18%), and headache (14%). Groups also were similar in 
the number and severity of AEs reported.  
At a dose of 6,[ADDRESS_1235658], the 
recommended dose of Neurontin (immediate release gabapentin) for the treatment of 
postherpetic neuralgia is 1800 mg per day given as 3 daily divided doses of 600 mg (Neurontin Product Insert). Based on the product prescribing information, the proportion of postherpetic 
neuralgia patients responding at the recommended doses of HORIZANT Extended -Release 
Tablets and Neurontin were similar. Higher doses of Neurontin or HORIZANT Extended -
Release Tablets were not more effective in treating postherpetic neuralgia, suggesting that both recommended dose regimens achieved essentially equivalent maximum levels of efficacy. The 
systemic exposure to gabapentin at the recommended HORIZANT dose in postherpetic neuralgia is approximately 20 to 30% lower than that from the recommended dose of Neurontin. However, 
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets achieves a similar level of efficacy to Neurontin despi[INVESTIGATOR_883261], presumably as a result of its more sustained plasma profile. 
In the Phase 2 randomized controlled trial in alcohol dependent patients reported by 
[CONTACT_701454] 
(2014) , two doses of the immediate release form of gabapentin were studied (900 mg per day and 
1800 mg per day). There was a dose dependent efficacy response with [ADDRESS_1235659] 4 weeks (month 6) because of the highly variable baseline amounts and unstable drinking 
patterns observed during alcohol trials during the initial months of the treatment period. Several 
studies have indicated that drinking patterns over the first [ADDRESS_1235660] 
MATCH study, Zweben and Cisler ( 2003 ) reported that 47% of the subjects experienced 
HORIZANT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 26 NIAAA Confidential   abstinence or moderate drinking without problems at the three month follow-up interval, but 
decreased to 38% at the six month follow-up and 29% at the one year follow-up interval, 
indicating that subjects were returning to heavy drinking and alcohol- related problems over time.  
Recently, using patients with alcohol use disorders from Kaiser Permanente, Kline- Simon et al 
(2013 ; 2014 ) reported that compared with heavy drinkers, abstinent or low-risk drinkers at [ADDRESS_1235661]- treatment (looking back at the 1 month period before the 6 month follow-up) were 
more likely to be abstinent or low-risk drinkers at [ADDRESS_1235662]- treatment. M oreover, 
compared to heavy drinkers, abstinent and low- risk drinkers at 6 months were similarly 
associated with lower 12 -month psychiatric severity and family/social problem severity. 
Furthermore, abstainers and low-risk drinkers had lower inpatient (hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]) treatment 
utilization over the next 5 years compared to that of heavy drinkers. Heavy drinkers had 
increased emergency department and inpatient costs during this period. Based on this data, we 
chose a 5 -month grace period with the primary analysis being conducted during Month 6 of the 
treatment period as a clinically meaningful primary outcome. Treatment effects during earlier 
months will be explored. 
In the analysis by [CONTACT_751480]-Simon and Weisner ( 2014 ), three month post- treatment was compared to 
[ADDRESS_1235663]-treatment in predicting consequences at 12 months (see Table  3 and  Table 4). 
Compared  with  the heavy drinkers, the abstinent and low-risk drinkers at [ADDRESS_1235664]-
treatment had improved social/family and employment consequences at [ADDRESS_1235665]- treatment.  
The drinking pattern appears to be more stable at 6 months than 3 months, thus more representative of the patient’s drinking pattern going forward in time. The responder analysis 
was selected for month [ADDRESS_1235666] 4 weeks of the treatment period.

with AUD. PSNHDD will also be analyzed during other time periods (i.e., the last 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24 weeks of the maintenance period) in exploratory analyses.  
5.2. Secondary Objective  
Secondary objectives are separated into two categories : key secondary objectives and supportive 
secondary objectives. The key se condary objective is to compare HORIZANT to placebo on the 
percentage of subjects abstinent from alcohol during the last 4 weeks of treatment. The 
supportive secondary study objectives are to assess other treatment benefits, including: reduction 
in other alcohol consumption endpoints, alcohol- related craving and consequences,  mood, 
smoking, sleep quality, safety , and tolerability.

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 29 NIAAA Confidential   6. Investigational Plan 
This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi- site study 
designed to assess the efficacy of HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  compared with placebo 
to reduce drinking in 346 subjects ( 173 in each group) who report 4 or more Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition (DSM-5™) symptoms of AUD and who 
meet the drinking criteria outlined hereafter. This study will be conducted at 10 clinical sites. If 
eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized using a stratified permuted  block 
randomization procedure with “clinical site” as the stratification variable in an approximate 1:1 
ratio (targeting 173 subjects per group) to receive either HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  
or placebo for 26 weeks (1 week escalation; 24 weeks maint enance; 1 week taper).  
Subjects will be seen in the clinic at screening , at randomization and 11 other times  during the 
study. During the Week 1 dose escalation period (midway through the week) and during the 
maintenance period (Weeks 2 to 25) , subjects will be contact[CONTACT_883288]-clinic visit weeks  to encourage study drug compliance and to assess withdrawal, AEs, and 
concomitant medications. A final follow -up telephone interview will occur during Weeks 28 to 
29 (1 to  2 weeks after the end of dosing). 
An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 2. Study assessments and procedures will 
be performed at the visi ts and time points outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5).

The site principal investigator (PI) or designated study personnel will maintain a log of the 
receipt of all investigational products and record of dispensing of all investigational products to 
the subject. Investigational product for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for 
throughout the trial. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her staff will count the tablets  remaining at the end of the 
study and record the tablet  count on the appropriate drug accountability form. Subject 
compliance with investigatio nal product will be assessed by [CONTACT_883290] (number of tablets  dispensed, number of tablets  prescribed , 
versus the number returned). Subjects will also be asked to account for any missing tablets . If the 
bottle is not returned, the subject will be asked to report daily drug self- administration.  
7.6. Used/Unused Investigational Product Supplies  
Unused investigational products will be retained at the clinic al sites pending instructions for 
return by [CONTACT_883291].  
7.7. Investigational Product Administration 
Dose titration, maintenance and taper will occur as shown in Table 7. The target maintenance 
dose of HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets is 600 mg BID. Subjects receiving placebo will 
take the same number of tablets as those prescribed for HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets  
to preserve the study blind.

Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. Tablets should be 
taken with food.  
Missed Doses:  Subjects will be instructed, if the dose is not taken at the recommended time, to 
skip this dose, and the next dose should be taken at the time of next scheduled dose ; doses should 
never be doubled up. S ubject s will be instructed  to record the dose that was missed.  
Dose Reduction and Discontinuation. I f the subject is not tolerating the investigational product 
or has a medical condition requiring dose reduction or discontinuation of the investigational 
product, a reduction to one tablet in the evenin g is permitted. If  discontinuation of the 
investigational product altogether is  necessary , then if the subject was taking the investigational 
product twice daily, he/she should taper to one tablet per day for one week before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If the 
subject was al ready taking just one tablet per day, he/she can simply discontinue unless clinically 
inappropriate to do so. In the event that a female subject becomes pregnant, she will be instructed 
to undergo the same dose reduction of investigational product as is recommended for all subjects as sudden discontinuation from 600 mg BID to zero could potentially increase the risk for 
withdrawal seizures.   
7.8. Take Control Behavioral Platform 
The behavioral platform “Take Control” will consist of a series of 11 computerized  modules. 
Subjects will view a single module of “Take Control” at each clinic visits from Visit [ADDRESS_1235678] remain at the clinic. The 
intervention is derived from a self-help approach developed by [CONTACT_566077]-based, field tested information for individuals with alcohol problems, and suggestions for making changes in their drinking. The NIAAA material is publically available in a NIAAA booklet 
entitled “Rethinking Drinking” and on a NIAAA website http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov. 
Delivering these materials in a computerized method in this trial has the advantage of standardizing the amount of educational material received by [CONTACT_423].   
7.9. Concomitant Medications  
Although there are no specific contraindicated medications, due to the somnolence effects of 
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets , drugs with sedative properties should be used with 
caution as it is a ssumed that sedative properties could be additive. While taking study drug, 
subjects may not take HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets , gabapentin or other 
gabapentinoids.

HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets , gaba pentin or other gabapentinoids already not allowed 
during the study, the following drugs approved for the treatment of alcoholism are also prohibited: 
• Oral naltrexone (Revia, Depade)  
• Depot naltrexone (Vivitrol) 
• Disulfiram (Antabuse)  
• Acamprosate (Campral)  
• Nalmefene (Selincro)  
In addition, a list of prohibited drugs that are prescribed off- label or experimentally for the 
treatment of alcoholism will be included in the M anual of Procedures and updated during the 
study if new drugs are identified. Also, if a subject reports using a drug or having been prescribed a drug to treat alcoholism during the trial, they will be asked to discontinue its use. 
Subjects will be instruc ted to check with study staff before taking any new medication s or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566029] . Subjects will be informed that starting any new medication 
without consulting study staff could pose health risks and/or result in their discontinuation for the 
study drug. 
Management of investigational products and concomitant medications during the study is at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_566030]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_701423].

a. Current or lifetime diagnosis of psychotic disorders 
b. Current bipolar disorder, 
c. Current major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or 
d. Current (past 3 months) eating disorde r (anorexia or bulimia).  
Note: Subjects diagnosed with psychiatric disorders not specifically excluded above may be included at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_883262], duration, or intensity. 
12. Have any of the following:  
a. attempted suicide past year,  
b. curren t (past year) suicid e behavior disorder in accordance with DSM-5 criteria as 
assessed using the MINI (see note below about assessment of subjects diagnosed at 
low risk),  or 
c. current (since screening MINI) suicidality risk as indicated during the conduct of the C-SSRS with concurrence after a study physician’s evaluation if the response to C-SSRS questions 1 or 2 is “yes”). 
Note: The MINI suicidality module rates scores of 1 to 8 as a diagnosis of low risk of 
suicidality. As the MINI questions that could result in a low risk score are considered 
inadequate to fully determine the potential suicidal risk of an individual (e.g., “Feel hopeless” and “Think that you would be better off dead or wish you were dead?” 
responses of “yes” dictates a score of 1 for ea ch question), any subject who scores in the 
low risk category should be evaluated further by a study physician who should document 
whether the subject is appropriate for study inclusion based on his/her clinical judgment 
of the potential suicide risk of the subject. Likewise, if the subject responds “yes” to 
either the first two questions on the screening C-SSRS performed on the day of randomization as a final eligibility check, the subject should also evaluated by a study 
physician for current suicidality risk, who should document the subject’s suitability for 
study inclusion.

scheduled to start the study and will come to the clinic for a final eligibility check including the 
following assessments: 
• Alcohol breathalyzer  (must have a reading of 0.0 to support abstinence)

*Note that the MINI will be used to rule out subjects who attempted suicide in the past year and current (past year) suicidal ideation at initial screening, with the C -SSRS providing an update on 
current suicidal ideation since screening.  
An eligibility checklist will be completed and reviewed by a study investig ator and, if the subject 
is still eligible, he/she will complete the following baseline assessments:  
• Blood for DNA genomics and RNA expression testing  
• Blood spot collection for phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level determination

If the subject reported drinking in the three days prior to randomization, they can be rescheduled 
for another randomization visit if they agree to try to stop drinking for the required period of [ADDRESS_1235699] number.  
8.6. Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
8.6.1. Randomization (Day - 1) 
If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized in an approximate 1:1 ratio to receive either 
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  or placebo using a stratified permuted block 
randomization procedure with “clinical site” as the stratification variable. Clinical site was 
chosen because both local study populations, and the inve stigative staff influence on the 
subject’s drinking behaviors may differentially influence endpoints.  
Centralized randomization will be performed using an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
The IWRS is available for randomization of subjects 24 hours/day, 7 days/week from any 
computer using a web browser. 
If the subject is determined to be eligible, site personnel who are authorized to randomize 
subjects and who have completed training for the IWRS, will log onto the system and provide 
the pre -assigne d unique s ubject  number and the subject’s date of birth. The IWRS provides the 
randomized group kit number and assigns the subject to one of the two interventions. If the 
subject is randomized and is never dispensed study drug, then the subject will be considered a 
randomization failure and an additional subject will be randomized with the next randomization sequence at the time he/she is randomized at that site . Likewise, if the subject was randomized 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235700] who received study drug but was later determined to be 
ineligible will likewise not be replaced.  The reason(s) that a subject was considered a 
randomization failure or screen failure will be documented in source documents and eCRFs. 
8.6.2. Blinding  
HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  and placebo tablets  will be identically matched in 
appearance and the bottle labels will not reveal the drug identity. The site investigator or 
designated approved study physician will make the decision to un-blind the identity of the investigational product in the event that the study blind needs to be broken to make medical 
decisions regarding subject treatment. If it is determined that unblinding is necessary to assess 
AEs or SAEs for expedited reporting, NIAAA may decide to request  unblinding of a subject. 
Site staff or S ponsor’s designee approved to un- blind the study drug will log into the IWRS to 
obtain the name [CONTACT_566131]. The IWRS will automatically notify the un -blinded staff member at the Data Coordinating Cent er who will 
notify the Medical Monitor. NIAAA will be notified that an unblinding has occurred if 
unblinding has been performed by [CONTACT_10982]. 
8.7. Interventions on Day -[ADDRESS_1235701] is randomized, he/s he will receive the first bottle of study drug 
and the instructional drug card to take home (Appendix 19.1). Site staff will explain the dosing 
plan to the subject (one tablet  in the morning for the first  3 days, then one tablet in the morning 
and one in the evening for the next 4 days) and how to complete the drug card to track when 
tablets  are taken. The subject will be instructed to take the first dose in the morning of Day 1  
(expected to occur the day after the date of randomization) . Subjects will be instructed to take 
tablets with  meals and w ill be advised to avoid driving and operating heavy machinery, until they 
are aware of how the study drug affects them. The subject will watch the first module of Take 
Control (Day -1), will be given the schedule of visits, and the Week [ADDRESS_1235702] that 
identifies the potential investigational products that s/he could be taking during the study. The 
card will provide the name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour phone number of the investigator (physician) at the site 
who can be contact[CONTACT_566082]. The card will also instruct the non- study 
physician rendering emergency care to contact [CONTACT_527952]/her about the 
care.  
If possible, clinic visits should be scheduled on the same day of the week that the subject 
received the first dose of study drug , but a 3-day window is allowed for conducting visits within 
the scheduled study week. Visits may be scheduled and conducted on any day of the week. Visits can be conducted outside of the scheduled study week, but only based upon subject request (e.g., for reasons related to patient non- compliance with the study schedule). Each subject will receive 
a visit schedule to take home for future reference.

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235703] escalates their dose to 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_63711]. 
Assessments will be the same a s all other telephone contacts (see section 8.10). 
8.9. Maintenance Phase  
During Study Weeks [ADDRESS_1235704] meets the BAC requirement of  a BAC ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_1235705] visit, take vital signs, adminis ter questionnaires (CIWA- AR and C-SSRS), inquire 
about other medication use and assess drinking by  [CONTACT_101608]. Clinical chemistry, pregnancy test for 
women of child- bearing potential and birth control methods (if female), blood for study drug 
compliance, and subject’s weights will be collected in accordance with the schedule in Table 5. 
In addition, s ubjects will complete the battery of questionnaires in accor dance with the schedule 
in Table 5. 
Brief telephone assessments will occur weekly between in -clinic visits . The final in- clinic 
assessment will occur during Week 27. This visit should be scheduled after the subject takes the 
last dose of study drug.  Subjects will view a single module of Take Control that is expected to have a run- time of [ADDRESS_1235706] will be given and the bottle (s) from the previous period will be collected 
and a tablet  count will be performed for accountability. Bottles with unused tablets  will be 
returned to the subject. The d osing schedule will be reviewed and the subject will be provided 
instructions on how to complete the drug card to track tablet  consumption. The subject will be 
instructed to bring the bottle (s) and drug cards with them to the next visit so the site staff can 
perform drug accountability ( tablet counts). The subject will also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_883294]. Additional in -clinic visits are permitted under the protocol, if needed, due to the following 
circumstances: (1) the subject has concerns either about the medication or their drinking and 
wishes to be seen at a time other than their next scheduled in -clinic visit, or, (2) the subject has 
missed a visit and wishes to resume regular participation before their next scheduled visit, (3) the 
subject has reported some change in health, functioning, or circumstances which necessitate a 
visit to conduct safety assessments and evaluate the risk of continued participation in the trial, or (4) clinical laboratory measurements need to be repeated.   
Subjects desiring additional counseling or professional therapy for non- crisis psychiatric matters 
(e.g., marital problems, work issues) should be encouraged to postpone such activity until their 
study participation is concluded. Attendance at self -help support groups (i.e., alcoholics 
anonymous ) will neither be encouraged or discouraged. Any attendance at self -help support

Alcohol Use Problems electronic case report form (eCRF).  
8.10. Telephone Assessments  
The brief telephone interview (approximately 10 minutes) will occur in accordance with the 
schedu le in Table [ADDRESS_1235707] of the next scheduled visit. A 
summary of the telephone script follows: 
1. AEs: An open-ended question will be asked as follows: “How have you been feeling since 
your last clinic visit or phone contact?” If the subject reports a new AE, the resolution of an 
AE, or a change in the severity of an AE, ask additional questions to determine the severity and dates of occurrence or resolution.  
2. CIWA -AR: Subjects  will be assessed for the emergence of withdrawal symptoms using  the 
CIWA -AR. The subject may be asked about changes in drinking status after responses to the 
CIWA -AR interview indicate significant withdrawal. 
3. Concomitant Medications: Ask the following question: “Have you taken any new 
medications since you were last seen in the clinic or since our last call? If the subject responds affirmatively, record the name [CONTACT_11889], the daily dose, route of 
administration, and reason used. If the medication is contraindicated for the study 
(HORIZANT  Extended -Release Tablets , gabapentin or gabapentinoids), then notify a study 
physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant for follow-up with the subject. 
4. Drug Compliance: Verification that the subje ct is taking the prescribed dose and a reminder 
to take investigational product and to return the bottle (s) with untaken tablets  at the next visit 
will be made. During the Week [ADDRESS_1235708] will be reminded of the drug escalation 
schedule.  
5. Reminders: Remind the subject of their next scheduled clinic visit, and adjust the date within the visit week if they have a conflict.  
8.11. Final Clinic Visit  
The final clinic visit occurs during Week 27; at which time the subject has completed taking investigational product. In addition to the assessments previously stated, subjects will have an Exit Interview assessment. The subject will be asked  about their drinkin g for his/her impression 
of whether he /she was receiving active drug  or placebo, if they felt that the medication helped 
drinking, how they would describe their experience taking the medication, if they would recommend it to a friend, if they would take it again if they needed further treatment in the 
future, and a question about desire to please people. The subject will be provided with a referral 
to a treatment program for their alcohol dependence.  If a subject withdraws from the study early 
for any reason, the subject should be asked to retu rn to the clinic for the  conduct of all of the 
final clinic visit assessments.

medical conditions/AEs since that visit. To prompt reporting of new AEs, the subject will also be asked about any ongoing or new medication use.  
8.13. Duration of Subject Participation  
The total time period that each individual subject will participate is 31 weeks  including up to 2 
weeks  for screening, 26 weeks of study interventions, and final safety and efficacy follow-up the 
week after completing treatment (Week 27) , and a final safety follow -up telephone contact f rom 
1-to-[ADDRESS_1235710] requires a higher level of care and discontinuation from the trial intervention are detailed 
below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigational Product Dose Reduction 
The daily dosage of investigational product may be reduced by [CONTACT_701468], by [CONTACT_5989], to compromise the subject’s ability to maintain activities of 
daily living or if the subject reports undue discomfort. As the investigational products are taken 
twice per day, only one dose reduction can occur. If dose reduction is warranted, the subject 
should continue to only take the evening dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigational Product Discontinuation 
Subject who will discontinue investigational products will have the dose reduced to once daily 
for [ADDRESS_1235711] experiences any AEs that are considered study drug related and 
for which the investigator has determined that continuation of the study drug could be

discontinuation from the study will be recorded and a pregnancy test (females only), body 
weight, vital signs measurement, ECG, clinical chemistry , C-SSRS, TLFB and an assessment of 
AEs will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study. Other 
assessments scheduled for the end of study visi t will be collected if possible  (Table 5). 
Additional blood samples for study drug measurement may be collected at the time of discontinuation from subjects who are discontinued due to AEs. 
8.16. Situations Requiring Discontinuation from the Study as well as from 
Investigational Product 
It is possible that there will be some subjects who cannot be safely managed in the clinical study 
even though investigational products have been discontinued. Examples are given below. 
1. Increased Drinking.  Subjects whose alcohol problem worsens, and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_701433], require a more intense level of care than provided in the study may have 
investigational product suspended, and referred to more appropriate care.  
2. Psychiatric Crises.  Examples of psychiatric crises include but are not limited to the 
following: 
a. Acute psychosis (hallucinations, impaired reality testing, paranoid ideation, etc.) 
requiring medication and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527909];  
b. Suicidal or homicidal ideation that results in a credible threat of violence directed at oneself or others; 
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566036]/homicidal behavior will be referred to local treatment centers, emergency departments, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4052], but will not be provided with medication or 
psychotherapy by [CONTACT_464].  
3. Absence from the Protocol due to Confinement in a Controlled Environment.  If a 
subject is confined to a controlled environment (such a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566038]) for less than [ADDRESS_1235713] should be assessed by [CONTACT_566083] (e.g. any new medications or symptoms, pregnancy test, etc.). The decision to restart study drug at the full dose or titrate to the  full dose will be made in the judgment of the 
investigator based on the subject’s time off study drug and past experience with side effects with the study drug.

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 52 NIAAA Confidential   10. Safety Monitoring Plan 
Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; therefore safety concerns will be 
identified by [CONTACT_218909], clinic staff, clinical monitor, medic al 
monitor, and NIAAA.  
Study Safety Management:  The IRB, Medical Monitor, PI, clinical monitors, NIAAA and 
XenoPort (or its affiliates) will review any safety concerns throughout the trial. In addition, a 
data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will participate in this study. The roles of these 
individuals/committee are described below.  
Medical Monitor:  A Medical Monitor and Alternate Medical Monitor have been appointed by 
[CONTACT_566085]. The Medical Monitor will be available for making recommendation s to 
the investigator and NIAAA on the severity of any SAEs, and the relatedness to the study interventions. The Medical Monitor will also be responsible for tracking and assessing trends in 
the AEs reported.  
Clinical Monitors: All investigators will allo w representatives of the Data Coordinating Center 
(Fast -Track Drugs and Biologics, LLC) staff to periodically monitor, at mutually convenient 
times during and after the study, all study data. These monitoring visits provide the Data 
Coordinating Center, NIAAA, and XenoPort with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the 
study and to obtain information about potential problems. The monitors will assure that 
submitted data are accurate and in agreement with any paper source documentation used; verify 
that investigational products are properly stored and accounted for, verify that subjects’ consent for study participation has been properly obtained and documented, confirm that research 
subjects entered into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assure that all essential 
documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed. 
Monitors will conduct a site initiation visit prior to the start of the study. At this visit, they will 
assure that proper study- related documentation exists, assist in training investigators and other 
site personnel in study procedures and GCP guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and 
assure that acceptable facilities are available to conduct the study.  
Routine monitoring visit s by [CONTACT_566086]’s representatives will be 
scheduled at appropriate intervals but more frequently at the beginning of the study. A monitoring visit soon after the first two subjects have been randomized is planned. At these 
visits, the monitors will verify that study procedures are being conducted according to the 
protocol guidelines, monitor eCRFs against source documents, review AEs and SAEs, and perform drug accountability. At the end of the study, they will confirm that the si te has the 
appropriate essential documents on file, advise on storage of study records, and inspect the return and destruction records for unused investigational products.  
Sponsor and XenoPort Site Visits:  All investigators will allow NIAAA and XenoPort f ull 
access to study records during periodic site visits by [CONTACT_883297] . Visits by [CONTACT_883298] a mutually convenient time and will be scheduled in advance. DSMB: An independent DSMB of external advisors will meet prior to the start of the study, 
quarterly during enrollment and follow-up and at trial end to review safety data. The Board will 
be blinded to subjects’ actual randomized group assignments but may request at any time that the 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 53 NIAAA Confidential   blind be broken by [CONTACT_68707], if concerns arise from the blinded data. In addition to 
quarterly meetings, the DSMB will meet after half of the subjects (173) have been randomized to 
review safety data and the integrity of the study (i.e., an evaluation of the dropout rate and 
impact on the planned statistical analysis of the data) and make a formal recommendation to the sponsor on the continuation or early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883264]. Ad hoc 
meetings will be convened if SAEs occur that are considered at least possibly related  to the 
investigational product. 
 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 54 NIAAA Confidential   11. Assessment  Methods  
All study assessments will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 5); the following sections outline the details and procedures associated with 
the assessments.  All assessments will be recorded on a source document with the exception of 
staff or subject completed questionnaires. 
11.1. Alcohol Breathalyzer  
An alcohol breathalyzer will be administered at consent, at screening, and at every in- clinic visit 
as a safety measure. Acceptable BAC level at consent  and screening visit 2 (Day -1, the day of 
randomization) is e qual to 0.[ADDRESS_1235722] a causal relationship with 
the administered treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational 
product . Pre-existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless there is a 
change in severity or  frequency.  
11.2.2. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events Definit ion 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one of the following:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in 
the ri sk information included in the Product Label for the drug. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 55 NIAAA Confidential   11.2.3. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints 
AEs will be assessed at study visits starting after the first administration of investigational 
product until the final follow -up visit. However, SAEs will be collected from the time of 
informed consent onward. General symptoms will be collected  via an open ended question: 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit or the last time we spoke ?”  
AEs will be documented in the source records, and recorded on the eCRFs using accepted 
medical terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is 
known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The investigator will assess all AEs for seriousness, relationship to investigational 
product, and severity. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on 
the AE eCRF as “ongoing”.  
If a woman has a positive or borderl ine pregnancy test after enrollment, the NIAAA Medical 
Monitor will be contact[CONTACT_566089]. The site will contact [CONTACT_3970]’s status until the pregnancy has been terminated or co mpleted. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the NIAAA Medical 
Monitor without delay within 24 hours of knowledge of the event if the outcome is a SAE (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life- threatening complicat ion to the 
mother or newborn).  
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_218911] (the event either resolved or stabilized and i s not expected to resolve in the near term). AEs must be reported up 
to [ADDRESS_1235723], AEs will be recorded and followed to resolution only if they 
are serious, or if the study physician assesses them to be clinically significant.  
11.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
Abnormal clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., from vital signs or ECG), judged as clinically significant by [CONTACT_701471], if they meet the definitions provided in Section 11.2.2. Abnormal 
laboratory or other findings present at baseline that significantly worsen following start of the 
study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. Abnormal findings present at the start of the study that do not worsen will not be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless the investigator or designee judges 
them as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
11.2.5. Classification of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Investigational 
Product  
For each recorded AE or SAE, a physician - investigator must make an assessment of severity . 
For those AEs included in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03), these severity criteria will apply. For those not listed in 
the CTCAE, the fo llowing criteria  will be used : 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 56 NIAAA Confidential   Mild:  An event that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does 
not generally interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject . The event is usually ameliorated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention.  
Severe:   An event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical status. The event poses a significant risk of harm to the subject  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911], and typi[INVESTIGATOR_527916]. 
Life-threatening  An event that puts the subject into imminent risk of death without 
intervention.  
In particular , clinical chemistry severity and blood pressure increases will be graded in 
accordance with the CTCAE version 4.03. The severity grades for the chemistry tests used in this 
study and for systolic and diastolic blood pressure are provided in Appendix 19.3. 
The investigator must make an assess ment of relationship to the investigational product based on 
the following criteria:  
Unrelated:  The subject did not receive the investigational product, the temporal sequence 
of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product 
is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of the AE/SAE. 
Unlikely:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product but there is another more likely cause of the AE/SAE.  
Possible:  
There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, but the AE/SAE could have been due to another equally likely cause.  
Probable:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational 
product is reasonable, and the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913]. 
Definite  There is evidence of expos ure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or investigational product class.  
11.2.6. Outcomes and Actions Taken  
All unresolved AEs will be followed for a minimum of 14 days (unless the AE is an ongoing 
pregnancy which must be followed to conclusion) after the subject ’s final study visit, unless the 
investigator’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized prior to the 14-
day period, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235724] observation, as follows: 
Fatal:  The subject  died.  
Resolved  without S equelae: The AE or SAE has ended. 
Resolved with Sequelae : The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from 
baseline.  
Unresolved – Ongoing:  The AE has not ended and is ongoing at the e nd of the 
reporting period (i.e., 14 days after the final Follow-up visit) 
and the investigator deems that further follow up is not medically required  
Unknown – Lost to Follow -up: Lost to follow -up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_29320]. 
Actions taken with respect to investigational agents (discontinuation or not) will also be 
recorded. In addition, if the AE was treated (medications or other physical measures), this will also be recorded. 
11.2.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 24 hour Reporting Requirements (Initial Report)  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subject from the time of 
signing consent through the final follow-up visit whether or not related to the investigational product, must be reported within  [ADDRESS_1235725] -Track will notify the Medical Monitors upon receipt of the 
notification and coordinate communications with the Medical Monitors.

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 58 NIAAA Confidential   • Any other relevant information necessary to support the investigator’s judgment 
regarding the SAE’s relatedness severity to the investigational product OR by [CONTACT_883300]/Alternate . 
These paper documents may be submi tted by [CONTACT_6972] , as email attachments, or by [CONTACT_566092]’s eCRF casebook. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting to the IRB  
Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, SAEs related to participation in the 
study and all subject deaths should be promptly reported by [CONTACT_648], email, or fax to the local IRB. 
Investigators are required to forward safety information provided by [CONTACT_456]’s representative 
to the IRB. 
11.3. Alcohol Craving Scale 
The ACQ -SR-R contains 12-items adapted from the 47- item ACQ -NOW developed by [CONTACT_701474] (1994)  to assess craving for alcohol among alcohol users in the current context (right now). 
There are 4 subscale scores for compulsivity, expectancy, purposefulness and emotionality and a 
total score. Each item has a 1 to 7 raw score (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). The sum 
of the raw scores for each factor are divided by 3 to yield a factor based score. Items 3, 8, and 11 are reverse keyed. A general craving index is derived by [CONTACT_701475] 12. 
This form takes ~[ADDRESS_1235727]-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, 
perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and three second- order factors 
(attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness) (
Patton et al -1995 ). This questionnaire will 
be completed by [CONTACT_566099]. 11.5. Beck Anxiety Inventory  
The BAI consists of [ADDRESS_1235728] week, 
expressed as common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to 
heat, and fear of the worst happening). This inventory was designed to minimize the overlap with 
depression scales  (
Beck et al -1988 ). Each question has the same set of four possible answer 
choices, which are arranged in columns and are answered by [CONTACT_883301] a 
cross. These are:  
Not at all. (0 points) 
Mildly : It did not bother me much. (1 point) 
Moderately : It was very unpleasant, but I could stand it. (2 points) 
Severely : I could barely stand it. (3 points) 
The BAI has a maximum score of 63. The standardized cutoffs for anxiety severity are:  
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 59 NIAAA Confidential   0-7: minimal level of anxiety  
8-15: mild anxiety  
16-25: moderate anxiety  
26-63: severe anxiety  
This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566109].  
11.6. Beck Depression Inventory – II 
The BDI -II is a 21 -item multiple choice questionnaire that is used for measuring the severity of 
depression ( Beck et al -1966 ). Each item is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. The standardized 
cutoffs for depression severity are:  
0–13: minimal depression  
14–19: mild depression 
20–28: moderate depression 
29–63: severe depression  
This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566109].  
11.7. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol- revised (CIWA -AR) 
The CIWA -AR modified telephone version is an adaptation for telephone administration of the 
CIWA -AR a brief 10 -item measure used to provide a quantitative index of the severity of the 
alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( Sullivan et al-1989 ). The CIWA-AR has been used both in 
clinical and research applications and has demonstrated both reliability and validity ( Sellers et al -
1992 , Stuppaeck et al -1994 ). This questionnaire will be administered by a clinical staff member 
and subject responses will be recorded electronically and will be both t he source and eCRF.  
11.8. Clinical Chemistry  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at the clinical site’s local clinical laboratory. 
Laboratories performing these assessments should be directly regulated by [CONTACT_36460] ( CAP ) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ( CLIA ) guidelines. The 
laboratory will need to provide a copy of current certification. All clinical laboratory data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_35955]. The total blood volume is approxi mately 
72 mL.  Additiona l laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the investigator if the 
results of any tests fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to ensure safety. Clinical chemistry tests  are listed below . 
• Creatinine  
• Total bilirubin  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 60 NIAAA Confidential   • Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)  
Serum creatinine levels will be used to calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl) according to the 
Cockroft- Gault  (1976)  formula as follows:  
 
Males  CrCl (mL/min) =  (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL 
 
Females  CrCl (mL/min) =  0.85 x (140 – age in years) x body weight in kg  
72 x serum creatinine mg/dL  
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers clinically 
significant:  
• The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out-of- range value  
• The investigator will follow the out-of- range value to a s atisfactory clinical resolution  
• A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study or 
requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE  
11.9. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a 4 -page form asking questions about suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, and 
suicidal behavior developed by [CONTACT_566100] ( Oquendo et al-2003 ). This scale is intended for use by [CONTACT_411974]. The 
questions contained in the C-SSRS are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the 
presence of suicidality depends on clinical judgment. Training is required before administering 
the C -SSRS through a 30- minute interactive slide presentation followed by  a question- answer 
session through the Columbia University Medical Center. Those completing the training are 
certified to administer the C -SSRS, and will receive a training certificate. As the MINI will be 
used to establish subject initial eligibility with  respect to suicidality, the “Since Last Visit” 
version of the C- SSRS will be used at each cl inic visit starting with Visit [ADDRESS_1235729]’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
employment pattern , occupation, and income level. These data will be collected by [CONTACT_566101] a 
source document and entered into an eCRF. 
11.11. Drinking Question  
If a subject  is withdrawn from the study early and is no longer participating in clinic visits or 
providing TLFB drinking data but is willing to be contact[CONTACT_883302], then they will be asked about any drinking and heavy drinking during the time since 
last contact. Phone calls will continue until the end of the treat ment period, as deemed acceptable 
by [CONTACT_102],  to obtain data on the primary efficacy endpoint (any heavy drinking days defined 
as 5 drinks per day for males and 4 drinks per day for females) and on the secondary efficacy 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235730] drinking units (SDU) applies. This data will 
be recorded on a source document and eCRF. This does not apply to subjects who are willing to 
supply daily drinking data by [CONTACT_566104]. 
11.12. ECG  
A 12 -lead resting ECG will be obtained. Any abnormalities will be noted and an assessment of 
clinical significance will be done by a study physician.  
11.13. Exit Interview  
At the final in -clinic visit (or by [CONTACT_566105]) , the subject will complete 
a questionnaire for his/her impression of whether he/she was receiving active drug  or placebo, if 
they felt that the medication helped drinking, how they would describe their experience taking 
the medication, if they would recommend it to a friend, if they would take it again if they needed 
further treatment in the future, and a question about desire to please people. This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_883303]. 
11.14. Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence  
The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence will be used to assess smoking status and motivation to change smoking behavior at baseline (
Heatherton et al -1991 ). This questionnaire 
will be completed by [CONTACT_883304]. 
11.15. Cigarette Smoking Quantity- Frequency  
A quantity frequency interview at baseline will include three questions to assess cigarette smoking behavior and other tobacco/nicotine containing products use during the study : 1) “Over 
the past week, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?”, 2) “On the days you smoked 
during the past week, how many cigarettes did you smoke on average?”, and 3) “Have you used 
any other tobacco or nicotine containing products besides cigarett es in the past week (e.g., cigars, 
cigarellos, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], bidis, or smokeless tobacco such as pan, chewing tobacco, or snuff, or nicotine 
replacement therap ies such as patch or gum)?”. This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566110]. 
11.16. Family History of Alcohol Problems  
Information on family history of alcohol problems will also be collected using the Family 
History of Alcohol Problems. The questionnaire provides subjects with a consistent set of cues 
for id entifying blood relatives with alcohol problems by [CONTACT_2329] a family tree listing for relatives 
(
Mann et al -1985 ). This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_883305]. 
11.17. Genetic Analy sis  
Blood samples for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_883265] ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Tubes w ill be stored 
frozen at < -20°C and will be shipped to a central storage facility  at the end of the study for

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235731] their sample analyzed for a broader range of research.  
One 2.5 mL tube of blood for RNA analysis will be collected at baseline and at Week 24 at 
approximately the same time of day to control for circadian rhythm. 
The samples will be retained while research on HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  (or drugs 
of this class) continues but no longer than [ADDRESS_1235732] responds on a 5-point scale responses to 
questions on the consequences of alcohol use. This scale was adapted from the Drinker Inventory of Consequences questionnaire based on FDA recommendations on patient reported outcomes 
(
Miller & Tonigen -1995 ). This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_883306]. 
11.19. Locator Form/Mobile Phone Contact 
[CONTACT_883307], subjects will be asked to provide names, addresses, and phone 
numbers of several friends and/or family members who can be contact[CONTACT_701479] (Locator Form). This locator form will be used to assist in contact[CONTACT_883308] -up. This form asks subjects his/her name, address, and phone number and to 
provide names, addresses, and phone numbers of several friends and family members who can be contact[CONTACT_566111]. This information is essential and will be coll ected 
during screening, and will be updated throughout the study as necessary. This information will 
remain exclusively at the site. In addition, a mobile phone provided by [CONTACT_883309] a mobile phone or who do not wish to use their personal 
mobile phone for study related contacts. The mobile phone will only be given to subjects who 
are determined to be eligible and who are dispensed study drug. 
11.20. Medical History  
A medical history will be taken for all potential study subjects to assure medical fitness during 
screening. The age at which the subject started drinking alcohol regularly at least 3 times per 
month (age of onset) will also be collected as part of the medical history. Prior (lifetime) 
treatment for alc ohol problems and drinking will also be collected. The answers to the following 
questions will be collected: 
1. Number of lifetime inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e. at least one overnight stay) to get help 
with reducing or quitting drinking. 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 63 NIAAA Confidential   2. Number of lifetime  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (i.e. at least one overnight stay) for 
illnesses, injuries, or accidents due to drinking. 
3. Number of times in lifetime underwent alcohol detoxification using medication.  
4. Number of lifetime outpatient visits (i.e. no overnight stay) with a health professional to 
get help with reducing or quitting drinking. 
5. In the past year, how many alcoholics anonymous (AA), [ADDRESS_1235733] 
if anything has changed since the initial screening interview.  
11.21. MINI  
The MINI (paper version 7.0) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by 
[CONTACT_242574], for DSM-5 and ICD -10 psychiatric 
disorders ( Sheehan et al -1998 ). With an administration time of approximately [ADDRESS_1235734] study visit, the 
Alcohol Use Disorders Module will be assessed again, but the initial drinking question will not 
be asked and the time period for which the questions apply has been revised to “the past month” instead of the past 12 months. 
11.22. Other Services Used for Alcohol Use Problems  
At randomization  (past 4 weeks) and monthly during the study, the subject will be interviewed 
about attendance at group meetings [ AA, 12- step programs, secular organizations for sobriety 
(SOS), or similar group meetings]  and visits with health professionals for assistance in reducing 
or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7448]. Use of additional counseling or professional therapy for non- crisis 
psychiatric matters or any additional pharmacologic or non- pharmacologic treatments received 
will be documented. This questionnaire will be administered by a clinical staff member and 
subject ’s responses will be recorded electronically and will be both the source and eCRF. 
11.23. Phosphatidyle thanol Determination 
Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) as a biomarker for chronic alcohol use has been reviewed recently by 
[CONTACT_883310] -2012 ). PEth  is formed in the blood by [CONTACT_883311] D to phosphatidic acid that when in the presence of blood alcohol results in the 
production of PEth  (Mueller et al -1988 ). In clinical studies conducted on chronic heavy drinkers, 
PEth was found to be detectable in blood up to 28 days after sobriety ( Aradottir et al-2006 ; 
Hansson et al -1997 ; Hartmann et al -2007 ; Varga et al -1998 ; Wurst et al -2010 ; Wurst et al -2012 ). 
In 15 alcoholics following a detoxification program, the mean half- life of blood PEth was 4.0 ± 
0.7 days with a range of 3.0-5.3 days ( Varga et al -2000 ). It has been demonstrated that sex, 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 64 NIAAA Confidential   gender, age and body mass index do not influence the normalization rate of PEth ( Wurs t et al -
2010 ). In a recent experiment during which, after three weeks of abstinence, 11 social drinkers 
were exposed to an amount of ethanol of 1 g/Kg for five consecutive days (daily alcohol intake 
ranging between 67 and 109 g/day ), and then remained abstinent for [ADDRESS_1235735] week and from 5.0 to 12.0 days in the second week ( Gnann et al -2012 ). 
A dried blood spot method will be used by [CONTACT_883312]’s finger (after wipi[INVESTIGATOR_883266]) with the lancet provided in the collection kit and allowing blood to wick onto the 
collection card ([ADDRESS_1235736]). The card may be stored at room 
temperature for up to one year before assay. Cards will be sent periodically during the study to the central laboratory ([LOCATION_002] Drug Testing Laboratories, Des Plaines, IL) for analysis.  
11.24. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548]  (PSQI)  
The PSQI  is a 1 9-item questionnaire with 6 subscales (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, 
sleep duration, habitual sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication and day time dysfunction) (
Buysse et al -1989 ). Each subscale is rated from [ADDRESS_1235737]’s overall sleep experience in the past [ADDRESS_1235738] Compliance  
11.25.1. Drug Accountability/Compliance 
Drug accountability will be performed by [CONTACT_883313]. The amount dispensed, daily dose prescribed, and 
amount returned will be reconciled and recorded at each visit. The drug card will be reviewed for 
subject reported consumption of investigational product. If the subject reports missing tablets  
that were not taken, these data will also be recorded and used to calculate total drug exposure. If 
the investigational product bottle was not returned, then the subject’s self-report of drug taken will be reported. If the study drug was discontinued, the reason for discontinuation will also be 
recorded.  
11.25.2. Gabapentin Plas ma Levels 
Blood samples for determining plasma levels of gabapentin  to assess for drug compliance and to 
perform population PK /PD analysis will be colle cted according to the schedule in Table 5. Blood 
will be collected in  one 8 mL K
3EDTA  tube and placed on ice. The t ube will be centrifuged and 
plasma collected, aliquoted, and frozen at ≤ - 20°C until shipment to [COMPANY_003] laboratories  for 
analysis. Gabapentin levels will be determined using a validated liquid chromatography–mass 
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC –MS/MS) method. The LC–MS/MS method was validated 
for gabapentin in plasma over the range 80 -10,000 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantitation is 80 
ng/mL.  The details for collection, centri fugation, aliquoting, storage and shipment of samples to 
the central laboratory  are provided in the Manual of Procedures. If a subject has discontinued 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235739] two days, then blood for PK determination does not need to be 
collected.  
11.26. Profile of Mood State (POMS)  
The POMS measures dimensions of affect or mood ( McNair and Heuchert -2005 ). It consists of 
[ADDRESS_1235740] responds according to a 5-point s cale ranging from “not at all” 
to “extremely.” Six subscale scores will be computed for items grouped as follows: Tension-
Anxiety, Depression- Dejection, Anger -Hostility, Vigor -Activity, Fatigue -Inertia, and 
Confusion=Bewilderment. A total mood disturbance score will also be computed which consists 
of the sum of the 5 of the six subscale scores (the Vigor -Activity score is not included). This 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_566099].  
11.27. Pregnancy Test and Birth Control Record  
An FDA approved rapid result urine pregnancy test will be used (i.e., dipstick test), unless the 
site IRB requires a blood- based assay. If applicable, subjects will be asked to sign a release of 
information form for study personnel to access medical records to obtain information regarding 
the outcome of a pregnancy that occurred during the study. 
The Birth Control Assessment is designed to determine a female subject’s compliance with the 
birth control specifications detailed in the inclusion criteria.  
11.28. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications taken by [CONTACT_423] 2-months prior to the start of screening, during the 
screening period, and through the final follow-up contact [CONTACT_639277]. All medications 
reported by [CONTACT_196303] a source document and eCRF.  
11.29. Physical Examination 
A physical examination of the oral cavity, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, cardiovascular 
system, lungs, abdomen, extremities, skin, neuropsychiatric mental status and sensor y/motor 
status, musculoskeletal system and general appearance will be performed during screening. The 
physical exam will be updated on the day planned for randomization by [CONTACT_701484]. Wei ght (kg) will be collected per 
the schedule in Table 5. A symptom directed physical examination will be performed , as 
applicable,  at other visits  if the subject reports any problems. Abnormal findings will be reported 
as AEs, if appropriate.  
11.30. Screen Failures Documentation  
To document the reason that a subject who consented to the study was not randomized, the 
Enrollment and Eligibili ty Checklist eCRF s will be completed for these subjects.  
11.31. Subject Disposition  
A subject disposition eCRF will be completed for all subjects who are randomized to the study and who are dispensed investigational product. This eCRF will be used to record the following 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 66 NIAAA Confidential   data as appli cable: 1) completion status of the subject at the end of their participation and if they 
were discontinued early, and reason for early discontinuation. 
Completion status is as follows: 
1. Subject completed full study (i.e., telephone contact [CONTACT_883314] W eeks 28 to 29 
follow-up). 
2. Subject completed  the full intervention phase of the study (i.e., subject came to Week 27 
clinic visit).  
3. Subject was withdrawn  prior to the Week 27 visit (reasons for early withdrawal are to be 
specified).  
4. If the subject d iscontin ued study medications. 
Even if the subject had investigational product suspended for any reason but attended clinic 
visits, the above definitions still apply. 
In addition, if the subject was confined and/or incarcerated at any time during the study, the da tes 
of confinement and/or incarceration will be collected. 
11.32. Drinking Goal  
The Thoughts About Abstinence Scale developed by [CONTACT_883315] (1988)  for smoking was 
adapted for drinking and items for a drinking goal, and confidence and motivation to meet the 
selected goal have been included. Th e resultant assessment , named Drinking Goal, is a 3-item 
questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_883316].  
11.33. TLFB Interview  
Drinking behavior will be assessed using the TLFB methodology ( Sobell & Sobell-1992 ). The 
TLFB is a semi -structured interview that provides estimates of the daily quantity of alcohol 
consumption during specified time periods. It uses a calendar prompt and a number of other 
memory aids (e.g., holidays, payday, and other personally relevant dates) to facilitate accurate recall of drinking or other drug use during the target period. The procedure has been widely used 
in clinical and research contexts. It has demonstrated adequate levels of reliability and validity 
when administered as an in -person interview, over the telephone, and when administered via 
computer (
Carey -1997 , Sobell et al -1988 , Sobell et al-1996 ). After consent is signed, the TLFB 
interview will be performed for the 28-day period prior to signing consent. Thereafter, the interview will be for the previous days between the last assessment and the day prior to the day of the assessment. It is estimated that a [ADDRESS_1235741] the TLFB drinking data. This spreadsheet contains a calculator to

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235742] drink units (SDUs). This spreadsheet will be reviewed, compared with source 
documents and collected by [CONTACT_566119]. 
Drinking days are defined as the number of days in which the subject reported any alcohol 
consumption (i.e., > [ADDRESS_1235743] drinking units [SDUs]). A standard drink contains approximately 0.6 fluid ounces (oz) of pure alcohol. The data given by [CONTACT_566120](s) consumed will be converted to SDUs. Standard drink unit definitions are provided in Table 8. 
Table 8: Standard Drink Unit Definitions  
For Beer  (~ 5% alcohol) , the approximate number of SDUs in:  
• 12 oz = 1.0  
• 16 oz = 1.3 
• 22 oz = 2.0 
• 40 oz = 3.3 
For malt liquor  (~ 7% alcohol), the approximate number of SDUs in: 
• 12 oz = 1.4 • 16 oz = 1.9 
• 22 oz = 2.6 
• 40 oz = 4.7 
For table wine  (~ 12% alcohol) , the approximate number of SDUs in:  
• 750 mL bottle = 25oz = 5.0 
• 5 oz glass = 1.0 
• 10 oz glass = 2. 0 
For 80 proof spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120]  (~ 40% alcohol) , or hard liquor, the approximate number of 
SDUs in:  
• 1.5 oz (mixed drink) = 1 .0 
• 16 oz (pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]) = 11.0 
• 25 oz ( a fifth) = 17.0 
• 1.75 L (59 oz) = 39 .0 
11.34. World Health Organization Drinking Risk Categorical Scale 
The WHO has developed a drinking risk categorical scale that can be used in a responder 
analysis approach to assess clinically relevant decreases in alcohol consumption ( Aubin et 
al-2015 ). Two dichotomous endpoints will be analyzed: WHO 1- level and WHO [ADDRESS_1235744] 1- and 2- level  decrease in WHO levels of alcohol consumption, 
respectively,  from the level at baseline (the period including the 28 days before screening) to the 
level during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance phase (Study Weeks 22 -25).  
  
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 68 NIAAA Confidential   The WHO levels of average alcohol consumption per day are as follows: 
               Males               Females  
Low Risk         1 to 40g            1 to 20g 
Medium Risk     41 to 60g          21 to 40g 
High Risk        61 to 100g        41 to 60g 
Very High Risk  101+g               61+g  
where 14g = 1 SDU ( WHO-2000 ). In computing the WHO alcohol consumption level, average 
drinks per day will be used, computed as the sum of all drinks in the 28 day period divided by 
[CONTACT_273575]- missing drinking data in that period. Abstinent subjects will be 
included in a separate “Abstinent” category. A subject must have at least [ADDRESS_1235745] will not be removed from the study but should be asked about medication use and possibly re- evaluate their medical history for substance abuse.  
11.36. Vital Signs  
Vital signs to be assessed include sitting  blood pres sure and pulse rate (after sitting  for at least 3 
minutes).

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 69 NIAAA Confidential   12. Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
12.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Complete details of the statistical analyses to be performed will be documented in a SAP, which 
will be completed prior to locking and unblinding the study data. This document will include 
more detail of analysis populations, summary strategies, and any amendments to the proposed 
analyses listed here, if necessary. Any changes to the SAP  will be outlined in the f inal study 
report.  
12.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  It is hypothesized that HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets, as 
compared to placebo will increase the PSNHDD during Study Weeks 22 to 25 (last 4 weeks of 
the maintenance period  (where a heavy drinking day is defined as 5 or more drinks per drinking 
day for men, 4 or more drinks per drinking day for women). This hypothesis will be explored using other time periods in exploratory analyses. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
Over the last 4 weeks of the maintenance period , it is hypothesized that the HORIZANT 
Extended -Release Tablets  group, as compared to the placebo group, will: 
1. Increase the percentage of subjects abstinent from alcohol  (key secondary endpoint) 
2. Increase the percentage o f subjects with a WHO drinking risk category decrease of: 
a.  1-level  
b.  2-level s  
3. Increase the percentage of days abstinent  per week  
4. Decrease the percentage of heavy drinking days per week  
5. Decease the weekly mean number of drinks per week   
6. Decrease the weekly mean drinks per drinking day 
7. Decrease the cigarettes smoked per week  among  smokers 
8. Decrease the alcohol craving score (ACQ -SR-R) per visit 
9. Decrease the alcohol related consequences ( ImBIBe) score  per visit 
10. Decrease PSQI  score  
11. Decrease the BAI score  
12. Decrease the BDI -II score  
12.3. Analysis Populations 
The study analysis populations will consist of the following: 
Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set: The mITT set is defined as subjects 
randomized to participate in the study who took at least one dose of investigational product. 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 70 NIAAA Confidential   Evaluable Analysis Set:  The evaluable analysis set is defined as those subjects randomized to 
the study who took at least 80% of the prescribed dose of tablets during the maintenance period 
(Weeks 2 - 25) and did not have a major p rotocol violation.  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed  on both the mITT and evaluable 
analysis sets.  Exploratory analyses will be performed on the mITT analysis set, unless otherwise 
specified.  Safety analys es will be conducted on the mITT analysis set.  
12.4. Description of Statistical Methods  
12.4.1. General Approach  
For descriptive purposes, dichotomous and categorical variables will be presented as number of 
observations and percentages; continuous variables will be given as means, standard deviations (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max). Statistical tests will be two -tailed at a 0.05 
Type I error rate. P -values for the primary and secondary endpoints of < 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant. Covariates will be pre -specified in the SAP. Endpoint data will also be 
screened for outliers and skewness. Appropriate non- parametric tests will be used to compare 
treatment groups on continuous baseline characteristics that are not normally distributed. 
Continuous endpoint data t hat are not normally distributed will be transformed . Cohen’s d will 
be used to calculate the effect size for means and Cohen’s h will be used to calculate the effect size for proportions. Odds ratios will be provided for all dichotomous outcomes and converted to Cohen’s d where appropriate. Descriptive statistics – mean, SD, median, min and max – of all 
endpoint data will be provided for each assessment point or summarized at each week for drinking endpoints. All data will be presented in listings.  
12.4.2. Analysi s Addressing the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary analysis will be conducted via a fully covaried logistic regression analysis of the  
PSNHDD during Study Weeks 22 to 25 (last 4 weeks of the maintenance period on the mITT population). The model include s treatment group, clinical site, pre -randomization drinking goal 
(abstinence versus not abstinent), and baseline percent heavy drinking days (in the 28-day period 
prior to the date that the subject sign ed the informed consent form). Exploratory analyses will 
examine other timeframes beyond the last 4 weeks. A two -tailed p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_1235746] 
TLFB d ata; however, if the subject does not want to participate in the collection of the TLFB 
they will be asked to participate in a periodic follow-up phone call to collect a summary of 
drinking information. If the subject agrees to be contact[CONTACT_883317]. Phone calls will continue until the end of the treatment period, as deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_102]. The two questions cover 
whether the subject had any heavy drinking days or drinking days during the period covered. 
This summary drinking data will be used for the primary endpoint when TLFB data are not available. If the subject does not agree to participate with phone contact, thus no summary 
drinking data nor TLFB data is available, then imputation as indicated above will be used. An 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 71 NIAAA Confidential   analysis of PSNHDD without imputation for missing data will be performed as an exploratory 
analysis.  
12.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Key Secondary Endpoint: Percentage of Subjects Abstinent from Alcohol  
Percentage of subjects abstinent during Weeks [ADDRESS_1235747] inent endpoint. The testing procedure utilizes the serial gate keepi[INVESTIGATOR_234255] 
(
Dmitrienko and Tamhane-2009 ). The key secondary endpoint can only be evaluated for 
statistical significance after the primary endpoint has been identified as statistically significant. In this situation, percentage of subjects abstinent will be evaluated using the Wald statistic from 
the logistic regression model at p<0.[ADDRESS_1235748] p<0.05. If PSNHDD is 
not statistically  significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_1235749] 
will be considered not abstinent. An analysis of percent subjects abstinent without imputation for 
missing data will be performed as an exploratory analys is.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supportive Secondary Efficacy Endpoints   
Supportive secondary efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed based on data during the last 4 
weeks of the maintenance period  (Weeks 22 through 25), including TLFB and other 
questionnaire data assessed at Week [ADDRESS_1235750] data collected during this period . No 
imputation will be done on any supportive secondary efficacy endpoint. 
In general, every continuous secondary efficacy endpoint is analyzed using a repeated measures 
mixed effects model where subjects are random effects; factors and covariates are fixed effects.  
 The primary analysis model for all continuous endpoint is: 
• Appropriately transformed endpoint = treatment + week + treatment*week + clinical 
site + baseline equivalent of endpoint + covariates  
Covariates for continuous secondary efficacy endpoints include the baseline equivalent of the 
endpoint, clinical site, treatment, time and the treatment by [CONTACT_6491]. Additional covariates for the secondary efficacy endpoints may include baseline characteristics with a 
theoretical and/or empi[INVESTIGATOR_883251] a relationship with a particular secondary endpoint. 
Such characteristics may include, but are not limited to,  drinking goal (total abstinence versus 
less than total abstinence), age, years of regular drinking (age minus age first started drinking 
alcohol regularly), baseline alcohol craving scale total score. Prior to the unblinding of the data, 
matrices of correlations between these baseline characteristics and each of the secondary efficacy endpoints, pooled across blinded treatment assignment, will be produced (using Pearson for 
continuous variables, Spearman for categorical outcomes). Selection of baseline var iables to 
HORIZA NT for Alcohol Use Disorder  NCIG, NIAAA, NIH  
Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 72 NIAAA Confidential   include as covariates in the models will be based on consideration of the following criteria: at 
least modest correlation with outcome (i.e., r> 0.20), and clinical expertise. Each endpoint may 
have a unique set of covariates. Care is taken to onl y select a limited number of covariates such 
that the models are not over fitted.  
This primary model will also be applied to the untransformed endpoint. 
Results based on the primary analysis model and the model of the untransformed endpoint will 
be presented in tabular form. The overall least squares means and least square means for each 
time point along with the 95% confidence intervals will be presented for the untransformed endpoint only, while two- tailed p -values and Cohen’s d will be presented for both the 
untransformed and transformed data. Inference and Cohen’s d will be based upon the results using appropriately transformed data.  
Analysis of the dichotomous secondary drinking endpoint s, percent subjects with a WHO 1- and 
2-level decrease in alcohol consumption (
Aubi n et al -2015 ), will be conducted via a fully 
covaried logistic regression  model and contingency table. Covariates for the logistic regression 
model will be selected using a similar approach as that used for the primary endpoint PSNHDD 
as described in Section 9.4.2. Fewer covariates for the logistic regression may be used depending 
upon the number of observed events. No baseline drinking covariate will be employed for the endpoints, as these endpoints already adju st for baseline drinking in their calculation. 
Covariates  for both of these endpoints will be pre -specified in the SAP . 
Analyses of supportive secondary endpoints with imputation for missing data will be performed 
as exploratory analyses.  
12.4.4. Safety Analyses 
AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the MedDRA and will be grouped by [CONTACT_883318]. The severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to investigational product 
will be presented by [CONTACT_566122][INVESTIGATOR_14839]. Listings of each individual AE including start date, 
stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will be provided. Each AE (based on PT ) 
will be counted once only for a given study subject. If the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity will be assumed. Thus, study subjects are not counted multiple 
times in a given numerator in the calculation of frequencies for a specific AE. C-SSRS reports of 
suicidality or suicidal ideation will be reported as AEs and analyzed as AEs if the investigator 
determines after an interview with the subject that the responses are consistent with suicidal 
ideation or attempt.  
Chemistry  data, urine drug screen results, pregnancy test results, and alcohol breathalyzer results, 
will be reported as summary statistics. Vital signs will be presented as summary statistics and 
change from baseline. The proportions of ECG results considered abnormal and clinically 
significant will also be provided. CIWA- AR scores will be analyzed similar to the efficacy 
endpoints: mixed effects models with and without baseline characteristics. In addition, change 
from baseline (shift tables) will also be presented for clinical laboratory data. The numbers and 
proportion of subjects who reported CIWA- AR scores ≥ 10 at any time after the start of dosing 
will be presented.

Protocol Number: NCIG -006 
Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235751] taken will be reported on a weekly ba sis and across 
the entire trial duration. In addition, the percentage of subjects discontinuing medication and a 
listing of the reasons for discontinuation will be provided. Weekly days of attendance at self -help 
meetings or other professional service providers to help reduce/quit drinking will be presented as 
summary statistics by [CONTACT_1570].  
12.4.6. PK Analysis 
Plasma levels of gabapentin will be presented as descriptive statistics including mean, SD,  
coefficient of variation, geometric mean, minimum and maximum levels and mean ± SD will be presented graphically over time.  Population PK analyses will be conducted in accordance with a 
separate PK /PD SAP . 
12.4.7. Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Summaries of the characteristics of the subjects in each of the study groups at baseline will be 
prepared for the mITT, safety,  and evaluable analysis sets. Baseline characteristics will be 
compared between the HORIZANT Extended -Release Tablets  and placebo groups using 
appropriate statistical methods. A summary will be prepa red to show dropouts/retention over 
time in each group, along with the reason for early termination. The number of missing 
observations will be presented between groups. 
12.4.8. Exploratory Analyses 
Exploratory analyses of the continuous secondary drinking endpoints , and the WHO 1- and 
2-risk level decrease in alcohol consumption endpoints, will employ a multiple imputation 
method for handling missing weekly drinking data for the mITT population (
Hopke et al -2001 , 
Rubin-1976 , Rubin-1996 , Schafer -1997 ). Multiple imputation replaces each missing value with a 
set of “m” plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. The 
imputation model will include a limited set of variables likely to be associated with missingness on the primary endpoint, excluding treatment assignment. The variables may include but are not 
limited to site, time and baseline alcohol use. Specification of the variables used in the multiple 
imputation models will be provided in the SAP. 
Analysis of abstinence from alcohol will not employ imputation for missing drinking data.  
The percentage of subjects abstinent from smoking will be analyzed only among subjects who 
smoked at baseline. Analysis will include two treatment time periods of interest: during the last 4 weeks of the maintenance period and over the entire maintenance period. All analyses of this 
endpoint will be conducted on both a nonimputed and imputed endpoint using the same 
modeling methods as other dichotomous secondary endpoints. Imputation will proceed such that

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) [ADDRESS_1235752] with any missing cigarettes per week data during the evaluation periods for this 
endpoint will be imputed  as a smoker. 
Blood PEth levels at Week 26 will be compared between treatment groups using analysis of 
covariance with treatment group, clinical site, and baseline blood PEth level. The proportion of positive samples [a test result >  8 ng/mL - the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the test] at 
Week 26 data will be  modeled using logistic regression with treatment group, clinical site, and 
baseline level as covariates provided there are sufficient observed events .  
The MINI AUD number of symptoms (identif iers) at Week 26 (covering the last 4 weeks of the 
maintenance period) will be compared between the treatment groups using analysis of 
covariance.  
Primary and secondary efficacy  endpoints will be compared between treatment groups over the 
entire maintenance period using the same analytic methods described above for these endpoints; in addition, these endpoints will be analyzed with and without imputation. The PSNHDD, percent subjects abstinent f rom alcohol, and the WHO 1- and 2- risk level decrease endpoints 
will be analyzed on a weekly and monthly basis; and cumulatively over Weeks 18-25 (last 8 
weeks), Weeks 14 -25 (last 12 weeks), and over Weeks 10-25 (last 16 weeks).   
A number of variables wi ll be tested as potential moderators of the medication treatment effect 
on the imputed PSNHDD endpoint over the last 4 week s of the maintenance period (primary 
endpoint). The potential moderator variables that will be examined include measures suggestive of alcohol withdrawal (i.e., withdrawal question on the MINI for alcohol use disorder, BAI, BDI-
II, PSQI total score, POMS total and subscales, ACQ -SR-R total score, and number of days 
abstinent prior to randomization), severity of alcohol use disorder (i.e., drinks per week [28 days 
prescreen], years of regular drinking), reducer status (change in baseline drinks per day), alcohol-
related treatment goal (total abstinence vs. less than total abstinence), BIS score, and baseline 
smoking status. 
12.4.9. Adjustment for  Covariates 
Covariates used in logistic regression and mixed effects models are described in section 12.4.2 
and 12.4.3. 12.4.10. Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
No interim analyses are planned for this study. 12.4.11. Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint use the serial gate keepi[INVESTIGATOR_234255] 
(
Dmitrienko and Tamhane 2009 ) to maintain a family -wise Type I error of 0.05. This process 
requires an ordering of the hypotheses; namely, that the primary h ypothesis for PSNHDD is 
evaluated first, followed conditionally by [CONTACT_883319]. This procedure requires that the primary hypothesis be rejected at p<0.[ADDRESS_1235753] for the key secondary hypothesis. The serial gate keepi[INVESTIGATOR_883267] (0.05, two-

Version  5.0 (18Aug2016) 75 NIAAA Confidential   sided) is avail able for the key secondary hypothesis. As such, the key secondary endpoint of 
percentage of subjects abstinent is evaluated at p<0.05 (two- sided) for statistical significance.  
12.4.12. Tabulation of Individual Response Data  
Individual subject data will be listed by  [CONTACT_8707]. 
12.5. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was based on a conservative approach to the results of the randomized, placebo-
controlled trial reported by  [CONTACT_701454] (2014) . Maso n et al (2014)  found an effect size for 
PSNHDD of odds ratio = 2.8 (Cohen’s h = 0.48). However, this study was a single site trial and 
single site trials are known to have greater effect sizes than multi-s ite trials ( Feinn  and 
Kranzler -2005 ). Taking a conservative approach, we assumed a smaller effect size for the current 
multi- site trial, an o dds ratio = 2.5; (Cohen’s h=.34 , that occurs given a placebo PSNHDD during 
Study Weeks 22-25 of 13% and an active study drug PSNH DD of 27%). To achieve 91% power 
for this trial, given a  two-tailed alpha of 0.05, then a sample size of 173 per group ( 346 total) is 
needed  (Fleiss et al -2003 ). The estimates of 13% and 27% for placebo and gabapentin, 
respectiv ely, assumes  15% of the randomized subjects in each treatment group will dropout prior 
to or during the last 4 weeks of the Maintenance Period, and consequently, these dropouts will be 
imputed as subjects with heavy drinking days (i.e., treatment failures ).

provided by [CONTACT_883323], will be disclosed to others without the subjects’ 
written permission, except if necessary to protec t subjects’ rights or welfare.  
When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will 
be included that would reveal subjects’ identity. Authorized representatives of the FDA, NIAAA , 
and XenoP ort Inc. may need to rev iew records of individual subjects periodically. As a result, 
they may know subjects’ names, but they are bound by [CONTACT_883324]. The results of this study including laboratory results and clinical information 
collected during this study will be submitted to the FDA and may be used for research purposes. 
The results of this study may be published but will not personally identify any subjects. All records will be kept in locked storage locations that will be accessible only to authorized study 
personnel.  
The clinical site s, XenoP ort Inc., and  Fast-Track Drugs & Biologics, LLC will apply for a 
Certificate of Confidentiality electronically through the following website: 
https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/clinicalresearch/cccert/default.aspx?ic=NIAAA 
This Certificate of Confidentiality helps researchers protect the privacy of subjects in health 
research projects against compulsory legal demands (e.g., court orders and subpoe nas) that seek 
the names or other identifying characteristics of research subjects. The certificate was developed to protect against the involuntary release of personally identified research information of a sensitive nature sought through any federal, sta te, or local civil, criminal, administrative, 
legislative, or other proceedings. This authority was granted under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Public Law No. 91-513, Section 3(a).  
This certificate is necessary for inves tigators to avoid being required to involuntarily disclose 
personally identifiable research information about individual study subjects. Under this statute: "The Secretary [of the Department of Health and Human Services] may authorize persons 
engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research (including research on mental 
health, and on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs) to protect the privacy 
of individuals who are the subject of such research by [CONTACT_883325]. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such individuals may not be 
compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal,  administrative, legislative, or other 
proceedings to identify such individuals" (Public Health Service Act 301 (d), 42 U. S. C. 241 (d), 
as amended by [CONTACT_883326]. 100-607, Section 163 (November 4, 1988)).” 
Accordingly, this special privacy protection c an be granted only to research (i.e., a systematic 
investigation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge). It is granted only 
when the research is of a sensitive nature where the protection is judged necessary to achieve the 
research objectives.

explanation of the protection it affords, including the limitations and exceptions. This 
information will be included in the informed consent. Please see below some suggested wording:  
“If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be required to give us information 
about substance use. A Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) issued by [CONTACT_883327] (NIAAA) which is part of the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH). NIH is governed by a part of the federal government called the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has been granted for this study. This Certificate, however, does not 
imply  that the Secretary, DHHS, approves or disapproves of the project. 
The CoC is issued to protect the investigators on this study from being forced to tell people that 
are not connected with this study about your participation in this study, even under a subpoena. 
This protection, however, is not absolute. The protection offered by [CONTACT_883328], physical, or other abuse of a child or older person, or a subject's threats of violence to self or others. 
If any member of the research team is given such i nformation, he or she will make a report to the 
appropriate authorities. Individuals who participate as research subjects in the specified research 
project are protected permanently during any time the Certificate is in effect - even if the subject 
gave the researcher data before the Certificate is issued. Also, because this research is sponsored by [CONTACT_50533], staff from NIAAA and other DHHS agencies may review records that identify you but only for the purposes of audit for quality and accuracy or program evaluation.  
Even when a CoC is in place, you must still continue to actively protect your own privacy. If you 
voluntarily give your written consent to anyone to receive information about your participation in the research or freely volunteer information to an yone other than the study staff that you are a 
research subject in this study, then we may not use the CoC to withhold this information.” 
Study subjects will be notified that a Certificate has expi[INVESTIGATOR_883272]'s coverage has not 
been granted.  
If the research scope of a project covered by a Certificate should change substantially, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_883273]; however, the NIAAA C ertificate Coordinator may 
require a new Certificate depending on the extent of the change in scope. An extension of coverage must be requested if the research extends beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_883274], as research information collected after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_19860] a Certificate is not protected 
from compelled release.  
A Certificate of Confidentiality is a legal defense against a subpoena or court order, and is to be 
used by [CONTACT_883329]. The researcher should seek leg al counsel from his or 
her institution if legal action is brought to release personally identifying information protected by a certificate. The Office of General Counsel for DHHS is willing to discuss the regulations with the researcher's attorney.

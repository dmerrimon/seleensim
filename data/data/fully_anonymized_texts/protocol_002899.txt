PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Sponsor:  VA CSR and D  
Title of Study:  Targeted Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Reduce Cardiovascular Disparity  
Number of Study 
Centers:  1 JBVAMC  
Objectives:  Primary Objectives:  
1. To assess the efficacy of –autoadjusting positive airway pressure ( AUTOPAP ) 
treatment in reducing 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in African 
American (AA) vs. - other (race) veterans with newly -diagnosed obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA);  
2. To assess the efficacy of –autoadjustin g positive airway pressure ( AUTOPAP ) 
treatment in reducing central aortic blood pressure (CABP) in AA vs. other 
(race) veterans with newly -diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA);  
3. To assess the efficacy of –autoadjusting positive airway pressure ( AUTOPAP ) 
treatment in reducing urinary biomarkers implicated in the pathogenesis of 
hypertension in OSA: 1 ) sympathetic nervous system activity (SNA; 2 4-hour 
urinary catecholamines)  and 2 ) oxidative stress (overnight urinary 8 -
isoprostane)  in AA vs. other (race) ve terans with newly -diagnosed obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA).  
4. To test daytime dysfunction (excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; EDS)  as a 
moderator of reduction in ABP and CABP in AA and other (race) veterans  
following 3 months of AUTOPAP  treatment.  EDS will be measured 
objectively with psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjectively with 
Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526] (ESS).  
 
Secondary Objectives:   
5. To ex amin e the association of reduction in ABP and CABP with genetic 
ancestry  (using ancestry informative markers; AIM s in DNA), as genetic 
admixture is expected among self -identified ethnic groups (i.e., AA and other 
(race) veterans ). 
6. To analyz e abnormalities in myocardial mechanics  on transthoracic 
echocardiography (TTE) in obstructive sleep apnea  and its reversibility with 
AUTOPAP  treatment.  
 
Ancillary Objective:  
7. Tissue banking (whole blood processed for DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma) 
for future genomic studies.  
Study Design:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is an interventional parallel group  (AA and other (race) veterans ) efficacy study of 
AUTOPAP  (standard first - line) treatment in 220 veterans with OSA.   Patients will be 
enrolled consecutively to reach target enrollment of 110 in each group.  All outcomes 
assessment will be do ne 3 months after AUTOPAP  treatment initiation.  
 
Recruitment Site: Sleep, Tele -sleep (for Adam Benjamin Jr CBOC), Pulmonary, and 
Primary Care Clinics at JBVAMC.  In addition, local IRB approved study flyers will be 
posted in sleep and pulmonary clinics at Hines and North Chicago VA.  
 
Initial Screening Visit #1:  At the first clinic visit,  each patient will be provided with 
oral and written information (informed consent form) describing the study and will

 have any questions answered. Patients will be specifi cally consented for blood draw for 
tissue banking and for TTE and patients will be able to participate in the primary study 
without participating in the secondary and ancillary measures (blood draw for genetic 
testing, tissue banking, and TTE). Consenting patients will undergo preliminary 
eligibility assessments, including Berlin Sleep Questionnaire  (BSQ), Epworth 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284] (ESS), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), medical 
history and physical examination, and CABP measurements. All e ligible patients will 
perform a 10-minute  psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Specifically,  consenting 
patients will have venous blood sampling (35 mL) for processing (DNA, RNA, serum, 
and plasma) and storage at UI Biorepository as well as a TTE scheduled at  JBVAMC. 
A urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing potential. All enrolled 
patients  will initiate 7-day actigraphy with concurrent sleep logs (to estimate average 
nightly sleep duration), [ADDRESS_140368] ings at 
completion of visit 1 and will be scheduled for an overnight portable monitoring (PM) 
test at Jesse Brown VAMC (Visit 2) or at home. If the PM test fails to record data due 
to technical or application errors, the patients may be asked to repeat thi s test once.  
 
Visit #2: For patients performing home PM , visit 2 will be in the morning and  PM 
device , actigraph y, sleep log, urine sample, and ABP monitor will be collected and 
processed/downloaded.  Patients performing PM test at JBVA will arrive for the  
overnight PM. Actigraph y, sleep log, urine sample, and ABP monitor will be collected 
and processed/downloaded in the morning. All patients with apnea hypopnea index 
(AHI) ≥ 15/hour on the PM test will be invited to continue.  
 
AUTOPAPAUTOPAPAUTOPAPAUTOPAP RATIONALE ** We have eliminated 
polysomnography (VISIT 3) at Hines for two reasons:  
1. We noted refusals to participate in this project in the past year (45/190 
Veterans approached) due to burden of traveling to Hines. To improve 
recruitment for this study and  to meet target enrollment (n = 2 20) over next 
two years, we have therefore eliminated the requirement for 
polysomnography. The PM test will be used to diagnose patients with 
moderate to severe OSA; as is done in clinical practice and many research 
studies .  
2. The primary goal of performing polysomnography was to obtain gold -
standard diagnostic and electroencephalography data from polysomnography. 
However, we have noted suboptimal data quality from the [ADDRESS_140369] and its objectives with these 
polysomnographies.  
 
 
Visit # 3:  Patients will return to the  clinic for AUTOPAP  treatment set -up and 
education. AUTOPAP  treatment adherence will be optimized with follo w-up telephone 
contacts as specified in full protocol below.  
 
Visit # 4: Patients will return to clinic for repeat PVT, FOSQ, ESS, CABP 
measurements and to initiate 24-hour ABP and urine collection . Patients will also be 
scheduled for repeat TTE  and blood  draw for tissue banking  
 
Final Visit # 5: Patients will return to clinic in the morning after initiating 24 -hour 
ABP and urine collection, which will be collected and processed/downloaded. Patients

will be given instructions regarding follow -up care for OSA with sleep medicine or 
primary care provider.

Our sample calculations and current dropout  rate 2/16 (12.5%, lower than the 
anticipated 20%) suggest n = 220 will provide 80% power to detect between group 
difference at two-sided  alpha of 0.05.

RATIONALE ** We have modified inclusion criteria from self -identified African 
American and European American Veterans to African American and “Other” for the 
following reasons:  
 Our primary goal is to identify treatment response in AA compared to other 
race (Hypothesis: response of hypertension to AUTOPAP treatment will be 
higher  in AA  than other groups ). 
 To improve recruitment for this study and meet target enrollment (n = 2 20) 
over next two years.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
and premature death. African American s (AA) are at higher risk of OSA compared to European 
Americans (EA) due to differences in craniofacial morphology and other genetic factors 
independent of obesity. This is particularly important as poorly controlled hypertension and 
CVD are more prevalent  among AA than the general population. Continuous positive airway 
pressure ( AUTOPAP ) treatment of OSA reduces ambulatory 24 -hour arterial blood pressure 
(ABP) and central aortic blood pressure (CABP; measured non -invasively by [CONTACT_124927]/upper arm cuf f). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the impact of AUTOPAP  treatment on control of 
hypertension and biological factors that determine this response among AA remain understudied. 
This lack of knowledge poses a serious problem as it hinders the implementation of targeted 
treatment of OSA and attendant cardiovascular morbidity in this high-risk population.  
 
Hypertension response to AUTOPAP  treatment is moderated by [CONTACT_654], level of obesity (body mass 
index; BMI), severity of hypertension (baseline ABP), severity of OSA (apnea hypo pnea index; 
AHI), and objective adherence to AUTOPAP . Our retrospective study of Veterans with 
hypertension and OSA demonstrates that AUTOPAP  treatment reduces blood pressure and this 
effect is larger in AA compared to EA, controlling for the known moderat ors of treatment -
response. Our central hypothesis is that AA with OSA experience greater improvement in 
hypertension with AUTOPAP  treatment compared to EA. The specific scientific objective is to 
examine key biological and clinical factors underlying hyper tension response to AUTOPAP  
treatment in self-identified AA vs. Veterans of another  race.    
 
2.  STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
The primary goal of this study is to quantify and compare change in blood pressure (ABP and 
CABP) following 3 months  of AUTOPAP  treatment in Veterans with hypertension and newly -
diagnosed OSA. We will examine changes in ABP and CABP in the context of key biomarkers 
implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension in OSA: 1) sympathetic nervous system activity 
(SNA; 24 -hour urinary catecholamines) and 2) cumulative oxidative stress (overnight urinary 8 -
isoprostane). ABP, CABP, and the biomarkers will be measured pre -treatment and after [ADDRESS_140372] the presence of excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS; symptom of OSA) is 
associated with a more robust hypertension response to AUTOPAP  treatment. Our preliminary 
data indicate a higher prevalence of objective EDS in AA with OSA compared  to EA after 
adjusting for socio -demographic factors. Thus, we will examine EDS as a moderator of 
hypertension response to AUTOPAP  treatment and identify EDS by [CONTACT_124928]; PVT (higher number of lapses per trial is objective EDS) and ES S questionnaire.  
 
There is significant genetic admixture among self -identified ethnic groups  which introduces 
biological heterogeneity and potential confounding. We will identify  genetic ancestry by [CONTACT_124929](s) , called Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) and 
explore the role of genetic (i.e. biologic) ancestry as a moderator of ABP and CABP outcomes.  
The effects of OSA on the heart muscle (myocardium) have not b een well characterized. The 
repetitive apnea and/or hypopnea  that occur during sleep in OSA can result in a mismatch of 
myocardial oxygen supply and demand.  However, the left ventricular dysfunction seen in OSA 
is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_124881].  
Subclinic al left ventricular dysfunction has been observed in OSA manifesting as changes in 
both systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the presence of normal overall ejection fraction .    
Cardiac ventricular function is most commonly evaluated by [CONTACT_51541] , but this is 
limited by [CONTACT_124930] (i.e. contraction or relaxation; also known as myocardial deformation).  
More recently, an echocardiographic imaging techniqu e named speckle -tracking 
echocardiography (STE) has been developed that allows for quantification of myocardial 
deformation in any plane, thus has the advantage of being  ‘angle independent’.  STE can be 
performed on any standard two -dimensional echocardiog raphic images  (does not require special 
equipment to obtain the images ). Multiple studies in various cardiac disease states have 
demonstrated the ability of STE to quantify and detect subtle preclinical changes in myocardial 
deformation.  The effects of OS A on myocardial deformation by [CONTACT_124931] -
characterized and  its relationship to the severity of OSA has been inconsistent. Additionally, 
limited data suggests that acute treatment with continuous positive airway pressure may improve 
myocardial mechanics . The current study will evaluate the effects of the severity and treatment 
of OSA on subclinical cardiac function by [CONTACT_124932].  
 
2.3 Ancillary Objective  
 
We will perform tissue banking of DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma samples derived from venous 
blood sa mpling at UI Biorepository for future genomic studies.  As we are interested in 
examining AUTOPAP  treatment related with genomic studies, we will repeat blood sample 
collection once at end of treatment period (visit5).  
 
3.  STUDY DESIGN  
 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 11 
 
 
 
This is a  parallel groups interventional study consisting of 4 main sections: 1. Screening for OSA

Potential study participants will be identified from sleep , tele -sleep,  and pulmonary specialty 
clinics at JBVAMC  (second floor Ogden Pavilion).  Additionally,  we will post study 
information flyers in Primary  Care clinics (f irst floor Ogden Pavilion). All study related 
patient visits will be at JBVAMC.  All study related patient visits during normal business/clinic 
hours will be in (rooms 2295, 2292, and 2291, Taylor Pavilion, JBVAMC) . The overnight 
visits for testing (Visit 2 ) will be in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Damen Pavilion, [ADDRESS_140373]  (rooms Room 9508, 
9511, 9514, 9515, and 9516 ). Visit 3 (polysomnography) will be at Hines VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Building 
200, Room # 1421, [ADDRESS_140374], Hines IL [ZIP_CODE] . 
 
Initial Screening Visit #1:   All eligible patients identified from the clinics noted above will be 
provided with the study information sheet by [CONTACT_978]/Study coordinator.  Each patient that 
verbally assents will be provided with oral and written information (informed consent form) 
describing the study and will have all questions answered. Patients will be specifically consented 
for blood draw for AIMs measurement, tissue banking , and echocardiography. Patients who want 
time to decide regarding participation in this study will contact [CONTACT_3433] e research coordinator by 
[CONTACT_756]. The potential participants will be screened with the use of a telephone screening 
script. Patients will be able to participate in the primary study without participating in the se 
measures ( venous blood draw  and echocard iography ). Consenting patients will undergo 
preliminary eligibility assessments, including Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BSQ), Epworth 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 12 
 
 
 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284] (ESS)  questionnaire , Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), 
complete medical history and physi cal examination, and CABP measurements. Enrollment of 
patients who have severely elevated blood pressure (>200/120 mm Hg) will be deferred and they 
will be referred to their primary care provider/urgent care as clinically appropriate.  
 
All antihypertensive  medications will be recorded (number, dose, and refill information) for each 
patien t at baseline and at the end of the study (final visit).  This information will be confirmed 
with the JBVAMC/or outside pharmacy for accuracy. Patien ts will be encouraged to  follow up 
with primary physician per usual schedule and to avoid taking over -the-counter medications that 
may affect blood pressure (e.g., some cold medications) for 24 hours before and during the ABP 
monitoring.  
 
All eligible patients will perform a 10-minute  psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Specifically,  
consenting patients will have venous blood sampling (35 mL) for processing (DNA, RNA, 
serum, and plasma) and storage at UI B iorepository as well as an echocardiography scheduled at 
JBVAMC. A urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing potential. All enrolled 
patients will initiate 7 -day actigraphy with concurrent sleep logs (to estimate average nightly 
sleep duration), 24 -hour urine collection, and 24 -hour ABP recordings at completio n of visit 1 
and will be scheduled for an overnight portable monitoring (PM) test at Jesse Brown VAMC 
(Visit 2) or at home. If the PM test fails to record data due to technical or application errors, the 
patients may be asked to repeat this test once.  We w ill schedule an echocardiography test at 
JBVAMC for consenting patients (to be completed before visit 4).  
 
Each measure to be performed is briefly described below. All are validated and commonly used 
in clinical practice and research:  
i. PVT : A [ADDRESS_140375] with a hand -held device for sustained attention will 
be conducted  (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY), with a preceding 1 -
minute practice exercise. Participants will be using  the hand held device and respond 
to the stimuli presented on the s creen at random intervals by [CONTACT_7326] a button. The 
PVT indicator of EDS will be frequency of lapses (instances where the patient  fails to 
respond to the stimulus in a timely manner; Reaction Time, RT > 500 milliseconds).  
ii. ESS is a self -administered questio nnaire used to estimate sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_124883] -life situations. A score of ≥ 11 is indicative of EDS, w hile 0 -10 is 
defined as normal . 
iii. FOSQ 10:  is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire to assess disease specific 
quality of life.  
iv. Actigraphy  will measure and account for daily sleep duration objectively with 7 -day 
recordings  (Actiwatch 2Ò, MiniMitter, Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Andover, MA) in 
conjunction with a sleep log , a subject ive daily log of sleep -wake schedule used for 
final scoring of actigraphy. This is important as sleep duration will affect daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_124884].  
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 13 
 
 
 
v. CABP  will be assessed using a brachial (upper arm) cuff-based  FDA approved 
system; SphygomoCor XCEL (Atcor medical, Australia). This will be measured in a 
seated position after [ADDRESS_140376] at visits 1 and 5. 
vi. ABP will be recorded with the [ZIP_CODE] Ultralite ambulatory blood pressure monitor 
(Spacelabs, Issaquah, WA). Blood pressure measurements will be  taken every 20 
minutes in the day and every 30 minutes at night (9 PM to 6 AM, to minimize sleep 
disruption) for a [ADDRESS_140377] 
70% of expec ted measurements are available . Patient s will be asked to repe at the 
ABP for failed recordings.  
vii. 24-hour Urine collection: Patient s will provide urine samples collected over 24 
hours as two samples (after first void in the morning to [ADDRESS_140378] void the morning). The patients will be provided approp riate urine collection 
system and overnight samples will be collected on ice  and stored at the JBVAMC 
room 7200, Taylor Pavillion for isoprostanes to be performed. The overnight urine 
samples to be stored at  JBVAMC will be labeled with unique study ID number and 
sample type only. 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines (SNA) will be 
measured from the pooled sample and this will be performed outside  JBVAMC 
laboratory per standard clinical procedure .  
Tissu e banking: blood processing for DNA, RNA, serum and plasma isolation and storage 
will be performed at UI Biorepository, under the supervision of [CONTACT_124959] , [CONTACT_124960] -nagy  and Vaiva Liakaite  (Clinical  Science Building North , [ADDRESS_140379] , W-17 
Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE] ). The blood samples to be carried outside JBVAMC will be labeled with 
unique study ID number only.  Only the processing of blood will be done outside JBVAMC 
and the blood draw procedure will only be done at JBVAMC.  The processing fo r JBVAMC 
is done at the Madison/Milwaukee VA lab. To avoid delays loss of sample or sample 
integrity, we want to hand -deliver the samples without individual identifiers to UIC for 
prompt processing.  
 
viii. Echocardiogram data will include myocardial mechanical data obtained by [CONTACT_124934].  This software is called Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI; Siemens Medical 
Solutions [LOCATION_003], Inc., Mountain V iew, CA).  [CONTACT_124961], JBVAMC 
cardiologist and collaborator will provide interpretation of these data.  
 
Visit #2:  Patients performing home PM  will be instructed to begin ABP monitoring and urine 
sample collection the morning prior to the scheduled v isit 2.  Visit 2 will be in the morning and 
PM device, actigraph y, sleep log, urine sample, and AB P monitor will be collected and 
processed/downloaded.  Patients performing PM test at JBVA will be instructed to begin ABP 
monitoring and urine collection the morning of scheduled visit 2. Patients will arrive for the 
overnight PM  at JBVAMC . Actigraph y, sleep log, urine sample, and ABP monitor will be 
collected and processed/downloaded in the morning  after completion of the PM test .  PM tests 
will be performed u sing ALICE PDX (Phillips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770]) or WatchPAT200 (Itamar Medical). 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_124885], are validated, used routinely in 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -[ADDRESS_140380] to screening for OSA . All patients 
with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/hour on the PM test will be invited to continue.  This 
additional screening step with PM testing will reduce screen failure rates with PSG, which is 
more costly. We propose to allow both home PM and PM at JBVAMC in order to minimize 
scheduling conflicts between clinical and research tests scheduled.   
 
Previously scheduled Visit 3 will be  eliminated to reduce participant burden  and improve 
recruitment to meet target sample of 220 over the next two years.  
 
Visit # 3:  Patients will return to the clinic for AUTOPAP  treatment set -up and education by 
[CONTACT_124935]. Patients and their bed partner will receive a one -on-one standardized 
education session describing the method of applying the device and individualized mask fitting 
will be performed; (4) patients will be called twice weekly in the first two weeks and once 
weekly thereafter to troubleshoot barriers to AUTOPAP  use and encourage daily treatment 
application including during daytime naps.   
 
Visit #4: Patients will return to clinic for repeat PVT, FOSQ, ESS, CABP measurements and to 
initiate [ADDRESS_140381]  in the following 3 months, if they had a pre -treatment ech ocardiography 
(to assess AUTOPAP  treatment effects). No caffeine will be permitted during visits 1 and 5 to 
minimize interference with EDS assessments.  Patients will also do venous blood sampling (35 
mL) for processing (DNA, RNA, se rum, and plasma) and storage at  UI Biorepository  
 
Final Visit # 5: Patients will return to clinic in the morning after initiating 24 -hour ABP and 
urine collection, which will be collected and processed/downloaded. AUTOPAP  devices contain 
a software system that records the dura tion of AUTOPAP  use each day. These data will be 
access ed and recorded as final measure of AUTOPAP  treatment  adherence . 
 
Patients will be given instructions regarding follow -up care for OSA with sleep medicine or 
primary care provider.   
 
4.  ELIGIBILITY C RITERIA  
 
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 
A patient may be included in this study if he or she meets all the following criteria:  
 
1. Self-identified African American and Other (race) Veterans ; 
 
2. Age: 18-70 years , < 18 and > 70 years of age patients will be exclude d due to higher 
prevalence of circadian phase misalignment and aging -related changes in sleep 
architecture (respectively), which would influence the sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_124884];  
 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 15 
 
 
 
3. Hypertension :  will be defined as pre -existing physician diagnosis of hypertension, 
current antihypertensive drug therapy, or average blood pressure of systolic ≥ 140 or 
diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg on seated resting cuff blood pressure meas urements x 3 (5 minutes 
apart) . While we will not employ an upper limit of blood pressure as an exclusion 
criterion, we will defer screening and enrollment of patients with systolic > 1 20 or 
diastolic > 1 20 mm Hg and refer them to their primary care physicians or urgent care as 
clinically appro priate;  
 
4. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15/hour on portable monitoring (PM);  
 
 
5. Able to understand and complete informed consent and a ll study assessments and forms.  
 
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
 
A patient will be excluded from this study if he or she meets any of the following criteria:  
 
1. Past/current treatment of OSA or other pri mary sleep disorders;  
 
2. Active uncontrolled medical or psychiatric conditions (for e.g. heart failure, chronic lung 
disease, depression etc.); 
 
3. Shift work in past 1 month;  
 
4. Current Illegal drug use , daily alcohol use, or  a positive urine drug screening test  in the 
preceding 6 months ;  
 
5. Pregnancy  (every woman of childbearing age group will have a urine pregnancy test on 
visit 1);  
 
6. Use of dietary supplements which in the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_124886];  
 
7. Average daily caffeine consumption > 500 mg/day (~5 cups of coffee);  
 
5.  CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS (ANTIHYPERTENSIVES)  
 
Antihypertensive medications will be recorded (number, dose, and refill information) for each 
patient  at baseline and at every visit thereafter. This information will be confirmed with the 
patient ’s pharmacy for accuracy  at visit [ADDRESS_140382] blood pressure  (e.g., some cold medications) for 24 hours before and during the ABP 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 16 
 
 
 
monitoring. Adherence to medications for hypertension will be defined by [CONTACT_124936] (MPR; performed by [CONTACT_124937][INVESTIGATOR_4382] v ials at visits 1, 2, 6, and 8) . MPR 
calculatio n results in values of 0 -1.0 (1.0 = perfect adherence). An MPR will be calculated for 
each antihypertensive drug, and the mean MPR for all antihypertensive drugs will be used as a 
measure of adherence to medication treatment. To adjust for changes in antih ypertensive 
regimen or dosage of drugs that may occur during the study, we will use the Defined Daily Dose 
(DDD). The World Health Or ganization; WHO DDD methodology 
(http://www.whocc.no/atcddd/) allows for comparison of BP medications across antihypertensi ve 
regimens using “the average maintenance dose per day for a drug.” Because no class of 
antihypertensive drugs is kno wn to be superior in OSA , this approach will allow examination of 
the potential blood pressure lowering effect of AUTOPAP  across the inter -individual and intra -
individual variations in antihypertensive medication regimens.  
 
6.  STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124887].  Reasons for early 
patient discontinuation may include: inability  to tolerate AUTOPAP , development of severe 
blood pressure elevation (> 200/120 mm hg) or other unstable medical conditions during study 
participation, request to discontinue the trial from the patient or a regulatory authority, or 
protocol violations.   
 
7.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.1 Definition - An AE is any adverse change from the patient’s baseline condition, including 
any clinically significant signs and symptoms that occurs during the course of the study after the 
patient is enrolled , whether the AE is consi dered expected/unexpected and related to the 
treatment or not.  
 
7.2 Adverse  Event Reporting  
 
7.2.1  Routine  Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
All AEs encountered during the clinical study that are considered study related, will be recorded 
in the source document s.  All new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency 
relative to baseline, which occur after enrollment through the period of protocol -specified 
follow -up (visit 6) will be recorded.  
The information to be recorded for each AE includes : 
 
1. Medical diagnosis of the event in standard medical terminology (if a medical diagnosis 
cannot be determined, a description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event 
should be recorded);  
 
2. Date of onset of any new AE or the date of worsening of a previously observed AE;  
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 17 
 
 
 
 
3. Date of resolution of the event;

and whether the patient was discontinued from the study);  
 
9. Description of outcome:  resolved or complete return to baseline, r esolving, unknown/lost 
to follow -up, AE persisting or resolved with sequelae.  
 
All AEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event .  This may require 
additional clinical assessments.  The follow -up results will be recorded in the patien t's source 
documentation.  
 
7.2.2 Expedited  Reporting of Serious Adverse Drug Experiences  
 
No serious adverse events (SAE) are expected as the intervention(s) are standard in clinical 
practice and non -invasive. Nevertheless, study coordinator/PI [INVESTIGATOR_124890] a SAE via a 
telephone call and preliminary information will be obtained.  If all information is not known at 
the time of initial reporting, an initial report will still be made. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124891].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124892], such as diagnostic test report s and progress notes, as requested.   
 
During the initial telephone call, the study coordinator /PI [INVESTIGATOR_124893]:  
 
1. Patient identification including participant identification number, initials , and date of 
birth;  
 
2. Date of onset of the event;  
 
3. Date of resolution of the event (or confirmation ongoing);

study);  
 
8. All concomitant medications (including doses, routes, regimens, and indications);  
 
9. Pertinent laboratory data;  
 
10. Medical history (including time on study prior to adverse experience).  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124895].  Based on the PI’s assessment of the adverse experience, a decision will be 
made concerning the need for further action.  The primary consider ation governing further action 
will be whether findings affect the safety of patient(s) participating in the clinical trial.   
 
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
 
1. Alteration of existing research by [CONTACT_124938];  
 
2. Discontinuation or suspension of the study;  
 
3. Alteration of the informed consent process by [CONTACT_124939];  
 
2. Modification of previously identified expected adverse e xperiences to include adverse 
experiences newly identified as study -related.  
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_124896] I.R.B.  
 
7.3 Withdrawal from Study Treatment Due to Adverse Experience  
 
Patients withdrawn from receiving additional study drug due to an AE  will be followed by [CONTACT_978]

9.4 Statistical Analyses  
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 21 
 
 
 
9.4.1 Power and Sample Size Estimation: The primary goal of this initial study is to 
estimate differences in the effect size of AUTOPAP  treatment on ABP and CABP in 
AA and EA’s  with moderate to severe OSA. Our preliminary data shows a reduction 
in office BP [ADDRESS_140387] size difference 
between -groups (by [CONTACT_124940]; using diff erences in mean ± SD change of BP and t -tests 
in PASS program, http://www.ncss.com/pass.html) was 0.42 for systolic and 0.53 for 
diastolic blood pressure. We determined that 99 patien ts in each group (total n = 198) 
will provide power of 0.[ADDRESS_140388] size between groups of 0.4. Based on our prior experience we 
anticipate an attrition rate of 10 -20%. Therefore, a total of 220 (198/0. 90) patients 
enrolled  will achieve the target of 198 patien ts completing the study. Our preliminary 
study of PM in our clinical population (selected with a positive BSQ) shows 
approximately  95% sensitivity and specificity of PM determined AHI of ≥ 15/hour in 
terms of predicting PSG -determined AHI of ≥ 15/hour (incl usion criteria). Therefore, 
we expect to screen approximately 260 patients  (220/0.9 5). 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 22 
 
 
 
9.4.2 Data analysis: A p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_140389] (PROC TTEST in 
SAS) will be used to examine between -group differences in the treatment -related 
changes in primary and secondary outcomes.  Specific Aim 2. Primary outcome will be 
assessed with a two-sample  t-test (PROC TTEST in SAS). Secondary outcomes will 
be assessed  with partial correlations implemented with PROC CORR in SAS.  
Exploratory Aim s 3. Effect of Individual Ancestry on changes in primary and secondary 
outcomes of specific aim 1 within group will be assessed with ANCOVA implemented with 
PROC GLM in SAS. Correlations (of VVI with AHI and change in VVI with change in AHI) 
will assessed within groups.  
Residuals and outliers:  Linear models require residuals from model fits to follow a normal 
distribution and be free of outliers. We will examine residual distributions and apply 
transformations to outcomes and explanatory variables as warranted to achieve normality.  
Further mod el checks will employ partial regression plots; outliers will be dealt through case 
removal, influence down -weighting (robust M -estimation), or bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_124902].  
Missing data:  We will examine patterns of missingness with respect to covariates and include 
any covariates differentially associated with missing data.  Correctly specified linear mixed 
models yield unbiased estimated for data missing at random (MAR); multiple imputation can 
also be employed.  It is possible that subjects’ treatment e xperiences will affect missingness 
(dropout), in which case data is not missing at random (NMAR) or nonignorable, and requires 
additional modeling, such as pattern -mixture models.   
Moderators:  Whether a moderator variable Z affects the association of exp lanatory variable X 
and outcome Y will be examined by [CONTACT_2359] Z and the Z*X interaction in the linear model.  
When Z is a (0,1) -indicator variable (e.g., gender), the coefficient for Z is the adjustment to the 
intercept and the coefficient for Z*X is t he adjustment to the slope appropriate for the group 
coded 1; the latter coefficient tests the moderator effect.   
Mediators:  None hypothesized.  
 
10.  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Declaration  of Helsinki

APPENDIX II: QUESTIONNAIRES and TEST BATTERY  
 
1. Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
This is a well -validated patientive rating scale for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], comprising 8 items each rated from 
0 (no chance of dozing) to 3 (high chance of dozing). A total score of >[ADDRESS_140396] and ESS score 
of ≥12. The standard instruction asks a patient to refer to “your usual way of life in recent times”, 
when answering.  This instruction will be modified, asking patients to refer to “the past two 
weeks”, which will be the interval between successive visits.  
 
THE EPWORTH SLEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_124917] s, in contrast to feeling just 
tired? This refers to your usual way of life during the past two weeks. Even if you have not done 
some of these things recently, try to work out how they would have affected you. Use the 
following scale to choose the most app ropriate number for each situation:  
0 = no chance of dozing  
1 = slight chance of dozing  
2 = moderate chance of dozing  
3 = high chance of dozing  
 
SITUATION  CHANCE OF DOZING  
Sitting and reading       
Watching TV       
Sitting inactive in a public place (e.g. a theater or a meeting)

2. Functional Outcomes of Sleep – Short Form (FOSQ -10) 
The FOSQ -10 is a 10 -item questionnaire, derived from the original 30 -item FOSQ instrument, 
that has been specifically validated in  patients with OSAS (Chasens et al. 2009). The FOSQ -[ADDRESS_140397] of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_97412]: general 
productivity, activity level, vigilance, social outcomes, and intimacy and sexual relationships. 
Each subs cale has a possible range of 1 – 4 and the total score has a possible range of 5 – 20.  
Higher scores indicate less impairment.

Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)  
The PVT is a motor reaction time task and a test of sustained vigilance. The patient is given a 
hand -held device with a screen and is instructed to press the “space bar” every time a flash of 
numbers appears in the center of the screen.  The intervals betw een these stimuli are randomized 
and when the space bar is pressed, the number displays the reaction time in milliseconds for a 
brief interval before the screen again goes blank. The task continues for 10 minutes.  
 
 
  
 
Portable Monitoring (PM)  
 
1. ALICE PDX      2. WP200  
  
 
 
Shown above are pi[INVESTIGATOR_124918] -invasive portable monitors that will be 
used during this study. They will yield equivalent results that are comparable PSG. Two 
monitors are chosen for efficiency of screenin g as [ADDRESS_140398] and will 
allow for titration of AUTOPAP  treatment.

URINE SAMPLE  
 
Urine Samples for Sympathetic Nervous System Activity : Patients  will provide urine samples 
collected over 24 hours as two samples (after first void in the morning to [ADDRESS_140399] void the morning). The overnight samples will be collected on ice 24 -hour urinary 
excretion of catecholam ines (SNA) will be measured from the pooled sample  
The samples will be homogenized into aliquots of [ADDRESS_140400] . Samples will be analyzed for norepi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] 3 ‐
methylnorepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (normetanephrine) using high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) with electrochemical detection and expres sed in µmol•mol−1 of creatinine83. HPLC 
offers the advantage that commonly used anti -hypertensive drugs do not interfere with the 
results.  
 
Urine Samples for 8 -isoprostane : (oxidative stress related to OSA) from the overnight samples.  
 
  
Total (free + esterified) isoPs will be analyzed.  Esterified isoP -containing lipi[INVESTIGATOR_124919] (0.5 
mL) will be hydrolyzed with β -glucuronidase from Helix pomatia (10 μL, 100 units/ μL) at 37 
oC under argon for 20 h.  Lipid hydrolysis will be conducted in the presence of  [2H11] -iso-
PF2a -VI, [2H11] -8,12-iso-PF2a -VI, [2H4] -8-iso-PGF2a, [2H9] -PGF2a, and [2H4] -11

The processing and storage will be performed at UI  biorepository per protocol specified below.  
 
Five tubes of blood will be collected; these include two 8 -ml BD Vacutainer® CPT Mononuclear  
Cell Prepara tion Tube for the isolation of lymphocytes and monocytes, two 6 -ml purple top 
vacutainers (K 2EDTA additive) for plasma and DNA recovery, and one 6 -ml red top vacutainer 
(no additives) for serum recovery. These samples will be collected and stored at room 
temperature until processing. Processing for all derivatives will be performed within four hours 
of the initial blood draw.  
 
Whole blood collected in the CPT vacutainers will be centrifuged according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions, and after the centri fugation, the overlying plasma will be decanted. 
The buffy coat remaining above the gel barrier will be removed from the two CPT vacutainers 
and transferred to a sterile 50 -ml tube and washed with Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS). 
At this point, Periph eral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) number will be measured using a 
Millipore Scepter Handheld Automated Cell Counter. The PBMCs will then be pelleted by 
[CONTACT_7891], and the HBSS removed. The PBMCs will then be lysed in 2 ml of TRIzol 
solution and store d at -80C in a sterile 2 -ml 2D barcoded tube.  
 
Blood from the two purple top vacutainers will be fractionated as following: Duplicate DNA 
extractions will be performed on 350 microliters of whole blood using the iPrep Purification 
Instrument with the iPrep ™ PureLink™ genomic DNA (gDNA) Blood kit (Invitrogen). The 
gDNA will be eluted in 200 microliters of buffer, analyzed using a NanoDrop 1000 
spectrophotometer and aliquoted. Six aliquots of 30 microliters will be produced for future 
distribution, and one al iquot of 200 microliters (likely 10 -20 micrograms of DNA) will be 
retained for future whole genome sequencing, if requested.  These will be stored in sterile, 
barcoded tubes of 0.5 -ml volume. In addition,  750 microliter aliquots of whole blood will be 
stored in sterile, barcoded tubes of 1 -ml volume. The remaining whole blood will be centrifuged 
at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1,500 RPM, and the overlying plasma will be recovered and aliquoted 
into six 1 -ml barcoded tubes.  
 
Blood from the single red top vacutainer will be stored at room temperature for 15 minutes 
before centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1,500 RPM. Subsequently, the overlying serum 
will be recovered and aliquoted into four 1 -ml barcoded tubes.  
 
In total , 20 tubes of derivatives of whole blood will be generated: (1) 2 -ml tube with PBMCs in 
TRIzol, (2) 0.75 -ml whole blood in 1 -ml tubes, (6) 0.03 -ml gDNA in buffer in 0.5 -ml tubes, (1) 
0.2-ml gDNA in buffer in a 0.5 -ml tube, (6) 0.50 -ml plasma in 1.0 -ml tube s and (4) 0.50 -ml 
serum in 1.0 -ml tubes.  
 
Gene and microRNA Expression Profiling - This proposal will utilize the GeneChip® Human 
Gene 1.0 ST Array by [CONTACT_11072] (details at the website) got gene expression profiling, covering 
> 28,[ADDRESS_140402] Array has greater than 99 percent coverage of 
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 37 
 
 
 
sequences present in the RefSeq database. To determine microRNA differences, this proposal 
plans to use the mercury LNA microRNA array offered by [CONTACT_45065]. The array provides access for 
examination of over 1300 human microRNAs with as little as 30ng total RNA. RNA for both of 
these arrays will be isolated from the blood collected from these patients in this study as 
described earlier.  Details of this technology are also provided at http://www.exiqon.com . 
 
3) Serum specimens  
 
Serum specimens are primarily collected for future proteomics analysis.  At this stage of 
planning, specimens are prepared anticipating subsequent analysis by a modified form of Isotope 
Coded Affinity Tagging.  As new techniques become available or new biomarkers are identified, 
these specimens may be analyzed by [CONTACT_124947].  
One 8 ml red -top tube specimen will be centrifuged at room temperature at approximately 1000 
x g for 5 minutes.  The serum supernatant will be removed and stored at –80oC in 125l aliquots.   
 
4) Plasma specimens  
 
Plasma specimens are primarily collected for conventional analysis by [CONTACT_124948].  As platelet contamination, proteolysis and other aspects of handling can 
contribute to variable assay results, specimens will be handled according to the following 
protocol. The technician will retrieve one 4 ml lavender -top tube and centrifuge for 15 minutes at 
4oC at 1000 x g within 30 minutes of collection.  The plasma supernatant will be removed to a 
fresh tube and centrifuged an additional 10 minutes at 1000 x g before removal and storage by  
[CONTACT_124949].  
 
5) AIMs analysis in isolated DNA at Kittles laboratory  
 
Autosomal SNP AIMs  will be genotype d using the Sequenom MassARRAY™ platform and 
iPLEX™chemistry. I ndividual Ancestry  will be estimated from the genotype data usi ng the 
Bayesian Markov Chain -Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implem ented in STRUCTURE version 
2.1. STRUCTURE will be run under the admixture model using prior population information 
and independent allele frequencies. The MCMC method will be run using K=2 and K= [ADDRESS_140403] model of K to use 
will be determined and principal components based on the total AIMs using EIGENSTRAT will 
be compute d.

APPENDIX IV: HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
A. Risks to Subj ects 
 
A.1 Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
After completing the informed consent process, the proposed study will enroll a total of 2 20 self-
identified African American and Other(race) , Veterans with pre -existing hypertension and newly 
diagnosed (and treatment -naïve) moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. These adult 
Veterans will not have debilitating physical or mental health problems. We will not recruit 
pregnant women, children, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or other vulnerable 
populations. During preliminary screening, subjects will be informed of the study purpose, the 
risks and benefits pertaining to their participation, the enrollment process, the proposed testing,  
and the necessary time commitment.  
Inclusion criteria briefly noted above are summarized in section C.4  (Table 7) of the research 
plan for this proposal. Exclusion criteria include: 1. Past/current treatment of OSA or other 
primary sleep disorders ; 2. Active uncontrolled medical conditions ; 3. Shift work in past 6 
months ; 4. Current  drug use , and pregnancy . At screening visit blood sample (15 ml, for genetic 
ancestry testing), urine pregnancy test (if applicable), and disease specific screening 
questionna ires, and a brief vigilance test with a hand -held device will be obtained. In addition, 
information regarding personal and family medical history, medication use, sleep -wake schedule 
and work schedule will be collected, and a physical examination will be p erformed. The physical 
examination will include central aortic blood pressure measurement (performed with a cuff on 
the upper arm) similar to the process utilized routinely in clinical practice. All subjects with 
baseline peripheral blood pressure values o f > 180 mm Hg systolic or > [ADDRESS_140404] clinical care and research r elated procedures:  
(1) polysomnography for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and confirmation of disease 
severity, (2) [ADDRESS_140405] will be 
performed at baseline (pre -treatment) and three months after institution of treatment for 
obstructive sleep apnea, (3) standard treatment of obstructive sleep apnea i.e., 
polysomnography guided continuous positive  airway pressure device treatment will be provided 
to all subjects. All research related subject visits will take place at the Jesse Brown VAMC . 
 
A.2 Potential Risks  
General : We see no psychological, social or legal risk associated with this research, beyond 
those of participation in health -related research in general.  
Blood sampling : There is a small risk of local hematoma (1 in 10 cases), and an extremely small 
risk (1 in 1000 cases) of infection associated with insertion of needles for blood withdraw al. An 
experienced technician, using aseptic techniques, will minimize these risks.  
Urine collection:  No risks are identified except loss of confidentiality (addressed below).  
Polysomnography:  Is a routine laboratory -based  procedure attended by a trained t echnologist. 
Minor skin irritation may occur from the electrode’s  application, in addition to fragmentation of 
sleep.  These complications are rarely observed,  and every effort will be made to minimize the 
associated discomfort.  
Protocol No. 1IK2CX001026 -01 Version 1.8  April 8, 2019  Page 39 
 
 
 
Actigraphy:  Is a wrist -watch  and maybe associated with minor skin irritation and wrist 
discomfort.  
24-ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with an inflatable cuff on the non -dominant upper 
extremity : The monitor itself is light and fits inside a shirt pocket. The cuff inflations can cause 
local discomfort. Therefore, we will limit our sampling rate to every [ADDRESS_140406]’s upper arm that is in flated briefly. This cuff is attached to a special monitor 
(Sphygomocor). The procedure in terms of subject risk is the same as a regular blood pressure 
check in their doctor’s office.  
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( AUTOPAP ) device treatment: Is the first-line treatment for 
obstructive sleep apnea and its safety and efficacy are well established. Complications skin 
irritation of the face at the site of mask application, nasal congestion/oral dryness, and 
claustrophobia. We will use standard measures u sed to address these issues promptly, such as 
individualized education, mask -fitting, and use of heated humidity.  
Confidentiality: It is possible that subject confidentiality could be breached. However, all data will 
be coded and direct linkages between th e subject and the data from that subject will be broken 
once the necessary clinical information has been obtained. No publications  lists or stored data 
will directly link a study subject with his or her data.  
 
A.[ADDRESS_140407], W -17 Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]   for DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma 
processing and storage. The DNA data generated will be hand carried by [CONTACT_976]/study coordinator 
to UIC Institute of Human Genetics at [ADDRESS_140408], Chicago IL 
[ZIP_CODE] for genetic ancestry analysis. All data collected will be securely stored, de -identified, and 
used for research purposes only.  
 
A.4 Therapeutic Risk 
The treatment intervention ( AUTOPAP ) is the standard treatment for sleep apnea of all severity. 
Therefore,  the risks incurred are no more than in routine clinical care and include complications 
skin irritation of the face at the site of mask application, nasal congestion/oral dryness, and 
claustrophobia.  
Polysomnography will be performed once (for diagnosis confirmation and AUTOPAP  titration) 
as is done in routine clinical practice. Minor skin irritation may occur from the electrode’s  
application, in addition to fragmentation of sleep.  
 
A.[ADDRESS_140409] during regular Jesse Brown VA 
Medical and Sleep Clinic visits. The pri ncipal PI [INVESTIGATOR_124922]. Interested subjects will be invited to participate.  
Informed Consent : All subjects will undergo informed consent in accordance with the 
requirements of the I.R.B governing clinical research activity both at Jesse Brown VAMC and 
ABJ CBOC. This will involve a complete discussion of the study procedures, risks, exclusion 
criteria. A discussion of possible risks will include discomfort associated with study procedures 
including venipuncture, polysomnography, actigraphy, [ADDRESS_140410] and the 
principal PI/research assistant. Subjects will be informed that all medical information obtained 
will only be used for study purposes.  
 
B.[ADDRESS_140411], all research materials 
(data and biological specimens) are maintained in a manner inaccessible to anyone other than 
the study PIs who have been trained in the protection of human subjects. All source documents 
and specimens are identified by [CONTACT_124950] c ode number, the keys to which are kept in locked 
file cabinet and on password protected electronic media. Second, the transmission of data to 
and from the Sleep Laboratory occurs via secure web -based connections or using encrypted 
electronic media. No resu lts will be reported in a personally identifiable manner.  
General: To protect against or minimize potential risk, subjects will be carefully evaluated and 
closely supervised during all study visits. The subjects will be screened to exclude those with 
medic al problems that might increase the risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_124923], such as 
uncontrolled high blood pressure. Before being considered for participation in the study, the 
subjects will undergo a physical examination and be medically cleared to participat e by [CONTACT_124951]. Subjects will be excluded if they are found to have any medical problems or other 
lifestyle behaviors described above in section A.1.  
Blood Sampling : An experienced technician using aseptic techniques will minimize the

Polysomnography, actigraphy, central aortic blood pressure measurement, and 24 -hour 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: The potential for a serious adverse event to occur during 
these procedures will be minimized by [CONTACT_124952].

Confidentiality : To maintain confidentiality, all of the data collected on the subjects will be coded 
with letters and numbers. Access to the data file that matches an ind ividual with an identifying 
code will be password protected and restricted to the PIs. Subject records will be kept in locked 
file cabinets within the respective laboratories in which they are collected. There are no 
alternatives to these procedures that w ould permit the acquisition of the information required for 
these research studies. The alternative is not to participate,  and that option is always available 
to study volunteers.  
 
C. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
The proposed research might not be of direct benefit to the subjects but is of potential benefit to 
society by [CONTACT_124953]. Pot ential benefits to the subjects 
in this preliminary study include favorable effects on nightly sleep, excessive daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], blood pressure control, and cardiovascular risk. Moreover, if data obtained from the 
subjects in this preliminary study show s improvement of biomarkers implicated in progression of 
blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure levels, this will lead to the design and 
implementation of larger studies to evaluate the effect of this AUTOPAP  intervention on 
cardiovascular disease pr ogression. Overall, we feel that the benefits of this research greatly 
outweigh the risks to the subjects.  
 
D. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
The overall objective of our proposal is to examine continuous positive airway pressure 
treatment -related effects on adverse cardiovascular effects (including 24 -hour blood pressure 
profile) of obstructive sleep apnea in African Americans, a high-risk popu lation. The ability to 
identify and effectively intervene for poorly -controlled hypertension in this population is of great 
relevance as it could help reduce the progression of organ injury.  
 
E. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety Monitoring : Data from the study will be monitored on a continuous basis by [CONTACT_124954] [[CONTACT_124962], principal PI (PI), Drs. David Carley , and 
[LOCATION_009]s Weaver (mentors ), study coordinator  Tomas Mercado ]. All serious adverse events 
(SAEs), adverse events (AEs), and laboratory values will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_124924]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124925] I.R.B and for reporting any adverse 
events (AEs) to the IRB. The IRB will be notified within [ADDRESS_140412].  
Monitoring of Relevant Literature : The principal PI [INVESTIGATOR_124926], cardiovascular disease and vascular function and continually monitor 
the scientific literature, serve on VA and NIH funded multicenter DSMB’ s and the editorial 
boards of several high impact peer reviewed journals, and regularly attend scientific meetings in 
the field. Any new information that might affect subject safety or the risk -benefit ratio will be 
reported to the IRB and used to amend or  discontinue study procedures. New information will

be immediately available and confirmed in the continuing progress reporting procedure to the 
IRB. 
 
F. Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
F.1 Inclusion of Women  
Based on the demographics of Jesse Brown VAM C and ABJ CBOC (recruitment sites) we do 
not expect to enroll many women in this study. However, we will include consenting women 
Veterans based on our specified inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
F.2 Inclusion of Minorities  
Consistent with the Aims of this study will include self -identified African Americans and 
Caucasian Veterans. For future studies, all ethnic groups will be eligible to participate.  
 
F.3 Targeted/Planned Enrollment  
240 study subjects will be recruited from  the Jesse Brown VA and ABJ CBOC sleep clinics, with 
a recruitment pool of more than 1400 potential subjects. Therefore, the planned recruitment of 
approximately 6 subjects per month over the anticipated enrollment period of 42 months is 
feasible and reali stic. We will include consenting adult African American and Caucasian 
Veterans for this study.  
 
F.4 Inclusion of Children  
The proposed study is a study of health outcomes in adults, hence the topic is not relevant to 
children and none are included.

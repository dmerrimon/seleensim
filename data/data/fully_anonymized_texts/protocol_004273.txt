2.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
2.1 Trial Design  
This is a single institution, prospective, observational cohort study of FDG PET/CT as a n early  
measure of response in patients with advanced  metastatic melanoma  scheduled to start 
pembrolizumab. Patients may participate in this study if they are greater than 18 years of age; most 
participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University o f Pennsylvania. Patients 
that may meet eligibility criteria  will be approached about study participation regardless of race or 
ethnic background.  
We anticipate enrolling up to 35 participants with metastatic melanoma who meet eligibility 
requirements for this study. The target accrual goal is to reach 30 evaluable patients, defined as those  
who complete two (Baseline and 1st Post-therapy ) of the three planned FDG PET/CT scans. Thu s, 
accrual is estimated to occur over approximately 1 year.  
 
FDG PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate glycolytic activity at sites of metastatic disease using 
the FDA approved clinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  radiotracer , 
[18F]Fluorodeoxygluc ose ( FDG) . Study imaging will be performed in a manner identical to standard 
clinical FDG PET/CT imaging procedures used at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574705] a dedicated whole -body  PET/CT scanner.  For each PET scan static images from the  vertex of 
the skull to toes will be acquired approximately [ADDRESS_754313] (IRB). 
 
 
 
3  
 
A total of three FDG PET/CT exams will be performed as follows:  
• Baseline : A restaging FDG PET/CT will be obtained no more than [ADDRESS_754314] of care, it may occur prior to consent and enrollment in this 
study. 
 
• 1st Post-therapy : at approximately 3 weeks (± 3  weeks) following the start of pembrolizumab, 
a post -therapy FDG PET/CT will be obtained. This exam will be obtained for study purposes, 
to assess glycolytic activity at sites of metastatic disease at an early time -point.  
 
• 2nd Post-therapy : When clinically indicated, as per the judgment of the patient’s oncologist, a 
restaging FDG PET/CT will be obtained at > [ADDRESS_754315] of care for restaging disease instead 
of FDG PET/CT.  
 
Almost all of the patients  treated for melanoma in the University of Pennsylvania Health System 
(UPHS)  have  consent ed to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Col lection Program (UPCC 
#[ZIP_CODE], IRB #703001) . For patients partici pating in this program, blood samples will be collected , 
processed, and stored according to the program’s standard operating procedure. Currently, this 
includes drawing less than 65 mL of blood according to  the following schedule (after initiation of 
pembr olizumab) : weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and at [ADDRESS_754316] an additional sample of blood drawn at approximately 1 week after starting pembrolizumab; this 
sample will also be collected, processed, and stored accor ding to the Penn Melanoma Tissue 
Collection Program standard operating procedure . If patients have not consented to participate in the 
Penn Melanoma Tissue Col lection Program, then no blood samples will be drawn  for the purposes of 
this study . Analysis of blood samples will include , but is not limited to , analysis of serum cytokines, 
chemokines,  and T cell markers. This data will be correlated to patient response as well as changes in 
tumor FDG uptake. Some of these studies will be performed upon receipt of  additional funding . There 
may be patients for which some or all of these blood draws are not possible,  in this case it will be 
documented in the CRF and the blood draws may be omitted and it will not be considered a protocol 
deviation. Experimental pathol ogy results will not be reported to the participant and will have no 
impact on the treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
Patients may undergo tumor  biopsy as part of their clinical care  prior to initiation of pembrolizumab. 
For patients part icipating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Col lection Program, these pre -therapy tissue 
samples will be collected, processed, and stored according to the program’s standard operating 
procedure. For the purposes of this study, patients will have a post -therapy tumor biopsy which will 
be scheduled within [ADDRESS_754317]-therapy FDG PET/CT ; this tissue will also be collected, 
processed, and stored according to the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program standard operating procedure. If patients have not c onsented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection 
Program, then no tumor biopsies  will be performed for the purposes of this study . The biopsy 
techniques preferred  for this study include core biopsies or surgical biopsies. The same biopsy 
techniques should be used as routinely used for a given tumor lesion/location. When possible, the 
 
[ADDRESS_754318]-therapy tumor biopsy should target the same lesion that was biopsied pre -therapy ; if the original 
lesion cannot be biopsied, then a lesion with a  significant change in FDG activity  should be targeted 
for biopsy . Analysis of tissue  samples will include, but is not limited to, analysis of t umor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL s) and macrophages . This data will be correlated to patient response as well as 
changes in tumor FDG uptake. Some of these studies will be performed upon receipt of additional 
funding. There may be patients for which a pre - or post - therapy tumor biopsy is not performed; those 
cases will be documented in the CRF and will not be considered a protocol deviation. In some cases 
tissue may be collected outside of the [ADDRESS_754319]-therapy FDG PET/CT; this 
will not be considered a protocol deviation. Experimental pathology results will not be reported to the participant and will have no impact on the treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
For patients participating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Col lection Program, we will follow the 
standard operati ng procedure regarding archival tissue access f or patients undergoing a biopsy or 
surgery on melanoma or other skin cancer for diagnosing, treating or research purposes, but for which 
there is no applicable left over fresh tissue, or p atients who had a biopsy or surgical  procedure done 
on melanoma or other skin cancer for diagnosing, treating or research purposes at the University of 
Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or at an institution outside of UPHS . If patients have not 
consented to participate in t he Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no archival tissue 
will be requested .

3.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHES ES 
3.1 Primary Objectives & Hypothes es 
(1) Objective:   To d etermine the distribution of changes from baseline in tumor FDG uptake 
on PET/CT at 3 weeks and >10 weeks after initiation of pembrolizumab. 
 Hypothesis:  None, descriptive statistics.  
(2) Objective:   To e valuate the ability of FDG PET/CT to serve as an early measure of 
objective response to therapy in patients with melanoma on pembrolizumab. 
Hypothesis:   Melanoma metastases demonstrate changes in FDG uptake on a 3 week 
PET/CT scan that are associated  with objective response to pembrolizumab. 
3.2 Secondary Obj ectives & Hypothes es 
(1) Objective:  Based on changes in tumor FDG uptake at [ADDRESS_754324] FDG “flare” ( an early increase in tumor FDG PET/CT uptake ), and assess whether 
FDG “flare”  is predictive of progression- free survival  and overall survival  in patients 
with melanoma on pembrolizumab . 
Hypothesis :  A flare response on FDG PET/CT performed 3 weeks after initiation of 
pembrolizumab is predictive of progression- free survival and over all survival in patients 
with melanoma . 
(2) Objective:   To collect tumor tissue pre - and post - treatment with pembrolizumab for  
correlation with changes in FDG uptake and objective response to therapy, and for 
studies of mechanism of action of PD -1 blockad e with pembrolizumab . 
Hypothesis:   Treatment with  pembrolizumab will result in a measurable change in tumor 
immune biomarkers, which will correlate with changes in tumor FDG uptake (including a 
“flare” response) and objective response to therapy, and will contribute to a better 
understanding of the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab.  
(3) Objective: To measure immune biomarkers in blood from subjects before and at serial 
time points after treatment with pembrolizumab , for correlation with changes in FDG 
uptake and objective response to therapy, and for studies of mechanism of action of PD -1 
blockade with pembrolizumab. 
Hypothesis :  Treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a measurable change in blood 
immune biomarke rs, which will correlate with changes in tumor FDG uptake (including a 
“flare” response) and objective response to therapy, and will contribute to a better 
understanding of the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab.  
 
7  
(4) Objective:  To correlate changes in t umor FDG uptake (including a “flare” response), 
serum immune biomarkers, and tissue immune biomarkers with objective response to 
therapy, progression- free survival, and overall survival. Changes in FDG uptake within 
immune related tissues (lymph nodes, spl een, bone marrow, and thymus) will also be 
correlated with serum and tissue immune biomarkers, and response.  
Hypothesis :  Serum and tissue immune biomarkers provide additional predictive value 
regarding objective response to therapy, progression- free survival, and overall survival 
when combined with FDG PET/CT imaging data.  
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.[ADDRESS_754325] shown great promise for a range of immunotherapy drugs, 
including anti -PD-1 therapy, in a variety of cancers. These ther api[INVESTIGATOR_574706]’s immune system towards the tumor. This differs from conventional cytotoxic systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574707]- specifically target dividing cells, 
including immune cells. For example, anti -PD-[ADDRESS_754326] with its ligands PDL1 and/or PDL2. Since many tumors express PDL1/PDL2, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_574708]. When successful, this leads to an immune infiltration of the tumor and ultimately tumor cell death.  
From the radiological perspective, following cancer response to immunotherapy presents 
unique challenges compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Studies of anti -
CTLA4 therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_574709] a significant subset of responding tumors may exhibit non- traditional patterns of response that can confound 
interpretation on CT (computed tomography).
[ADDRESS_754327] been developed, 
termed immune -related response criteria (irRC), that incorporate the possibility of a transient 
flare response, as well as a delayed immune response, into the assessment.1,[ADDRESS_754328] (Response Evaluation Criteria 
In Solid Tumors) in the setting of immunotherapy, irRC still does not accurately identify all 
responders and non- responders. This is partly due to the fact that morphological changes to 
the tumor from immunotherapy can take several months to manifest. Thus, a more timely and accurate measure of response to immunotherapy is needed.  
FDG PET/CT  as a marker of cancer and inflammation :  
2-Deoxy -2-[
18F]fluoro -D-glucose (FDG) is an 18F analogue of glucose that serves as a PET 
radiotracer of cellular metabolism. FDG enters the cell through cell surface glucose transporters and becomes trapped within the cell following enzymatic phosphorylation by [CONTACT_497747]. For decades, FDG has been employed to dete ct cancer exploiting a phenomenon 
known as the Warburg effect in which most malignancies preferentially produce ATP through a boost in extra -mitochondrial glycolysis, rather than mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_574710]. This met abolic switch, termed aerobic 
glycolysis, has a greater rate of glucose utilization albeit overall lower ATP yield, and provides the generation of key carbon precursors needed for the synthesis of nucleic acids, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], fatty acids, cholesterol and porphyrins.
[ADDRESS_754329] malignancies utilize more glucose (and 
FDG) than their non- transformed neighboring cells, which has led to the use of FDG PET/CT 
as a highly sensitive and moderately specific tool for the detection of occult metastatic disease.  
It has recently been recognized that immune activation results in a similar cellular metabolic 
switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. This is occurs with both the 
innate and adaptive immune activation. For example, when activated usi ng TLR ligands or 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages have been 
demonstrated to switch their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis.
5 Similarly, following TCR stimulation, lymphocytes increase glucose utilization 
by [CONTACT_574717].6,7 Interestingly anti -inflammatory subpopulations of 
both the innate and adaptive immune system, such as M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells and quiescent memory T cells, demonstrate a predominant use of oxidative phosphorylation rather than aerobic glycolysis as opposed to their inflammatory counterparts such as activated macrophages and T -helper 17 cells.
8   
The upregulation of aerobic glycolysis in immune activation is readily visualized with FD G 
PET/CT imaging. Inflammatory conditions such as infection, rheumatoid arthritis and 
sarcoidosis yield intense avidity for FDG that compares with or exceeds that of most 
malignancies.9,[ADDRESS_754330], a significant limitation to the use of FDG PET/CT in cancer 
restaging has been interference of the tumor FDG signal by [CONTACT_447] -therapeutic inflammatory 
tissues including surgical changes, talc pleurodesis, and r adiation therapy.11  
In this study we propose utilizing FDG PET/CT to assess the immunother apy response by 
[CONTACT_574718] a therapy -
induced infiltrating population of glucose avid activated immune cells. Of note , a flare 
 
9  
phenomenon has been described in several cancer types following  therapy; in patients with 
breast cancer on endocrine therapy, a clinical flare response was identified in [ADDRESS_754331] that a flare res ponse is predictive of response to therapy.   
FDG PET/CT studies are typi[INVESTIGATOR_574711] 12 weeks following the 
initiation of 
pembrolizumab, and the probability of 
seeing a flare 
response on these 
clinical studies is 
very low; this is 
supported by [CONTACT_574719] 
2014, in which 3.6% 
of patients with 
melanoma 
demonstrated a flare response on imaging ( ≥25% increase in tumor burden) at 12 weeks. We 
propose looking for a flare response at about 3 weeks following the start of immunotherapy. The choice of this time point is considered appropriate for the activation and expansion of 
immune cells and is supported by [CONTACT_574720]- small cell lung cancer, 
which revealed that circulating cytotoxic T cells specific to tumor neo antigens peak at around 
3 weeks from the initiation of therapy (Figure 1).
13 Additional data on pembrolizumab in 
multiple other tumor types also found that activated cytotoxic T cells peak at around 3 
weeks.14  
No significant change is expected in the tumor’s inherent basal glycolytic activity over the short interval between the baseline FDG PET/CT and the 3 week PET/CT. Therefore we hypothesize that the flare response will be able to be visualized with FDG PET/CT by [CONTACT_129163] a superimposed burst of tumoral glycolytic activity resulting from immunotherapy induced immune infiltration. If successful, thi s study will help to determine 
the ideal time point for visualization of the flare response, test the potential for the flare response to serve as a biomarker for detecting an early response to therapy, and contribute to our understanding of pembrolizumab’ s mechanism of action.   
In addition, studies in human tumor tissue are needed to define the mechanism of action of 
PD-[ADDRESS_754332] -
treatment tumor tissue is acquired within 7 days following the 3 week PET/CT. We also propose acquiring blood samples pre -therapy, and at serial time -points during therapy  
(including a [ADDRESS_754333] explored to date) . 
Analysis of these samples will include, but is not limited to, serum cytokines , chemokines, 
and T cell markers, and tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and macrophages ; some of 

 
10  
these studies will be performed upon receipt of additional funding . Of note, some of these 
studies will be informed by, and/or modeled after the current study at Penn titled, “ A Phase 
Ib Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) in Subjects with Resectable 
Advanced Melanoma .” This data will be correlated to patient response as well as changes in 
tumor FDG uptake. Thus, we expect the  proposed study to generate mechanism of action 
data, and help identify factors that predict response to treatment with PD -1 inhibition, which 
may allow for more strategic development of combination immune therapy strategies, and 
ultimately may help to  increase objective response rates to immune therapy in melanoma and 
other tumor types. 
4.1.1 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits Assessment  
2-Deoxy -2-[18F]fluoro -D-glucose (FDG) is FDA approved for imaging in clinical oncology, 
and has been extensively used in oncologic PET imaging with no evidence of 
pharmacological effect. No adverse events (AEs) have been reported in the large number of published studies of hum an experience for FDG at the dose to be used in this study. In this 
study we will a dminister approximately [ADDRESS_754334] procedures 
used for clinical FDG PET/CT  at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] .  
Risk/Benefit  
Participants will undergo up to two additional FDG PET/CT examination s for the purposes 
of this study. This will be in addition to other  clinically indicated CT and/or PET/CT 
examinations. FDG is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical. As such, it poses an intrinsic radiation exposure risk. However, when administered in low tracer doses as a PET imaging agent, as described in this protocol, this risk is felt to be extremely small. In addition to the radioactive FDG tracer, a low -dose CT of the chest, abdomen a nd pelvis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_574712]/CT for the purpose of anatomical registration and attenuation correction of PET images. There are no separate diagnostic CT scans performed as part of this scan. FDG PET/CT scans are a standard clinical pro cedure for patients with metastatic 
melanoma.  This research involves exposure to radiation that could affect a fetus or pregnant 
woman, due to this risk a urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at the time of screening. Women who are pregnant at the time of screening will not be included in this study.  
The dose will be delivered intravenously by [CONTACT_574721][INVESTIGATOR_574713]; venous cannulation is a routine clinical procedure that carries minimal risks when performed by [CONTACT_21724]. It is possible that bruising, dizziness or fainting could occur in some subjects. There is a risk of phlebitis or infection, 
which is very remote. Also, the PE T/CT scan takes place in a small, enclosed space and 
therefore can be uncomfortable for some people with claustrophobia or musculoskeletal 
disorders (such as arthritis). Subjects will be made as comfortable as possible and staff will be available throughout the imaging to address any discomfort.  
No psychological, social or legal risk is expected. While loss of confidentiality is possible, it is felt to be very unlikely due to the small number of professionals involved in the study with 
 
11  
knowledge of this inf ormation. All clinicians and research staff involved are well trained in 
HIPAA practices. There is no anticipated additional financial risk to the patient due to 
participation in this study since the two additional study FDG PET/CT ’s, 1 week blood draw  
(if performed), and post -therapy tumor biopsy  (if performed) will be paid for through study 
funds. The clinical restaging FDG PET/CT examinations and pre -therapy tumor biopsy ( if 
performed ) will be paid for through the patient’s insurance as per routine clini cal care for 
their cancer. Additional blood draws described in this protocol outside of the 1 week sample will be paid for by [CONTACT_574722] . 
The risk to the patient is felt to be minimal with only the added radiation considere d the 
likely risk posed to the patient. It is not unusual for oncologic patients to receive multiple radiological tests, including multiple PET/CT scans, in the course of clinical management and the addition of two FDG PET/CT scan s is not considered to add a large risk to  the 
subject . This study proposes the addition of two  PET/CT scan s to the patient’s care. This 
study also proposes the addition of one tumor biopsy to the patient’s care; this procedure 
carries a low risk of bleeding or infection at the biopsy site, thus the additional risk to the patient from this procedure is felt to be minimal. 
There is no anticipated benefit to study subjects as a result of their participation in this study. 
There is potential benefit to general society if FDG PET/CT proves to be a useful imaging agent for detecting an early response to immunotherapy for cancer,  or helps in the 
understanding of pembrolizumab’s mechanism of action.  
4.1.2 Rationale for  Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Endpoint  
Objective r esponse to therapy at 6 months, based on imaging and the clinical evaluation of 
the patient , is an acceptable primary  endpoint in this prospective, observational cohort study 
of FDG PET/CT as an early measure of response in patients with advanced metastatic 
melanoma.  Response will be determined by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1. While either CT or MRI 
may be utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.  
Patients will be categorized as responders (i.e., complete response or partial response) or nonresponders ( stable disease or progressive disease).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary  Endpoint s 
Progression free survival (PFS), is defined as  the time from initiation of Pembrolizumab to 
documented disease progression, death due to any cause or last patient follow -up that 
documented lack of disease progression.  
Overall survival , is defined as start date of Pembrolizumab until death from any ca use or last 
patient contact [CONTACT_133621].  Survival data  will be  obtained from the electr onic medical records .

[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research  
Almost all of the  patients treated for melanoma in the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System (UPHS) have consented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection 
Program (UPCC #[ZIP_CODE], IRB #703001). For patients participating in this program, blood samples will be  collected, processed, and stored according to the program’s standard 
operating procedure. Currently, this includes drawing less than 65 mL of blood according to the following schedule (after initiation of pembrolizumab): weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and at [ADDRESS_754335] an additional sample of blood drawn at approximately 1 week after starting pembrolizumab; this sample will also be collected, processed, and stored according to the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection P rogram standard 
operating procedure. If patients have not consented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no blood samples will be drawn for the purposes of this study. Analysis of blood samples will include, but is not limite d to, analysis of serum 
cytokines , chemokines, and T cell markers. This data will be correlated to patient response as 
well as changes in tumor FDG uptake. Some of these studies will be performed upon receipt of additional funding. There may be patients for which some or all of these blood draws are not possible, in this case it will be documented in the CRF and the blood draws may be omitted and it will not be considered a protocol deviation. Experimental pathology results will not be reported to the parti cipant and will have no impact on the treatment decisions 
made by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
Patients may undergo tumor biopsy as part of their clinical care prior to initiation of 
pembrolizumab. For patients participating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collect ion Program, 
these pre -therapy tissue samples will be collected, processed, and stored according to the 
program’s standard operating procedure. For the purposes of this study, patients will have a post-therapy tumor biopsy which will be scheduled within [ADDRESS_754336]-therapy 
FDG PET/CT; this tissue will also be collected, processed, and stored according to the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program standard operating procedure. If patients have not consented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no tumor 
biopsies will be performed for the purposes of this study. The biopsy techniques preferred for 
this study include core biopsies or surgical biopsies. The same biopsy techniques should be 
used as routinely used for a  given tumor lesion/location. When possible, the post -therapy 
tumor biopsy should target the same lesion that was biopsied pre -therapy; if the original 
lesion cannot be biopsied, then a lesion with a significant change in FDG activity should be 
targeted fo r biopsy. Alternatively, the largest lesion or most accessible lesion may be 
biopsied. Analysis of tissue samples will include, but is not limited to, analysis of tumor -
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and macrophages. This data will be correlated to patien t 
response as well as changes in tumor FDG uptake. Some of these studies will be performed 
upon receipt of additional funding. There may be patients for which a pre - or post - therapy 
tumor biopsy is not performed; those cases will be documented in the CRF and will not be considered a protocol deviation. In some cases tissue may be collected outside of the [ADDRESS_754337]-therapy FDG PET/CT; this will not be considered a protocol 
deviation. Experimental pathology results will not be repor ted to the participant and will have 
no impact on the treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].

enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least [ADDRESS_754344] their 
baseline FDG PET/CT performed as a research scan. Occasionally, the baseline FDG 
PET/CT may be ordered by a treating physician  as part of standard medical care, in which 
case the scan may occur before the patient is consented and enrolled in this study. 
 
15  
Information from this baseline FDG PET/CT scan will be compared to the post -therapy FDG 
PET/CT scans. FDG PET/CT scans performed at an institution outside of University of 
Pennsylvania health system will not be able to be used in this study.  
5.[ADDRESS_754345] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly.  I f a subject who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that subject should be discontinued from the 
study.  A subject may voluntarily discontinue participation in this study at any time.  The investigator may also, at his or her discr etion, discontinue the subject from participating in 
this study at any time.  If a subject is prematurely discontinued from participation in the study for any reason, at any time, at either the investigator’s discretion or the subject’s request, an effort must be made to document the reason(s) why a subject fails to return to the study clinic for necessary visits or  is discontinued from the study . 
The primary reason for discontinuing participation in the study may include, but is not limited to, one of the following:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent. 
• Development of an intercurrent illness, injury, or medical condition likely to interfere with subject safety or the overall assessment.  
• Noncompliance wit h protocol, e.g., the patient fails to appear at one or more imaging 
procedures.  
• Development of any condition for which the investigator feels study withdrawal is justified.   
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Termination of the study.  
Follow -up information will be obtained for subjects who discontinue the study. Additional 
details are listed in Section 7.1.4 (Visit Requirements).   
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons. If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no f urther evaluations should be performed, and 
no additional data should be collected. The investigator may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.

 7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart -  Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual  trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_112102]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from t he subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The Investigator or delegate must obtain documented consent from each potential subject 
prior to pa rticipating in a clinical trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_754349]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_574733].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any writte n information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signa ture or 
by [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and Sponsor requirements. 
 
 
 
 
  
19 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_26358].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
A baseline medical history and  physical exam will be collected from the  medical record from  
standard clinical visits  with the treating medical oncologist.  
7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee wi ll assess each subject to evaluate for potential new 
or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart. Adverse events that are grade 3 or higher will be recorded . Adverse events related to the research PET/CT will only be assessed 
for the period of ti me from the injection of FDG to the completion of the imaging exam. AEs 
related to the clinical treatment will not be collected or reported as part of this study.  
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
The following procedures will be done at each imaging session, as per routine clinical 
practice for FDG PET/CT imaging.  
• Injection of FDG performed as per routine clinical procedure . 
All women of child -bearing potential will be asked on the day of the PET/CT scan if they 
might be pregnant; this is a standard question for all patients who will be undergoing PET/CT scans due to the radiation exposure associated with the scan. If the patient is unsure about whe ther she might be pregnant then a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to 
the injection of FDG.  
The patient will be made comfortable in a preparatory room. Approximately [ADDRESS_754350] procedures used for clinical FDG PET/CT at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] . All patients will undergo a vertex of skull to 
toes PET/CT scan starting at approximately [ADDRESS_754351] PET/CT imaging procedures; this is used for attenuation correction and anatomical localization of findings in the PET scan. This can be performed either before or after the PET transmission scan. There are no separate diagnostic CT scans perfo rmed  as part of this research.  
A total of three FDG PET/CT exams will be performed as follows:  
 
 
 
  
20 
 • Baseline : A restaging FDG PET/CT will be obtained no more than [ADDRESS_754352] of care, it may occur 
prior to consent and enrollment in this study.  
 
• 1st Post-therapy : at approximately 3 weeks (± 3 weeks) following the start of 
pembrolizumab, a post -therapy FDG PET/CT will be obtained. This exam will be 
obtained for study purposes, to assess glycolytic activity at sites of metastatic disease 
at an early time -point. 
 
• 2nd Post-therapy : When clinically indicated, as per the judgment of the patient’s 
oncologist, a restaging FDG PET/CT will be obtained  at > [ADDRESS_754353] of care for restaging disease instead of FDG PET/CT .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling  
For patients participating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program  (UPCC #[ZIP_CODE], 
IRB #703001), blood samples will be collected, processed, and stored according to the program’s standard operating procedure. Currently, this includes drawing less than 65 mL of blood according to the following schedule (after initiation of pembrolizumab): weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and at [ADDRESS_754354] an additional sample of blood drawn at approximately 1 week after starting pembrolizumab; this sample will also be collected, processed, and stored according to the Penn Mela noma Tissue 
Collection Program standard operating procedure. If patients have not consented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no blood samples will be drawn for the purposes of this study. Analysis of blood samples will include, but is not limited to, analysis of serum cytokines , chemokines, and T cell markers ; proposed cytokines 
and chemokines are listed in Table 1, and proposed T cell markers are listed in Table  2. This 
data will be correlated to patient response as well as changes in tumor FDG uptake. Some of 
these studies will be performed upon receipt of additional funding. There may be patients for which some or all of these blood draws are not possible, in this case it will be documented in the CRF and the blood draws  may be omitted and it will not be considered a protocol 
deviation. Experimental pathology results will not be reported to the participant and will have no impact on the treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
Patients may undergo tumor biopsy  as part of their clinical care prior to initiation of 
pembrolizumab. For patients participating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, 
these pre -therapy tissue samples will be collected, processed, and stored according to the 
program’s standard operating procedure. For the purposes of this study, patients will have a post-therapy tumor biopsy which will be scheduled within [ADDRESS_754355]-therapy

 FDG PET/CT; this tissue will also be collected, processed, and stored according to the Penn 
Melanoma Tissue Collection Program standard operating procedure. If patients have not consented to participate in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no tumor biopsies will be performed for the purposes of this study. The biopsy techniques pr eferred for 
this study include core biopsies or surgical biopsies. The same biopsy techniques should be used as routinely used for a given tumor lesion/location. When possible, the post -therapy 
tumor biopsy should target the same lesion that was biopsied pre -therapy; if the original 
lesion cannot be biopsied, then a lesion with a significant change in FDG activity should be targeted for biopsy. Analysis of tissue samples will include, but is not limited to, analysis of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) , macrophages , and other myeloid subsets; changes in 
tumor cells will also be evaluated, and the fraction of necrotic cells will be calculated. TILs will be analyzed using multiparameter flow cytometry ; proposed phenotypic markers are 
listed in Table 2. This data will be correlated to patient response as well as changes in tumor 
FDG uptake. Some of these studies will be performed upon receipt of additional funding. There may be patients for which a pre - or post - therapy tumor biopsy is not performed; those 
cases will be documented in the CRF and will not be considered a protocol deviation. In 
some cases tissue may be collected outside of the [ADDRESS_754356]-
therapy FDG PET/CT; this will not be considered a protocol deviation. Experimental pathology results will not be reported to the participant and will have no impact on the treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_1963].  
 
For patients participating in the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, we will follow 
the standard operating p rocedure regarding archival tissue access for patients undergoing a 
biopsy or surgery on melanoma or other skin cancer for diagnosing, treating or research purposes, but for which there is no applicable left over fresh tissue, or patients who had a 
biopsy or surgical procedure done on melanoma or other skin cancer for diagnosing, treating 
or research purposes at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or at an 
institution outside of UPHS. If patients have not consented to participate in the Penn  
Melanoma Tissue Collection Program, then no archival tissue will be requested.

7.1.4 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 -  Trial Flow Chart.   Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 7.1 -  Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening  
The investigator will provide for the protection of the subjects by [CONTACT_131934].  These regulations are available upon request from the sponsor.  The sponsor and 
IRB must review the informed consent form used during the informed consent process, and it must be available for inspection.   
Before any procedures specified in t his protocol are performed, a subject must:  
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed 
consent.  
• Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate.  
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study.  
• Sign and date an IRB -approved informed consent form.    
 
 
 
  
[ADDRESS_754357] their baseline  FDG PET/CT performed as a research scan. 
Occasionally, the baseline FDG PET/CT may be ordered by a treating physician as part of 
standard medical care, in which case the scan may occur before the patient is consented and 
enrolled in this study. Information from this baseline FDG PET/CT scan will be compared to the post -therapy FDG PET/CT scans. FDG PET/CT scans performed at an institution outside 
of University of Pennsylvania health system will not be  able to be used in this study.  
The following additional patient data will be obtained:  demographics (including gender, date of birth, height, weight, and race), hi stologic diagnosis, and year of diagnosis. Correlative 
pertinent imaging including CT, MRI, x -ray, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT, or bone scan may be 
reviewed  if necessary to confirm eligibility . For patients referred from outside the University 
of Pennsylvania h ealth system, patient records, biopsy material, and imaging will be 
reviewed to determine eligibility for the study.  For women of childbearing potential a urine pregnancy test will be performed at the screening visit . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Follow -up 
Clinical follow -up may include standard of care imaging, tumor markers and standard visits 
with a treating physician at intervals standard for metastatic melanoma follow -up after the 
start of new treatment, and usually at the time of symptomatic progression. The timing of clinical visits will be determined by [CONTACT_574725].  
Information will be collected through medical record review to assess for status of disease and the date of progression will be documented at the time of clinical progression. Clinical follow up for overall survival, by [CONTACT_61706], will continue until loss to follow up or death. For those whose are cared for by a non- UPHS  clinician during this period, this 
clinician will be contact[CONTACT_574726] -up. The patients may also be contact[CONTACT_574727] -up.

[CONTACT_574729], of the primary tumor and up to 5 metastatic lesions will be measured on each FDG PET/CT scan. Patients will be grouped into responders ( partial/complete response) and 
nonresponders ( stable disease or progressive disease) based on RE CIST . Patients will also be 
grouped based on a positive flare response (greater than 20% increase in SUVmax) or negative flare response (less than 20% increase in SUVmax . An exploratory tumor -by-tumor 
FDG PET/CT response analysis will be performed for the primary tumor and up to 5 metastatic lesions in each patient. Changes in FDG uptake within immune related tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and thymus) will also be measured as an exploratory objective using SUVmax and SUVmean.  
 
 
 
  
[ADDRESS_754359] that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study . An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable  and uni ntended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the protocol -specified 
procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any  clinically significant adverse change in frequency 
and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with the study 
period, is also an adverse event.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event .  
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood dra w, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
 
7.2.1 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring during participation in this study  that: 
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an other important medical event  
Refer to Table [ADDRESS_754360] to be excluded from the trial . 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician to be related to the research FDG PET/CT scan procedure  or post -therapy tumor 
tissue biopsy that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow -up period specified in the paragraph above, or 
at any time outside of the time period spec ified in the previous paragraph also must be 
reported immediately to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  Global Safety .

 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caus ed death.); or

The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures 
that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test dr ug and the adverse event based upon the 
available information.  
The following  components are to be used to assess the relationship between [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):

7.2.3 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Design:  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_574714] a standard regimen. The intent of this study is to evaluate FDG PET/CT 
as an early measure of response to immunotherapy. Tumor FDG uptake  will be measured at 
baseline and at 3 and >10 weeks after initiation of pembrolizumab. 30 evaluable patients will 
be enrolled; evaluable implies that the patient had baseline and week 3 FDG PET/CT scans.  
This study will also include serum and tissue sampling for immune biomarkers.  
 
8.2 Objectives:   
The primary objectives are to:  
1. Determine the distribution of changes from baseline in tumor FDG uptake on PET/CT 
at 3 weeks and >[ADDRESS_754365] for the association between chan ge in tumor FDG uptake  on PET/CT at 3 weeks 
and objective response (RECIST) . 
 
The s econdary objectives are to:  
1. Based on change in FDG uptake  at [ADDRESS_754366] FDG 
“flare.”  
2. Test for the association between FDG flare (yes/no) and objective response .  
3. Test for the association between FDG flare and progression -free and overall survival . 
4. Test for correlation between change in FDG uptake  and levels of immune biomarkers 
in serum and tissue.  
5. Test for association  between changes in immune bio markers in serum and tissue with 
objective response, progression- free survival, and overall survival.  
 
8.3 Endpoints:   
1. Objective response is defined by [CONTACT_393] . The clinical evaluation takes place at [ADDRESS_754367] pembrolizumab regimens . Patients will be categorized as 
responders (complete response or partial response) or nonresponders ( stable disease 
or progressive disease).  
 
 
 
   
 
[ADDRESS_754368] ized uptake value (SUVmax) will be analyzed  for all tumor 
sites. Immune -related tissues will be analyzed with SUVmax and SUVmean.  
3. Studies have shown that the baseline test/re -test variability is 15 -20%. Thus, FDG 
“flare” will likely be defined by >20% increase in tumor FDG uptake  at 3 weeks. This 
definition may be modified for the observed distribution of changes in tumor FDG 
uptake  on our study.  
4. Progression- free and overall survival are defined in Section 4.1.2. 
5. Immune biomarkers (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
 
8.4 Plans for Data Analysis:   
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_574715]/CT imaging to evaluate early response to 
immunotherapy. We will first begin with a descriptive analysis. For continuous variables, we 
will generate graphs and descriptive statistics (e.g.,  means, standard deviations, medians and 
inter-quartile range ). Categorical variab les will be described by [CONTACT_82658], proportions and 
95% exact confidence intervals. Change in tumor FDG uptake  will be closely examined. It is 
likely that change in tumor SUVmax  >20% will be classified as a FDG “flare” and  the 
number of patients with a f lare will be computed.  
 
Next, associations between change in tumor FDG uptake  with clinical outcomes will be 
conducted. Change in tumor FDG uptake  at [ADDRESS_754369]. Also, objective response rates will be compared 
between patients with or without FDG “flare” by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.  
 PFS and OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_41238]. Median values and 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated. PFS and OS will b e compared between patients with 
or without FDG “flare” by [CONTACT_574730]. Cox regression may be used to assess the effect 
of continuously scaled measurements of FDG change. For all survival analyses, a landmark 
analysis will be performed . Here, PFS or OS are defined from a landmark, which is 3 weeks 
after initiation of pembrolizumab . The landmark method is necessary because the change in 
tumor FDG uptake  is known at 3 weeks . Serum and tissue biomarkers will be correlated with 
change tumor FDG uptake , using Pearson correlation or Spearman’s correlation , as 
appropriate. Within- patient pre -/post -treatment changes in biomarkers will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_574731]’s t -test or Wilcoxon signed ranks test, as appropriate. We will test for an 
association between post -/pre-treatment fold change in immune biomarkers in serum and 
tissue and objective response, progression- free survival, and overall survival  using logistic 
regression (for response) and Cox regression (for time -to-event outcomes) using landmark 
surviva l analysis.  
 
8.5 Sample Size Justification:
  
The target is 30 evaluable patients, which may require up to 35 enrolled patients. Based on 
our clinical experience, we assum e a 50% objective response rate, thus there will be [ADDRESS_754370] 84% power to detect a 1.0SD difference in mean 
values, using 1- sided two sample t  test at a 5% significance level.  The [ADDRESS_754371] greater changes in FDG SUV.  
 
8.6 Study Duration:   
This study will enroll [ADDRESS_754372] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the 
following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their au thorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subject s that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive).  
All research personnel associated with this study have completed the University of Penn sylvania’s Patient Oriented Research Training Program as well as HIPAA Compliance 
Training.  Trained staff will assess eligibility, introduce the study rationale, procedures, study risks, and collect the combined informed consent/HIPAA authorization form.  The study 
team will work to uphold the privacy of the participants in several ways.  Communications made among study staff regarding participants will use ID numbers whenever possible and minimize the use of patient name [CONTACT_29097] e xcept when necessary for 
conduct of the study. Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be 
accessible to personnel involved in the study. Computer -based files will only be made 
available to personnel involved in the study through the use of access privileges and 
 
 
 
   
 
33  passwords. Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information. In 
data analysis sets, we will use ID numbers and/or patient initials only.   
Precautions will be applied to protecting subject privacy a nd the protected hea lth information 
detailed below:  
1. Name  
2. Address  
3. Date of Birth  
4. Telephone Number  
5. Email address  
6. Emergency contact [CONTACT_6227], name, and relationship 
7. Medical Record Number  
8. Health Plan ID numbers  
Data will be accessible to the study investigators, all study staff, Department of Radiology 
IND office representatives, Radiation Research Safety Committee members, UPenn IRB and Office of Clinical Research, and the FDA (if desired).

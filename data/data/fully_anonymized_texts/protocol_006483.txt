Revised 
Protocol 0312-Nov -2018Major changes:
Enrollment into the study was stopped as of [ADDRESS_508256] -2018, due to 
the results of the futility analysis performed on 12 -April -2018.
All efficacy assessments will be based on the investigator evaluation
rather than Independent Review Committee (IRC) . 
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403270] -points and samples are reduced; 

 
Update of Appendix 3 Definitions of Response and Progression 
criteria , Appendix 5 Nivolumab Management Algorithm and 
Appendix 6Pomalidomide Pregnancy Risk Prevention Plan.
Revised 
Protocol 0222-Ma y -2018Major changes: 
Incorpo rates changes required by [CONTACT_403298] , as well as 
study design and objective changes to reflect endpoints adequacy in 
light of these safety concerns.

current International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidance .
Revised 
Protocol 0127-Dec -[ADDRESS_508257] -2018, enrollment into theCA209602 study  was permanent ly closed due to 
insufficient benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis ofprogressi on free survival 
(PFS). Subjects rando mized to the nivolumab+p omalidomide (NPd)or nivolumab+elotuzumab 
+pomalidomide (NEPd )arms may continue treatm ent based on investigator’s judgement of 
continued clinical benefit. The s tudy will close af ter all  enrolled subjects com plete safet y follow-
up (i.e., [ADDRESS_508258] has discont inued study treatm ent). To align with this change ,
study  assessments have been modified : all efficacy assessments will now be based on investigator 
evaluat ion rather than by [CONTACT_403299] (IRC), bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403271] n

Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 12-Nov-[ADDRESS_508265] meets other criteria for discontinuation of study drug outlined in Section 3.5.
Study Phase: 3
Research Hypothesis: .The additio n of nivolumab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone will increase the clinical 
benefit represented by [CONTACT_403301] (PFS) and higher response rate compared to poma lidomide 
and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
Objectives : 
Primary Objectives
The primary objective isto compare progression free survival (PFS) between N -Pd and Pd arms , by [CONTACT_1697] .
Secondary Objective s
To estimate overall survival (OS) within N -Pd and Pd arms 
To assess the time to objective response (TTR) within N -Pd and Pd arms by [CONTACT_1697]
To assess the duration of objective response (DOR) within N -Pd and Pd arms by [CONTACT_65019] r
To compare ORR between N -Pd and Pd arms, by [CONTACT_1697] .
Exploratory Objectives
To evaluate efficacy  of NE-Pd in subjects with relapsed and /orrefra ctory multiple Myeloma within NE -Pd arm
through the assessment of ORR and PFS
To evaluate efficacy of NE-Pd in subjects whocross ed over from the control arm (Pd) to the exploratory arm 
(NE-Pd) through the assessment of ORR and PFS
Toassess safet y and tolerability
Study Design : 
This is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of the 
combinatio n the rapy of Nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethason e (N-Pd the investigational arm -armA) , when 
compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd ; the control arm -arm B ) in subjects with relapsed and/o r refractory 
multiple myeloma (rrMM). Revised Protocol [ADDRESS_508266] arm evaluating the clinical benefit and 
the safety of the combination therapy  of elotuzumab, nivolumab, pomalid omide and dexamethasone (NE-Pd, the 
exploratory arm -arm C ) in the same patient population. Additionally, subjects randomized to the Pd arm were allowed 
to cross over to this exploratory NE-Pd arm at the time of progression. Cross over was stopped as of [ADDRESS_508267] 
clinical benefit and do not meet the study discontinuation criteria.

Clinical Protocol CA209602
BMS -936558 nivolumab
Initially, the study was designed toenroll approximately 417subjects for a total of 348subjects to be randomized
(assum ing 20% screen failure rate) to N-PdandPd in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization wasperformed with the following 
stratification factors: a) number of lines of prior therapy (2 vs3+); AND b) ISS stage (1 -2 vs 3 ).
Subjects were to continue treatment as long as the subject has clinical benefit from the treatment and does not meet 
criteria for treatment discontinuation.
As of 23-August -2018, the further enrollment of CA209602 study was permanently closed due to the insufficient 
benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis of PFS. A total of [ADDRESS_508268] udy: 
75 to NPd, 71 to Pd and 24 to NE -Pd arms. Subjects randomized to the NPd or NEPd arms may  continue  treatment 
based on investigator’s  judgement  of continued clinical benefit. Study will be closed after all subjects complete safety 
follow -up (i.e., [ADDRESS_508269] has discontinued study treatment). 
The study  design schematic is presented below:
Study Population: Subjects who are diagnosed with refractory  or relapsed multiple myeloma defined as:
1.Must have received [ADDRESS_508270] included an immune modulatory drug (IMiD) 
and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) alo ne or in combination. Subject must have received at least 2consecutive 
cycles of an IMiD and at least 2 consecutive cycles of a PI. The dose of the pri or IMiD (eg ,lenalidomide) to 
which the subject has relapsed or been refractory  must be the induction dose and NOT a maintenance dose 
(Note: adjusted induction dose for intolerance reasons or for renal impairment is accepted).
2.Documented refractory or rela psed and refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma
3.Refractory ( lack of response or progressed on or within [ADDRESS_508271] dose of treatment) to their last line 
of treatment . Lack of response is defined as not having achieved at least PR.i
4.Subjects must have failed treatment with a proteasome inhibitor and an IMID in one of the following ways :
a.“Refractory ” = Refractory ( lack o rresponse or progressed on treatment or within [ADDRESS_508272] 
dose of treatment, regardless of the achievement of initial response) to a proteasome inhibitor and 
an IMiD .Lack of response is defined as not having achieved at least PR.i

Study Assessments :Tumo r response assessmen t by [CONTACT_403302]. The primary endpoint PFS will be based on the investigator .
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: 
In Revised Protocol 02, t he planned sample size for this study was revised to approximately 348 randomized subjects 
randomized at a 1:[ADDRESS_508274] at the overall alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided) with 90% power with 
twointerim analy ses, with the first one for early futility and the second for efficacy .
The study requires at least 262 PFS events to ensure that a two-sided 5% type I error sequential test procedure with 
twointerim analy ses will have 90% p ower to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667, corresponding to a median PFS of 
[ADDRESS_508275] -2018 , the Sponsor (BMS) decided to permanently discontinue enrol lment based on insufficient clinical 
benefit ob served at an interim futility analysis for PFS. A total of [ADDRESS_508276] been randomized in the study .

Analyses:
PFS Analysis Timepoints
At the time of PFS analyses, as assessed by [CONTACT_1697] , the distribution of PFS in N -Pd group will be compared 
with the Pd arm via a two -sided, log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_403304] . The 
hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding 100x(1 -adjusted alpha)% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated in a 
stratified Cox proportional ha zards model using treatment as a single covariate. 
PFS curves, PFS medians with two-sided 95% CIs, and PFS rates at at select milestone with 95% CIs will be 
estimated using Kaplan -Meier methodology.
Analy sis of OS
At the time of PFS analyses, OS will be summarized by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier product limit method within each arm. 
Median values along with two -sided 95% CIs based on the log log transformation, will be calculated. Additional 
details of OS analysis will be inclu ded in the SAP
Analy sis of ORR by [CONTACT_1697]
Investigator -determined ORR analy ses will be conducted using a two sided Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) 
test stratified by [CONTACT_403305] r lines of therapy  and ISS stage at study entry  to compare N -Pd to Pd arm. Associa ted odds 
ratios and 95% CIs will be calculated. Additionally , ORRs and corresponding 95% exact CIs will be calculated 
using the Clopper Pearson method for N -Pd and Pd arms
Analy sis of DOR and TTR
DOR and TTR will be computed for subjects who achieve sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR as assessed by [CONTACT_403306] . Median values of DOR, alo ng with two -sided 95% CI, will be calculated 
using KM product -limit method. Summary statist ics of TTR will be provided. More detailed analy sis of DOR 
and TTR will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) .
Details on the testing procedure will be described in SAP.
Safety Analysis
The safety analy sis will be performed in all treated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safety  will be presented using 
Natio nal Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 by [CONTACT_6490]. Adverse Events (AE), drug-related AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and drug-related SAEs will be 
tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v.4.[ADDRESS_508277] grade

1 I NTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 Multiple Myeloma 
Amo ng hematol ogic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent blood 
cancer after non-Hodgkin lympho ma, representing 10% of hematol ogic malignancies. In the 
[LOCATION_002] there are an est imated 26,850 new cases and 11,240 deaths predicted for [ZIP_CODE].The 
incidence of MM in Europe is 4.5 to 6.0/100,000/year and the mortalit y is 4.1/100,000/y ear1.The 
incidence of MM increases with advancing age and the median age of diagnosis in the US is 
70years1and in Europe between [ADDRESS_508284] frequent 
primary  neoplasm o f the bone marrow. Pathologically, it stems from an e xpansio n of a sing le clo ne 
of abnorm al terminally different iated B cells (plasma cells) that produce a monoclonal 
immunogl obulin (M -protein) and replace the normal bone marrow, leading to hy pofunctioning o f 
the bone marrow, osteolyt ic bone lesio ns, hypercalcemia, and renal disease2.
1.2 Current Treatment Regimens and Unmet Medical Need
Current ly approved treatments commo nly used for patients with relapsed / refractory MM include 
prote asome inhibitor (PI) based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, bortezomib, carfilzo mib), immune modulatory  drug 
(IMiD) based therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (thalido mide, lenalido mide, or pomalido mide) and histone deacet ylase 
inhibitors.3,4More recent ly an oral proteasome inhibitor ( ixazomib ) as well as new drug classes, 
elotuzum ab (anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody) and daratum umab (anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody ) have also been approved for treatm ent of rrMM. There is no cure and current therapi [INVESTIGATOR_403272], prolong survival, and minimize symptom s. While recent 
advances in the use of high-dose chemo therapy, targeted therapeuti cs, and stem  cell transplantati on 
have improved overall and event -free survival, the majorit y of patients with myelo ma will relapse 
and disease progression is expected for all but a small percentage.5Mult iple myelo ma is associa ted 
with morbidi ty and m ortali ty, thus reflecting a significant unmet medical need.
1.3 Study Rationale
1.3.1 Rationale for Nivolumab Development in Multiple Myeloma 
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is characterized by [CONTACT_403307] (BM) 
microenvironment which supports immune evasio n and a growth advantage for malignant plasma 
cells. The nature of this suppression involves many cell types that have been implicated in 
inhibit ing immune responses to con trol myeloma cell growth. In part, PD-L1 has been shown to 
play a role in mediat ing inhibit ion of both adaptive and innate immunit y in t he bone marrow milieu 
of MM patients. As PD-L1 is over-expressed on MM cells and other cells in the BM 
microenvironment from MM patients, its receptor PD-1 is also found over-expressed on both 
CD8+ T and some NK cell subsets. Therefore PD-L1 mediated suppression of PD1+ T and NK 
cells is one potenti almechanism in place to confer immune escape.

PD-L1 in MM
1)PD-L1 on myelo ma cells:
While PD-L1 is seldo m found on normal plasma cells, myelo ma cells frequent ly express PD-L1 
and this expressio n is further enhanced when cultured with bone marrow stromal cells 
(BMSCs).6,7,8Limit ed data to date also suggests that PD -L1 expressio n on myelo ma cells may be 
increased with disease burden, stage and at time of relapse suggest ing a possible mechanism for 
immune escape from current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .9
Figure 1.3.1 -1: PD-L1 expression in myeloma cells.
a., b:PD-L1 expression is increased on B M my eloma cells in MM patients
c:PD-L1 expression on BM plasma cells may be increased with disease stage
d:increase in PD -L1 on BM plasma cells associated with progression (within individual patients).6,9
2)PD-L1 on immune cells in MM:
PD-L1 can also m ediate suppressi on of  immune effector functi on through i ts expressi on on other 
cells in the BM of MM patients. PD-L1 is found to be over-expressed on both MDSCs 
(myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and pDCs (plasmacy toid dendri tic cells) in the BM of MM 
patients and this expressio n has been shown to drive suppressio n of both CD8+ T and NK and cell 
responses in vitro.8,10
PD-1 in MM
PD-1 plays a role in maintaining T cell homeostasis and its expression on T cells is generally 
associ ated with an antigen-activated or an exhausted phenoty pe.Increased frequency of PD-1+ 
Tcell subsets have been reported in many tum or types including MM.8,11Increased frequency o f 
PD1+ NK cells have also been observed in the BM of MM patients.8,12Therefore expressio n of 
PD-1 on cytolytic immune cells such as CD8+ Tand NK cells (Figure 1.3.1 -2) represents a 
possible mechanism of how PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and suppressive immune cells can 
inhibit effector cell funct ion conferring immune escape and growth of myelo ma cells.12

Effects of PD-1 and/or PD-L1 blockade in enhancing immune cell function and killing of 
myeloma cells.
The PD -1/PD -L1 axis imposes an inhibitory mechanism to reduce effector cell funct ion and killing 
of mye loma cells. This state of inhibit ion is mediated in part through tumor cell PD -L1 suppressio n 
of effector cells.Blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 (or both) can directly enhance 
effector cell funct ion and killing of myeloma cells in vit ro (Figure 1.3.1 -3).Addit ionally, 
PD-1/PD -L1-blocking antibodies can inhibit suppressive mechanisms in vit ro mediated by

Nivo lumab is a fully human, IgG4 (κ) isotype mAb that binds PD- 1 on activated immune cells a nd 
disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1(B7 -H1/CD274) and

Nivo lumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma as 
both a single agent and in co mbinat ion with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Nivo lumab is also approved for non-small 
cell lung cancer fo llowing failure on or after platinum based therapy, as well as for advanced rena l 
cell carcino ma following treatm ent with an ant i-angiogenic therapy .Opdivo (nivo lumab) is 
approved for use in multiple countri es including the [LOCATION_002] (US Dec 2014), the European 
Unio n (EU June 2015) and Japan (Jul 2015). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Nivolumab dose and frequency
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was selected based on clinical data and 
modeling and simulat ion approaches using populatio n PK (PPK) and exposure -response analyses 
of data fro m studies in mult iple tumor types (melanoma, non -small -cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and 
renal cell carcino ma [RCC]) wher e body  weight norm alized dosing (mg/kg) has been used.
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proporti onal exposure over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and no differences in PK across ethnicit ies and tumor ty pes were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribut ion were found to increase as the body 
weight increases, but less than the proporti onal with increasing weight, indicat ing that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model previously devel oped using data from NSCLC subjects has recent ly been updated, using 
data from 1544 subjects from 7 studies investigating nivolumab in the treatm ent of melanoma, 
NSCLC, and RCC. In this dataset, the median (minimum -maximu m) weight was 77 kg 
(35kg -160 kg) and thus, an approximately  equivalent dose of 3 mg/kg for an [ADDRESS_508287] rel evant summary  exposures 
of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, the PPK model was used to simulate nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
240mg Q2W. In the simulat ions, the simulated patient populat ions consisted of [ADDRESS_508288], time- averaged concentrati ons (Cavgss) for 240 mg Q2W are 
predi cted to be si milar for all subjects in reference to 80 kg subjects receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W.
Nivo lumab is safe and well  tolerated up to 10 m g/kg Q2W dose level. Adverse events have been 
broadly  consistent across tumor types following monotherapy  and have not demonstrated clear 
dose-response or exposure -response relationships. Addit ionally, the simulated median and 95th 
predi ction interval of  nivolumab summary exposures across body  weight range (35 -160 kg) are 
predi cted to be maintained below the corresponding observed highest exposure experienced in 
nivolumab ie, 95th percentile fo llowing nivo lumab 10 mg/kg Q2W fro m clinical study CA209003. 
Thus, while subjects in the lower body weight ranges woul d have greater exposures than 80 kg 
subjects, the exposures are predicted to be within the range o f observed exposures at doses (up to

10 m g/kg Q2W) used in the nivo lumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects at 
increased risk. For subjects with greater body  weights, the simulated ranges of exposures are also 
not expected to affect efficacy, because the exposures predi cted following administration of a 
240mg Q2W are on the flat part of the exposure -response curves for previously invest igated 
tumors, m elano ma and NSCLC. Given the similarity of nivo lumab PK across tumor types and the 
similar exposures predicted fo llowing administration of 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg, it 
is expected that the safet y and efficacy  profile of 240mg nivolumab will be similar to that of 
3mg/kg nivo lumab. Thus nivo lumab [ADDRESS_508289] 4 months 
will be used this study .
At 4 months after init iation o f treatm ent, subj ects will be switched from nivo lumab 240 mg ever y 
2weeks to nivol umab 480 mg every  4 weeks (Q4W), which provides a more convenient dosing 
regimen for subjects. Based on PK mo deling and simulat ions, administration of nivo lumab 480mg 
Q4W will be started after steady  state is achieved with 240 mg Q2W and is predi cted to provide 
Cavgss similar to 240 mg Q2 W. While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide greater (approximately 
20%) maximum steady  state concentrations and lower (approximately 10%) steady  state trough 
concentrations, these exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at doses 
up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects 
at increased risk. Similar to the nivo lumab [ADDRESS_508290] similar efficacy  and 
safet y profiles to nivo lumab 240 mg Q2W.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Nivolumab [ADDRESS_508291] a burden on subjects and treatment centers. Establishing that nivo lumab 
can be safely administered using shorter infusio n times of 30 minutes duration in subjects will 
diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Previous clinical studi es show that 
nivolumab has been administered safely  over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10mg/kg over 
long treatm ent duration. In Study  CA209010, (a Phase 2, randomized, doubl e blinded, 
dose-ranging study  of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose 
associ ation was observed for infusio n site reactio ns and hypersensit ivity react ions (1.7% at 
0.3mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. An infusion durat ion of 30 minutes for 240 mg and 480 flat doses of nivolumab 
(~60% of  the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) are not expected to present safet y concerns compared 
to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivo lumab dose infused over a 60 minute duration.
1.3.2 Rationale for Elotuzumab Development in Multiple Myeloma 
Elotuzumab (BMS -901608, HuLuc63) is a first-in-class, immunostimulatory , humanized 
immunogl obulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal  antibody  (mAb) targeted against Signaling Lymphocy te 
Activation Molecule Famil y 7 (SLAMF7, also called CS1), a glycoprotein highly  expressed on 
myelo ma cells independent of cytogeneti c abnormalit ies. SLAMF7 is also expressed on natural 
killer (NK) cells and at lower levels on other immune cell subsets. SLAMF7 has not been detected

of myeloma cells wit h minimal effects on normal tissue.15
Elotuzumab dem onstrates a dual mechanism that includes: 1) direct NK cell act ivation and 2) NK 
cell-mediated Antigen Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicit y (ADCC).
In a Phase 2 trial of elotuzum ab combined with lenalido mide and dexamethasone for 
relapsed/refractory  myeloma subjects, the obj ective response rate was 84% and median PFS was 
29months.[ADDRESS_508293] regimen of histamine 
blocking agents, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Investigator -determined infusio n reacti ons 
were reported in 11% of subjects in the phase 2 tri al.
Phase 3 Tri al of Elotuzum ab in relapsed/refractory MM
The study  CA204004 is an ongoing Phase 3, rando mized, open -label trial invest igating the 
combinat ion of elotuzum ab with lenalidomide/low -dose dexamethasone (E-Ld) versus 
lenalido mide/low -dose dexameth asone alone (Ld) in subjects with previously  treated relapsed or 
refractory  multiple myelo ma. The primary  objectives of this study  were to com pare the ORR and 
PFS of E -Ld versus Ld. In total , 646 subj ectswere randomized and 635 were treated. At the time
of the interim analysis data cut-off, 179 (elotuzumab group, 35%; control group 21%) were still 
on-treatment. The median follow up was 24.5 months and in the elotuzum ab group, subjects
received a median of 19 (range, 1 to 42) treatm ent cycles over a median of 17 months versus 
14 (range, 1 to 40) over [ADDRESS_508294] ratio for progression -free survival  was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.85; 
P=0.0004). 1 -year progression -free survival rate in the elotuzumab group was 68%, ver sus 57% in 
the control  group; 2-year rate was 41% versus 27%. Medi an progressi on-free survival in the 
elotuzum ab group was 19.4 months versus 14.9 months in the control group. Overall response rate 
in the elotuzumab group was 79% versus 66% in the control group (P=0.0002).
In the 635 treated subjects , adverse events of any grade occurr ed in 99% of patients. In the 
elotuzum ab group, 34% of the patients experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia versus 44% in the 
control  group; 77% versus 49% of pat ients had grade [ADDRESS_508295] 
commo n non-hematol ogic toxicities (>30% of patients) included infect ions, fatigue, pyrexia, 
diarrhea, constipation, and cough. The most common grade 3 to 4 non -hematol ogic toxicit ies were 
fatigue and pneum onia. In the elotuzum ab group, infections were reported for 81% of patients 
versus 74% in the control  group. When adjusted for the longer drug exposure in the elotuzum ab 
group, infect ion rates were equal in both groups (incidence rate per 100 patient years, 197).
Consequent ly, despi [INVESTIGATOR_403273], there 
were no apparent untoward clinical manifestations.

In the elotuzum ab group, study drug toxicity was the primary  cause of death in 5 (2%) patients 
versus 6 (2%) in the control  group .
Thirty-five (6%) patients had a second primary malignancy: 22 (7%) in the elotuzumab group and 
13 (4%) in the control  group. The incidence rates of second hematol ogic malignancies were 
ident ical in the elotuzum ab and control  groups (2% in each group); rates of second solid tumors 
were 3% versus 2%, respect ively, and rates of non-melano ma sk in cancers were 3.1% versus 1.5%, 
respectively . When adj usted f or exposure to study  therapy , the inci dence rates of second primary 
malignancies per 100 patient -years were similar at 3.5 versus 2.8, respectively. 
Thirty-three (10%) patients receiving elotuzum ab had an infusion reacti on, including pyrexia, 
chills, and hypertension. Infusio n reacti ons were mostly grade 1 to 2; 1% were grade [ADDRESS_508296] 2 cycles of study therapy 
(range cycle 1, day 1 to cycle 11, day 281); five patients had an infusio n reacti on after cycle 2. 
Infusio n of elotuzum ab was interrupted in 15 (5%) patients owing to an infusio n react ion, for a 
median durati on of 15 minutes. Infusio n reactions resolved in all pat ients; however, 2 (1%) patients 
discontinued due to an infusio n reaction.
Elotuzumab may be detected in the serum  protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixat ion assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response 
classificat ion.A small  peak in the early gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ on serum 
immunofixat ion may potentially be attributed to elotuzum ab, particularly in patients whose 
endogenous myelo ma protein is IgA, IgM, IgD, or lambda light chain restricted. This interference 
can impact the determinat ion of complete response and possi bly relapse from complete response 
in patients with IgG kappa myelo ma protein .
Elotuzumab w as approved in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone for the treatment 
of patients with multiple myelo ma who have received one to three prior therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (FDA, 
November -2015) and in MM pati ents who have received at l east one pri or therapy  (EMA, 201 6).
A descript ion and status of all studies are presented in the Invest igator Brochure.17
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Elotuzumab dose and frequency
The dose of 10 mg/kg on D1, 8, 15 & 22 of Cycles 1 and 2 then on D1 & 15 during Cyc les3 and 4, 
used in this protocol , is the FDA approved dose and regimen of el otuzum ab in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide and dexamethasone.
Clinical Phase I and IIa studies suggests that the trough serum concentrations of elotuzum ab in 
subjects treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg doses are above the target levels ie, 70 g/ml, which is 
predi cted based on preclinical models. Following elotuzum ab dosing of 10 and 20mg/kg in 
combinat ion with lenalido mide/dex, the observed steady -state Cmin values consistent ly remained 
above 70 g/mL, the minimum efficaci ous trough concentrati ons18. Elotuzum ab dosing also

elotuzum ab dose and decreasing the administration of elotuzumab frequency to every 4 weeks will 
continu e to provide Cmin,ss above 70 ug/ml ,and will be more convenient for patients on long 
term therapy and therefore requi re fewer schedul ed clinic visits. With 20mg/kg Q4W, the 
simulated Cave,ss is 301ug/ml, which is similar to the 10mg/kg dosing regimen with Cave,ss 
value of 297 ug/ml. In addit ion, with the estimated Cmin,ss (geometric mean) is 141 ug/ml, and it 
remains above 70 ug/ml, which is the minimum trough concentration at which maximum efficacy 
was seen in preclinical studies and is suffic ient to maintain saturation of SLAMF7 by [CONTACT_403309]. 
Furthe r, with the 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing, the Cmax,ss (geo metric mean) is est imated as 556 ug/ml, 
which is higher than the Cmax,ss of 401 ug/ml at the 10 mg/kg dose. However, in the PPK analysis 
of elotuzum ab combinat ion with len/dex, there was no relat ionship betw een el otuzum ab exposure 
and Grade 3+ AEs hazard ratio. The point estimate indicated no increase in hazard ratio with 
increasing exposure over the range of exposures observed wi th a 10 mg/kg dosing regimen. This 
exposure-safety  analysi s indicates that incre asing exp osure may have limited im pact on the safet y 
for subje cts.

The maximum infusio n rate of 2 m l/min was initially explored in the phase 1 and 2 elotuzum ab 
clinical trials. However, the infusion of elotuzum ab at a faster rate was explored in 2 completed 
trials (HuLuc63 -1703, CA204009) and 1 ongoing tri al (CA204112). In the phase 2 porti on of  the 
HuLuc63 -1703 trial, 31 subjects had the infusio n rate escalated up to 5mL/min 
(approximately 1hour infusio n). Of the total 3412 elotuzum ab infusio ns administered, 
1127 (33%) infusio ns were given at 5 m L/min. Nearly all the su bject tol erated the faster infusi on

among the 41% of subjects and 19% of infusio ns administered at the faster rate of 5 ml/min.
In the CA204112 study , the infusio n rate was escalated to 5mL/min starting C1D15 . As of 
13Oct2015, 70 subjects were treated with a median of 6 cycles (1 -13). A total of 2 subjects (3%) 
experienced infusio n react ions (pyrexia, grade 1, and infusio n related reaction, grade 2). No grade 
3 -4 infusio n reaction was reported. Of the total of 1113 elotuzumab infusions, 968 infusions were 
given at 5mL/min with no reported infusio n reacti ons. The 2infusio n reacti ons observed were 
reported at the infusio n rate of 2mL/min.
The 5 ml/min infusio n rate for elotuzum ab will be utilized in this trial based on its safet y across

Thephase 3 study  (MM- 003/NIMBUS® trial) evaluated the combinat ion of pomalidomi de with 
low-dose dexamethasone vs high -dose dexamethasone in refractory  or relapsed and refractory  MM 
subjects. A total  of 302 pati ents were randomly assi gned to receive pom alidom ide plus low-dose 
dexamethasone and 153 high -dose dexamethasone. 
Pomalidomi de was dosed at 4 mg orally on Days 1-21 of  each 28 day cycle and dexamethasone 
was given at a low dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, orally or at a high dose of 40mg/day
on da ys 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20, orally .Treatment continued until disease progressi on or 
unacceptable toxicit y. The primary  endpoint of the study was progressi on-free survival (PFS).
Efficacy data from this phase 3 study  shows that median PFS with pomalido mide plus low-dose 
dexamethasone was 4.0 months (95% CI 3.6–4.7) versus 1.9 months (1.9–2.2) with high-dose 
dexamethasone (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.39–0.60]; p<0.0001) favoring the pomalidomide plus low

pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone group than in the high dose dexamethasone group 
(12.7 months [95% CI 10.4–15.5] vs 8.1 months [6.9–10.8]; HR 0.74 [0.56 –0.97]; p=0.0285).

Phase [ADDRESS_508303] Line Myelo ma
An ongoing phase 2 study  single arm is evaluating the safet y and efficacy of a similar PD-1 
inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in 
relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma pat ients.
Of the first 24 pati ents, 75% had pri or autol ogous transplantation and 96% were refractory  to last 
therapy . All patientshad received both IMiD s and Proteosom e inhibitors; 75% were double 
refractory  to both IMiD s and Proteosom e inhibitors and additional 21% were refractory  to 
lenalido mide alone. Patients had received a median of 3 lines of prior th erapy  (range: 1-6). The 
median time fro m MM di agnosis to study  entry  was 4 years (range: 1.2 -15).
Preliminary safet y and efficacy data for the first 24 subjects demonstrated no infusio n-related 
reacti ons. Hematol ogic toxicities (grade 3) were neutropeni a (29%), lymphopenia (17%) and 
thrombocy topenia (8%). Non-hematol ogic adverse events included (Grade 2; 3): 
fatigue (n=12; 1), constipation (n=10; 0), dyspnea (n=9; 2), itching (n=6; 0), muscle spasms (n=6; 
0), infect ion(n=4; 3), hyperglycemia (n=5; 0), edema (n= 4; 0), fever(n=3; 0), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_3116](n=2 ; 
1), rash (n=3; 1) and hypotension (n=3; 0). Events of clinical significance, autoimmune mediated, 
included hypothy roidism (n=2), transaminit is (n=2), and pneumo nitis(n=1). Four patients had 
pomalidomide dose reductions due to rash, neutropenia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_403274]. Two patients 
died; one af ter cy cle 1 (progressive disease) and one during cycle 2(sepsis). Objective responses 
(modified IMWG criteria) were observed in 11 of 22 evaluable patients (50%) including: near 
complete response (n=3), very good partial response (n=2), partial response (n=6); additionally, 
3patients had minimal response, 6 had stable disease and 2 progressed. At a median follow up of 
16 weeks; 17 of 22 patients continued on the study. 
Phase 1 Tri al of PD-1 Inhibitor with Lenalido mide in Myelo ma
Another ongoing phase 1 study  combining the PD1 inhibitor pembro lizumab with lenalido mide 
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma has demonstrated a 
tolerable safet y profile of the PD1 inhibitor and IMiDcombinat ion. Am ong the fi rst 17 evaluable 
subjects, sixteen (94%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) of any grade related to study 
treatm ent and 10 (58%) experienced grade 3/[ADDRESS_508304] frequent treatm ent-related AEs were: 
thrombocy topenia (47%), neutropenia (41%), fatigue (29%), and anemia, hyperglycemia, and 
muscle spasms (23% each). No DLTs were observed in the 10-mg lenalido mide coho rt. In the 
25-mg lenalido mide cohort, 3 patients (3/13) experienced a dose-limit ing toxicity (DLT): 
neutropeni a (grade 3 and grade 4), infectious pneum onia (grade 3), and tumor lysis syndro me 
(grade 3) with hyperuricemia (grade 4). All patients recovered from the DLTs without treatm ent 
discontinuat ion. Based upon these data the MTD/MAD was defined as pembro lizumab 200mg 
fixed dose in combinat ion with lenalido mide 25 mg and low-dose dexamethasone 40mg. The 
preliminary efficacy  was also promising in this study  with 76% ORR reported so far.
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 12-Nov-[ADDRESS_508305] ically and clinically meaningfu l 
improvement over lenalido mide/dexamethasone alone in a phase [ADDRESS_508306] therapy .
In in vit ro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferat ion and induced apopto sis of
hematopoiet ic tumor cells. Addit ionally , pomalidomide inhibited the proliferat ion of
lenalido mide -resistant multiple myelo ma cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both
lenalido mide -sensi tive and lenalido mide -resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis.
Pomalidomi de enhanced T cell-and natural  killer (NK) cell-mediated immunit y and inhibited
producti on of  pro-inflammatory cytokin es (e g, TNF -and IL -6) by  [CONTACT_51920]20.
Since pomalido mide may enhance the activit y of NK cells, which are central to the main biological 
activit y of elotuzum ab, combining both drugs is likely to enhance elotuzum ab-mediated 
antibody -dependent cell-mediated cytotoxi city (ADCC) towards primary myelo ma cells in a 
similar way  to that observed wit h lenalido mide.
Figure 1.3.5 -1illustrates resul ts from pre-clinical data (Robbins et al, unpublished) showing the 
combinat ion of elotuzum ab wi th pom alidomi de +/ -dexamethasone (SCID -ICR mice wi th OPM2 
xenograft) i s similar to the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide that has been previously 
reported21. Therefore, in pre-clinical models of M M, the combin ation of 
elotuzum ab/po malidomide enhances the killing of SLAMF7+ myelo ma cells in vivo greater than 
either agent alone. Addit ionally, low doses of dexamethasone do not appear to impair NK function 
in this model and adds to the anti -myelo ma act ivity of the combinat ion in this model.

1.3.6 Rationale for combining Elotuzumab and Nivolumab in Multiple 
Myeloma 
It has been previously shown in pre-clinical models that elotuzumab activit y towards MM cells 
can be improved by [CONTACT_403310], either through agoni zing activating 
molecules or blocking inhibitory  molecules on the surface of NK cells22.Consistent with this 
rationale, PD -1 expressio n has been shown on both T cells and NK cells in bone marrow samples 
from MM patients, therefore blocking the PD-1/PD -L1 axis may also contribute to increased 
elotuzum ab activity towards killing myelo ma cells. Figure 1.3.6 -1shows that in pre-clinical  in 
vivo models, the combinat ion of elotuzum ab and a murine surrogate antibody of nivolumab 
demonstr ates enhanced reducti on of tumors in mice.23These resul ts were generated in a 
completely immune competent syngeneic mouse tumor model therefore the net anti -tumor activit y 
observed can be mediated by  [CONTACT_403311] (NK) a nd adaptive (T cell) immunit y.

1.6.1 Clinical Summary
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Nivolumab Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinet ics (PK) of nivolumab were studi ed in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 
10mg/kg administered as a single dose or as mult iple doses of nivo lumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geom etric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of 
distribut ion at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geom etric mean eliminat ion half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady -state concentrations o f nivo lumab were reached by 12 weeks 
when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accum ulation was approximately  3-fold. The 
exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10mg/kg 
administered every [ADDRESS_508308] on the CL 
of nivo lumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK analysis suggested 
no difference in CL of nivo lumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline tumor size, and 
hepat ic impairment.
Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtratio n rate (GFR), albumin and body  weight had 
an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. Addit ionally, PPK and 
exposure response analyses have been performed to support use of 240mg Q2 W do sing in addit ion 
to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. Using the PPK model, exposure of  nivo lumab at 240 mg flat dose 
was ident ical t o a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, which was the approximate media n 
body  weight in nivo lumab clinical trials (see Sect ion1.3.1.1 ).
Full details on the clinical pharmaco logy aspects of nivolumab can be found in the Invest igator 
Brochure.

with multiple myelo ma who experienced Grade 3 pneumo nia and Grade 3 pneumo nitis. There was 
1 DLT at the 3 m g/kg dose l evel in a pat ient with small lymphocy tic lymphom a who experienced 
Grade 3 hy pereosinophilia and Grade 3 diplopia. The MTD was not reached.
Adverse events were reported in 104 of 105 (99%) patients and Grade 3 events in 64 (61%) 
patients. Related AEs were reported in 72 (68.6%) patients. Those that occurred in more than 5% 
of patients included: fat igue (16.2%), rash (10.5%), pneumonit is (9.5%), pruritus (9.5%), diarrhea 
(8.6%), py rexia (8.6%), decreased appetite (7.6% ), thrombocytopenia (6.7%), l eukopenia (5.7%), 
lymphopenia (5.7%), hypocalcaemia (5.7%) and lipase increased (5.7%). Related Grade 3 events 
were reported in 23 (21.9%) patients; the most commo n of which was leukopenia that occurred in 
4 (3.8%) patients. twenty  five (23.8%) patients discontinued therapy due to AEs, 15 of which were 
related to study  therapy. A total of 37 (35.2%) patients died: 28due to disease, 8 due to other 
causes, and 1 due to drug toxi city. Drug -related pneum onitis was observed in 10 patients (9.5%): 
Seven pat ients had Grade 1 or 2 pneumonit is; 2 had Grade 3; one patient had Grade 4.
Preliminary efficacy  results in 27 relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma patients have 
demonstrated stable disease amo ng 63% of patients with the remainder progres sion on single agent

1.7 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is the second most prevalent blood cancer after non -Hodgkin lympho ma, 
represent ing 10% of hematol ogic malignancies. While recent advances in the use ofhigh-dose 
chemotherapy, targeted therapeuti cs, and stem  cell transplantati on have improved overall and 
event -free survival, the majorit y of patients with myel oma will relapse and disease progressi on is 
expected for all but asmall percentage24. The subjects treated in this trial will receive an 
anti-myeloma regimen of pomalidomide + dexamethasone which dem onstrated improvements in 
PFS, overall survival, andoverall response in patients with refractory  or relapsed and refractory 
multiple myelo ma, including patients with disease refractory  to both bortezomib and 
lenalido mide25.
Pomalidomi dehas gained U.S. FDA and EMA approval  in this popul ation of MM patients at a 
dose of [ADDRESS_508310] follow the Pomalido mide Global 
Pregnancy Prevent ion Plan for clinical trials(Appendix 6).All invest igators and subjects must 
fully comply with and participate in the pregnancy prevent ion program  in order to parti cipate in 
this trial.
Nivo lumab is approved in multiple solid tumor indicat ions based on its favorable benefit/risk 
assessment. In hematological malignancies including mult iple myelo ma, nivo lumab mo notherapy 
was generally well tolerated and toxicity profile was similar to that observed in solid tumors. 
Nivo lumab has the potential  for clinically relevant unique AEs potenti ally caused by [CONTACT_403314].: 03

inflammatory  mechanism. These include pulmo nary toxicity, hepatotoxicit y, diarrhea/co litis, 
endocrinopathies, and nephrotoxi city. To date, these unique AEs have been manageable with 
frequent monitoring, prom pt diagnosis, and initiation of corticosteroi ds, dose interrupti on, and 
adequate supportive care. The management algorithms of the immune related AEs are included in 
Appendix 5.
Emerging preliminary  data on safet y and efficacy  of the PD1 inhibitor pembro lizum ab in 
combinat ion with IMiDs (pom alidomide and lenalido mide) in relapsed/refractory  multiple 
myelo ma patients have demonstrated a clinical benefit and was well tolerated. Being a PD1 
inhibit or, nivolumab is expected to have an acceptabl e tolerance profile in combination with 
pomalidomide similar to that of pembro lizumab. 
Elotuzumab has proven activi ty in relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma patients in combinat ion 
with IMiD s. The addition of elotuzum ab to lenalido mide and low dose dexamethasone has 
signifi cantly pro longed the PFS compared to lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone.
Elotuzumab as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with immunomodulatory  agents such as
thalido mide or lenalido mide is well tolerated. Safety data from theongoing rando mized phase 3 
study  of lenalido mide and dexamethasone with or without elotuzumab in pat ients with relapsed or 
refractory  multiple myelo ma (Eloquent 2) has shown thatelotuzumab was well tolerated in 
combinat ion with lenalido mide/dexamethasone, with minimal incremental toxicit y and no new 
safet y signals. The safet y profile of elotuzumab was consistent across IMiD combinat ion studi es 
(thalido mide and lenalido mide). Key elotuzum ab adverse events have been infusio n related 
events26.These have all been managed by [CONTACT_403315]24 hours. The 
frequency  and intensit y of infusio n related adverse events has been mit igated with prem edicati ons, 
including corticosteroi ds, histamine -[ADDRESS_508311] non-overl appi[INVESTIGATOR_95611], the combinat ion of 
both drugs with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is not expected to increa se toxi cities.
Based on the above assessment, the potenti al benefi t of combining nivolumab and elotuzum ab 
with pomalidomi de and dexamethason eappears to outwei gh the potenti al risk. The overall 
risk/benefit assessment supports the evaluat ion of these combi nations in this setting.
It is possible that unforeseen or unant icipated adverse events may  occur. In order to minimize the 
overall risks to participat ing subjects, the protocol has inclusio n-exclusion criteria appropriate to 
the popul ation, and specific follow-up safet y assessments. Adverse events and serious adverse 
events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_403316]’s 
pharmacovigilance group to look for trends and safety  concerns. Addit ionally, to ensure subjects’ 
safet y, an independe nt Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC) will also be established to monitor the

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a phase 3 mu lticenter, randomized, open label study  designed to evaluate the clinical benefit  
and safety of the combinat ion therapy  of Nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (N-Pd 
the invest igational arm A), when com pared to pomalidomide and dexamethaso ne (Pd; the control 
armB) in subjects wi th relapsed and/or refractory  multiple myelo ma (rrMM). 
Up to Revised Protocol  01,the study  design included an exploratory  third arm evaluat ing the 
clinical benefit and the safet y of the combinat ion therapy of elotuzum ab, nivolumab, 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone (NE-Pd, the exploratory  arm-[arm C]) in the same patient 
popul ation. Addit ionally , subjects randomized to the Pd arm were allowed to cross over to this 
exploratory  NE-Pd arm at the time of progression. Cros s over was stopped as of [ADDRESS_508320] clinical benefit and do not m eet the study  discont inuat ion 
criteria. 
Initially, the study  was designed to enroll approximately 417 subjects for a total o f 348 subjects to 
be rando mized (assuming 20% screen failure rate) to N-Pd and Pd arms in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization wasperformed with the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: a) number of lines of prior 
therapy  (2 vs 3+); AND b) ISS stage (1- 2 vs 3).
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 12-Nov-[ADDRESS_508321] -2018, any addit ionalenrollment of CA209602 study was permanent ly closed due 
to the insufficient benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis of PFS. A total of 170 
subjects were rando mized into the study : [ADDRESS_508322] igator’s judge ment  
of continued clinical benefit. Study will be clo sed after all subjects complete safet y follow-up (i.e., 
[ADDRESS_508323] has discont inued study treatment).
The study  design schem atic is presented in Figure 3.1 -1.

Consult the Medi cal Moni tor for further guidance regarding alternat ive premedicat ions fo r subjects 
allergic or intol erant to any  premedicat ion or to determine if locally used equivalent medications 
are acceptable.
On weeks of elotuzum ab infusio n, the dexamethasone dose will be split into a PO and IV 
administration which will also serve as premedicatio n for elotuzum ab.
Intravenous and PO dexamethasone doses are calculated to provide a total dose that is 
bioequivalent to an oral dose of 40 mg (subjects who are 75 years old) or 20 mg (in subjects who 
are > 75 y ears ol d). (Dexam ethasone 8 m g IV i s approximately  bioequivalent to 11 mg PO).
In addition, the following must also be administered 45 to 90 minutes before initiating the

[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Elotuzumab Infusion in Subjects with Infusion Reactions
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Grade 1 Infusion Reaction
For Grade 1 elotuzum ab infusio n-related reactions, by [CONTACT_154020], do not require intervent ion. 
However, increased monitoring is reco mmended.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Grade 2 or 3 Infusion Reaction
Infusion reactions during the elotuzumab infusion : For a Grade [ADDRESS_508389] shoul d be treated as 
clinically indicated with one or more of  the following medicat ions or intervent ions: antiemetics, 
antihistamines, analgesics, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, oxygen inhalat ion, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated.
Once the elotuzum ab infusio n-related reaction has resolved to Grade 1, the infusio n can be 
restarted at 0.5 mL/minute. If symptom s do not recur after 30minutes, the infusio n rate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashio n (0.5 mL/minute every  30minutes or per investigator’s discretion ) 
to the rate at which the infusio n react ion occurred. If no recurrence of the infusio n react ion, the 
escalat ion regimen according to the table above can be resumed.
Subjects who experience an infusio n reaction require vital signs to be monitore d every 30 minutes 
for 1 or 2 hours after the end of the elotuzumab infusio n (or as clinically indicated per 
investigator’s discret ion). If the elotuzumab infusio n react ion recurs, the infusio n must be stopped 
and not restarted on that day . Appropri ate the rapy shoul d be administered to address the subject’s 
signs and symptoms. The infusio n can be reattempted at the next protocol defined infusio n time 
point at the invest igator’s discretion wit h additional premedicati on as described in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -
5.
Infusion reactions after the completion of elotuzumab infusion : Should a Grade 2or 3infusio n 
reacti on occur following completion of an elotuzumab infusio n, the subject shoul d be treated as 
above.
Elotuzumab infusions on subsequent weeks after a prior Grade 2 or 3 infusion reaction : 
Subjects with a priorGrade [ADDRESS_508390] the subsequent 
infusio n started at 0.5 mL/min. The infusio n rate may be escalated in a stepwi se fashion

Treatment recommendations are provi ded below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1symptom s: (mild react ion; infusion interrupti on not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicati ons are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_508394] 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusio n interruption but responds 
prom ptly to symptomat ic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):
Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect u ntil resolution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l [ADDRESS_508395] 30 minutes before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g of SoluCortef or equivalent) ma y be used.

4.5.3 Management Algorithms for Immune Related Adverse Events
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_53970] c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an immuno -oncol ogy agent 
in this protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with immuno -oncol ogy 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been devel oped to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing t he fo llowing groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above al gorithms are found in Appendix [ADDRESS_508396] igator Brochure.
4.5.4 Dose Delay, Interruption, or Discontinuation, All Subjects
If the dose of one drug in the regimen (ie, pomalido mide, dexamethasone, nivolumab or 
elotuzum ab) is interrupted, or discont inued, the treatm ent with the other drugs may continue as 
scheduled. However, if dexamethasone is interrupted or discontinued discuss o ngoing elotuzumab 
administration with the medical mo nitor (applicable for NE -Pd arm only).
Each cycle is 28 days. While dose delays (within the allowed window determined below for 
nivolumab and elotuzum ab) or interruptions are permitted, the start of each cycle cannot be 
delayed and is fixed (ie, anchored) relative to Cycle [ADDRESS_508397] is unable to start

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy endpoints will be based on analysis o f serum and ur ine electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), 
sFLC (for those wi th sFLC only disease ), corrected cal cium (serum calcium and serum albumin), 
imaging and bone marrow assessments, all at predefined intervals as specified in Table 5.1-1, 
Table 5.1-2,Table 5.1-3andTable 5.1-4. Assessments done at local labs versus central  labs are 
indicated in Table 5.1 -1, Table 5.1 -2, Table 5.1 -3, and Table 5.1 -4. Assessments for SPEP, UPEP 
and sFLC will be based on central lab results, whereas assessments of bone marrow, bone lesio ns, 
extram edullary  plasmacy tomas, and corrected calcium will be based on local analysis at the site.
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
IMWG Response criteria in Appendix 3will be used for the efficacy analysis. For the purposes of 
this study , all subjects’ tumor assessments by [CONTACT_403326] (SPEP M protein and 
UPEP M protein quant ificat ion, corrected calcium (calcium and albumin), and serum free light 
chain) should be re -evaluated per the protocol -stated frequency relat ive to the date of first dose of 
study  drug until confirmed disease progression based on Appendix 3, irrespective of dose delays 
or treatm ent cycle. If subject does not have documented disease progression as defined in 
Appendix 3at the time of study drug discontinuation, then disease assessments must continue 
to be performed according to the same schedule described above until confirmed disease 
progression even if a subsequent anti-myeloma treatment is initiated prior to disease 
progression confirmation . Subjects will be followed every 12 weeks, or more frequent ly, after 
disease progressi on for survival, subsequent myelo ma therapy , and devel opment of second 
primary  malignancy.
All efficacy  laboratory  assessments (SPEP, UPEP, serum/urine immunofixat ion, and sFLC) 
shoul d be done through the central laboratory, except corrected calcium (serum calcium and seru m 
albumin), and bone marrow assessments for plasma cell percentag e and light chain restri ction 
(clonali ty by [CONTACT_182470]). All bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403288].: 03

disease assessment shoul d be assessed locally .  
For any  SPEP, UPEP, or 
sFLC assessment performed locally, in lieu of a central  lab assessment, (ie, if the subject cannot 
complete a visit at the study siteafter treatm ent discontinuat ion), M protein abso lute quantificat ion 
(eg, g/dL or g/L) or sFLC (eg, mg/L or mg/dL) must be performed. Any laboratory  samples 
analyzed locally, including for efficacy, must be entered on the appropriate CRF/eCRF as 
requested by  [CONTACT_403327].

Elotuzumab may be detected in the serum  protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixat ion assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response 
classificat ion.A small  peak in the earl y gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ on serum 
immunofixat ion may potentially be attributed to elotuzum ab, particularly in patients whose 
endogenous myelo ma protein is IgA, IgM, IgD, or lambda light chain restricted. This interference 
can impact the determ ination of complete response and possi bly relapse from complete response 
in patients with IgG kappa myelo ma protein. It is likely  that nivolumab may also be detected by 
[CONTACT_403328]. Serum  or peripheral bloo d samples, 
collected during the study, may be analyzed for the presence of mo noclonal  antibody  interference.

5.4.3 Imaging Assessments for Myeloma
[IP_ADDRESS] Skeletal Survey
Skeletal survey , by [CONTACT_403333] , for metastati c disease will be performed within 
28days of rando mizat ion in all subjects. Skeletal survey will be performed on study  if clinically 
indicated (development of com pressi on fracture does not excl ude response). Use of conventi onal 
or low dose CT scan (i e, of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) or MRI bone survey  is acceptable. If imaging is perform ed 
on treatm ent for assessment of progression, the site must use the same modalit y of imaging as used 
in screening. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic shoul d be 
recorded on the eCRF. On treatm ent survey shoul d record whether there is an increase in the
number or size of ly tic lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
Com puted tomography  or MRI should be performed at screening, if clinically  indicated or if 
patient had a previous extramedullary  or bone pl asmacy toma. To minimize unnecessary radia tion 
in myelo ma subjects where progression is primarily based on serum and urine M -protein, on study 
assessments shoul d only be performed if clinically  indicated (ie, pain, concern for disease

progression), whether or not present at baseline . In subjects w ith baseline plasmacyto ma, imaging 
follow-up shoul d be done regul arly per invest igator’s discretion . Imaging confirmat ion of 
disappearance of plasmacy toma is requi red at time of CR/sCR if it was not confirmed before .
A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perpendicular diameter for all 
measurable lesions will be calculated at screening. This sum will be used as the reference for on 
study  assessments by  [CONTACT_403334].
All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. All docum ented measurable and 
non-measurable lesions are to be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used for 
tumor response evaluati on, including the baseline assessment, m ust be perf ormed using the same 
method for repeat assessment. CT and MRI scanning are the preferable methods of assessment. 
Conventional CT and MRI shoul d be performed with contiguous cuts of 10mm or less or with 
cuts of 5  (or 10) mm if spi[INVESTIGATOR_182447]. Imaging- based evaluat ion is preferred to 
evaluat ion by [CONTACT_198278]. Evaluat ion by [CONTACT_13190] x-ray is less preferable than CT or MRI, 
and should only be used for well -defined lesio ns surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. Clinical examinat ion 
is only acceptable when lesio ns are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymph node. Skin 
lesions must be docum ented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acceptable for 
docum entati on of  measurable disease.
Duplicate copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] o f all imaging studies used for tumor response evaluat ion will be made available 
for review by [CONTACT_117605].
Measurable disease are lesio ns that can be accurately measured in [ADDRESS_508477] be [ADDRESS_508478] scanning or [ADDRESS_508479] twice the slice thickness.
Non-measurable disease are all other lesio ns (or sites of disease), including those that are too small 
(ie, do not meet above criteria), occur within a previously irradiated area (unless they are 
docum ented as new lesio ns since the completion of radiation therapy), bone lesions, 
leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusi on (exception for effusions 
docum ented by [CONTACT_403335]), lymphangit is 
cutis/pulm onis, abdominal masses that are not pathol ogically/cy tologically confi rmed and 
followed by [CONTACT_15218], and cyst ic lesio ns.
5.4.4 Definitions of Response and Progression Criteria
See Appendix 3for definit ions ofresponse and progression. All criteria are derived from 
IMWG32,33,34. All response and progressi on categori es require 2 consecutive assessments to 
confirm response and progression before init iation of any new therapy.
NB: Table in Appendix 3 is inclusive ofmultip leresponse category  definit ions; however, the 
protocol /CRF is not reporting on all of these response categori es.

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any

unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnormallaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
advers e events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject . (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorit ies and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws includin g European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)

Second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be collected throughout the study  which includes 
assessments during survival  follow-up. All SP Ms that occur during thescreening period and within 
60days of discontinuation of dosing will be reported as an SAE regardless of relat ionship to study

will be reported as an SAE. All other SPMs will be collected and reported on a separate CRF page.
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated
mechanism or immune -mediated co mponent for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion

COMMITTEES
An independent data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is
treated to provide oversight of safet y and study conduct. The DMC will review safet y and efficac y 
data at periodic intervals.
The first comprehensive safet y review will occur after the first 42 treated subjects (ie,the first 
6subjects in the exploratory arm) have been fo llowed for 1 month
An independent review commit tee (IRC) had been set up to review blinded responses and 
progression criteria in each subject. However, after enrollment was discont inued, it was decided 
to discont inue efficacy assessment by [CONTACT_55543].

Prior to Revised Protocol 02, the study  planned to rando mize 406 subjects at a 3:3:[ADDRESS_508493] oratory  NE-Pd arm  upon progressi on. As of  1 September 2017, cross -over wasno longer 
permitted and as of Revised Protocol 02, the explo ratory  NE-Pd arm  was cl osed to enrollment.
In Revised Protocol  02, the planned sample size for thi s study  was revised toapproximately 348 
rando mized subjects rando mized at a 1:[ADDRESS_508494] at the overall 
alpha level of 0.05 (two -sided) with 90% power with twointerim analys es, with the first one for 
early  futility and the second for efficacy .
The study requires at least 262 PFS events to ensure that a two-sided 5% type I error sequent ial 
test procedure with twointerim analys es will have 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.667, corresponding to a median PFS of [ADDRESS_508495] versi on 6.3 was used for sample size/power computation.

Interim Analysis for PFS Futilit y 
At FDA’s request on 21- June-2018, a formal PFS interim analysis for futilit y was conducted in 
August 2018 based on the database lock on 12 -April-2018. The investi gator assessed progression 
events (NPd and Pd arms) were used in this analysis. Prior to runni ng the fut ility analysis, a fut ility 
criteria was defined based on condit ional power assuming 85 events (30% informat ion fraction).  
The stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_403293] 1%. This woul dcorrespond to a HR (NPd vs. Pd) boundary  of 0.995 and the

true (HR = 0.667), there is st ill 67.8% chance that the study  will be posi tive at the final analysis. 
Subsequently, after conducting the interim analysis, the decisi on was made to permanently

APPENDIX 1 DEFINITION OF L INES OF THERAPY
Line of Therapy (from Internati onal Myel oma Working Group (Raj kumar, 2011)) is defined as 
one or more cycles of a planned treatment program . This may consist of one or more planned 
cycles of single -agent therapy  or combinat ion therapy, as well as a sequence of treatm ents 
administered in a planned manner. For example , a planned treatm ent approach of induct ion 
therapy  followed by [CONTACT_403346], followed by [CONTACT_182482] . Each subsequent line of therapy  starts when a planned course of therapy is 
modified to include other treatm ent agents (alone or in combinat ion) as a resul t of disease 
progression, relapse, or toxicity. A new line of therapy also starts when a planned period of 
observat ion off therapy  is interrupted by  a need for addi tional treatm ent for the disease.

APPENDIX 3 DEFINITIONS OF RESPONSE AND PROGRESSION CRITERIA
NB: The table below is inclusive of multiple response category definitions; however, the  
protocol/CRF is not reporting on all of th ese response categories. The standard IMWG  
response criteria have been limited to the eligible patient population in the study.
Table 1: IMWG criteria for response assessment including criteria for 
minimal residual disease
Response SubcategoryResponse criteriaa
IMWG MRD criteria (requires a complete response as defined below)
Sustained MRD-
negativeMRD negativity in the marrow (NGF or NGS, or both) and by [CONTACT_385918], confirmed minimum of 1 year apart. Subsequent evaluations can be used to 
further specify the duration of negativity (eg, MRD-negative at 5 years)b
Flow MRD-negativeAbsence of phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_403295] (or validated equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of [ADDRESS_508521]-
negativeAbsence of clonal plasma cells by [CONTACT_128754][INVESTIGATOR_385823] 
a clone is defined as less than two identical sequencing reads obtained after DNA 
sequencing of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128715] (or validated 
equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of [ADDRESS_508522] negativity as defined by [CONTACT_403347] a preceding PET/CT or decrease to less 
mediastinal blood pool SUV or decrease to less than that of surrounding normal 
tissuec
Standard IMWG response criteria
Stringent complete
responseComplete response as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal 
cells in bone marrow biopsy by [CONTACT_9064] ( κ/λ ratio ≤4:1 or ≥1:2 forκ 
and λ patients, respectively, after counting ≥100 plasma cells)d
Complete responsee Negative immunofix ation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403296] M-pro tein detectable by [CONTACT_403348] ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level < 100 mg per 24 h
Partial response≥50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by 
≥90% or to < 200 mg per 24 h;
If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels  is required in place of the M-protein 
criteria;
If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, and serum-free light assay is also 
unmeasurable, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M-protein,
provided baseline bone marrow plasma-cell percentage was ≥30%. In addition to 
these criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD)fof soft tissue

plasmacytomas is also required
Minimal response25% but 49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24- h urine M -protein 
by 50 –89%. In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a 50% 
reductio n in the size (SPD)fof soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required
Stable diseaseNotrecommended for use as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best 
described by [CONTACT_385921] -to-progression estimates. Not meeting criteria for
complete response, very good partial response, partial response, minimal response, or 
progress ive disease
Progressive diseasegAny one or more of the following criteria:
1.Increase of 25% from lowest confi rmed response value in one or more of the 
following criteria:
a)Serum M -protein (absolute increase must be 0.5 g/dL);
b)Serum M -protein increase 1g/dL, if the lowest M component was 5 
g/dL;
c)Urine M -protein (absolute increase must be 200 mg/24 h);
d)In patients without measurable serum and u rine M -protein levels, the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase 
must be >10 mg/dL);
2.Appearance of a new lesion(s), 50% increase from nadir in SPDfof > 1 lesion, 
or 50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion > 1 cm in short 
axis;
IMWG=International Myel oma Working Group. MRD=minimal residual disease. NGF= next-generation flow. 
NGS=next -generation sequencing. FLC=free light chain. M -protein=myeloma protein. SPD=sum of the products of 
the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions. FCM=flow cytometry . SUV max=maximum standardised 
uptake value. MFC=mul tiparameter flow cytometr y. 18F-FDG PET=18F -fluorodeoxyglucose PET. 
aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made any time before starting any new 
therapy ; for MRD there is no need for two consecutive assessments, but information on MRD after each 
treatment stage is recommended (eg, after induction, high-dose therapy /ASCT, consolidation, maintenance). 
MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of suspected complete response.  All categories of response and 
MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. 
However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy  these response requirements except for the requirement 
of FDG PET if imaging MRD -negative status is reported. Each category, except for stable disease, will be 
considered unconfirmed until the confirmatory test is performed. The date of the initial test is considered as the 
date of response for evaluation of time dependent outcomes such as duration of response.
bSustain ed MRD negativity  when reported should also annotate the method used (eg, sustained flow MRD -
negative, sustained sequencing MRD -negative).
cCriteria used by [CONTACT_403349],2and expert panel (IMPetUs; Italian Myeloma criteria for PET Use).3, [ADDRESS_508523] two consecutive slices. Alternatively, an 
SUVmax=2·[ADDRESS_508524] areas >1 cm in size, or SUVmax=1·[ADDRESS_508525] areas [ADDRESS_508526] negativity  is determined by [CONTACT_403350].

dPresence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the //L ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio 
by [CONTACT_403351] a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abno rmal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.
eWhen the only method to measure disease is by [CONTACT_403352]: complete response can be defined as a normal 
FLC ratio of 0·26 to 1·65 in addition to the complete response criteria listed previously. Very good partial 
response in such patients requires a 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvo lved FLC 
levels
fPlasmacy toma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT 
scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. 
Measurement of tumou r size will be determined by [CONTACT_403353] n alone in a patient previously classified as achieving a complete response will not be 
considered progression. In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (eg, a 
possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.

A FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally  postm enopausal 
(amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potenti al) forat least 24 
consecut ive months (ie, has had menses at any  time in the preceding 24 consecut ive months).
2.1.2 Definition of Females Not of Childbearing Potential
Females who do not meet the above definit ion of FCBP should be classified as FNCBP.

 A MULTICENTER, RANDO MIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PLACEBO -CONTROLLED 
STUDY EVALUATING THE  EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF MLD10 IN T HE 
PREVENTION OF MIGRAINE HEADACHE IN ADULT S 
 
INDICATION 
For the prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults 
 
STUDY PURPOSE  
• To evaluate the daily use of MLD10 and placebo for the treatment of migraine, as 
measured by [CONTACT_25418] 3 months. 
• To compare daily use of MLD10 and placebo as measured by: 
- change in the quantitative and qualitative aspects of migraine headaches from baseline, during treatment, and at the conclusion of a
 3-month treatment period. 
- safety and tolerability measures in migraine headache subjects through the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and clinical chemistry values.  
 SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi- center study.  Subjects agreeing to 
participate in the study and meet the entry criteria assessed at the screening visit, will begin a [ADDRESS_24340] generated randomization schedule.  Approximately 142 subjects (71 subjects per arm) will be randomized and enter the treatment phase receivi ng MLD10 or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_24341] study medication adherence, pain severity, headache symptoms, acute medication usage, and unusual symptoms. Serum samples will be collected and analyzed for ionized Mg, electrolytes, and creatinine.  
 The study consists of 5 visits: Baseline Period:  Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline Period)  
Treatment Period:  Visit 2 (Randomization/Treatment Period Month 1) 
 Visit 3 (Treatment Period Month 2)  
 Visit 4 (Treatment Period Month 3) 
 Visit 5 (Final Visit)  
 
POPULATION SAMPLE  
Subjects in the study are those: 
• who have at least a 3 month history of 3-14 migraines, with or without aura, as 
defined by [CONTACT_25419] (ICHD) - 3 beta 
(Appendix 1) or treat with a ergot or triptan and received relief.  
• who received a diagnosis of migraine before age 50. 
• who have used acute headache medication 14 or fewer days per month in the previous 3 months. 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/[ADDRESS_24342] MLD10 as follows: 2 MLD10 caplets, oral, 
twice daily or placebo caplets as follows: 2 placebo caplets, oral, twice daily.  
 
BACKGROUND & STUDY RATIONALE  
Magnesium is frequently used in the treatment and prevention of migraine, though there are relatively few clinical trials supporting its efficacy.  While there is a sound scientific rationale for magnesium as a migraine preventative, different forms of magnesium differ significantly in their solubility and bioavailability.  In addition, there are challenges in measuring bioactive magnesium levels in the body.  Consequently, a discussion of the efficacy of magnesium needs to be specific to the formulation of magnesium being studied, its ability to be adequately absorbed, and phy siologically active.  
 Magnesium is recognized to block the N- methyl -D-aspartate ion -dependent channel.  Low levels 
of magnesium increase the sensitivity of the NMDA receptor to glutamate.  Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter and is considered central to the development of cortical spreading depression.  In addition, glutamate is considered to play an excitatory role in the hyper- vigilant 
migraine nervous system.  Thus, magnesium properly utilized physiologically has significant potential to protect the nervous system from migraine. 
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To compare the change from baseline to treatment period months 1, 2, and 3 in the 
number of migraine headache days of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo.   
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
To compare change from baseline of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period: 
• the number of headache days 
• the average headache duration  
• pain severity at headache onset 
• the use of acute medications 
• Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores  
• Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) 
• Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
 
EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES  
To compare the change from baseline of subjects treating with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period. 
• migraine with aura days  
• serum ionized magnesium  
 SAFETY OBJECTIVES  
Safety assessments will include monitoring the parameters during the length of the study.  
• adverse events  
• physical examination  
• urine pregnancy tests for all females of childbearing potential  
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16

 • vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight 
• Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• concomitant medications  
• clinical chemistry measurements

 STUDY MEDICATION RANDOMIZATION  
Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive magnesium L -lactate dehydrate (243 mg of 
elemental mg++ BID for a total of 486mg daily) or placebo at Visit 2.  If at any time during the 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/[ADDRESS_24354] withdrawals from the study, they will be instruc ted to return all used packaging 
and unused medication.   
Group A  
Subjects randomized to MLD10 (Group A) will be dispensed a 28 day supply of 
magnesium L -lactate dehydrate 10 mEq (121.5 mg of elemental mg++ caplets) for 
daily treatment.  A total of 120 caplets will be given each time at Visit 2, 3, and 4.  Additional overage will be given to account for the 3 day window.  Subjects will be instructed to take two caplets of study medication BID at about the same time each day (i.e. 8AM & 8PM for a total of 486mg’s of elemental mg++ per day).  Subjects will be instructed regarding storage requirements and will be asked to return all used/partially used/unused medication containers at the next office visit.   
Group B  
Subjects randomized to placebo (Group B) will be dispensed a 28 day supply of 
matching placebo for daily treatment.  A total of 120 caplets will be given each time at Visit 2, 3, and 4.  Additional overage will be given to account for the 3 day window.  Subjects will be instructed to take two caplets  of study medication BID at about the 
same time each day (i.e. 8AM & 8PM).  Subjects will be instructed regarding storage requirements and will be asked to return all used/partially used/unused medication containers at the next office visit.  
 
RESCUE MEDICATION 
Subjects will be instructed they may take their investigator approved rescue medications for 
headaches, if needed.  Rescue medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the headache diary.  
 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator. Concomitant medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the concomitant medication form.  
 Routine medications, including migraine preventative medications, should be maintained on a stable dose and regimen for the duration of the study period.  Additionally, any concomitant chronic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_25410] a stable dose and dose regimen during the study. 
 
 Allowed Medications  
1. All acute migraine medications currently taken by [CONTACT_25421] [ADDRESS_24355] agrees to continue at that dose throughout the study.   
 Prohibited Medications  
Any medication containing magnesium 30 days prior to screening.  
 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/[ADDRESS_24356] diary data for the previous day (24 hour period).  If a subject does not experience a headache in the previous [ADDRESS_24357]’s diaries may vary day to day based on their responses.  Subjects will be asked to document all headaches exper ienced regardless of severity for one month.  All subjects should 
have at least 80% compliance with diary completion throughout the length of the study.  Subjects will record headache severity, symptoms, use of acute medications, as well as additional questions as required.  Headache severity will be subjectively rated by [CONTACT_25422]: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, or severe pain.  These ratings will be collected at pre- defined 
time points.       
 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
If a subject has an unscheduled visit, the unscheduled visit form must be completed.  If the visit occurs for safety reasons, all relevant safety data should be captured and reported on the appropriate forms.  If the unscheduled visit results in an early termination, all applicable final study visit procedures will be performed and the early termination form will need to be completed as well.  
 
BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
At randomization (Visit 2), neither the subject nor the investigator will be aware to which 
treatment group the subject has been assigned.  If needed, for safety and proper treatment of the subject, the investigator can unblind the subject’s treatment assi gnment to determine which 
treatment has been assigned and institute appropriate follow-up care.  When possible, Clinvest should be notified prior to unblinding study medication.     Individual unblinding envelopes are shipped with study medication.  Each s tudy medication kit 
has a corresponding unblinding envelope.  Unblinding will include matching the kit and unblinding envelope with the subject drug number.  To unblind a subject without breaking the blind for remaining subjects’ treatment the following instructions described below will be followed: 
 
• Obtain the security envelope containing the unblinding envelopes. 
• Remove the unblinding envelope with the study drug number corresponding with the study medication kit dispensed to the subject. 
• Break the seal o f the unblinding envelope and remove the subjects’ treatment label. 
• Return the subjects’ treatment label to the unblinding envelope. 
• Return the unblinding envelope to the security envelope. 
• Document on the unblinding form located in the eAdmin Binder.  
• Email copy of unblinding form to [EMAIL_406] within 24 hours of unblinding. 
• Complete and email or fax the Sterling IRB, unanticipated problem report form, to Sterling IRB within 10 business days of unblinding.

 DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY 
All subjects who withdraw from the study, for any reason, must return all study medication and 
supplies to the investigator or his/her delegate at the first available opportunity.   Subjects may withdraw at any time or be dropped from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Clinvest if he/she violates the study plan or for administrative and/or safety reasons.  When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable activities scheduled for the final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation, as well as the completion of the early termination form and unscheduled visit form (if appropriate).  Any adverse experiences which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accor dance with the safety requirements 
outlined in the adverse event reporting section of this protocol.   
 
REPORTING PREGNANCY  
Although not considered an adverse event, if a female of childbearing potential becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator will notify Clinvest and Pharmalyte Solutions LLC by [CONTACT_25423].  The subject will not receive any further treatment and will be withdrawn from the study.  The subject should be followed for [ADDRESS_24358] 6 -8 weeks following the report of pregnancy, before 
being exited from the study.  The investigator will (1) notify the subject’s physician that the subject was being treated with an investigational drug MLD10 and (2 ) follow the progress of the 
pregnancy until delivery.  The investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide a copy of the documentation to Clinvest.  
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator will be responsible for the detection, collection, and evaluation of all events 
meeting the definition of an adverse event (AE).  An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study product.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not related to the study product.    An adverse event observed after the initial dose of the study product will be considered a “treatment -emergent adverse event”.  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be analyzed and 
discussed in the clinical study rep ort for this study.  Adverse event terms should include a 
diagnosis, as available, in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms.  If a diagnosis is not possible, each sign and symptom should be recorded as an individual adverse event.    All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug, must be completely documented on the appropriate adverse event eCRF (electronic case report form) page.  If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event, this must also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages.    The site staff must record all directly observed AEs and all spontaneously reported AEs.  At each visit, the site staff will ask the subject a non -specific question (e.g., “Have you noticed any

visit.   
 
Non-Serious Adverse Event (NSAE)  
NSAE’s will be collected beginning after the first dose of study medication or within [ADDRESS_24360]’s 
condition at Visit 2.  These include physical findings, clinical signs and symptoms, or sequelae.  Any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition w hich is temporally associated with the use of 
the provided product, is also considered to be an adverse event.  Events such as medical/surgical procedures or anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing 
conditions present at screening that do not worsen are not considered NSAE’s.  All NSAE’s noted will be captured on the non-serious adverse events eCRF.  Information captured will include start date/time, end date/time, severity, relationship of causality to study drug, course of action taken, and out come.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurring after signing of the informed 
consent and until cessation of the study which: 
1. results in death. 2. is life threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the defin ition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.).  
3. requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411].  
4. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. 
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25412].  These should also be considered serious. 
SAE’s will be reported in compliance with all applicable safety reporting requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.  SAE’s assessed as life threatening or death “possibly related to the study medication” will be reported to Clinvest, Pharmalyte Solutions LLC, and Sterling IRB within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_464].  All other SAE’s (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, congenital anomaly, and an important medical event) will be reported to Clinvest, Pharmalyte Solutions, and Sterling 
IRB within [ADDRESS_24361].    Included in the SAE Report Form will be an assessment of the causal relationship between the Pharmalyte Solutions LLC Materials and the SAE.  SAE’s will be followed

 SAFETY MEASURES  
 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. All reported AEs 
will be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
 
Physical Examination 
At screening and study exit, the investigator will examine the patient for any 
detectable abnormalities of the following body systems: general appearance; neck (including thyroid); head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lungs; heart/cardiovascular; abdomen; neurologic; extremities; back; musculoskeletal; lymphatic; skin; and other. The neurologic examination should be conducted to detect the presence of any significant sensory/motor abnormalities. A digital rectal examination is not required. Gynecological examinations are not required.  
 
Weight should be measured at screening, day 1, and each subsequent office visit using the same scale for all patients at a given investigator site when possible.  
 
Pregnancy tests for all females of childbearing potential.  Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted at screening, on day 1, and each subsequent office visit to confirm continued non-pregnant status prior to study drug administration or study completion.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be collected for clinical laboratory testing at Visits 2 -5 for all 
patients qualifying f or randomization.  Non-fasting blood samples (approximately 
10 mL for Electrolytes, Creatinine, and Ionized Magnesium) should be collected using standard laboratory instructions and procedures provided by [CONTACT_25437].   
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at screening, day 1, and each subsequent office visit. 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate over [ADDRESS_24369] (seated) for at least 2 minutes. Blood pressure should be recorded in mmHg. Pulse rate should be measured in beats per minutes.  
 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS will be conducted at the screening visit and each subsequent office 
visit.  The C- SSRS is a semi -structured interview designed to assess t he severity 
and intensity of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and non- suicidal self -
injurious behavior over a specified time period (e.g., prior year, since last visit). The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on 5 “yes” or “no” questions (plus a description if answered “yes”) arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers “yes” to either question 1 or 2, the intensity of ideation will then be assessed in 5 additional questions relating to the frequency, duration, 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/[ADDRESS_24370] severe ideation. Suicidal 
behavior is then assessed by [CONTACT_25438], aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non-suicidal self -injurious behavior. The interview is used in full only if the initial 
questions are positive; this assessment is completed at all scheduled clinic visits at which other clinical assessments are to be carried out.   
  
If any item(s) on the C -SSRS are answered with “yes”, a clinician 
investigator must review patient’s responses in order to:  
a) at screening and baseline determine patient’s study eligibility and potential need for referral to a mental health professional AND  
b) during the study evaluate patient’s need for appropriate medical management such as referral to a mental health professional.  
 
A significant risk of suicide is defined as a “yes” in answer to:  
a) questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation section; OR b) any questions on any item in the suicidal behavior section.  
This must be reported as a serious adverse event and followed up accordingly.  Additionally, if a patient responds “yes” to any of the suicidal ideation questions 1 to 3, a clinician investigator should apply clinical judgment to determi ne the need 
for reporting as an adverse event or serious adverse event and the need for any referral.  
 SUMMARY OF METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION  
Data required for the evaluation of the primary and some secondary measures will be recorded by [CONTACT_25439] a daily e -diary.  The following data will be collected daily with the e -diary 
(subject instructions and training for completion of the e-diary will be provided): 
• Estimated total duration of headache that day (if no headache, subject will report 0 hours) 
• Severity of headache at the time of onset (mild, moderate, or severe) only for subjects who report a headache duration > 0)  
• Acute headache pain medication(s) usage  
• Study medication usage 
• Unusual symptoms 
 
Should a subject skip a day of e- diary entry, the subject will be able to provide the missing 
information for up to 1 calendar day.  The e-dairy should not be completed on the day of the office visit; the last e -dairy entry for the preceding period should be completed the day prior to 
the office visit.   
Questionnaire data required to be directly collected from subject will be obtained at each appropriate visit using an electronic device as defined in the protocol.  Questionnaires are to be completed by [CONTACT_25440], not from family, friends, or the study support personnel.    
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
23 
 Questionnaire data required to be collected directly from clinicians will be obtained at the 
appropriate visit and recorded in the eCRF per protocol.   
 
STATISTI CAL ANALYSIS  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into the treatment groups.  Randomization will not include any type of stratification.    An alpha of .05 will be used for statistical significance. All statistical tests will be two -sided.  All 
data will be analyzed using JMP (SAS Institute, Inc.).    Descriptive statistics will establish baseline characteristics and adverse event frequency.  Data for the primary endpoint will be statistically  analyzed via a repeated measures ANCOVA 
controlling for ionized serum Mg levels.  Data for each of the secondary outcome measures will be statistically analyzed for both within and between group changes via a 2- tailed Repeated 
Measures ANOVA and/or independent or dependent t- tests as appropriate.  All ANOVAs will be 
followed by [CONTACT_25441]- hoc tests as appropriate. Multiple comparison adjustments will be 
made if needed.  
 An interim analysis will be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_24371] secondary endpoint of migraine and headache day reduction will be assessed at the time of the interim analysis, as well as adverse events for safety purposes.     
 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population (mITT) 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population will include all randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug and obtained at least one endpoint measurement 
(mean change from baseline in the number of hours with headaches) after treating.  The mITT population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
 
 Safety Population 
The safety p opulation will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study drug (active or placebo).  
 
A last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be utilized to impute missing values for 
subjects continuing in the study, but missing values for this analysis.  This type of imputation replaces the missing value with the last observation value obtained.  Baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method will be used if a subject discontinues the study.  Thus, if a subject has a missing value at month [ADDRESS_24372] will be considered a non-responder.   
 
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
To compare the mean change from baseline in the frequency of migraine headache days per 28 -
day period ending with the cessation of treatment period month 3 in subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo.  
 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
24 
 A migraine headache day will be defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) with 4 or more hours 
of migraine headache, fulfilling ICHD- 3 beta criteria, and/or any headache of any duration with 
the use of migraine- specific acute medications(s) (i.e. ergot alkaloids, ergot co mbinations, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], triptans, combination analgesics [simple analgesics combined with opi[INVESTIGATOR_25414]]).   
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
1. To compare change from baseline of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo on 
the following parameters during or after a 3 month treatment period: 
• the frequency of headache days  
• the average headache duration after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment 
• reduction of pain severity at the time of headache onset  
• the use of acute medications after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment 
• Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores at Visits 2 and 5  
• Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) at Visit 5  
• Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Visit 5 
2. To assess the safety and tolerability of magnesium -L-lacate- dihydrate versus placebo 
in migraine headache subjects through the comparison of adverse events. 
 
EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
To compare the change from baseline of subjects treating with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period.  
• migraine with aura days  
• serum ionized magnesium 
 
SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
Safety assessments will include:  
• adverse events  
 COLLECTION AND DERIVATION OF ENDPOINTS  
Data required for the evaluation of endpoints will be recorded for the duration of the study using 
electronic data capture and included subject and clinician reported outcomes.   Following visit 2, subsequent visits will occur every [ADDRESS_24373] 28 continuous days of the run- in period will serve at the “baseline” for  calculating change from baseline for 28 -day 
periods subsequent to each office visit.  If the run- in period (starting with the screening visit and 
preceding the day before visit 2) exceeds [ADDRESS_24374] meet 80% diary completion compliance (22 days recorded unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_1052]/or Clinvest).   
Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the mean change from baseline in the frequency of 
migraine headache days per 28 -day period ending with the cessation of treatment period 
month 3 in subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo. This variable is derived from 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
25 
 the e-dairy.  It is based on the count of days with migraine headaches, fulfilling ICHD -3 
beta criteria, and/or headaches of any duration with the use of migraine- specific acute 
headache medication(s).  The primary time point is treatment month 3, encompassing the 
last 28 -day period before study end.   
 
 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
• Change from baseline in the frequency of headache days per 28 -day period.  
This variable will be derived from daily e-diary reports.  It will be based on 
the count of days with headaches.  
• Change from baseline in the total cumulative hours of headache per 28- day 
period.  This variable will be derived from daily e- diary reports.  It will be 
based on the sum of total headache duration for days with any headache.   
• Change from baseline in the average pain severity at time of onset compared to each 28 -day period.  This variable will be derived from the daily e -diary 
reports.   
• Reduction from baseline in the total number of acute headache pain medications used.  This variable will be derived from the daily e-diary reports.  
• Change from baseline in the total MIDAS score.  This variable will be derived from the subject questionnaire. 
• SGIC score at the end of treatment.  This variable will be derived from the subject questionnaire. 
• PGIC score at the end of treatment.  This variable will be derived from the clinician re ports.

Study Title: Immediate and Short Term Efficacy of Low Intensity Shock Wave Therapy in the 
Management of Erectile Dysfunction Due to Mild – Moderate Cavernous Arterial  Insufficiency  
 
Protocol version number and  date: September  10, [ADDRESS_138765] therapy (LiSWT) via 
MoreNova in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). 
 
Aim 1: To assess the efficacy  of the use of MoreNova shockwave therapy in individuals diagnosed with ED by 
a change in evidence based imagining via Color Duplex Doppler U ltrasound (CDDU)  
 
Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy  of the use of MoreNova shockwave therapy based on patient reports erectile 
charges through the IIEF-EF, EHS , SEP  2+3, and GAQ questionnaires (1, 3). 
 
Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .): 
 
ED is broadly defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for penetration (NIH Consensus Statement 1992). Treatment for ED consists of oral medications, intracavernosal injections and surgically placed penile prosthetics. In the literature this has been described as a Stepwise Approach, empi[INVESTIGATOR_123377]. Our approach at Mayo Clinic 
[LOCATION_012] has been to investigate the complaint of ED in men who fail the first step in ED  management which is 
a trial of oral phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (PDE5I). Using evidence-based technology we rule  out 
psychologic ED and characterize vascular erectile function . Color Duplex Doppler Ultrasound (CDDU ) in 
combination with an age specific dosage of intracavernous vasoactive medication ( alprostadil, PGE1) 
stimulates erection for office testing.  We have been able to categorize the severity of ED and identify the etiology of ED as arteriogenic ED, veno- occlusive ED or psychogenic ED. CDDU has become the standard of 
care in the evaluation of va scular erectile dysfunction (2). Penile injection therapy is often taught to men who 
have failed oral PDE -Type 5 Inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil). These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123378]; they 
manage ED with escalating dosages of vasoactive drugs. The goal of LISWT  is to restore natural erections and 
/ or improve responses to oral medications (first line therapy). 
 
LISWT for ED  is under evaluation in the [LOCATION_003].  The European Association of Urology Guidelines on ED were 
recently updated to include LISWT for men with mild to moderate ED. The energy/pulse used in this application is approximately 10% of the energy used for disintegrating kidney stones ; no serious side effects have been 
reported . Shock wave therapy for diabetic ulcers has recently been approved by [CONTACT_1622]. 
 
The present study proposal uses a device called MoreNova, in which shockwaves are focused onto linear

Methods: Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol : 
APPROACH 
This is prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_123379] [ADDRESS_138766] been diagnosed with ED for over a year, but less than 5 years. 
 
Efficacy is to be assessed by [CONTACT_123384]-ups. 
 
Efficacy is to be assessed by [CONTACT_123385] s data via IIEF -EF, SEP 2+3, GAQ and EHS  that 
catalog the frequency of successful erections and side effects during treatment. 
 
RECRUITMENT  
 
Review of clinic patient records within the MCF Department of Urology to identify potential research participants (patients with ED who have already presented to MCF and had initial evaluation and CDDU diagnosis ). 
Participants will first be identified through the treating physician and the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_123380], [CONTACT_123391]. The study coordinator will then be notified of the potentially eligible patient who will further screen for eligibility. Once the patient has been determined eligible, the study  coordinator will contact [CONTACT_123386] a research appointment to discuss the study in detail. The study coordinator will meet with the patient, describe the goals of the study, and ask if they would like to participate. If the patient agrees to participate at this time, a signed Patient Informed Consent is obtained before the patient leaves. The patient can decide at a later date to sign Informed Consent. If so, the study coordinator will schedule an appointment at a time 
when  the patient will return for an appointment with a consultant. Recruitment will take place in quiet room where 
the study will be explained fully and the patient will have adequate time to decide. If a patient declines consent, the study coordinator will express that this in no way affects their current or future medical care.  
 
Given the paperless initiative put forth by [CONTACT_123387], this study will utilize the Research Participant 
Tracking (PTrax) digital signature [CONTACT_123390].  
 
PARTICIPATION  
 
Once consented, the participants’ medical history will be reported and a physical examination will be performed as part of standard of care. Participants will be asked to stop all PDE -[ADDRESS_138767]  treatment (washout period) and throughout the treatments. The participant will then be 
scheduled to receive their first shock wave therapy via the MoreNova device. Participants will receive a total of 
6 treatments lasting approximately 20 minutes  each, two treatments weekly for 3 weeks.  A CDDU diagnostic

DATA COLLECTION  
 
Clinical data will be collected begin at time of consent from the patients’ medical record as well as the 
administered questionnaires. All data obtained for this investigation will be entered and maintained into electronic case report forms via REDCap database. Clinical data collection will include subject demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), current medications, and medical history relevant to cancer risk such as smoking history, body mass index, and family history of cancer. In addition, we will collect clinically variables resulting from the CDDU exam (see primary endpoint). The participant questionnaire responses will also be entered. Follow -up data 
collection for outcomes on all participants will be performed at [ADDRESS_138768] treatmen t was given. 
 
All data will be entered by [CONTACT_123388]. Continuous data queries will be performed to ensure data integrity and completion. 
 
Resources: Describe the available resources to conduct the research (personnel, time, facilities, mentor 
commitment, etc.) : This proposal will require collaborative efforts between the Department of Urology and 
Clinical Studies U nit. For this proposal we will utilize the existing research infrastructure nestled within the 
Department of Urology. A clinical research coordinator will assist in screening, consenting, and enrollment and follow-up data and AE collection for all participating patients. Our Urology Senior P rogram Coordinator

provide and evidence basis for  improved of ED, we will closely monitor the 10 patients enrolled in the 
study. By [CONTACT_123389]’s clinical assessment in PI’s standard clinical

for improvement of erectile function. Specifically, we will measure cavernosal artery in flow, peak systolic 
velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index and erection hardness  (EHS). CDDU is performed in 
privacy  with Male Nurse provider recording Doppler data and PI [INVESTIGATOR_123382]. Patients receive 
an intracavernous injection of alprostadil ([ADDRESS_138775] of care). CDDU measureme nts are taken at 
5-10 minutes and again after a period of privacy and visual sexual self- stimulation.  
 
Secondary Endpoint: 
- To assess efficacy  for patients receiving MoreNova therapy for treatment of ED via IIEF -EF, Total IIEF-
EF, EHS , SEP  2+3, and GAQ questionnaires. To provide clinical and participant self -reported date, we 
will administer questionnaires at baseline, after the last treatment, and at the 1 and 3 -4 month follow -up. 
Specifically, these questionnaires target sexual and erectile f unction as well as quality of life.

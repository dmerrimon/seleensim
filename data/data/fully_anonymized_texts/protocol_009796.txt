Safety:   
• To evaluate the safety of EyeQue VisionCheck compared with the phoropter and the 
autorefractor  
Study design:  This is a single -center, open -label, prospective study in healthy volunteers  
desiring refraction for correction of visual acuity  to compare the EyeQue VisionCheck with the 
phoropter and autorefractor.  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 
100 evaluable subjects.  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 65% in the age range of [ADDRESS_706592] will complete the following assessments and procedures at Screening  to confirm 
eligibility :   
• demographics/ medical history/concomitant medication review,  
• slit-lamp biomicroscopy,  
• laser retinal scan  or fund oscopy ,  
• optical coherence tomography (OCT) (retina and anterior chamber) , 
• tonometry (non contact) , 
• Ishihara color test,  
• cover test,  
• retinoscopy  
• phoropter refraction, and  
• visual acuity with phoropter correction.   
During the OCT and laser retinal scan /fundoscopy , images will be taken of the retina , anterior 
chamber,  and fundus.  All eye procedures will be completed without dilation using standard 
procedures.     
Retinoscopy will be used as a basis for further refinement by [CONTACT_541579].  Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for oculus dexter  (OD, right eye) and oculus sinister (OS, left eye) 
will be recorded for each subject using the phoropter.  These values will be used to adjust the lenses in the phoropter while the subject is looking through the device at an Early Treatment Diabetic Retin opathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart to determine BCVA, as subjects are eligible to 
participate in the study only if their vision ( oculus uterque [ OU]; both eyes) can be corrected to 
20/20 ( logarithm of th e minimum angle of resolution [L ogMAR ] 0.0).

diagnosis (see exclusion criteria below).  
 
Testing procedures    
Once eligibility is confirmed , the subject will be enrolled and proceed with study testing 
procedures.  T he refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for each subject (OD and OS) will be 
assessed using 2 additional  devices: autorefractor  and the EyeQue VisionCheck.  Subjects will be 
assessed with the autorefractor using standard device methodology.  The ref raction values 
generated from the EyeQue VisionCheck, the autorefractor  and the phoropter (during screening) 
will be used to prepare [ADDRESS_706594] followed by a minimum of 3 saved tests for each eye using the 
EyeQue VisionCheck device and mobile application (app).  After completion of a set of tests ([ADDRESS_706595] for each eye), the subject may elect to save or discard that set of tests.  They may choose 
to discard for any reason which may include not following instruction, pressing the wrong button in error, etc.   Each test consists of the subject looking through the VisionCheck device and using 
the app controls to fully overlap red and g reen bars at 9  differe nt angles.   After  completion of all 
tests ([ADDRESS_706596] and 3 saved tests with each eye), the refraction values will be displayed on the mobile app.  These values will be used for preparation of the trial lens frames.  If the EyeQu e 
system determines that the overall test results are unreliable, s ubjects may have to complete [ADDRESS_706597] results are unreliable, no values will be provided.  
  
After collection of refraction values from each device (phoropter, autorefractor, and EyeQue 
VisionCheck), the [ADDRESS_706598] s will also be asked a question regarding overall satisfaction with visual acuity 
using each of the 3 trial lens frames.  Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs) duri ng the study.    
Number of subjects (planned):  Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to 
achieve a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects.  An initial cohort of  39 subjects  will b e excluded 
from the analysis populations due to a software error identified in the EyeQue app t hat has since 
been corrected ; therefore, approximately 160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.

Safety:  
If any AEs occur during the study, t he safety endpoints will include the frequency and severity of 
AEs, ADEs , and serious adverse events  (SAEs).  
Statistics:  
Analysis Populations  
Modified Intent to Treat Population:  All subjects that perform BCVA for trial frames with 
test lens es based on both phoropter and EyeQue VisionCheck. 
Safety Population:  All subjects that meet the screening criteria and are enrolled in the study.    
 
After enrollment in this study was initiated , a software  error was identified in the EyeQue app 
used with the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The error was corrected and the algorithm for the  EyeQue  
app was updated.  An initial cohort of 39 subjects was enrolled in t he study prior to these 
changes being implemented .  Due to these EyeQue app updates, t his initial cohort of  39 subjects 
will be excluded from the analysis populations and any safety information for these subjects will 
be listed separately.   
 
Power and Sample Size  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects  to assess the effectiveness and safety of the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The 
initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately [ADDRESS_706602] ion of  non- inferiority bounds  of 0.1 
LogMAR (one line) and 0.05 LogMAR (one -half line) would require approximately 10 and 40 
subjects, respectively, with 90% power on the BCVA from the resulting lens from each 
approach.  This assumes the devices are roughly equivalent and the standard deviation (SD) is 0.077; th ese data are  based on a previous version of the EyeQue VisionCheck  device  tested 
against an autorefractor.   The proposed sample size has been inflated to allow for the possibility 
that a larger standard deviation will be observed in the current study , as well as to allow for 
comparisons within each stratum.   
When the software error in the EyeQue app was identified, t he algorithm for the EyeQue app 
was updated with more strin gent parameters  which may also impact the number of evaluable 
subjects.  Due to the updates  to the parameters , there may be additional subjects for which 
EyeQue VisionCheck refraction values are not  produced, leading to an increase in the number of 
subjects that wil l not be evaluated for the primary endpoint.  Of the approximately [ADDRESS_706603] database for investigations of the secondary outcomes and descriptions of the EyeQue VisionCheck’s performance characteristics.

5. INTRODUCTION 
Uncorrected r efractive errors account for m ore than 40% of the major causes for visual 
impairment globally  (Pascolini D , 2010; World Health Organization, Blindness and vision 
impairment fact sheet ).  The most common types of refractive errors include myopia, hyperopia, 
presby[CONTACT_19555], and astigmatism .  When an individual has a n uncorrected refractive error, symptoms 
may include blurred vision, double vision, haziness, squinting, headaches, and eye  strain.  
Refractive error correction is a ccomplished through the use of eye glasses, contacts, or refractive 
surgery .  Traditionally, refraction measurements are conducted by [CONTACT_541583] a comprehensive eye exam using diagnostic device s such as a phoropter or autorefractor.  
However, not all of the population has access to optometrists/ophthalmologists and these 
diagnostic devices or can afford these exams.   Additionally, for some instances i t may be more 
convenient to be able to obtain refraction  values outside of the clinic .   
The EyeQue Corporation (EyeQue) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_541563], portable, self -administered 
device to measure refraction values that can be used outside of the clinic.  The EyeQue VisionCheck device is a monocular  refraction system consisting of 3 components:  a mobile 
application ( app), a cloud -based processing platform, and the VisionCheck optical device that 
attaches to a  compatible  smartphone  owned/operated by [CONTACT_477460] .  The EyeQue  app guides 
the subject through interactive measurements with the EyeQue VisionCheck device in order to 
determine refractive error.    
This is a single center, clinical evaluation study to evaluate the performance of the EyeQue 
VisionCheck device compared w ith standard eye  care diagnostic devices  of phoropter and 
autorefractor  in measuring refractive error of the eye.  The intent of this study is to determine 
whether  EyeQue VisionCheck is statistically non -inferior to the phoropter and autorefractor  in 
corre cting visual refractive errors .  The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using trial lens 
frames prepared using refraction values from each of the [ADDRESS_706615] satisfaction with the 3  different trial lens f rames will be assessed during 
the study .

will be recorded for each subject using the phoropter.  The se values will be used to adjust the 
lenses in the phoropter while the subject is looking through the device at an Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart to determine BCVA, as subjects are eligible to

participate in the study only if their vision ( oculus uterque [ OU]; both eyes) can be corrected to 
20/20 ( logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [ LogMAR ] 0.0).     
The Screening procedures will be used to confirm that the subject does not have an exclusionary 
diagnosis.  
Testing proc edures    
Once eligibility is confirmed , the subject will be enrolled and proceed with study testing 
procedures.  T he refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for each subject (OD and OS) will be 
assessed using 2 additional  devices: autorefractor  and the EyeQue VisionCheck.  Subjects will be 
assessed with the autorefractor using standard device methodology.  The refraction values generated from the EyeQue VisionCheck, the autorefractor , and the phoropter (during screening) 
will be used to prepare [ADDRESS_706620] followed by a minimum of 3 saved tests for each eye using  the 
EyeQue VisionCheck device and mobile  app.  After completion of a set of tests ([ADDRESS_706621] for each 
eye), the subject may elect to save or discard that set of tests.  They may choose to discard for 
any reason which may include not following instruction, pressing the wrong button in error, etc.  Each test consists of the subject looking through the EyeQue VisionCheck device and using the 
app controls to fully overlap red and green bars at 9 different angles.   After completion of all 
tests ([ADDRESS_706622] and 3 saved tests with each eye), the refraction values will be displayed on the mobile app.  These values will be used for preparation of the trial lens frames.  If the EyeQue 
system determines that the overall test results are unreliable, s ubjects may have to complete  [ADDRESS_706623] .  If the spread is too large, 
the results are considered  to be unreliable  and values will not be provided.  Such spread can be 
due to testing error, improper instruction, etc.  
After collection of refraction values from each device (phoropter, autorefractor, and EyeQue VisionCheck), the [ADDRESS_706624], BCVA LogMAR scores will be collected for OD, OS,  and OU) for each of the [ADDRESS_706625] s will also be asked a question regarding overall satisfaction with visual 
acuity using each of the 3 trial lens frames.   Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) 
and adverse device effects (ADEs) during the study .    
Appendix 1 presents the schedule of assessments for the study.  Section 11 de tails the study

160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a 
population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 
65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.  
7.3. Study Endpoints  
7.3.1. Efficacy Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by [CONTACT_405745] (OD, OS, and OU ) measured using trial lens frames that correct the 
refractive error measured by [CONTACT_541580] 45 through 
65 years.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Comparison of raw refraction values produced using the EyeQue VisionCheck and the phoropter  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 years and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with autorefractor 
assessed by [CONTACT_405745] ( OD, OS, and OU) measured using trial lens frames that correct 
the refractive error measured by [CONTACT_541575],  analyzed with age strata 30 through 
65 years and 45 through 65 years .   
• Comparison of raw refraction values produced using the EyeQue VisionCheck and the autor efractor  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by [CONTACT_405745] (OD, OS, and OU) measured using trial lens frames that correct the refractive error measured by [CONTACT_541585] 30 through 65 years .   
Exploratory Endpoint:  
• Subject preference of trial lens frames that correct the refractive error meas ured by 
[CONTACT_210696] 3 device s:  EyeQue VisionCheck, phoropter, and autorefractor  
7.3.2. Safety Endpoints  
If any adverse events occur during the study, t he safety endpoints will include the frequency and 
severity of AEs , ADEs,  and serious adverse events (SAEs) . 
7.4. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
A clinical study  based on statistical non- inferiority is the most appropriate means to assess the 
effectiveness and performance of the EyeQue VisionCheck device relative to the comparator  
devices , the phoropter  and autorefractor , that are standard eye  care diagnostic devices  used to 
obtain refraction values.   
Masking of the subject s and assessors to the re fraction values used to prepare  the 3 trial lens 
frames  is appropriate to control and minimize bias  in the a ssessment of BCVA  as these L ogMAR

Protocol EYEQUE -[ADDRESS_706626] and/or reproduce.   
Based on the intended use for obtaining refraction values , a one -day evaluation is appropriate 
because standar d-of-care eye exams in which refraction values are obtained are typi[INVESTIGATOR_541564] a periodic basis, such as yearly, and it is not anticipated that refraction values would 
change over a short duration where additional repeated measurements would be necess ary for 
this study .  Visual acuity may fluctuate often; however, there is no appreciable change over a 
period of a several  months.   
The design allows for enrollment of subjects [ADDRESS_706627] visual accommodation that would add complexity to this 
comparative study.  Younger subjects may be assessed in a separate clinical study.

12.3. Adverse E vents 
12.3.1. Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects, and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be re corded throughout the study and will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The investigator is responsible for the de tection and documentation of AEs and ADEs .  For all 
AEs/ADEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to dete rmine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring  immediate notification to the s ponsor or its designated representative. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions of Terms  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Adverse Even ts  
Any undesirable clinical occurrences observed in subjects during an investigational clinical 
study .  In addition to novel e vents , an AE  may be an exacerbation of a pre- existing medical 
condition that was present before the subject was assigned to a treatment group.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Serious Adverse Even t  
Adverse events considered serious are those that result in one or more of the following  
• Death 
• Immediately life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541571] a n existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that are not fatal, life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Non-serious adverse events are all other adverse e vents not deemed serious. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect is an AE that is suspected to be related to the device.  Adverse device 
effects can be either anti cipated, which means that they have been previously identified in this 
protocol or the investigator’s brochure, or unanticipated.  
             31    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)
 
 
    
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An u nanticipated ADE  (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application; 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a  device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.   
12.4. Severity of Adverse Events  
The study site will grade the clinical severity of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_541589]:  
• Mild:  Causes no limitation of usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes some limitation of usual activities  
• Severe:  Prevents or severely limits usual activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_541590] i n Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
12.5. Relationship to Test Article 
An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational device caused or contributed t o an AE  and must be provided 
for all AEs  (serious and non- serious).  
The s ponsor’s determination of attribution will be used for reporting to the appropriate health 
authorities.  The relation of an AE  to study participation will be determined using the des criptors 
and definitions provided in Table 1. 
Table  1: Attribution of adverse events  
Not R elated  The AE is clearly/most probably caused by [CONTACT_541591]’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, or the 
delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a 
causal relation, or the AE star ted before administration (screening phase).  
Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_541592].  
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_541593].  The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey in general 
that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.   
The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_14882].  Any AE that is suspected to be related to the EyeQue Visio nCheck, phoropter, or the autorefractor  will be 
classified as an ADE .

Protocol EYEQUE -[ADDRESS_706643] article, are to be recorded on the 
appropriate AE page (either serious or non -serious) in the eCRF throughout the study.  All 
adverse effects during the study will be documented in the subject's medical record.  This 
information will then be transcribed on the AE page of the eCRF by [CONTACT_51015].  Required information includes a description of the event, date of onset, date of r esolution, the 
action taken to manage the AE, the subsequent outcome, and severity.  
Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. 
All AEs /ADEs  must be follow ed to adequate resolution or stabilization.  If the AE/ADE has not 
resolved or stabilized by [CONTACT_541594], the investigator 
will follow the status of the subject's AE/ADE for at least [ADDRESS_706644]'s final study 
visit, unless directed otherwise by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor.  
12.7. Reporting SAEs  and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect s 
For reporting of SAEs  and UADEs , the following process ensures compliance with  21 CFR  812 
and International Conference on Harmoni sation  (ICH) guidelines.  Investigators and other study 
center staff must inform Rho Product Safety representatives of any SAE /UADE  that occurs 
(whether or not attributable to the study drug) in the study within 24 hours  of when he or she 
becomes aware of the SAE /UADE .  It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
SAE /UADE  reporting procedures are followed appropriately.  In addition, the investigator must 
ensure that these events are entered on the SAE /UADE  eCRF  via Rave electronic data capture 
(EDC ) or via paper form, if Rave EDC is unavailable .  The form will be entered into EDC or 
faxed  to the Rho Product Safety p ersonnel within  24 hours .  The following variables will be 
recorded for each AE:  verbatim/AE description, time and date for AE start and stop, m aximum

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Power and Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a mini mum of 
100 evaluable subjects  to assess the effectiveness and safety of the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The 
initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately [ADDRESS_706646] ion of  non- inferiority bounds  of 0.1 
LogMAR (one line) and 0.05 LogMAR (one -half line) would require approximately 10 and 40 
subjects, respectively, with 90% power on the BCVA from the resulting lens from each 
approach.  This assumes the devices are roughly equivalent and the standard deviation (SD) is 
0.077; th ese data are  based on a previous version of the EyeQue VisionCheck device  tested 
against an autorefractor.   The proposed sample size has been inflated to allow for the possibility 
that a larger standard deviation will be observed in the current study , as well as to allow for 
comparisons within each stratum .  A software error in the EyeQue app was identified  and the 
algorithm for the EyeQue  app was updated with more stringent parameters which may also 
impact the number of evaluable subjects.  Due to the updates to the parameters, there may be additional subjects for which EyeQue VisionCheck refraction values are not  produced, leading to 
an increase in the number of subjects that will not be evaluated for the primary endpoint.  Of the 
approximately [ADDRESS_706647] database for investigations of the secondary outcomes and descriptions of the EyeQue VisionCheck ’s performan ce characteristics.  
13.2. Analysis Populations  
Two analysis populations are defined for this study.  
Modified Intent to Treat Population:  All subjects that perform BCVA for trial frames with 
test lens es based on both phoropter and EyeQue VisionCheck. 
Safety Population:  All subjects that meet the screening criteria and are enrolled in the study.    
 
After enrollment in this study was initiated, a  software  error was identified in the EyeQue app 
used with the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The software error was co rrected and the algorithm for the 
EyeQue app was updated.  An initial cohort of [ADDRESS_706648]’s BCVA 
LogMAR score from the phoropter -based lenses  will be subtracted from the BCVA  LogMAR

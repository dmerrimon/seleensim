STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the long-term safety , 
tolerability, and effectiveness of CIN-[ADDRESS_993676] be obtained before any Protocol- specific procedures are performed 
in this study (Study CIN-107-130). Eligible patients from Study CIN-107-[ADDRESS_993677] to 
participate in the OLE will be enrolled directly following the EOT assessments at the end of Part 1 
or Part 2 of Study CIN-107-124 (ie, they will not undergo the safety follow- up in 
Study CIN-107-124). The EOT assessments at the end of Part [ADDRESS_993678] dose of CIN-107 that is safe and medically reasonable. Investigators will 
be allowed to determine whether the patient should start the OLE study with an additional single 
background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent based on the patient s BP control in 
Study CIN-107-124 (ie, whether the patient in addition to the CIN- 107 study drug would start the 
OLE study with an additional single background antihypertensive agent from another or same 
class as during Part 1 of Study CIN-107-124).  
The single background antihypertensive agent chosen at Visits 1 or 2 should remain stable until 
Visit 3 of the OLE study, after which the I nvestigator is permitted to use his/her medical judgment 
to up/down titrate or discontinue the background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent.  
Rescue medication use is permitted and recommended if the SBP shows an acute and sustained 
increase of 30 mmHg (or greater) from Visit 1 and/or is 170 mmHg and/or the DBP is 
[ADDRESS_993679] clinical judgment when 
determining the need for rescue medications and are encouraged to discuss selection of rescue 
medication with the study Medical Monitors. 
The Investigator is to document the clinical rationale for adding, changing dose, or discontinuing  
either the single background antihypertensive agent or rescue medication. The range of 
antihypertensive classes that may be used (listed in  Appendix E ) during this study is left to the 
-sparing diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists are not allowed. 
To manage persistent or symptomatic hypotension, the Investigator should first reduce or 
discontinue any rescue medication, and then reduce or discontinue use of the single background  
antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent if medically sound. If the symptoms continue, the dose 
strength of CIN-107 may be down-titrated from 2 mg to 1 mg. The CIN-107 dose may be further

Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_993680]. CIN-107 may be temporarily discontinued if the SBP remains <[ADDRESS_993681]. Study drug dosing may be resumed or up-titrated after 
reassessments.  
Patients will complete approximately 8 study visits during the OLE study, including enrollment  
(Visit 1) and follow-up (Visit 8) visits . During the treatment period, patients will return to the 
clinical site for visits. Unscheduled v isits may be scheduled at any time during the study period

participation of patients. 
The safety and tolerability of CIN- [ADDRESS_993682] dose of study drug 
in Study CIN-107-130 until the end of the follow-up visit. Patients will be followed for 
effectiveness and adherence throughout the treatment p eriod. PD variables analyzed during the 
study may include, but are not limited to, measures of aldosterone and its precursors, cortisol and 
its precursor, and plasma renin activity (PRA), and calculation of aldosterone/PRA ratio. PK 
variables analyzed during the study will include plasma concentrations of CIN- 107 and any 
measured metabolite(s). 
Clinical sites will provide patients with a 24-hour urine collection kit at Visit [ADDRESS_993683] morning void on the second 
day for a total duration of 24 (±2) hours. Patients must be instructed to keep the sample refrigerated 
at all times except during their transit to the clinical site. A 24- hour urine collection may be 
repeated if the Investig ator suspects that the sampling is insufficient and the patient is within the 
visit window. Clinical sites will aliquot urine into a transfer tube and send it to the Central 
Laboratory. 
On clinical site visit days, patients will self-administer the morning dose of any other concomitant 
medications (if applicable) at home. CIN-107 should be withheld as it will be self- administered at 
the clinical site and witnessed by [CONTACT_6624], after completion of pre- dose evaluations and laboratory 
sampling. Between clinical site visits, patients will continue to self- administer study drug once 
daily (QD) by [CONTACT_727550]. Patients will be instructed to 
bring their antihypertensive medication(s) and study drug to all clinical site visits for pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. 
Patients should not exercise, smoke, or consume caffeinated beverages or food for at least 2 hours 
prior to each clinical site visit. All clinical site visits should occur between 6:00 a.m. and 
11:00 a.m. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: 
CIN-[ADDRESS_993684] to participate in this study will continue 
treatment with 2 mg CIN-107 tablets QD after enrollment , starting at Visit 1 and concluding at 
EOT (Visit 7).

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Aldosterone is a hormone that has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and renal diseases. 
It is the principal mineralocorticoid in humans and is synthesized in the adrenal cortex by [CONTACT_727551]. Aldosterone is a key component of the renin angiotensin aldosterone 
system and acts as a critical regulator of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis through its agonism of 
the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Its effect on end organs has been shown to occur by [CONTACT_727552] (genomic effect) in addition to mechanisms independent of that direct 
interaction (non-genomic or non-receptor mediated effects).1,2,3 
One of the challenges that has impacted the development of aldosterone synthase inhibitors has 
been the difficulty in selectively inhibiting aldosterone synthase without affecting the synthesis of 
-hydroxylase (encoded by [CONTACT_48931] P450 [CYP] 11B1 gene) and shares high sequence similarity with aldosterone 
-hydroxylase leads to 
suppression of cortisol levels, compromised stress and immunologic responses, adverse effects on 
some metabolic functions, and possibly increased mortality rates.4,5,6,7 
Baxdrostat is a highly potent, selective, and competitive inhibitor of human aldosterone synthase 
(encoded by [CONTACT_35233] P450 [CYP]11B2 gene). Baxdrostat (formerly CIN-107 or 
RO6836191) was acquired from [COMPANY_002] Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereinafter [COMPANY_002]) by [CONTACT_727553], Inc. (hereinafter CinCor). CinCor is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [COMPANY_008] group 
of companies. [COMPANY_008] is pursuing further clinical development of the compound. In 
preclinical in vivo studies (primarily conducted in primates), CIN-107 significantly lowered 
aldosterone without affecting cortisol levels over a wide dose range. The ability of CIN-107 to 
lower aldosterone without affecting cortisol was confirmed following administration of single oral 
doses and in the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) in healthy human patients. 
1.[ADDRESS_993695] safety pharmacology, 
genotoxicity, repeated-dose toxicity, and reproductive toxicity studies. Findings in animal models 
 
Dose- and exposure-dependent inhibition of aldosterone synthesis was confirmed in acute and 
sub chronic monkey models. In cynomolgus monkeys challenged with an injection of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone, CIN-107 blocked aldosterone synthesis without interfering with 
cortisol levels. 
Administration of CIN-107 up to 30 mg/kg/day for up to 13 weeks and up to 10 mg/kg/day for up 
to [ADDRESS_993696] changes in the 13-week toxicity study were 
reversible and/or confined to the high dose level, with the exception of dose-related decreases in 
aldosterone in both sexes, which was noted at all dose levels. Based on preliminary data from the 
26-week toxicity study (Study CIN-107-RETOX007), CIN-107-related mortality occurred in 
2 female rats administered 10 mg/kg/day and who were sacrificed in moribund condition due to 
dehydration and loss of body weight. Mild, dose-responsive (females only), non-adverse increased 
serum cholesterol concentration was observed in males administered 10 mg/kg/day and females 
administered 1 mg/kg/day. Based on these data, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) 
for CIN-107 in male rats is 10 mg/kg/day or a human equivalent dose of 81 mg/day. Due to the 
[COMPANY_008] 
Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page 21 of 66 
Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 CIN-107-related unscheduled sacrifice of 2 females administered 10 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for 
CIN-107 in female rats is 3 mg/kg/day which is equivalent to 24 mg/day for a 50 kg human. 
CIN-107 was administered in cynomolgus monkeys up to 6 mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks. Based 
on preliminary results of Study CIN-107-RETOX006, no CIN-107-related clinical pathology 
changes were noted. CIN-107-related microscopic findings included adrenal hyperplasia (zona 
glomerulosa, minimal to moderate), renal juxtaglomerular hyperplasia (considered related to 
CIN-107 pharmacology), and decreased lymphocytes in multiple organs (spleen, thymus, and 
mesenteric lymph nodes) of animals administered 1 mg/kg/day. Microscopic findings showed 
evidence of reversibility. Due to the lack of impact on the health and well-being of animals, the 
NOAEL is 6 mg/kg/day for male and female monkeys or a human equivalent dose of 97 mg/day 
for a 50 kg human.  
The adrenal gland was the primary tissue affected in both rats and monkeys. CIN-107 was well 
tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to 7 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks but was not well tolerated 
at 40 mg/kg/day. A mechanistic 4-week cynomolgus monkey study demonstrated dose-related 
hypertrophy of adrenal zona glomerulosa cells with increased thickness or expansion of the zona 
glomerulosa layer, increased aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) immunostaining, lipid vacuolation, 
apoptosis, and proliferation of zona glomerulosa cells. These pathological changes in the adrenal 
gland were ameliorated by [CONTACT_727554]-converting enzyme 
inhibition, indicating that they were exaggerated pharmacological effects of and 
physiologic/adaptive responses to aldosterone inhibition. 
There was no evidence for a mutagenic, clastogenic, or aneugenic potential of CIN-107. 
In vitro cardiovascular safety was assessed in a human ether à-go-go-related gene assay. The 
concentration needed for 20% inhibition was >150-fold above the free maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) expected to be efficacious in man (at 10 mg once daily [QD] dose for the 
treatment of hypertension [HTN]). This indicated a very low probability of any QT liability. In a 
modified Irwin test and in a whole-body plethysmography study in male rats, single oral 
administrations of CIN-107 up to a dose of 50 mg/kg did not induce any adverse effects on the 
central nervous system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. The NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg 
CIN-[ADDRESS_993697] been conducted to date in healthy patients: a 
single-ascending dose (SAD) study, a MAD study, a study to characterize the effect of food on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and to bridge the PK of the solution formulation of CIN-[ADDRESS_993698] of CIN-107 on the 
PK of the multidrug and toxin extrusion substrate metformin. 
Results of the SAD study which investigated the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of CIN-107 in healthy male volunteers demonstrated that single oral doses of CIN-107 up to 
360 mg were well tolerated. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or dose-limiting 
events, and the maximum tolerated dose observed was at the highest dose tested of 360 mg. 
[COMPANY_008]  
Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_993699]-dose. Thereafter, concentrations declined from peak in a biphasic manner with a long 
median terminal elimination half-life of approximately 25 to 31 hours. Over the anticipated 
therapeutically relevant dose range (through 10 mg), peak and overall exposures (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_727555]-time curve [AUC]) increased in a generally 
dose-proportional manner. 
Single doses of CIN-107 reduced plasma and urine aldosterone levels by [CONTACT_3450] 85% to 
90% in a dose-dependent manner. A maximum effect on aldosterone reduction was consistently 
achieved at a dose of 10 mg CIN-107 under the different conditions tested (Cortrosyn® challenge, 
standing, normal salt diet, and low salt diet conditions). No change in plasma cortisol levels after 
the Cortrosyn challenge was apparent across the full dose range tested (0 to 360 mg CIN-107). 
Although there was no effect on cortisol levels through [ADDRESS_993700] occurred based on observed increases in 11-deoxycortisol (at doses of 180 mg and 360 mg) 
and 11-deoxycorticosterone (at doses 90 mg). 
Single oral doses of up to [ADDRESS_993701] serum electrolyte (chloride, potassium, 
sodium, and phosphate) levels, with no difference for patients on active treatment versus those on 
placebo. Urine sodium and the sodium to potassium ratio both increased, with the sodium loss in 
urine greater than the potassium retention. No change in urine creatinine was apparent. 
Results of the MAD study indicate that multiple ascending doses of CIN-107 up to 5 mg QD for 
10 days were well tolerated by [CONTACT_727556] (for 2.5 and 5 mg CIN-107 
dose groups) and normal salt diet (for 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mg CIN-107 dose groups). Specifically, 
there were no deaths, SAEs, or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal, 
and there were no clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) or vital signs. PK 
data from the MAD study indicate that exposure to CIN-107 (as assessed by C max and AUC) is 
generally 2- to 2.5-fold higher at steady state as compared to that observed following a single dose. 
Exposures within the dose range studied increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. 
PD data from this study confirmed the ability of CIN-[ADDRESS_993702] 
study (CIN-107-112). The study was conducted with a 5 mg solution (fasted) and a [ADDRESS_993703] on the extent of absorption (as assessed by C max and AUC) but did 
have a small effect on the rate of absorption. Time to C max occurred approximately 1 hour later 
(median of 4 hours) when CIN-107 was administered with the specified meal as compared to in a 
fasted state (median of 3 hours). 
The metformin drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that systemic exposure to metformin is 
unchanged when administered with CIN-107. The safety profile of metformin was similar in the

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 presence and absence of CIN-107. Specifically, there were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to 
withdrawal and there were no clinically significant changes in ECGs or vital signs. 
The results of the renal impairment study indicated that a single 10 mg dose of CIN-107 was well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_727557], ranging from normal renal function to 
end stage disease receiving hemodialysis. One patient with end stage disease experienced an 
unrelated SAE of metabolic encephalopathy and a moderate unrelated adverse event (AE) of 
tremor. One control patient experienced a mild AE of diarrhea, which was considered to be related 
to study drug by [CONTACT_737]. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values 
(including potassium), ECGs, or vital signs. PK data from this study demonstrated that there was 
no noteworthy increase in systemic exposure or decrease in renal clearance in individuals with 
moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 
59 mL/min) as compared to control patients (normal renal function or mild renal impairment; 
eGFR 60 mL/min). The conclusions of this study suggest that it is not necessary to dose adjust 
CIN-107 for patients with renal impairment. 
 
1.3 Study CIN-107-124 (HALO Study) 
Study CIN-107-124, the HALO study, is the parent clinical trial of the current Study CIN-107-130. 
It is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple dose 
strengths of CIN-[ADDRESS_993704] uncontrolled 
HTN (mean seated systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140 mmHg [or 130 mmHg if diabetic]) despi[INVESTIGATOR_698987] a stable regimen of a single background antihypertensive agent at the maximal tolerated 
dose (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) for at least [ADDRESS_993705] a serum aldosterone 
7 ng/dL ( 6 ng/dL if on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor 
blocker) and meet all other enrollment criteria. Approximately 250 patients are to be enrolled in 
the clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002]. A subsequent amendment of the protocol permitted patients 
being on a stable regimen of an ACEi/ARB or an ACEi/ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or an 
ACEi/ARB plus a CCB at the MTD (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) for at least 8 weeks to be 
enrolled.  The requirement of a baseline serum aldosterone 7 ng/dL ( 6 ng/dL if on an 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker) was removed. 
Patients in the HALO study are to be randomly assigned to CIN-107 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 
placebo QD for 8 weeks as the add-on therapy to their single background antihypertensive agent 
in Part 1. All responders (defined as patients achieving a mean seated SBP <130 mmHg) at the 
end of Part 1 will be qualified to participate in Part 2. Responders will receive 2 mg CIN-107 
tablets and discontinue their single background antihypertensive agent in Part 2. Non-responders 
who received any study drug except 2 mg CIN-107 in Part 1 will move into Part 2, receive the 
2 mg dose of CIN-107 for 4 weeks, and discontinue their single background antihypertensive 
agent. A non-responder who has already received the maximum dose strength (2 mg) of CIN-107 
in Part 1 will be considered withdrawn from the study. Patients who complete the study through 
12 weeks or who were considered withdrawn at the end of Part 1 may be eligible to enter the 
open-label extension (OLE) study (Study CIN-107-130).

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 1.4 Rationale for Conducting Study CIN-107-130

effectiveness on blood pressure (BP) management of CIN-[ADDRESS_993706] uncontrolled HTN despi[INVESTIGATOR_256254] a stable regimen of a single background antihypertensive 
agent, represent a large portion of the hypertensive population. 
1.5 Risk/Benefit 
1.5.1 Potential Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia 
Aldosterone leads to increased reabsorption of sodium and water and secretion of potassium in the 
kidneys, thereby [CONTACT_727558]. Based on the preclinical observations and the 
mode of action of CIN-107, reduction of circulating aldosterone levels may lead to natriuresis and 
subsequently to increased serum potassium, decreased serum sodium, possible dehydration, and 
decreased BP. Patients with potassium and sodium levels outside of Protocol-required levels will 
be excluded from study participation and these electrolytes will be closely monitored for the entire 
study duration. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of hypovolemia and orthostatic hypotension 
As a consequence of the urinary sodium loss described above, osmotic water loss can lead to 
hypovolemia and consequently to orthostatic hypotension with a corresponding increase in heart 
rate. These events will be followed in this study by [CONTACT_727559] (BP and heart rate). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of adrenal effects 
While CIN-107 exhibits highly selective CYP11B2 inhibition, CYP11B1 inhibition with repeat 
dosing cannot be ruled out and may result in reduction in cortisol levels, as seen at high doses in 
preclinical studies and in clinical studies for the non-selective CYP11B1/B2 inhibitor LCI699 
(osilodrostat).8,9 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk of sex hormone-related adverse events 
Known side effects of MR antagonists (MRAs) are gynecomastia, mastodynia, and abnormal 
vaginal bleeding, and were observed more frequently with spi[INVESTIGATOR_727548]. 
Occurrence of these events will be monitored in this study. Nevertheless, a selective inhibitor of 
aldosterone synthase is not expected to interfere with sexual hormone pathways. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of allergic reactions 
Patients with known allergies to CIN-107 or its excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (including placebo) should not receive 
CIN-107.

Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page 25 of 66 
Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 CIN-107 is an aldosterone synthase inhibitor. Aldosterone synthase inhibition is a new therapeutic 
option for the phenomenon of aldosterone breakthrough (in which the initially reduced plasma 
aldosterone concentration returns to baseline levels over time). With aldosterone breakthrough, BP 
control may be diminished with the associated progression of end organ damage. 
Taken together, the preclinical data and existing clinical data support the activity and safety of 
CIN-107 and its continued clinical evaluation.

be allowed to determine whether the patient should start the OLE study with an additional 
background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent based on the patient s BP control in 
Study CIN-107-124 (ie, whether the patient in addition to the CIN-107 study drug would start the 
OLE study with an additional background antihypertensive agent from another or same class as 
during Part 1 of Study CIN-107-124).  
The background antihypertensive agent chosen at Visits 1 or 2 should remain stable until Visit 3 
of the OLE study, after which the Investigator is permitted to use his/her medical judgment to 
up/down titrate or discontinue the background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent.  
Rescue medication use is permitted and recommended if the SBP shows an acute and sustained 
increase of 30 mmHg (or greater) from Visit 1 and/or is 170 mmHg and/or the DBP is

determining the need for rescue medications and are encouraged to discuss selection of rescue 
medication with the study Medical Monitors. See  Appendix E for rescue medication guidance. 
The Investigator is to document the clinical rationale for adding, changing dose, or discontinuing 
either the single background antihypertensive agent or rescue medication. The range of 
antihypertensive classes that may be used (listed in  Appendix E ) during this study is left to the 
-sparing diuretics and MRAs are not allowed. 
To manage persistent or symptomatic hypotension, the Investigator should first reduce or 
discontinue any rescue medication, and then reduce or discontinue use of the single background

study may include, but are not limited to, measures of aldosterone and its precursors, cortisol and 
its precursor, and plasma renin activity (PRA), and calculation of aldosterone/PRA ratio. PK 
variables analyzed during the study will include plasma concentrations of CIN-107 and any 
measured metabolite(s). 
Clinical sites will provide patients with a 24-hour urine collection kit at Visit 6. Patients will be 
instructed to start the collection up to [ADDRESS_993715] morning void on the second 
day for a total duration of 24 (±2) hours. Patients must be instructed to keep the sample refrigerated 
at all times except during their transit to the clinical site. A 24-hour urine collection may be 
repeated if the Investigator suspects that the sampling is insufficient and the patient is within the 
visit window. Clinical sites will aliquot urine into a transfer tube and send it to the Central 
Laboratory. 
On clinical site visit days, patients will self-administer the morning dose of any other concomitant 
medications (if applicable) at home. CIN-107 should be withheld as it will be self-administered at 
the clinical site and witnessed by [CONTACT_6624], after completion of pre-dose evaluations and laboratory 
sampling. Between clinical site visits, patients will continue to self-administer study drug QD by 
[CONTACT_727550]. Patients will be instructed to bring their 
antihypertensive medication(s) and study drug to all clinical site visits for pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. Patients 
should not exercise, smoke, or consume caffeinated beverages or food for at least 2 hours prior to 
each clinical site visit. All clinical site visits should occur between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.

prior to each clinical site visit. All clinical site visits should occur between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. 
5.5.3 Allowed Medications and/or Procedures 
Investigators will be allowed to determine whether the patient should start the OLE study with an 
additional background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent based on the patient s BP control in 
Study CIN-107-124 (ie, whether the patient in addition to the CIN-107 study drug would start the

Rescue medications (see Appendix E for guidance) and down-titration of antihypertensive 
medication(s) (see  Appendix F for recommendations) are allowed. 
5.5.4 Dietary Guidance 
Given the potential for predisposition to lower sodium values in the study population (eg, diuretic 
use) and to avoid potential additive effects on serum sodium values, Investigators should be 
cautious in advising patients to increase fluid intake/hydration during the study, as may sometimes 
be done prior to laboratory sampling. As such, patients should maintain their usual fluid intake as 
best as possible, unless additional oral hydration would be needed, such as in cases of assessed 
volume depletion or dehydration. In addition, Investigators should consider encouraging patients 
who present with lower sodium levels (eg, approximately 128 to 133 mEq/L) to moderately 
liberalize their salt intake without necessarily increasing fluid intake. 
5.5.5 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use 
All medications used within 30 days prior to enrollment (Visit 1) will be recorded.  
All concomitant medications and concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including fluids, electrolytes, vitamins, and

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already present at enrollment (Visit 1) should be recorded as medical 
history and not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
baseline changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, 
it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, ECGs) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at enrollment (Visit 1) and significantly worsen during the 
study should be reported as AEs, as described below. The Investigator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error should 
not be reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings (eg, ECG 
abnormalities) should be reported as an AE if any of the following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality; or

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 Causality assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related)  The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or definitely related)  The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the patient may have. 
 Concomitant drug- 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical 
and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) 
of the study drug should be considered.

 Events of hypotension that require clinical intervention; 
 Abnormal potassium laboratory values that require clinical intervention; and 
 Abnormal sodium laboratory values that require clinical intervention. 
During the course of the study, additional AESIs may be identified by [CONTACT_1034]. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE -
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered

of SAEs. 
8.4 Overdose Reporting 
Overdose refers to the administration of a quantity of the study drug given per administration or 
cumulatively (accidentally or intentionally), which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the Protocol.  
In cases of a discrepancy in the drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is 
clear that the patient has taken additional dose(s), or the Investigator has reason to suspect that the 
patient has taken additional dose(s). Clinical judgment should always be applied in determining 
overdose. 
All reports of overdose as described above must be reported on the Special Situations Report form 
and faxed/emailed to Medpace Clinical Safety (contact [CONTACT_248130]  8.7) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All AEs associated with these Special Situation reports should 
be reported as AEs or SAEs as well as recorded on the AE eCRF and/or the SAE report form. 
Details of the symptoms and signs, clinical management, and outcome should be provided, when 
available. 
8.5 Safety Surveillance and Management of Serum Potassium Levels 
Patient serum potassium levels will be monitored systematically throughout the study. Serum 
potassium will be measured at the Central Laboratory at each visit as indicated in the Schedule of 
Procedures (Appendix A ). Unscheduled assessments of serum potassium levels should be 
-up from 
elevated Central Laboratory potassium, acute changes in clinical condition, suspected 
dehydration, etc).  
[COMPANY_008]  
Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page 46 of 66 
Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 For serum potassium 5.5 mEq/L and <6 mEq/L, the patient should present to the clinical site 
immediately for repeat testing, but study drug dosing may continue. For serum potassium 
6 mEq/L, the patient should suspend study drug dosing and present to the clinical site 
immediately for repeat testing. 
Repeat and unscheduled testing for serum potassium should be measured at the local laboratory 
and Central Laboratory. 
8.6 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study or within the safety follow-up period defined in the 
Protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the patient should 
be withdrawn from the study. ET procedures should be implemented at that time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to Medpace 
Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Medpace Clinical Safety will then 
provide the Investigator/clinical site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/clinical site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to Medpace Clinical 
Safety.  
If the female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while the patient is receiving study drug 
or within the safety follow-up period defined in the Protocol, the Investigator should notify 
Medpace Clinical Safety as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
Medpace Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.7 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), applicable competent authorities in all the Member States concerned, 
and to the Central Ethics Committee, and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_429]/designee of such a case. Relevant follow-up information will subsequently be 
communicated within an additional [ADDRESS_993737] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country-specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform all Investigators as required per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to investigational medicinal product.

in Appendix A.  
8.9 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. Orthostatic vitals will 
include standing BP and standing heart rate. Vital signs and BP will be measured pre-dose at visits 
indicated in  Appendix A using the following standardized procedures: 
 Patients should not exercise, smoke, or consume caffeinated beverages or food for at least 
2 hours prior to each clinical site visit; 
 At clinical site visits when study drug will be administered, vital signs and BP will be assessed 
pre-dose only; 
 Vital signs and BP measurements should be obtained prior to ECG recordings; 
 Patient should be seated for at least 5 minutes in the examination room before measurement of 
vital signs and BP; and 
 For measuring BP during clinical site visits, the following standardized procedures are 
recommended: 
o The patient should be seated with his/her back supported, feet flat on the floor, and the 
measurement arm supported so that the midpoint of the manometer cuff is at heart level; 
o A designated automated office BP monitoring (AOBPM) device will be provided to each 
clinical site and must be used for all study-related measurements; 
o An appropriately sized cuff should be used with the bladder centered over the brachial 
artery; 
o The cuff size and arm used for the measurement should be recorded; 
o At enrollment (Visit 1), laterality should be determined first before taking the enrollment 
(Visit 1) measurements. BP will be measured in both upper arms (3 times/arm) using an 
appropriately sized cuff to detect possible laterality differences. The arm with the higher 
mean value will then be used to take the enrollment (Visit 1) BP measurements (at least 
5 minutes after determining laterality) and for all subsequent measurements; 

[COMPANY_008]  
Clinical Study Protocol D6971C00001
Confidential & Proprietary Page 48 of 66 
Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 o All BP measurements should be obtained at approximately the same time of day as the 
enrollment (Visit 1) measurements are obtained; 
o 3 seated BP measurements (each measurement 1 to 2 minutes apart) should be obtained 
using the same arm and the AOBPM device at each clinical site visit; 
o If the lowest and highest SBP measurements are >[ADDRESS_993740] SBP measurements are >[ADDRESS_993741] SBP values remain >20 mmHg apart after 
6 measurements at a subsequent assessment, then the patient will be excluded from the 
study; and 
o Once the seated BP has been determined, the patient will be asked to stand, and after 
60 seconds, a single standing BP and heart rate (orthostatic vital signs) measurement will 
be obtained, as required.

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 APPENDIX D:  EXAMPLES OF EXCLUDED MEDICATIONS 
Each concomitant medication should be assessed individually for its potential for a drug-drug 
interaction. For examples of clinical inhibitors and substrates of the listed transporters and clinical 
inducers for cytochrome P450-mediated metabolisms, see the online reference at 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions-
table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers. 
An extract of this website on 24 June 2021 is reflected in  Table 2. 
Table 2. Examples of Excluded Medications 
Group Examples 
Strong CYP3A inducers [1] Apalutamide, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [2], enzalutamide [3], mitotane, 
phenytoin [4],  
1. Examples of clinical inducers for P450- mediated metabolisms (for concomitant use clinical DDI studies and/or drug 
labeling) (12/03/2019). 
Note: Strong, moderate, and weak inducers are drugs that decrease the AUC of sensit ive index substrates of a given 
metabolic pathway by 80%, 50% to <80%, and 20% to <50%, respectively. 
2. Strong inducer of CYP2B6, CYP3A, and weak inducer of CYP2C9. 
3. Strong inducer of CYP3A and moderate inducer of CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. 
4. Strong inducer of CYP2C19, CYP3A, and moderate inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. 
5. Strong inducer of CYP3A and moderate inducer of CYP1A2, and CYP2C19. 
6.  
AUC = area under the concentration-time curve; CYP = cytochrome P450; DDI = drug-drug interaction.

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 APPENDIX E:  RESCUE MEDICATION GUIDANCE 
The following guidelines should be utilized for selection of rescue medication: 
 If a hypertensive emergency appears imminent, refer the patient to seek urgent care in a clinic 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 Rescue medication use is permitted and recommended if the following blood pressure (BP) 
measurements are recorded in office: 
o Systolic BP (SBP) shows an acute and sustained increase of 30 mmHg (or greater) from 
baseline (Visit 1) measurement; and/or 
o SBP is 170 mmHg; and/or  
o Diastolic blood pressure is [ADDRESS_993763] clinical judgment when determining the need for rescue 
medications.  
o The following classes of antihypertensive agents may be used during the study: 
 Vasodilators; 
 Calcium channel blockers; 
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; 
 Angiotensin II receptor blockers; 
 Beta blockers;  
 Diuretics (Note: Use of potassium-sparing diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists are not allowed); and 
 Alpha blockers.  
o The following class of antihypertensive agents should not be used during the study: 
 Potassium-sparing diuretics; and 
 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 
 Investigators are encouraged to discuss selection of rescue medications with the study Medical 
Monitors. 
 Rescue medications may be continued until end of the study or discontinued at the 
 
 Down-titration of antihypertensive medication(s) is allowed as detailed in  Appendix F.

Version 2.0, 31 March 2023 APPENDIX F:  DOWN-TITRATION OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE 
MEDICATION(S) 
Down-titration of antihypertensive medication(s) is recommended for management of persistent 
or symptomatic hypotension in study patients. The following recommendations are provided as 
guidance to the Investigator: 
 The guiding principle for medical decision making with regard to blood pressure (BP) 
management in this study is to try to maintain patients on the highest dose of CIN-107 that is 
safe and medically reasonable. Study drug should be continued unless the Investigator feels it 
is necessary to stop for the safety of the patient. 
 To manage persistent or symptomatic hypotension in a step-wise fashion, the following are 
recommended to Investigators: 
o First, any rescue medication (see Appendix E ) that may have been started should be 
reduced or discontinued; 
o Then, the use of the single background antihypertensive (non-CIN-107) agent should be 
reduced or discontinued, if medically sound; 
o If the symptoms continue, the dose strength of CIN-107 may be down-titrated from 2 mg 
to 1 mg;  
o If the systolic BP (SBP) remains [ADDRESS_993764], 
the CIN-107 dose may be further down titrated to 0.5 mg; 
o CIN-107 may be temporarily discontinued if the SBP remains <[ADDRESS_993765]; and 
o Study drug dosing may be resumed or up-titrated after reassessments.

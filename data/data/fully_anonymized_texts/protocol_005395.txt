 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND  SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  2 study  of reduced  intensity  conditioning  (RIC)  and the transplantation  of an unrelated  donor  
umbilical  cord blood  (UCB)  graft in patients  with acute  myelogenous  leukemia  (AML),  acute  lymphoblastic  
leukemia  (ALL),  advanced  myelodysplasia  (MDS),  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML),  other  
myeloproliferative  disease  or Non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  unsuitable  for high dose myeloablative  conditioning.  
The aim is to obtain  a preliminary  estimate  of disease -free survival  at [ADDRESS_845275]  of cyclophosphamide  (Cy),  fludarabine  (Flu),  thiotepa  (Thio)  and low 
dose total body  irradiation  (TBI)  followed  by [CONTACT_362626] a double unit UCB graft.  Cyclosporine  (CSA)  and 
mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  will be used for GVHD  prophylaxis.  
 
Candidates  for this trial will include  patients:  1) aged 18-70 years  with AML,  ALL,  advanced  MDS,  CML,  
MPD  or Non-Hodgkins  or Hodgkins  lymphoma  at high risk of relapse  for whom  pre-transplant  induction  
chemotherapy  is possible;  and 2) high dose myeloablative  conditioning  is not appropriate.  
 
UCB  will be used as the source  of hematopoietic  stem cells (HSCs).  Grafts  will consist  of two partially  HLA - 
matched  UCB  units  to augment  graft cell dose.  Patients  will be carefully  monitored  post-transplant  for donor  
engraftment  and count  recovery,  donor  chimerism,  incidence  and severity  of acute  and chronic  graft -versus - 
host disease  (GVHD),  serious  infectious  complications,  transplant -related  mortality  (TRM),  characteristics  of 
immune  recovery,  as well as overall  and disease -free survival.  In addition,  laboratory  studies  will be performed  
to investigate  factors  that may be associated  with graft failure,  GVHD  and immune  recovery.  
 
Biostatistics  will be based on  a total of [ADDRESS_845276] 
6 years.  At the conclusion  of the study,  a preliminary  estimate  of the one-year disease -free survival  after 
UCBT  will be possible  with a confidence  of  0.13.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
Introduction  
Acute  leukemia  comprises  2% of all malignancies  in the United  States.  While  some  patients  are cured  with 
chemotherapy,  patients  with high-risk AML  in 1st remission  (e.g. AML  secondary  to MDS  and/or  high-risk 
cytogenetics),  high-risk ALL  in 1st remission  (e.g. Philadelphia  chromosome  positive),  and relapsed  acute  
leukemia  are not curable  with standard  therapy.  Similarly,  the only known  potentially  curative  treatment  for 
MDS  is allogeneic  transplant.  However,  widespread  application  of allogeneic  transplant  is limited  by [CONTACT_17588] a 
paucity  of suitably  matched  and readily  available  donors  and the inability  of older  patients,  or those  with co- 
morbidities,  to withstand  intensive  conditioning.  Treatment  strategies  for patients  with these  diseases  with the 
potential  for cure are needed.  This protocol  seeks  to investigate  the combined  approach  of UCB  as a HSC  
source  and reduced  intensity  conditioning  (RIC)  to resolve  these  limitations.  
 
An additional  high-risk AML  group  which  will be eligible  for this protocol  is any AML  patient  age > 55 years  
with intermediate -risk cytogenetics.  The very poor prognosis  of these  adult  AML  patients  at presentation  has 
recently  been highlighted  by [CONTACT_633115] [3]. This retrospective  analysis  of [ADDRESS_845278]  of age upon  outcome  when  treated  with 
chemotherapy.  Notably,  the median  DFS of patients  (n = 246) aged 56-65 years  was 7.4 months  (6.5-8.8) and 
8.3 months  (6.3-10.2)  in those  aged 66-75 years.  As shown  in Figure  1, at 3 years  after study  entry  the overall  
survival  of all patients  aged > 55 years  with intermediate  risk cytogenetics  was < 20%.  Those  with high risk 
cytogenetics  fared  worse  with all patients  having  a survival  of less than 20% at [ADDRESS_845279] been  supported  by [CONTACT_633116]  a 3 year survival  of less than 20% for 
older  patients  with intermediate  or high risk cytogenetics  [4]. Novel  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633094].  Therefore,  this protocol  will investigate  RIC allograft  for not only high-risk AML  patients  in CR1 
by [CONTACT_633117],  but also any AML  patients  in CR1 with intermediate -risk cytogenetics  age > 55 years.

Approved:  7-DEC -[ADDRESS_845280] a poor prognosis.  Cutler  et al 
reported  that survival  is maximized  if patients  in intermediate  2 and high International  Prognostic  Scoring  
System  groups  are transplanted  at diagnosis[5].  Patients  with advanced  MDS  will therefore  also be eligible  for 
this protocol.  Patients  will require  at least one cycle  of prior  induction  chemotherapy  or treatment  with 
decitabine  or azacitidine.  
 
Patients  with ALL  will also be eligible.  Both  relapsed  and poor-risk ALL  in CR1 are accepted  indications  for 
allograft.  Data from  the GOELAMS  group  has demonstrated  superior  overall  survival  of allogeneic  
transplantation  compared  to high-dose consolidative  therapy  with autologous  stem cell support  in poor-risk 
disease  [6]. The advantage  of allogeneic  transplant  was also highlighted  in the Plenary  Session  of the 2006  
ASH  conference  presented  by [CONTACT_633118][7]  in a large  MRC/ECOG  cooperative  trial. This analysis  
demonstrated  superior  OS, EFS,  and risks of relapse  in intermediate -risk ALL  patients  receiving  allograft  
versus  standard  post-remission  chemotherapy.  Moreover,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_633095]  > [ADDRESS_845281]  induction  chemotherapy  resulted  in median  overall  survival  of 7 months  supporting  the investigation  
of alternative  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  [8]. 
 
Finally,  other  high risk patients  with hematologic  malignancies  include  patients  with CML  who have 
developed  blast crisis  or failed  or are intolerant  of standard  therapy  with tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  and patients  
unable  to tolerate  the prolonged  consolidation  and maintenance  chemotherapy  regimens  fair very poorly.  
These  patients  are also appropriate  candidates  for allograft  as an alternative  treatment  strategy.  
 
 
Clinical  Results  of Allotransplant  in Acute  Leukemia  and MDS  
 
RIC is being  widely  investigated  as a potential  means  to extend  the possibility  of an allograft  and the 
associated  beneficial  GVL  effect  to older  patients  or patients  unsuitable  for a high-dose regimen.   This 
treatment  approach  is of particular  interest  in older  leukemic  patients  in the age range  of 50-[ADDRESS_845282] shown  that such conditioning  can be successfully  used to ensure  the 
engraftment  of either  sibling  or unrelated  volunteer  donor  HSC  with low TRM  even in patients  who are older  
or extensively pre -treated[9 -15]. These  results  demonstrate  that RIC transplant  in patients  with acute  leukemia,  
using  predominantly  sibling  donors,  is associated  with low TRM  despi[INVESTIGATOR_633096] 2. DFS after  RI allograft  vs chemotherapy  in elderly  AML/  MDS  patients.

 transplant  standards  and therefore  warrants  further  investigation.  A recent  prospective  study  by [CONTACT_633119], as shown  in Figure  2, supports  an advantage  of allogeneic  transplant  over chemotherapy  in elderly  AML  
and high risk MDS  [16].  
 
There  are a number  of limitations  of this approach,  however.  Firstly,  the intensity  of the preparative  regimen  
necessary  to ensure  disease  control  for these  patients  has not been fully defined.  Also,  non-myeloablative  
transplantation  for patients  with acute  leukemia  in relapse  has not been successful.  Further,  for those  with high 
risk disease,  while  TRM  can be reduced  after RIC as compared  to higher  dose conditioning,  the risk of relapse  
is concomitantly  increased.  While  some  investigators,  such as Flynn  et al, have shown  a comparable  DFS after 
RIC to that after ablative  conditioning  in patients  with AML  and MDS[17],  too much  reduction  in preparative  
intensity  may be insufficient  to ensure  disease  control.  For example,  in a study  by [CONTACT_633120]-ablative  conditioning  was associated  with improved  TRM,  a more  intense,  but still reduced  
intensity  approach  was associated  with both improved  donor  engraftment  and decreased  relapse  resulting  in 
superior  progression -free survival  [18].  Therefore,  in this protocol,  a RIC regimen  will be utilized  in 
preference  to a truly non-ablative  regimen.  
 
A further  limitation  of allogeneic  transplantation  is that many  patients  do not have a sibling  or unrelated  
volunteer  donor  that is both suitably  matched  and available  in the required  time period.  MSKCC  data to date 
demonstrates  that UCB  extends  transplant  access  to patients  of ancestry  other  than northwestern  Europe  
without  suitable  unrelated  donors  including  racial  and ethnic  minorities  (Table  1). In addition,  UCB  is 
available  faster  than unrelated  donors  [26].  Therefore,  in this protocol  UCB  will be inves tigated  as an 
alternative  HSC.

(n = 38). The vast majority  of 
patients  received  UCB  if they did 
not have a suitably  matched  
unrelated  donor.  Unrelated  Donor  UCBT  after  Reduced  Intensity  Conditioning  
 
Multiple  reports  have documented  that UCB  is capable  of 
reconstituting  hematopoiesis  after  intensive   myeloablative  
therapy[1,  19-26]. Results  of unrelated  donor  UCBT  have 
demonstrated  that banked  UCB  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_633097][27]  and can 
successfully  engraft  the majority  of small  children  with a relatively  
low incidence  of acute  and chronic  GVHD  despi[INVESTIGATOR_633098][24].  This HSC  source  therefore  permits  an expansion  of the 
donor  pool and UCBT  has become  a standard  alternative  for the 
treatment  of pediatric  leukemia.  
 
In contrast,  adult UCBT  has been  limited by [CONTACT_633121] 
[18, 23, 25]. Therefore,  for larger  adolescents  and adult  patients  
undergoing  UCBT,  efforts  have focused  on improving  engraftment  
and decreasing  TRM.  To address  this problem  the combined  
transplantation  of two UCB  units  in a double  unit graft has been 
investigated  as a strategy  to augment  graft cell dose[26].  The initial  
University  of Minnesota  experience  in 31 double  unit myeloablative  
UCBT  patients  (median  age 24 years;  range  13-53) with hematologic  
malignancy  was associated  with sustained  neutrophil  engraftment  in 
all evaluable  patients  (n = 29) at a median  of 23 days (range  14-41). Interestingly,  this engraftment  was 
accounted  for by [CONTACT_633122] -match  predicting  unit predominance.  The 
incidences  of grade  III-IV acute  GVHD,  chronic  GVHD,  and TRM  were  24% (95%  CI: 9-39) at 100 days,  
32% (95%CI:  13-51) at 1 year,  and 20% (95%CI:  6-34) at 6 months,  respectively.  At a median  follow -up of 
1.2 years  (range  55 days-3.2 years),  the Kaplan -Meier  estimate  of disease -free survival  at 2 years  was 60% 
(95%CI:  41-79) in all patients,  and 68% (95%CI:  47-89) in patients  (n = 23) transplanted  in remission.

Non-myeloablative  UCBT  has been investigated  utilizing  double  unit grafts  in those  inappropriate  for high 
dose conditioning  in 110 high-risk adults  (median  age 51 years)  with high-risk or advanced  hematologic  
malignancies  [1, 2]. Patients  received  cyclophosphamide  50 mg/kg,  fludarabine  200 mg/m2, and 200 cGy TBI 
(+anti-thymocyte  globulin),  with cyclosporine -A and mycophenolate  mofetil,  and either  single  (n = 17) or 
double  (n = 93) 4-6/6 HLA -matched  UCB  units  with a median  total infused  dose of 3.7  x  107 NC/kg.  
Neutrophil  recovery  occurred  in 92% of patients  at a median  of 12 days (range  0-32). The cumulative  
incidence  of sustained  donor  engraftment  was 85% (95%CI:  77-92) overall.  The cumulative  incidence  of grade  
II-IV acute  GVHD  was 59% (95%CI:  49-69) at day 100, and chronic  GVHD  was 23% (95%CI:  15-31) at 1 
year,  with a TRM  of 19% (95%CI:  12-26) at day 180 and 26% (95%CI:  18-34) at 3 years.  Notably,  TRM  was 
significantly  reduced  in patients  > 45 years  compared  to those  < 45 years  (15%  vs 32%,  P=.02)  at 180 days.  
The probability  of EFS was 38% (95%CI:  28-48) at  [ADDRESS_845284] satisfactory  fitness  and 
reasonable  progression -free survival  in this high-risk patient  population.  Notably,  the survival  after non- 
ablative   UCBT   is  comparable   to  that  of  sibling   donor  non-ablative   allograft   [29].      However,   prior

chemotherapy  has been found  to be an important  factor  in ensuring  donor  engraftment  after non-myeloablative  
therapy.  As seen in University  of Minnesota  data in Figure  3, patients  with recent  combination  chemotherapy  
or a prior  autologous  transplant  had a 98% cumulative  incidence  of sustained  donor  engraftment.  This is in 98%  (95%CI: 94 - 100)

 comparison  to only 64% sustained  engraftment  in patients  without  such prior  therapy  likely  due to the 
ability  of the latter  group  to reject  their grafts.  
 
This protocol  will therefore:  1) dictate  at least one cycle  of prior  chemotherapy  (including  decitabine  or 
azacitidine  for MDS  or a tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  for CML);  and, 2) utilize  a RIC regimen  rather  than non- 
myeloablative  conditioning.  Combined,  this approach  should  enhance  both disease  control  and donor  
engraftment.  However,  to ameliorate  potential  organ  toxicity  in older  patients  >/= 60 years  and those  with 
significant  comorbidities,  a regimen  with only 5 mg/kg thiotepa  will be investigated  for this patient  population.  
 
Because  any patient  receiving  less than a fully ablative  regiment  is at increased  risk of graft rejection,  this 
protocol  will also perform  correlative  laboratory  studies  to investigate  whether  pre-transplant  T-cell function  
and/or  HLA  antibodies  are associated  with mixed  donor  chimerism  or graft rejection.  Blood  of patients  with 
myelodysplasia  and chronic  phase  CML  will be assayed  pre-transplant  in the Clinical  Laboratory  (Katherine  
Smith,  PhD)  to quantify  T cell numbers  (CD3+CD4+/CD8+)  and T cell proliferative  capacity  as measured  by 
[CONTACT_633123].  Additionally,  HLA  antibodies  will be measured  in all patients  at the American  Red Cross  HLA  
Laboratory  (Susan  Hsu, PhD).  Those  patients  with a positive  screen  for antibody(ies)  against  HLA  Class  I 
(A,B,C)  and/or  Class  II (DRB1,DQ)  loci will have the HLA  specificity(ies)  of the antibody(ies)  determined  in 
a semi -quantitative  assay.  Antibodies  of most  interest  will be those  directed  against  HLA  loci exclusively  
present  in the donor.   Results  of the T cell count  and activity,  and presence  of HLA  allo-antibodies  (especially  
if against  donor  HLA  loci) will be correlated  with the risk of graft failure  and donor  chimerism  measured  at 
days 21 (BM),  28 and 60 (blood)  post-transplant.  In addition,  correlative  laboratory  studies  of double  unit 
biology  will be performed,  and immune  recovery  and serum  markers  of GVHD  will be assessed.  
 
Summary  
 
Select  patients  with high risk 1st remission  or relapsed  acute  leukemia,  advanced  MDS,  CML,  or MPD  may 
benefit  from  the GVL  effect  of allogeneic  transplant.  However,  many  patients  with these  diseases  do not have 
a suitably  matched  related  or unrelated  donor  and are not suitable  candidates  for conventional  high-dose 
conditioning.  UCBT  with RIC is a valid  alternative  for these  patients.  Prior  chemotherapy  will be given  to 
facilitate  donor  engraftment  and optimize  disease  control.  In addition,  a reduced  intensity  rather  than a truly 
non-myeloablative  approach  will be used to enhance  both engraftment  and disease  control.  Non-Hodgkins

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN / INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a phase  2 study to evaluate  the disease -free survival  after RIC UCBT,  utilizing double  unit grafts  to 
augment  graft cell dose,  in patients  with acute  leukemia,  advanced  MDS,  CML,  MPD  or Non-Hodgkins  
lymphoma  (including  CLL)  not suitable  for ablative  conditioning.  Pre-transplant  chemotherapy  will be 
required  as part of transplant  eligibility,  both to contribute  to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_633100].  This should  consist  of induction  (or re- 
induction)  chemotherapy.  Problems  with engraftment  or severe  GVHD  after UCBT  and other  adverse  
experiences  will be monitored  throughout  the study  by [CONTACT_633124].  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_633101]  > 30% at day [ADDRESS_845286] UCBT.

transplant.  
 
Candidates  for this trial will include  patients:  1) aged 18-70 years  with AML,  ALL,  advanced  MDS,  CML,  
MPD  or Non-Hodgkins  lymphoma  who are at a high risk of relapse  for whom  pre-transplant  induction  
chemotherapy  is possible;  and 2) myeloablative  conditioning  is not appropriate.  
 
Transplant  conditioning  will consist  of cyclophosphamide  (Cy),  fludarabine  (Flu),  thiotepa  (Thio)  and low 
dose total body  irradiation  (TBI)  followed  by [CONTACT_362626] a double  unit UCB  graft.  A less intense  
regimen  will be used in patients  >/= 60 years  and those  with significant  comorbidities.  Cyclosporine  
(CSA)  and mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  will be used for GVHD  prophylaxis.  UCB  will be used as the 
source  of hematopoietic  stem cells (HSCs).  Grafts  will consist  of two partially  HLA -matched  UCB units to 
augment  graft cell dose.

9.3 GVHD prophylaxis  
19 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#:  08-087 A(18)  
Approved:  7-DEC -2016   
 All patients  will receive  GVHD  prophylaxis  with 2 drugs  as follows:  
 
Cyclosporine  
 
• Cyclosporine  A (CSA)  will be given  per current MSKCC  guidelines.  
• It will begin  on day -3 intravenously  in the AM to achieve  therapeutic  levels  per MSKCC  
guidelines.  
• Initial  dosing  will be per the MSKCC  guidelines  of 3 mg/kg  per dose (adjusted  weight  in the 
setting  of marked  obesity)  starting  day -3 and dose adjustments  should  be made  on the basis  of 
toxicity  and sub - or supra -therapeutic  CSA  levels.  
• Once  the patient can tolerate  oral medications,  CSA can be converted  to an oral form.  
• In case of major  CSA  toxicity  (e.g. CNS  neurotoxicity  documented  by [CONTACT_9268]),  CSA  should  be 
discontinued.  Patients  may be re-challenged  when  clinically  appropriate  and alternative  immune  
suppression  should  be substituted  per MSKCC guidelines.  
• Patients  unable  to tolerate  CSA  due to renal  impairment  should  also be considered  for an 
alternative  immunosuppressant  in addition  to mycophenolate  mofetil  as per MSKCC guidelines.  
• Standard  patients  will receive  CSA  for approximately  5-6 months  in the absence  of ongoing  
GVHD  requiring  systemic  immune  suppression.  If no history  or evidence  of GVHD,  CSA  may be 
tapered  with monitoring  for GVHD  with the aim to be off immunosuppression  by [CONTACT_3450]  
8-9 months  after transplant.  
• In patients  intolerant  of CSA  due to renal  impairment  or other  toxicity  CSA  can be tapered  before  
MMF.  This is a reverse  taper  (see guidelines).  
• For patients  with GVHD,  CSA  may be continued  for longer  time periods  according  to standard  of 
care guidelines  
• If disease  progression  or persistence  occurs,  or the patient  is considered  to be at very high risk of 
relapse,  early  taper  or cessation  of CSA  can be considered  with close  observation  for GVHD.  
 
Mycophenolate  Mofetil  
 
• Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  will be given  per current  MSKCC  MMF  guidelines.  It should  
begin  on day -[ADDRESS_845296]  dose for adults  is 15 mg per kg per dose IV q8 
hours -see detailed  dosing  instructions  in the 
• Obtain  therapeutic  trough  levels  as per MSKCC guidelines.  
• In preparation  for discharge,  switch  to oral route  (CellCept  or generic  mycophenolate  mofetil).  For 
oral conversion  round  to tablet  size. If possible  ensure  both tablet  strengths  are given  to patient  to 
permit  easy taper  in clinic.  On Pediatric  Service  can use liquid  suspension.  Avoid  suspension  on 
Adult  Service.  
• No dose adjustments  for renal  or liver disease  are needed  routinely  unless  severe  organ  
dysfunction.  
• If patient  is > +28 days and without  neutrophil  engraftment,  consideration  can be made  to dose 
reduce  dosing  after discussion  with PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-PI. 
• If no evidence  of GVHD,  MMF  can be tapered  at approximately  60-[ADDRESS_845297]-transplant.  
Taper  at approximately  10-20% decrements.  The aim to be off the drug by [CONTACT_3450]  5-6 
months.  Earlier  tapers  can be considered  if myelosuppression  or high relapse  risk with very close  
monitoring  for GVHD.  Abrupt  reductions  or cessation  should  be avoided  due to GVHD risk.  
• Patients  who are intolerant  of MMF  due to myelosuppression  may require  earlier  taper  at the 
treating  physician’s  discretion.  Do not abruptly  stop the drug unless  life-threatening  toxicity  is 
suspected.

Approved:  7-DEC -2016   
 • If the patient  is intolerant  of CSA,  MMF  taper  may be delayed  i.e. do a reverse  taper  
where  CSA tapered  first (see above).  
• If the patient  has acute  GVHD  requiring  systemic  therapy,  MMF  should  only be tapered  if control  
of GVHD has  been obtained  
 
 
9.4 UCB  Thaw  and Administration  
 
• Units  will be thawed  by [CONTACT_633132]  (SOPs)  and release  criteria.  As per standard  practice,  ABO  blood  group,  total nucleated  
cells (TNC),  CD34+  and CD3+  cell number  and viability,  sterility  and colony -forming  units  (CFU)  
will be measured  post-thaw.  
• If cell dose permits  (< 1% of the post-thaw  TNC  of each unit) will be used for laboratory  research  
studies  (see Section  10.5).  
• Units  should  be administered  promptly  upon  arrival  to the patient  care unit by [CONTACT_362642] a BMT attending  physician.  UCB infusion  nursing  guidelines  should  
be followed.  
• Units  should  be given  consecutively  each over approximately  30-45 minutes,  but can be slowed  for 
serious  infusion  reactions  as appropriate.  
• Pre-medication  should  be as per current  cord blood  infusion  guidelines.  
• IV hydration  per standard  of care.  
 
Following  infusion  the bag and tubing  from  each UCB  unit must  be submitted  to the Microbiology  
Laboratory.  Specimen  from  each UCB  unit for Diagnostic  Molecular  Pathology  will be forwarded  by [CONTACT_633133].  
 
9.5 Growth  Factor  (G-CSF)  after  UCBT  
 
G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day  IV/SQ  (dose  rounded  to vial size to a maximum  of 480 mcg)  will be given  to all 
patients  post UCBT  as from day +[ADDRESS_845298]  1) Bacteria  during  neutropenic  period  2) Pneumocystis  carinii,  3) Herpes  simplex  and 
Herpes  Zoster,  and 4) fungal  infections.  Sero-positive  patients  will be closely  monitored  for activation  of 
CMV and CMV  viremia  will be treated  according  to the BMT  guidelines.  
 
10.3 Transfusions  
 
Following  initiation  of the pre-transplant  cytoreduction,  all blood  products  for transfusion  (with  the 
exception  of the stem  cell graft)  will be irradiated  as per MSKCC guidelines.

10.6 Correlative  Laboratory  Studies  
 
Pre-transplant  Assays  
 
• Anti-HLA  antibodies:  An immunofluorescence -microarray  based  technique,  performed  by [CONTACT_633134],  will be used to screen  patients’  serum  pre-transplant  for 
specific  anti-HLA -A, B, C, DRB1,  and DQ  antibodies  (all patients).  
 
Double  Unit Biology  Studies  
 
Laboratory  research  studies  will be performed  using  a maximum  of ≤1%  of each unit on the day of 
thaw  investigating  the determinants  of (or factors  associated  with)  unit predominance  in patient  
engraftment.  The correlative  studies  will include:  
 
• Characterization  of the composition  of each unit by [CONTACT_4133]  (Clinical  Laboratory,  Supervisor  
Katherine  Smith).  
 
Additional  Studies  may include:  
 
• Analysis  of the Killer  Ig-like receptor  (KIR)  genotype  to assess  if NK alloreactive  cells are 
involved  in unit predominance  ([CONTACT_362666]’s  Laboratory).  
 
As a maximum  of 1% of each unit will be used for research,  these  studies  may be limited  by [CONTACT_633135].  Therefore,  not all studies  may be performed  on every  double  unit pair and 
the experiments  will be prioritized  by [CONTACT_633136].  
The results  of the laboratory  studies  will be correlated  with the engraftment  of each unit in the patients  
(see Section  14.0).  
 
Immune  Recovery  
 
Immune  recovery  testing  will be performed  as per current  ABMT  guidelines.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_845301]-transplant  evaluations  are summarized  in the following  table.  Scheduled  evaluations  for day 21 should  
be performed  +/-2 days,  for day 28 should  be performed  +4/-2 days.  For day 60, evaluations  should  be 
performed  +/-7 days.  For day 100, evaluations  should  be performed  +/- 10 days.  For 6 and 9 months  should  
be done  +/-14 days,  and 1 year,  18 months,  2 years  should  be performed  +/-30 days of  the targeted  date.

transplant.  The patient’s  referring  physician,  in consultation  with the MSKCC  transplant  physician,  may 
assist  with follow -up. 
 
Chronic  GVHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to MSKCC  criteria.  Assessments  will be obtained  
at approximately  day 100, 6, and [ADDRESS_845307]  of care guidelines.  Patients  will be 
vaccinated  after transplant  as per current  MSKCC  guidelines  or as clinically  appropriate.  Note  immune  
studies  will not be drawn  if the patient  has severe  cytopenia  precluding  testing  and IgG levels  will not 
measured  per protocol  during  the time the patient  is IVIg dependent.  
 
Also,  research  blood  (approximately  20 cc) will be obtained  to assess  the recovery  of NK and T cells at 6

11.1 TOXICITIES/  SIDE -EFFECTS  
 
11.2 Toxicity  Grading  
Toxicities  will be graded  according  to Adult  BMT  Guidelines.  
11.3 Total  Body  Irradiation  (TBI)  
The dose of TBI in this regimen  is low and therefore  the side-effects  that may be associated  with high doses  
of radiation  should  be minimal.  At the dose of radiation  in this study  mild nausea  and vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis,  fever,  alopecia,  and transient  erythema  may occur  but should  be mild and can be treated  
symptomatically.  
Radiation  contributes  to the immune  suppression  induced  by [CONTACT_633137].  This is a major  toxicity  of the preparative  regimen  and is treated  by [CONTACT_633138].  
High  doses  of radiation  in combination  with high dose chemotherapy  may contribute  to damage  to vital 
organs  such as the lung or the liver.   Such  toxicity  is unlikely  with the doses  in this protocol.  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN  KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#:  08-087 A(18)  
Approved:  7-DEC -[ADDRESS_845308] transplant  and 
treated  with hormonal  replacement  as indicated.  Radiation  could  contribute  to the risk for sterility  that is 
primarily  from  chemotherapy.  The risk increases  with the number  of years  since  puberty.  
 
11.4 Cyclophosphamide  
 
Nausea,  vomiting  and anorexia:  virtually  all patients  will experience  nausea  and vomiting  after intravenous  
cyclophosphamide.  This can be significantly  diminished  with anti-emetics.  
 
Fatigue.  
 
Diarrhea:  most  patients  develop  some  diarrhea  in the first 1-[ADDRESS_845309] cyclophosphamide.  This is treated  
symptomatically.  
 
Myelosuppression  and immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by [CONTACT_633139].  
 
Mucositis:  most  patients  will develop  mild to moderate  mucositis  of the oral and GI tracts,  which  will be 
managed  with supportive  care.  
 
Skin changes:  transient  skin rashes  have been described.  Alopecia  is always  seen but is usually  reversible.  
 
Hemorrhagic  cystitis  is a potential  complication  and can be variable  in severity.  Severe  cystitis  is unlikely.  
The risk of cystitis  will be reduced  by [CONTACT_633140].  Fluid  weight  gain and edema  is associated  
with this fluid flush  but is transient  and can be treated  with diuretics  if necessary.  
 
Syndrome  of inappropriate  anti-diuretic  hormone  (SIADH)  can be seen but is transient  and will spontaneously  
resolve  after drug administration.  
 
Cardiomyopathy  has been described  with cyclophosphamide  but is very rare. 
 
High  doses  of cyclophosphamide  may contribute  to damage  to vital organs  such as the lung or the liver.  This 
is unlikely  due to the reduced  intensity  of this protocol.  
 
Late effects  include  sterility.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_845310] been described.  
Immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by [CONTACT_633141].  
 
Effects  on the nervous  system  are rare, but  if they occur  could  include  confusion,  coma,  weakness  or 
numbness,  loss of balance,  difficulty  walking,  or loss of vision  and could  be very serious  or lethal.

 11.6 Thiotepa  
 
Side effects  of thiotepa  include:  alopecia,  nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  Thiotepa  can also cause  
myelosuppression,  pancytopenia,  sterility  and fevers.  
 
Other  less likely  side effects  include  dizziness  and transient  hepatic  transaminase  elevation.  Rare  but serious  
side effects  include  CNS  toxicity  manifested  by [CONTACT_12704],  mild cognitive  dysfunction,  disorientation,  
confusion,  irritability,  and bizarre  behavior;  as well as, interstitial pneumonitis  and renal  failure.  
 
11.7 Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  
 
The major  toxicity  of MMF  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for infection.  This is 
managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and treatment  of infectious  complications.  
 
Other  potential  side-effects  include  myelosuppression,  headache,  insomnia,  aches  and pains,  rash,  nausea,  
anorexia  and diarrhea.  
 
There  is also a very rare side effect  known  as Progressive  Multifocal  Leukoencephalopathy (PML), which  is a 
progressive  disease  of the nervous  system  that can cause  severe  disability  or death.  A very small  number  of 
cases  of PML  have been  reported  in patients  treated  with MMF.  PML  can cause  hemiparesis,  confusion,  
cognitive  deficiencies  and ataxia.  
 
11.8 Cyclosporine -A (CSA)  
 
The major  toxicity  of CSA  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for infection.  This is 
managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and treatment  of infectious  complications.  
 
Renal  dysfunction  is common  and is treated  by [CONTACT_633142].  
Electrolyte  abnormalities  involving  potassium  and magnesium  are also common  and electrolytes  must  be 
closely  monitored.  
 
Increased  blood  pressure  is common  and is treated  with anti-hypertensive  medication(s).  
 
Neurological  side effects  include  tremor  (common),  seizures  (rare),  confusion,  ataxia,  cortical  blindness  
(rare),  and peripheral  neuropathies  and are usually  reversible  with cessation  of the medication.  
 
While  mild to moderate  microangiopathic  hemolysis  is relatively  common,  serious  thrombotic  
thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP)  is rare. 
 
Gastrointestinal  side-effects  include  anorexia  and nausea,  swollen  gums,  and hyperbilirubinemia.  
Skin changes  include  hirsutism  and gingival  hyperplasia.  
11.9 G-CSF (Neupogen)  
 
Side-effects  of G-CSF are generally  mild,  include  bone  pain,  headaches,  body  aches,  fatigue,  edema  and 
nausea  and are managed  with supportive  care.  Pleuro - or pericarditis  are seen rarely  and are managed  by 
[CONTACT_362651].

Approved:  7-DEC -[ADDRESS_845312]  of care.  These  products  may also transmit  serious  infections  (e.g.,  CMV,  
hepatitis,  HIV).  To circumvent  this, blood  donors  are screened  according  to AABB  and FACT  guidelines.  All 
blood  products  (other  than the UCB  graft)  are irradiated  to circumvent  the risk of GVHD  caused  by 
[CONTACT_362652].  
Toxicities  potentially  associated  with the infusion  of the UCB graft  include  DMSO  toxicity  and side effects  
from  red cells and may include changes  in heart  rate or rhythm,  changes  in blood  pressure,  fever,  chills,  
sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  headache,  dyspnea,  presence  of DMSO taste  and 
odor, hemoglobinuria,  and acute  renal failure.  However  due to the dilution  step and pre-medication  these  
toxicities  are unlikely.  The process  of CB engraftment  can also be associated  with a pre-engraftment  
syndrome  characterized  by [CONTACT_362653][INVESTIGATOR_93027].  This process  is highly  
responsive  to corticosteroid  therapy  and this will be treated  according  to accepted  clinical  practice.  
 
 
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  end-point  of this study  is the disease -free survival  (survival  without  malignant  relapse)  at one year 
post-transplant.  Disease  free survival  at two years  and overall  disease  free survival  at one and two years  will be 
monitored  as secondary  endpoints.  Other important  outcomes  include:  
 
12.2 Failure  of Neutrophil  Recovery  and/or  Donor  Engraftment  
 
The following  definitions  will be used:  
 
• The day  of neutrophil  recovery is the 1st day of  3 consecutive  days of absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  at 
or above  [ADDRESS_845313]-UCBT  nadir.  
• Donor  chimerism will  be defined  as either  partial  (10-89% donor)  or complete  (> 90% donor)  and should  
be recorded  as to whether  it is sampled  from  the patient's  marrow  or peripheral  blood  and which  UCB  
unit engrafts  (by [CONTACT_633143]).  If both UCB  donors  engraft,  the total donor  chimerism  (contribution  of 
each donor  added  together)  as well as the contribution  of each donor  individually  should  be documented.  
• Primary  graft failure  = no neutrophil  recovery  by [CONTACT_4475] 45 (regardless  of donor  chimerism)  or autologous

• Secondary  graft failure  = loss of ANC  to < 500/µL  for 14 consecutive  days after initial  recovery  or loss of 
donor  chimerism  to < 10% donor  after primary  donor  engraftment  has been achieved  not due to 
progressive  malignancy  within  the marrow.  
• Successful  primary  donor  engraftment  = neutrophil  recovery  within  the first 45 days after transplant  and 
partial/complete  donor  chimerism  (> 10%).  
• Successful  sustained  donor  engraftment  = successful  primary  donor  engraftment  without  subsequent  graft 
failure  beyond  45 days.  This will be reported  along  with the median  (range)  of total donor  chimerism  at 
serial time points  post-UCBT.  
 
Patients  with suspected  graft failure  will be evaluated  with bone  marrow  biopsy  to assess  BM cellularity  and 
assess  for residual  or recurrent  disease,  and molecular  analyses  of marrow.  Patients  who suffer  failure  of 
donor  engraftment  will be managed  with supportive  care if they have autologous  recovery  and adequate  
hematopoiesis,  or re-infused  with either  a second  UCB  graft or other  stem cell source  if they are aplastic.  
Management  of graft failure  is as per MSKCC  standard  of care.

Acute  GVHD  is manifested  by [CONTACT_362656],  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea  and ulceration  of the intestines,  
hyperbilirubinemia  and hepatitis,  and suppressed  or delayed  recovery  of the hematopoietic  and immune  
system.  Standard  clinical  criteria,  and histological  grading  of skin,  liver or gastrointestinal  pathology  where  
possible,  will be used to establish  and grade  acute  GVHD.  In the first [ADDRESS_845315] practice  of the Adult  BMT  service.  Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GVHD  
(grade  II-IV) will be treated  as per standard  of care.  Patients  failing  to respond  to steroids  will be considered  
for treatment  with standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  agents  Chronic  GVHD  is characterized  to 
varying  degrees  by [CONTACT_362657],  scleroderma -like changes  of the skin,  chronic  
inflammation  and scarring  of the gastrointestinal  tract with consequent  malabsorption  and diarrhea,  
inflammation  of the liver,  suppression  of the immune  system and occasionally other  auto-immune  phenomena  
(eg auto-immune  hemolysis)  or involvement  of other  organs  (eg pulmonary  involvement).  Chronic  GVHD  
will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to the MSK  criteria  and treated  with standard  or experimental  
immunosuppressive  therapy.  Patients  will be assessed  for GVHD  at day 100, 6 months,  1, and  2 years.

 14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
14.2 Clinical  Endpoints  
 
This is a phase  2 study  of RIC UCBT  utilizing  double  unit grafts  in selected  patients  with acute  leukemia,  
MDS,  and Non-Hodgkins  lymphoma  (see Section  6.1 for disease  eligibility  criteria).  As of July 1 2015,  the 
accrual  of 55 patients  to the protocol  is near complete.  Therefore,  the protocol  is amended  to accrue  an 
additional  25 patients  for a total of 80 patients.  These  additional  patients  will provide  a more  precise  estimate  
of the disease -free and overall  survival  in this patient  population.  With  80 patients  transplanted,  the one-year 
overall  and disease -free survival  probability  can be estimated  to within  ± 0.11.

At the conclusion of the study,  the population  recovery rates  for hematologic  and immunologic  factors  will be 
estimated  using  kernel  derived  growth  curves.  Kernel  smoothing  provides  a non-parametric  estimate  of the 
population  recovery rates  over time.  These longitudinal  measures  will be correlated  with the characteristics  of 
the engrafting  unit, the time to infectious  complications,  and survival  time using  a marginal  regression  model  
and the time-dependent  covariate  Cox model.  In addition,  the time to neutrophil  and platelet  engraftment,  and 
the time to acute  and chronic  GVHD will  be assessed  using  the cumulative  incidence  function.  
 
14.3 Laboratory  Studies  
 
Laboratory  research  studies  will be performed  investigating:  
 
• The determinants  of unit predominance  to facilitate  the understanding  of the biology  of double  unit 
UCBT.  The results  of these  studies  will be correlated  with the engraftment  of each unit in the patients  
testing  if the laboratory  results  predict  or correlate  with unit predominance  in the patient.  The Wilcoxon

http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm . 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  and quality.  
There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data 
verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  
procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  
the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  
(DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level  of risk and 
degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  
sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established

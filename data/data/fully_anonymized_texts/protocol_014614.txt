1     The WELL Study (Wellness Education for Liver Health Study): Reducing liver disease in genetically predisposed adults   Version: 12-2-21 HUM00154361     Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195771], PhD  Methodology:   We will examine the feasibility and acceptability of our four-month, online, dietary intervention among 40 adults with NAFLD from a high-risk subpopulation (rs738409-GG and rs738409-CG). Participant recruitment, liver clinic evaluation, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. We have already identified candidates from the Michigan Genomics Initiative using their electronic medical records including outpatient laboratory values that are homozygous for PNPLA3 rs738409 and have elevated liver-function tests (median alanine aminotransferase above 35 international U/L). They have already consented to be re-contact[CONTACT_823118]. The clinical characteristics of eligible participants are given in Table 2. We will contact [CONTACT_823119] a postcard describing the study, either in an envelope or with mailing information directly on the postcard. We may also send a follow up letter or flyer describing the study, in an envelope with either a handwritten or a typed address. Potential participants may also receive a phone call. Interested participants will fill out a screening survey; study team members will review their medical records for exclusions and elevated liver function tests. Participants that appear to meet inclusion and do not have exclusion criteria, based on their survey and medical chart, (Table 3) and agree to participate will be referred to our liver clinic to be evaluated to rule out other causes of elevated liver function tests (such as medications or high levels of alcohol intake). Participants who are taking blood glucose-lowering medications will be considered eligible for the trial. However, participants taking insulin will be excluded from participation. If the study team finds that recruitment is too slow and excluding insulin is too restrictive, participants taking insulin will be considered for enrollment. These participants will receive extra attention by [CONTACT_823120]. See Safety and medication management section below. Table 3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

[ADDRESS_1141409]. Speliotes at Michigan Medicine’s Taubman Center liver clinic and the second will be a baseline liver MRI; participants will receive instructions to call and schedule their baseline MRI to ensure the schedulers have accurate safety information when scheduling the appointment. The virtual visit will be scheduled within one month of the phone call, the second will be scheduled two to four weeks after the first. Participants who elect to participate in the optional induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell research will be asked to informally schedule a time to get their blood drawn at the Taubman blood draw clinic. This blood draw must take place at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823114]. Participants will choose a time on a weekday, ideally in the morning, within two weeks of their appointment with [CONTACT_823124]. At the virtual visit, [CONTACT_823124] will evaluate the full medical history and physical health. History will be evaluated for cardiovascular disease (angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure). If participants are not getting blood drawn for iPSC research, then they will proceed to a fasting blood draw at any MM Labs location (no appointment needed) within one to two weeks following this virtual visit. If participants are getting blood drawn for iPSC research and scheduled a time for their blood draw during their consent visit, then they will go to the Taubman Center blood draw clinic at the time of their appointment. A member of [CONTACT_823124]’ team will either meet with participants when they arrive at the clinic to provide resarch tubes to the phlebotomist for the iPSC samples or will arrive immediately following the participant’s blood draw to collect the samples. Blood tests will be drawn to assess (1) the cause of elevated liver function tests (complete blood count with differential; comprehensive metabolic panel; prothrombin time; C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; iron studies (iron level, iron binding capacity, percent transferrin saturation, ferritin); antinuclear antibodies; anti-LKM-1 antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies; antismooth muscle antibodies; and alpha-1-antitrypsin levels), (2) diabetes (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and hemoglobin A1c), and (3) dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (serum lipid panel). Additionally, participants will have excess whole blood and serum drawn during their appointments. This serum (SST tube) will be transported to a lab in the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health and tested for levels of an appetite suppressing hormone (growth differentiation factor: GDF15). For participants contributing blood for iPSC research, two tubes of whole blood (ACD solution A tubes or two CPT with sodium citrate tubes) will be drawn and transported to a lab within Medical Sciences Building II (Speliotes Lab). Participants may opt out of this step in the main study consent form. Also in the week following their virtual visit, participants must fill out an additional survey providing personal information, including their address (for mailed materials) and their primary care provider’s name [CONTACT_91985]. Participants will also track their food for three days on the MyFitnessPal website or complete two 24-hour dietary recalls over the phone. The study team will reach out to the primary care providers of participants who have eligible blood tests. Primary care providers must approve their patient’s participation before the subject is enrolled, within one month of first contact [CONTACT_103904]. Primary care providers of participants who are taking blood glucose-lowering medications other than metformin will be advised that their patient may stop their medications as they begin the program to avoid risk of hypoglycemia. All primary care providers will be informed that their patient may reach out to them if they’re experiencing symptoms or may need further medication adjustments.  Participants may be ineligible after their blood tests and virtual visit. If no other cause of elevated liver function tests is found except for NAFLD and the patient meets inclusion with no exclusion criteria, the patient will attend their second appointment at the main Michigan Medicine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823115] a baseline standard-of-care, clinical liver MRI-derived proton density fat fraction test, the gold standard for non-invasive measurement of both hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Prior to this appointment, participants of childbearing potential will be mailed a urine pregnancy test. They’ll be instructed to take this test the day of their MRI and to send a photo of the result to the study email (they can write their result if they’re uncomfortable with a photo). 
[ADDRESS_1141410] will be asked not to come in for their appointment and will not be eligible for the trial. At the second appointment, participants will complete an MRI screening with the technicians and may be ineligible if they are unfit for an MRI. Those whose MRI shows steatosis, mild fibrosis, and early cirrhosis (F1-4), will be invited into the trial, as these are the patients for whom we may be able to reverse fibrosis with intervention. (See Figure 1 for the full flowchart of the study.) If participants are ineligible after completing their MRI, they will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1141411]. The “psychological self-report” listed in Figure 1 for baseline and 4-month assessments includes questions concerning health-related quality of life,[1] dietary intake, physical activity,[2, 3] food cravings,[4] stress eating,[5, 6] dietary-based social support,[7] and hunger.[8]  Participants who are eligible after their MRI and have completed all other baseline measurements will be mailed a digital scale. Participants must weigh themselves on this scale within two weeks of receipt, before being enrolled in the trial.  Many of these measurements are standard of care for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and will be charged to the participant’s insurance. Baseline and follow up virtual visits, the baseline clinical liver MRI, and all baseline and follow up blood tests (with the exception of the excess serum, excess whole blood, and the fasting insulin tests) will be charged to the participant’s insurance. Participants will be informed of this during the consent process and will be encouraged to check their plans to ensure they have coverage. The study will cover the costs of all other measurements and materials.  
 NAFLD standard of care. All participants will receive care at our NAFLD liver clinic; we will provide state-of-the-art care of and resources about NAFLD to all participants. An information packet will be provided to all participants at their baseline office visit that includes: 1) NAFLD disease information including diagnosis, clinical manifestations, natural history, and treatments; 2) NAFLD physical activity recommendations including walking programs and physical activity logs; 3) weight tracking logs; and 4) resources for exercise programs. [CONTACT_823124], with gastroenterology fellows working with her, will provide all medical care. Adverse events will be routinely queried at each clinic visit and the study physicians will be on call in the case of an adverse event.  All participants will be taught a VLCD diets using our validated online program. Participants will have a baseline virtual visit with [CONTACT_823124] in the liver clinic and, if they appear eligible, they will come back for an MRI. After all baseline measurements are completed and if participants are still eligible, they will be enrolled in the 4-month online program. This program will include weekly lessons, mailed materials, and the support of a dietary coach. Details are outlined below: Figure 1. Flowchart of intervention study. 
   

[ADDRESS_1141412]. Saslow has found effective in her previous research,[9] and to reduce carbohydrate intake to between 20-35 non-fiber grams of carbohydrates a day with the goal of achieving nutritional ketosis, defined as a positive urine dipstick (Bayer Ketostix), which measures the ketone acetoacetate. A VLCD restricts carbohydrate intake to a point that induces a low level of ketone production. Nutritional ketosis may indicate that insulin levels are reduced to a level that the body is using fat as the key source of energy, turning on fat burning (lipolysis).15 When this occurs, some fats are turned into ketones, which serve as a readily used fuel.16 This is a commonly used approach,[10, 11] and results from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268][9] and other studies[12-15] provide empi[INVESTIGATOR_823116].[16] Support. As changing a diet can be complex, several sessions are necessary to comprehensively and effectively teach a new way of eating. All participants will be e-mailed links every week for [ADDRESS_1141413] them to a) a short survey to assess intervention-related behavioral adherence and health concerns, b) a short video to teach the topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], c) downloadable handouts distributed online to accompany the videos, and d) links to external resources on the web pertaining to the week's information. As some participants prefer not to watch videos, the transcripts of the embedded videos will be provided as well, in an easy-to-read downloadable format. The lessons can be watched and read whenever is convenient and take about [ADDRESS_1141414] been found to be effective additions to behavioral interventions,[17] if participants in the groups have questions, they will be able to contact a coach in order to receive prompt replies. Coaches will be trained, and coaching quality will be monitored for fidelity to our coaching manual.  All participants will be provided with extra support tools. These will be taught with a weekly short video, downloadable handouts, and links to external resources. Below, we describe the justification for the behavioral support we include.  a) Training in positive affect and mindful eating. To adhere to a new diet, participants need to cope effectively with inevitable stressors. According to the revised Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_334387][18, 19] positive emotions serve as a psychological “time-out” from the upset caused by [CONTACT_823121].[20] Moreover, our intervention aims to help participants better enjoy and savor their food. Hedonic theories of behavior propose that people will be more likely to continue doing behaviors they enjoy,[21] and previous research shows a connection between greater eating plan satisfaction and better eating plan adherence.[22, 23]  Those who eat as a way to cope with their emotions tend to regain more weight after successful weight loss.[24, 25] The psychological causes of emotional eating may involve poor awareness of internal physiological states and differentiation between hunger cues and emotional arousal.[26-28] To counteract the tendency to eat when stressed, we will draw on Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT),[29, 30] which includes exercises to increase the awareness of the triggers of overeating, internal cues that signal hunger and fullness, and ways to cultivate healthier alternative behavior. We will teach these diet- and health-focused skills; how they are expected to help; research supporting them; and suggestions for practicing them.  b) Dietary self-monitoring using a free online or mobile application. We will ask participants to track their diet using a free online and mobile application, MyFitnessPal (which our participants have found easy to use, has a wide variety of foods in its database, and has over 150 million users). Previous participants have nearly unanimously enjoyed using this application. We will encourage dietary tracking daily for the first few weeks of the program, tapering to at least a few days a week by [CONTACT_823122] 4. Participants will first be asked to track their regular eating pattern with MyFitnessPal before they begin the program (during their enrollment process). Participants will be encouraged but not required track their eating throughout the intervention to support them in making dietary changes and follow the very low carb diet. Finally, participants will be asked to track for three days near the end of the intervention for assessment of dietary adherence.  c) Body weight self-monitoring using a digital scale. At the start of their 4-month program, participants will be mailed a scale. We will ask participants to track their body weight weekly with this scale, which is easy 
[ADDRESS_1141415] to set up any passwords, simplifying ease of use. We will use this information to monitor participant success and tailor coaching support.  d) Mailed materials.  At week 1, week [ADDRESS_1141416] been studied, and are generally found to be helpful for weight loss,[31, 32] this cookbook approach is novel. Also at week 1, participants who are taking glucose-lowering medication (other than metformin) will be sent a glucose-monitoring device via Amazon, so that they may self-monitor their glucose.  e) Text messages. Reminders about targeted behaviors are tied to greater behavioral adherence.[33] Thus, to encourage the adoption and maintenance of the new intervention-related behaviors, participants will be sent text messages to give them feedback as well as to motivate, educate, and remind them about the targeted behaviors and skills.[34] Thus, as [CONTACT_195782] has done in her previous research, we will send automatic, motivational, and educational skill-relevant messages about 5 times a week to participants.[35, 36]  Although most previous participants enjoyed the messages, participants have the option to opt out of text messages. Safety and medication management. Participants will be asked in a weekly survey about health symptoms or adverse events they’ve experienced and to report any medication changes they’ve made. Participants who report symptoms will be reached by [CONTACT_823123]. Participants may be called if the health event seems urgent or severe. For severe or long lasting symptoms, participants will be encouraged to reach out to their primary care physician. Participants who are taking some blood glucose-lowering medications (metformin, DPP-4s, GLP-1 agonists, and Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)) will continue their medications as normal. Participants taking all other glucose-lowering medications will be asked to stop taking these medications at the start of the trial (PCPs will be informed of this change when participants begin the trial). All participants will be asked in the aforementioned weekly survey about their highest and lowest fasted and postprandial (2 hours after eating) blood glucose levels over the previous week. If participants report low glucose (fasting below 70 mg/dL or postprandial below 110 mg/dL), they should reach out to their physician and follow self-management guidelines (sent to them as part of week 1’s intervention materials). If participants report more than two weeks of high blood glucose (180 mg/dL), [CONTACT_823125] will reach out to participants via email or phone about management and reach out to participant PCPs. Outcomes and analyses. After [ADDRESS_1141417] (if of childbearing potential), and return for a MRI-derived proton density fat fraction test. All final measurements should be completed within [ADDRESS_1141418] a fasting blood draw. Follow up blood tests will include: complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, prothrombin time, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, and a serum lipid panel.  Statistical Design:   Based on a previous, small, short-term trial without genetic biomarkers,[1] we expect patients enrolled in this program to lose 12% of their liver fat with a standard deviation of 6%. With a one-sample Wilcoxon test, this sample is 99% powered to detect such a decrease in MRI-derived fat fraction at α = 0.01. Extrapolating from the epi[INVESTIGATOR_823117]738409-GG genotype with fatty liver in insulin-resistant patients,[2] the benefit in this group may be twice as high as in the general population (24%); if so, we would likewise be 99% powered to detect a reduction significantly greater than 12% at α = 0.01. 
[ADDRESS_1141419]-program semi-structured interviews, as in Aim 1, will be used to assess satisfaction, adherence and dropout.   1.

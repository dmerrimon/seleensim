EGGS Study, Version 1. 2  11-02-2017  Effects of choline from eggs vs. supplements on the generation of TMAO in 
humans (EGGS)   
 
Principal Investigator : W. H. Wilson Tang, MD  
Date:  November 2 , 2017; Version 1.[ADDRESS_889378] previously  shown that dietary intake of trimethylamines, including the choline 
group of phosphatidylcholine (PC), is mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease risk  and 
that the metabolism of these trimethylamine nutri ents in humans is modulated by [CONTACT_659384] (gut microbes ). Additionally, extensive animal studies link an essential role of gut 
microbiota  to the metabolism of choline and the produc tion of metabolites that promote / 
accelerate atherosclerotic processes (Wang et al, 2011, Nature). We have also recently shown 
a 10-fold increase in plasma TMAO levels following supplementation with choline bitartrate 
supplements. However, another pi[INVESTIGATOR_168809] a collaborator did not show the same increase in 
plasm a TMAO levels following the ingestion of whole eggs, a major dietary source of choline. 
Therefore, w ith this study we wish to examine the differences, if any, between the ingestion of 
an equivalent mass of total choline in the free form (as bitartrate salt ) as a supplement vs. within 
whole eggs . We also wish to examine the ingestion of an equivalent mass of choline as a 
phosphatidylcholine (PC) supplement capsule  and compare this to the ingestion of the choline 
bitartrate supplements and/or the whole eggs.  
 
Eggs, and specifically the egg yolk, contain a large amount of total choline ( USDA Database for 
the Choline Content of Common Foods, 2008 ). However, egg white contains potential anti -
microbial peptides that could influence gut microbial composition and f unction, and therefore 
impact conversion of choline into TMA and TMAO observed in subjects. Therefore, w e 
hypothesize that the consumption of whole eggs ( hardboiled ) will not elevate plasma TMAO 
levels to the same extent as a comparable amount of total cho line ingested in capsule form as 
the choline bitartrate salt. We further hypothesize that the consumption of egg white with choline 
bitartrate tablets may result in less of a rise in TMAO levels than ingestion of the choline 
bitartrate supplement alone.   
 
The majority of the choline present in egg yolks is found as part of phosphatidylcholine. We 
therefore hypothesize that the ingestion of phosphatidylcholine supplements will not elevate 
plasma TMAO levels to the same extent as a comparable amount of total choline ingested in 
capsule form as the choline bitartrate salt, but will instead elevate plasma TMAO levels in a 
comparable fashion to the whole eggs (hardboiled).  
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
To compare the blood and urine levels of free choline, phosphatidylcholin e (PC), 
trimethylamine -N-oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine (TMA), and gammabutyrobetaine in subjects 
before versus following the ingestion of choline provided in either the bitartrate salt (in 
supplement ) form, within phosphatidylcholine (in supplement form),  within eggs (whole or in 
part), or in combinations of these . 
 
 
EGGS Study, Version 1. 2  11-02-2017   
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective non-blinded randomized study with 5 study arms  as detailed below. For 
each study arm, subjects will be asked to consume choline bitartrate tablets , 
phospha tidylcholine capsules,  and/or eggs  or egg whites  every day for 4 weeks.  
  Arm 1: whole hardboiled  egg  
  Arm 2: choline bitartrate tablets   
  Arm 3: whole hardboiled  egg + choline bitartrate tablets  
  Arm 4: egg whites + choline bitartrate tablets  
Arm 5: phosphatidylcholine capsules  
 
For arms [ADDRESS_889379] (baseline) study visit, subjects will have blood and urine samples collected. S ubjects 
will then be randomized  or assigned  to one of the five study arms as described above.  
 
Following randomization , or assignment in the case of arm 5 , subjects will be asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_659381]/or supplements each week. Spot urine  collections will be 
collected weekly . Subjects will also be asked to provide a stool sample at the time of the spot 
urine collection if they are able to. The stool sample s will be optional, we will not require them . 
 
At the  day [ADDRESS_889380] their final study visit. This visit will occur between 
26 and 30 days after their baseline visit.

levels do not drop from baseline, which would indicate non -compliance with the study 
treatments.  
 
5.4 Receiving  & Storage

All adverse events will be immediately reported to the primary investigators and to the 
IRB, per their procedures. The clinical course of each event will be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determin ed that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end 
of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and  is considered to be possibly 
related to the study treatment or study participation will be rec orded and reported 
immediately.  
 
8.2 Serious/Unexpected Adverse Events  
Serious and unexpected adverse events will be reported to the Ethical Committee in 
accordance with institutional guidelines. In the case there would be any adverse 
event s or unanticipated problem s, an appropriate adverse event or unanticipated 
report form will be made and the Ethical Committee notified immediately. The study 
will also be stopped im mediately if a subject  would experience any unanticipated 
discomfort or adverse cardiac events (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). There will be no DMC and 
no interim analys es.

informed of their rights and the privacy safeguards in place during the consent process.  
 
9.2 Data Management  
Study  data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture).  REDCap is a secure, web application designed to support data capture for 
research studies, providing user -friendly web -based case report forms, real -time data 
entry valid ation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de -identified 
data export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).   
The system was developed by a multi -institutional consortium which includes Cleveland 
Clinic  and was initiated at Vanderbilt University.  The database is hosted at the 
Cleveland Clinic Datacenter.  The system is protected behind a login and Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. There is an audit trail tracking all logins and activities in 
the da tabase. Data collection is customized for each study or clinical trial based on a 
study -specific data dictionary defined by [CONTACT_659391].

10.2  Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and Institutional compliance and 
quality assurance groups of all study related documents (for examp le, source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). The 
investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related 
facilities (for example, pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.). Participatio n as an 
investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_659392].  
 
11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be conducted according to US a nd international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
This protocol and any amendments wi ll be submitted to a properly constituted independent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval 
of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made 
in writi ng to the investigator before commencement of this study.  
Prior to enrollment, a ll subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this 
study and providing sufficient information for subjec ts to make an informed decision.

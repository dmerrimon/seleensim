 INTRODUCTION 151 
 152 
 Background and Rationale  153 
The transition of closed -loop control (CLC, known as the “artificial pancreas”) to everyday diabetes 154 
therapy is contingent upon the acceptance by [CONTACT_367221] 155 
ensuring concerted work of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), insulin pumps, and control [ADDRESS_458832] towards the development of such a system was charted by [CONTACT_941] 157 
Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) – a smart -phone mul ti-use platform designed at the University of Virginia 158 
(UVA) to operate in several treatment modes ranging from CGM or insulin pump support to overnight 159 
and 24/7 CLC. Since its introduction in 2011, DiAs has earned regulatory approvals in the U.S., 160 
[LOCATION_009], Italy, Netherlands , and Israel; [ADDRESS_458833] been accumulated 164 
to warrant a large- scale clinical trial aiming to establish the artificial pancreas as a clinically accepted 165 
treatment f or type 1 diabetes that is superior to the current sensor -augmented pump (SAP) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A 166 
key distinction of our approach is that the artificial pancreas is not considered a single- function 167 
device– it is a platform for technology deployment that can run o pen- or closed -loop control modalities [ADDRESS_458834] 5 174 
years since the introduction of our DiAs system:  175 
Figure 1: Past, cur rent, and upcoming outpatient studies identified by [CONTACT_367222]: JDRF, NIH, [ADDRESS_458835] (HCT), and the European Commission (EC)  [ADDRESS_458836] again, in various 182 
conditions, clinical centers, and age groups. As noted above, these studies accumulated a wealth of data 183 
(21 patient years of closed -loop control ) and AP know -how, which now allow us to transition to the 184 
large- scale International Diabetes Closed -Loop pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. The upper panel of Figure 1 includes 185 
pediatric studies, while the lower panel presents studies in adults.  186 
 187 
Briefly, in 2012/2013 we completed two international multi -site trials, which confirmed the feasibility 188 
of DiAs and its efficacy to reduce hypoglycemia in the out patient setting; both were selected for the 189 
Diabetes Care  symposiums at the 2013 and 2014 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Scientific 190 
Sessions (1, 2) . Three summer camp trials of remote monitoring (3), overnight CLC (4), and 24/7 CLC 191 
(5) confirmed the efficacy of DiAs in children with T1D. In Europe, AP@home ran two pi[INVESTIGATOR_367213] [ADDRESS_458837] for the large -scale AP@Home- 3 which included 2- month overnight and 2- mont h 24/7 CLC 193 
at home  (6), which was the first study to report statistically significant reduction in HbA1c with CLC 194 
(7). The longest to -date (6 -month) multi- center trial of 24/7 CLC at home was reported in February 2016 195 
at the ATTD conference in Mil an, Italy and showed very significant several -fold reduction in 196 
hypoglycemia without deterioration in HbA1c (8, 9) . Adult studies now continue with Project Nightlight 197 
– an 11 -month trial  which compares dinner/overnight vs. 24/7 CLC in terms of glycemic outcomes and 198 
patient acceptance (10), and with the International Diabetes Closed -Loop Trial. Three new exciting 199 
pediatric studies complete the lineage presented in Figure 1 : (i) the multi -center Italian PedArPan trial 200 
recruited 5 –9-year-old children and their parents from 5 sites for a summer camp (11); (ii) the French 201 
Stop Hypo at Night trial compares the prevention of hypoglycemia in 7- 12 year old children achieved 202 
by [CONTACT_367223]. threshold low glucose suspend, and (iii) an [ADDRESS_458838] the ability of the 204 
system to cope with extreme winter conditions and prolonged vigorous physical activity (5 hours of 205 
skiing daily for 5 days) (12). 206 
While our over all progress with the development and the clinical testing of a wearable artificial pancreas 207 
(AP) is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1 , the results below are of par ticular relevance to the proposed Study:  208

reduced mean BG level at 07:00h (119.3 vs. 152.9 mg/dL ; p<0.001) and overnight (139.0 vs. 170.3 215 
mg/dL ; p<0.001) (14). 216 
(2) JDRF Multi -Center 6 -Month Trial of 24/7 Closed- Loop Control:  In the summer of 2014, we initiated 217 
a two -phase long -term (6 months) trial evaluating DiAs in the natural environment. Phase 1 (1 month) 218 
recruited 30 patients with T1DM at 6 clinical centers: UVA, Stanford University, the William Sansum 219 
Diabetes Center, S anta Barbara, CA, the Universities of Padua (Italy) and Montpellier ([LOCATION_009]), and the 220 
Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel  (1). During Phase 1, subjects participated in 2 weeks of 221 
overnight -only and 2 weeks of 24/7 CLC. Phase 2 continued with N=14 patients at 4 of these sites (UVA, [ADDRESS_458841], Sansum, Padua) , for 5 additional months of 24/7 CLC (9). The study was coordinated by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_458842] characteristics: age=45 years; duration of diabetes=27 years; total daily insulin=0.54 225 
(U/kg/day); basal daily insulin=0.22 (U/kg/day); 10/4 male/female.  226 
Results:   227 
Figure 3  below  presents the time within target range achieved during CLC in Phase 1 of this study during 228 
overnight CLC and during 24/7 CLC, compared to sensor -augmented pump. As seen in Figure 3 , CLC 229 
achieved over 70% time in the target range overall, accompanied by [CONTACT_367224] 230 
hypoglycemia.  231

Overall, HbA1c was reduced from 7.2% at the baseline to 7.0% (p=0.16) at the end of the [ADDRESS_458844] three months of CGM monitoring 4.1% vs. 1.3% 240 
(p<0.001). Improvement in HbA1c was highly correlated with the percent time of system use, 241 
r=0.59; in particular those with above -median system use (>70% of the time) achieved HbA1c 242 
reduction of 0.44%, from 7.19% at the baseline to 6.74% at the end of study (9).  243

 Closed -Loop Control System  257 
inControl -AP is an “artificial pancreas” (AP) application that uses advanced [ADDRESS_458846] A ndroid smartphone and uses Bluetooth (BT) and 261 
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity to communicate with a Continuous 262 
Glucose Monitor (CGM) and insulin pump.  The system modulates insulin to 263 
keep blood glucose in a targeted range.  inControl -AP runs on a modified release 264 
of the Android operating system.  Modifications include the removal of 265 
unnecessary applications and functions, and fixes to the BT stack to permit 266 
communication with the insulin pump. While inControl -AP is an Android 267 
application with a JS/CSS UI , system upgrades during the study will be 268 
considered when new technology becomes available and is sufficiently tested. 269 
For example, new generations of CGM sensors or insulin pumps with embedded 270 
inControl -AP could become available for inclusion in  this trial and could be used, 271 
provided that these new development do not change the core functionality of the 272 
system described below and in Figure 5.    273 
 274 
The system services include the following processing elements:  275 
• Core:  handles timing and main loop ca lls, intercepts system messages and 276 
handles data changes  277 
• Metabolic state estimation:  calculates the patient’s current metabolic 278 
state, including current  and predicted blood glucose  and IOB , and stores 279 
values in a database 280 
• Controller :  calls the modules th at calculate algorithmic and manually 281 
requested insulin delivery quantities in sequence  282 
• UIM – User Input Module handles the delivery of insulin requested 283 
manually by [CONTACT_367225]  284 
• BIM –  Basal Increase Module increases  basal delivery in response 285 
to estimated blood glucose levels based on a circadian target profile  286 
• HCM – Hyperglycemic Correction Module calculates  a correction 287 
bolus in response to estimated blood glucose  above its target  288 
• BAM – Basal Attenuation Module may reduce basal insulin 289 
delivery if the system determines a risk of hypoglycemia  290 
• Supervisor:  determines which dosing algorithm outputs are valid and [ADDRESS_458847] frequency of input data.  There 294 
are two insulin dosing modes (pump and closed loop) and three operating modes (normal, sleep and 295 
exercise). The combination of insulin dosing mode and operating mode determines what actions 296 
inControl will perform and what options are presented to the user. 297

• Technology A cceptance Survey (CTR group only ) 937 
 938 
Each questionnaire is described briefly below.  The procedures for administration are described in the 939 
study procedures manual. 940 
 941 
 Diabetes Specific Personality Questionnaire 942 
The Diabetes Specific Personality Questionnaire  (15)  is based on the original Six Factor P ersonality 943 
Questionnaire  (16), a well -validated measure that  was adapted for the diabetes -specific version of the 944 
questionnaire. The SFPQ is a measure of six personality dimensions each consisting of three facet 945 
scales, measured by 108 Likert items. The SFPQ facet scales are organized in terms of six factor 946 
scales.   947 
 948 
Administration time is approximately 15 minutes.  949 
 950 
 Clarke’s Hypoglycemia Awareness Scale 951 
The scale (17) comprises eight questions characterizing the subject 's exposure to epi[INVESTIGATOR_297526] 952 
and severe hypoglycemia. It also examines the glycemic threshold for, and symptomatic responses to, 953 
hypoglycemia. A score of four or more on a scale of 0 to 7 implies impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.    954 
 955 
Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.   956 
 957 
 Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS -II) / Low Blood Sugar Survey  958 
The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey -II (18) was developed to measure behaviors and worries related to fear 959 
of hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. It is composed of 2 subscales, the Behavior (HFS -B) 960 
and Worry (HFS -W). HFS -B items describe behaviors in which patients may engage to avoid 961 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591]/or their negative consequences (e.g., keepi[INVESTIGATOR_251248] 962 
150 mg/dL , making sure other people are around, and limiting exercise or physical activity). HFS -W 963 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  32 
    items describe specific concerns that patients may ha ve about their hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., being 964 
alone, epi[INVESTIGATOR_251249], or having an accident).  965 
 966 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.  967 
  968 
 Hyperglycemia Avoidance Survey (HAS) / High Blood Sugar Survey  969 
The HAS  (19)  reliably quantifies affective and behavioral aspects of hyperglycemia avoidance and is 970 
used to assess the extent of p otentially problematic avoidant attitudes and behaviors regarding 971 
hyperglycemia in people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D).  972 
 973 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.  974 
 975 
 Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale  976 
The HCS (20)  is a 9 -item self -report scale that examines the degree to which people with diabetes feel 977 
able, secure, and comfortable re garding their ability to stay safe from hypoglycemic -related problems. 978 
It has been validated for use in adults with type 1 diabetes and insulin- using type 2 diabetes.  979 
 980 
Admini stration time is approximately 5  minutes.  981 
 982 
 Diabetes Distress Scale  983 
The Diabetes Di stress Scale  (21)  is a measure of diabetes -related emotional distress and consists of a 984 
scale of 28 items. These include 7 items from each of four domains central to diabetes -related 985 
emotiona l distress .  Patients rate the degree to which each item is currently problematic for them on a 986 
6-point Likert scale, from 1 (no problem) to 6 (serious problem).  987 
 988 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.  989 
 990 
 Technology Expectation and Technology Accep tance Survey s 991 
The Technology Expectation and Technology Acceptance Surveys were developed for a Bionic 992 
Pancreas camp study  (22). The 38 items in the Questionnaire were based on interviews  conducted with 993 
individuals who had participated in previous Bionic Pancreas trials about their experience regarding 994 
the Bionic Pancreas. It was subsequently adapted to assess these same measures for the inControl 995 
closed -loop system. It assesses both posit ive and negative experiences with inControl, including blood 996 
glucose management, device burden, and overall satisfaction. Item s were rated on a 5 -point scale . 997 
 998 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.  999 
 1000 
 INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_66681]  1001 
The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] ( Insulin Delivery S ystems: P erceptions, Ideas, R eflections and E xpectations) survey was 1002 
developed to assess  various aspects of a  user ’s experience regarding automated insulin delivery for 1003 
both patients and family members. The surveys include various topi[INVESTIGATOR_66682] 1 1004 
diabetes and their family members based upon >200 hours of qualitative interviews and focus groups . 1005 
The adult survey  include s 31 items; the adolescent survey includes 28 items; and the parent survey 1006 
includes 30 items. Response options for all surveys include a 5- point Likert scale from strongly agree 1007 
to strongly disagree, along with an N/A option.  1008 
 1009 
Admi nistration time is approximately 5 minutes.   1010

Throughout the study, subjects will be instructed to calibrate the study CGM in accordance with 1016 
manufacturer labelling.  1017 
 1018 
 Safety Measures f or Open -Loop CGM  Use 1019 
These measures apply to subjects in the SAP group throughout the course of the study and also to 1020 
subjects in the CTR  group during periods when the closed- loop system is not being used or is not 1021 
communicating with the CGM device.  1022 
 1023 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypoglycemia Threshold Alarm and Safety Protocol  1024 
All subjects will initially be required to set the CGM hypoglycemia threshold alarm to a value no less 1025 
than 60 mg/dL.  During the course of the study, subjects will be permitted to change this setting, but 1026 
will b e instructed to choose a value no less than 60 mg/dL.  [ADDRESS_458909] will be instructed to treat hypoglycemia with ~[ADDRESS_458910] -acting 1031 
oral glucose.  1032 
 1033 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hyperglycemia Threshold Alarm and Safety Protocol  1034 
All subjects will initially be required to set the CGM hyperglycemia thres hold alarm to a value no 1035 
greater than 300 mg/dL.  During the course of the study, subjects will be permitted to change this 1036 
setting, but will be instructed to choose a value no greater than 300 mg/dL.  [ADDRESS_458911]’s CGM reading is ≥300 mg/dL  for over 1 hour, or ≥400 mg/dL  at any point, the subject [ADDRESS_458912] to take the following steps:  1044 
• Perform a blood ketone measurement with the study ketone meter. Subjects will also be 1045 
encouraged to check ketones if they are clinically concerned.  1046 
• Correction insulin may be taken per the subject’s usual routine.  1047 
• Subjects will be instructed to change their pump site and administer correction insulin via 1048 
insulin syringe or pen for ketones ≥0.6 mmol/L and to additionally notify study staff for 1049 
ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L. 1050 
 1051 
 Safety Measures Specific to Control -to-Range (CTR) Closed -Loop Group  1052 
 1053 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Insulin Dosing  [ADDRESS_458913] (IOB)  constraints avoid 1056 
inappropriate insulin stacking.  In the case of a system crash or any interruption of communication 1057 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  34 
    between inControl  and the insulin pump, the pump will revert to the preprogrammed basal delivery 1058 
within a short period of time  (maximum 30 minutes) .  Each bolus is checked by [CONTACT_367231] 1059 
ensure that it does not exceed a maximum threshold depending on whether the bolus is for a meal, for a 1060 
correction, or for usual basal delivery.  1061 
 1062 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypoglycemia Safety Protocol  1063 
The inControl system will issue a hypogl ycemia alarm  if the CGM is <70 mg/dL  or when the system [ADDRESS_458914] s BG  <70 mg/dL  within the next [ADDRESS_458915] to do the following :  1070 
• Check blood glucose  1071 
• Treat with fast acting carbohydrates  1072 
 1073 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hyperglycemia Safety Protocol  1074 
The inControl system will issue a predictive hyperglycemia alarm if the system detects prolonged 1075 
resistance to insulin treatment and the BG is estimated to be above 200 mg/dL . [ADDRESS_458916] to do the following : 1080 
• Confirm hyperglycemi a with a fingerstick  1081 
• Consider possible reasons including missed  bolus es for carbs, infusion site problems, [ADDRESS_458917]’s CGM reading is ≥300 mg/dL for over 1 hour, or ≥400 mg/dL at any point, the subject [ADDRESS_458918] to take the following steps:  1086 
• Perform a blood ketone measurement with the study ketone meter. Subjects will also be 1087 
encouraged to check ketones if they are clinically concerned.  1088 
• Correction insulin may be taken per the subject’ s usual routine.  1089 
• Subjects will be instructed to change their pump site and administer correction insulin via 1090 
insulin syringe or pen for ketones ≥0.6 mmol/L and to additionally notify study staff for 1091 
ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L. 1092 
 1093 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Remote Monitoring  1094 
The inControl  remote monitoring portal (inControl Cloud) automatically logs system data such as [ADDRESS_458919] questions and troubleshooting.  In addi tion, the system will log information  1105 
regarding potential system malfunctions to a central location for periodic technical monitoring.  1106 
 1107 
[IP_ADDRESS]. CGM Sensor Connection Failure  1108 
If the CGM signal becomes unavailable for > [ADDRESS_458920] recent 1110 
insulin dosing parameters  programmed in the system for that individual . Resumption of Closed- Loop 1111 
will occur automatically  by [CONTACT_367232].  1112 
 1113 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pump Connection Failure  1114 
If inControl is unable to establish required pump connectivity for > 20 minutes, the system will revert 1115 
to Stopped mode and display a message accompanied by [CONTACT_367233].   The insulin pump will 1116 
automatical ly revert to preprogrammed basal insulin delivery without any need for instruction from the 1117 
controller  once the 0% temporary basal rate last directed by [CONTACT_367234] . Alternatively, the [ADDRESS_458921] can cancel the temp basal on the insulin pump and immed iately resume basal insulin 1119 
administration.   1120 
 1121 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study System Failure  1122 
If the study system stops working for more than 30 minutes, the pump will automatically revert to 1123 
preprogrammed basal insulin delivery without any need for instruction from the controller.  1124

 ADVERSE EVENT S, DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS , POTENTIAL RISKS, AND 1126 
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442]   1127 
 1128 
 Definition s 1129 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective of the 1130 
relationship between the adverse event and the device(s) under investigation. 1131 
 1132 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any untoward medical occurrence that:  1133 
• Results in death. 1134 
• Is life -threate ning; (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 1135 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event). 1136 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 1137 
• Results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to [ADDRESS_458922] normal life functions (sight threatening).  1139 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  1140 
• Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., 1141 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 1142 
the outcomes listed above).  [ADDRESS_458923] (UADE): A ny serious adverse effect on health or safety or any [ADDRESS_458924], problem, or 1146 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational 1147 
plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) , or any other unanticipated serious 1148 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants (21 CFR 1149 
812.3(s)). [ADDRESS_458925] (ADE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant which the [ADDRESS_458926] contributed. (Note that an Adverse Event 1153 
Form is to be completed in addition to a Device Deficiency or Issue Form).  1154 
 1155 
Device Complaints: A device complication or complaint is something that happens to a device or is 1156 
related to device performance, whereas an adverse event happens to a participant. A device complaint 1157 
may occur independently from an AE, or along with an AE. An AE may occur without a device 1158 
complaint or there may be an AE related to a device complain t. 1159 
 1160 
Device Malfunction : Any failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise 1161 
perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device. 1162 
The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is labeled or 1163 
marketed. (21 CFR 803.3)      [ADDRESS_458927] medical occurrence that meets  one 1167 
of the following criteria :   1168 
1) A serious adverse event  1169 
2) An Adverse Device Effect as defined in section 7.1, unless excluded from reporting in 1170 
section 7.3 1171 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  37 
    3) An Adverse Event occurring in association with a study procedure  1172 
4) Hypoglycemia meeting the definition of severe hypoglycemia as defined below  1173 
5) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as defined below  [ADDRESS_458928].  Skin reactions from sensor placement are 1176 
only reportable if severe and/or required treatment.   [ADDRESS_458929] is only reportable as an adverse event 1182 
when the following definition for severe hypoglycemia is met:  the event required assistance o f another 1183 
person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, 1184 
glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the participant was impaired cognitively to the 1185 
point that he/she was unable to treat himself/herself, was unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was 1186 
incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_367216] 1187 
associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or loss of consciousness .  If plasma 1188 
glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the 1189 
restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by 1190 
a low plasma glucose concentration.  1191 
 1192 
 Hyperglycemi c Events/Diabetic Ketoacidosis  [ADDRESS_458930] is only reportable as an adverse event 1194 
when one of the following criteria is met:  (1) the event involved DKA, as defined by [CONTACT_367235] 1195 
Control and Complications Tr ial (DCCT) and described below, or (2) in the absence of DKA if 1196 
evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider facility for an acute event involving 1197 
hyperglycemia or ketosis .  1198 
 1199 
Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if the following are present:  1200 
• Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting;  1201 
• Serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones;  1202 
• Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15; and 1203 
• Treatment provided in a health care facility      [ADDRESS_458931] been caused by [CONTACT_941] 1213 
study device. 1214 
 1215 
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the following 1216 
general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  1217 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  38 
     1218 
Yes 1219 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and the study 1220 
intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state, 1221 
intercu rrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of 1222 
response to the study intervention; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of 1223 
the study intervention or dose reduction and, if applicable , reappears upon re -challenge.  1224 
 1225 
No 1226 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study intervention (e.g., 1227 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 1228 
and/or the adverse event  has no plausible temporal relationship to study intervention.    1229 
 1230 
 Intensity of Adverse Event  1231 
The intensity of an adverse event will be rated on a three point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 1232 
severe. It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus a severe adverse event is 1233 
not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be 1234 
clinically serious.  1235 
• MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment, and does not interfere with the 1236 
participant’s daily activities.  1237 
• MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and 1238 
may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  1239 
• SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities and generally requires systemic drug 1240 
therapy or other treatment.  1241 
 1242 
 Coding of Adverse Events  1243 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. The Medical Monitor will review the 1244 
investigator’s assessment of causality and may agree o r disagree. Both the investigator’s and Medical 1245 
Monitor’s assessments will be recorded. The Medical Monitor will have the final say in determining 1246 
the causality.  1247 
 1248 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study will be 1249 
followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the condition is 1250 
expected.  1251 
 1252 
 Outcome of Adverse Event  1253 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by [CONTACT_3470]:  1254 
• RESOLVED – The participant recovered from the AE/SAE without sequelae. Record the 1255 
AE/SAE stop date. 1256 
• RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – The event persisted and had stabilized without change in [ADDRESS_458932] the AE/SAE stop date. 1258 
• FATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as  the SAE that resulted in death. Only the event that was 1259 
the cause of death should be reported as fatal. AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of 1260 
death; however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at the time of death.  1261 
• UNKNOWN – A n unknown outcome is defined as an inability to access the participant or the 1262 
participant’s records to determine the outcome (for example, a participant that was lost to 1263 
follow -up).  1264 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  39 
    • ONGOING – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined as the event was ongoing with an undetermined 1265 
outcome.  1266 
o An ongoing outcome will require follow -up by [CONTACT_3471] 1267 
outcome of the AE/SAE.  1268 
o The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, 1269 
will be updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop 1270 
date.  1271 
 1272 
All clinically significant abnormalities of clinical laboratory measurements or adverse events occurring 1273 
during the study and continuing at study termination should be followed by [CONTACT_2299]’s ph ysician 1274 
and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until diagnosis of the underlying cause, or resolution. [ADDRESS_458933] the participant until 1281 
the adverse event has resolved or stabilized.  1282 
 1283 
 Reportable Device Issues  1284 
All UADEs, ADEs, device complaints, and device malfunctions will be reported irrespective of 1285 
whether an ad verse event occurred, except in the following circumstances.  1286 
 1287 
The following device issues are anticipated and will not  be reported on a Device Issue Form but will 1288 
reported as an Adverse Event if the criteria for AE reporting described above are met:   1289 
• Component disconnections  1290 
• CGM sensors lasting fewer than 7 days  1291 
• CGM tape adherence issues  1292 
• Pump infusion set occlusion not leading to ketosis  1293 
• Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless communication  1294 
• Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not leading to system 1295 
replacement  1296 
• Device issues clearly addressed in the user guide manual that do not require additional 1297 
troubleshooting  1298 
• Skin reactions from CGM sensor placement or pump infusion set placement that don’t meet [ADDRESS_458934] be reported to the Coordinating Center 1307 
within 24 hours via completion of the online serious adverse event form.  1308 
 1309 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  40 
    Other r eportable adverse events and device malfunctions (with or without an adverse e vent) will be [ADDRESS_458935] igator becoming aware of the event. 1315 
 1316 
The Coordinating Center will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is serious, 1317 
related, and unexpected. Notification will be made within 10 days after the Coordinating Center 1318 
becomes aware of the event.  1319 
  1320 
Each principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_3411] -related adverse events and 1321 
abiding by [CONTACT_66716]/her Institutional Review Board or Ethics 1322 
Committee.  1323 
 1324 
Upon receipt of a UADE report, the Sponsor will investigate the UADE and if indicated, report the 1325 
results of the investigation to the sites’ IRBs, and the FDA within ten working days of the Sponsor 1326 
becoming aware of the UADE per 21CFR 812.46(b) (2). The Medical Monitor must determine if  the [ADDRESS_458936]  1337 
The DSMB will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated adverse device events 1338 
that occur during the study and wil l review compi[INVESTIGATOR_367217].  Details regarding 1339 
review will be documented in standalone DSMB procedural documentation.   1340 
 1341 
 Potential Risks and Side Effects  1342 
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data are handled to minimize this risk.  1343 
Hypoglycemia, h yperglycemia, and ketone formation are always a risk in subjects with type 1 diabetes 1344 
and subjects will be closely monitored for this.  When weari ng sensors and insulin infusion sets there is 1345 
always a risk of skin rashes, allergic reactions to the tape, or infections at the insertion site.  There is 1346 
always a risk for a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_44619] a sensor remaining under the skin or a sensor or infusion set brea king 1347 
off under the skin.  1348 
 1349 
 Venipuncture Risks  1350 
A hollow needle/plastic tube will be placed in the arm for taking blood samples. Blood draws can [ADDRESS_458937] for sev eral weeks.  The risk of local infection 1360 
is less than 1 in 1000.  This should not be a significant contributor to risks in this study as fingersticks 1361 
are part of the usual care for people with diabetes.  1362 
 1363 
 Subcutaneous Catheter Risks ( CGM ) 1364 
Subjects using the  CGM  will be at low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of the 1365 
sensor needle placement.  If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours it is possible to get 1366 
an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness a nd pain.  There may be bleeding where 1367 
the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin caus es a bruise (1 in 10 risk).   [ADDRESS_458938] should be further instructed to notify the study coordinator immediately  if this occurs . 1372 
 1373 
 Risk of Hypoglycemia  1374 
As with any person having type 1 diabetes  and using insulin, there is always a risk of having a low 1375 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less [ADDRESS_458939] as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures (convulsions) and [ADDRESS_458940] may not be as aware of symptoms of hypoglycemia .  A CGM  1379 
functioning poorly and significantly over -reading glucose values could lead to inappropriate insulin 1380 
delivery.     1381 
 1382 
 Risk of Hyperglycemia  1383 
Hyperglycemia and ketonemia could occur if insulin delivery is attenuated or suspended for an 1384 
extended period or if the  pump or infusion set is not working properly .  A CGM  functioning poorly 1385 
and significantly under -reading glucose values could lead to inappropriate suspension of insulin 1386 
delivery.     1387 
 1388 
 Risk of Device Reuse  1389 
The study CGM  system  is labeled for single -patient use only. The sensor (the component of the system 1390 
that enters the skin) will be single -patient  use only. The transmitter and receiver may  be reused  during 1391 
the study  after cleaning the device using a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved cleaning procedure. The transmitter is  1392 
attached to the sensor but does not enter the skin and the receiver is a hand held device. Subjects will be 1393 
informed that FDA or relevant national authorities ha ve approved these devices for single use and that 1394 
by [CONTACT_28040], bloodborne pathogens (i.e. Hepatitis B) may be spread through 1395 
the use of multiple users.  1396 
 1397 
The study insulin pump is labeled for single -patient use. During the study, this device may  be reused 1398 
after cleaning adhering to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved cleaning procedure. All infusion set equipment will be 1399 
single patient use only (infusion set insertion kits, tubing, cartridges etc.)   Subjects will be informed 1400 
that FDA or relevant nat ional authorities ha ve approved the insulin pump device for single use and that 1401 
by [CONTACT_28040], bloodborne pathogens (i.e. Hepatitis B) may be spread through 1402 
the use of multiple users.  1403 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx   2-9-2018  42 
     1404 
The study blood glucose meter and blood ketone meter are labeled for single- patient use. During the 1405 
study, only one person can use each device as there are rare risks that bloodborne pathogens (i.e. 1406 
Hepatitis B) may be spread thr ough the use of multiple users. [ADDRESS_458941] been uncommon. 1413 
 1414 
 Other Risks  1415 
Some subjects may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure the 1416 
CGM, or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.  If these 1417 
reactions occur, different adhesives or “under -tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, etc.) will be 1418 
tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_367218] y be 1419 
required. 1420 
 1421 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM and pump infusion sites 1422 
are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may cause an 1423 
infection.  These occur very infr equently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_458942] s will be carefully instructed about proper use of the 1426 
sensor. 1427 
 1428 
Data downloa ded from the CGM, pump, and blood glucose and ketone meter s will be collected for the 1429 
study as measures of diabetes self -management  behaviors.  Some people may be uncomfortable with 1430 
the researchers' having such detailed i nformation about their daily diabetes habits. 1431 
 1432 
 Risk Assessment  1433 
Based on the facts  that (1) adults and adolescents with diabetes experience mild hypoglycemia and 1434 
hyperglycemia frequently as a consequence of the disease and its management, (2) the study 1435 
intervention involves periodic automated insulin dosing that may increase the likelihood of 1436 
hypoglycemia, and periodic automated attenuation  of insulin delivery that  may increase the likelihood 1437 
of hyperglycemia , (3) mitigations are in place, and have been tested in prior studies using the 1438 
investigational device system in the home setting, that limit the likelihood of  excessive insulin dosing  1439 
or prolonged withdrawal of  insulin , and (4) rapid reversal of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can be [ADDRESS_458943] Discontinuation of Study Treatment  1446 
Rules for discontinuing closed- loop use (if randomized to CTR  group) or study CGM use (if 1447 
randomized to the SAP  group) are as follows:  [ADDRESS_458944] to continue on the intervention. This could 1449 
be due to the development of  a new medical condition or worsening of an existing condition; or [ADDRESS_458945]’s 1451

on CGM values without confirmatory fingerstick (assuming  contraindicated by [CONTACT_28047] 1453 
labelling ); or CTR  subject with recurring hypoglycemia due to over -bolus es in closed -loop with [ADDRESS_458946] pregnancy  1457 
 1458 
In addition, closed- loop use will be discontinued if either of the following occurs:  [ADDRESS_458947] complete the 13- 1468 
week visit . 1469 
 1470 
 Criteria for Suspending/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3396]  1471 
In the case of a system malfunction result ing in a severe hypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia event 1472 
(as defined in Section 7.1) during closed- loop control either due to excess insulin administra tion or 1473 
inappropriate suspension that occurs more than one time , enrollment visits, randomization visits, and 1474 
all use of the closed -loop system in the study will be suspended while t he problem is diagnosed.  In 1475 
addition, study activities could be similarly  suspended if the manufacturer of any constituent study 1476 
device requires stoppage of device use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall). The affected study [ADDRESS_458948]  Compensation  1497 
Subjects will be compensated $ 50 (or local equivalent)  for each separate clinic visit during the study . [ADDRESS_458949] 1507

 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  1511 
 1512 
The approaches to sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below. A detailed statistical 1513 
analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the completion of the study.  1514 
 1515 
The co -primary outcomes for this study are  CGM -measured % below 70 mg/dL  and % above 180 1516 
mg/dL  over a 3-month period. The intervention will be considered effective if both of the following 1517 
comparisons between two treatment arms (SAP vs. CTR) are statistically significant (p < 0.05):  1518 
• superiority test for % time  CGM values below  70 mg/dL and  1519 
• non-inferiority test for % time CGM  values above 180 mg/dL (non- inferiority limit = 5%).  1520 
 1521 
 Sample Size  1522 
Sample size has been computed using co -primary outcomes of time <70 mg/dL (superiority) and time 1523 
>180 mg/dL ( non-inferiority ). Data from the  CGM arm of the JDRF CGM RCT from subjects meeting [ADDRESS_458950] the distribution of % below 70 and above 1525 
180 mg/dL over 3 months as measured by [CONTACT_367236].  1526 
 1527 
The  total  sample size was computed to be 110 for the following assumptions: (1) 1:1 randomization,  1528 
(2) 90%  power, with adjustment to account for the two co- primary analyses, (3) a 50% relative 1529 
reduction in time <70 mg/dL  (or absolute reduction of 2.0%  assuming ba seline of 4.0% ) with an 1530 
effective SD of 2.8%  and 2 -sided type 1 error of 5%, and (4) a non- inferiority  limit of 5% for the 1531 
treatment group comparison of time >180 mg/dL and assuming there is a true difference of 2.5% [ADDRESS_458951] deviation of 11% and a 1- sided type 1 error of 1533 
2.5%.  The sample size was increased to 126 to account for subjects with insufficient data to include in 1534 
the primary analysis (see section 9.2 ). [ADDRESS_458952] -randomization through the 3 month 1547 
visit will be included in the calculation of each CGM metric. Missing (or less than 168 hours) post - [ADDRESS_458953] -randomization unblinded or blinded data will be included in 1550 
CGM analyses . Percentages <70 and >180 mg/dL will be calculated givin g equal weight to each CGM [ADDRESS_458954].  1552 
 1553 
The two weeks of blinded CGM data collected after 9 weeks will not be used for the primary outcome; [ADDRESS_458955] will be excluded from all HbA1c analyses . 1563 
 1564 
 Primary Analyses  1565 
The primary analysis will follow the intention -to-treat principle. It will include all randomized 1566 
subjects, the data from whom will be analyzed in the group to which the subjects were assigned 1567 
through randomization.     1568 
 1569 
The intervention will be declared effective only if a statistically significant result (p -value<0.05) is  1570 
obtained for both co- primary outcomes.  The type 1 error is therefore not inflated by [CONTACT_196863]- primary 1571 
outcomes. 1572 
 1573 
 Changes in CGM -Measured % below 70 mg/dL from Run -in to 3- Months Post - 1574 
Randomization Period between the Two Treatment Arms  1575 
Summary statistics ( median, quartiles) will be reported for the CGM % <70 mg/dL by [CONTACT_1570].  1576 
 1577 
Changes from run-in pre-randomization CGM wear (data generated as described above) to the [ADDRESS_458956]-randomization period in CGM -measured % <70 mg/dL between two treatment arms will be 1579 
compared using a linear mixed effects regression model with a log(x[PHONE_7594]) transformation while 1580 
adjusting for the baseline CGM % <70 mg/dL and clinical center (random effect). Residual values will [ADDRESS_458957] statistical method (e.g., non- parametric or 1583 
MM estimation) will be used instead.  1584 
 1585 
 Changes in CGM -Measured % above 180 mg/dL from Run -in to 3- Months  Post - 1586 
Randomization Period between the Two Treatment Arms  1587 
Summary statistics (median, quartiles) will be reported for the CGM % >180 mg/dL by [CONTACT_3148] [ADDRESS_458958] -randomization in CGM -measured % 1591 
>180 mg/dL between two treatment arms will be compared using a linear mixed effects regression 1592 
model; while adjusting for % >180 during run -in, and clinical center (random effect). A 2 -sided 95% [ADDRESS_458959] at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_458960] at alpha = 0.025.  It is also worth noting that the [ADDRESS_458961] for superiority does not inflate the overall alpha since a type 1 error can only 1598 
occur if the two -sided 95% confidence interval fai ls to contain the true difference. Residual values will [ADDRESS_458962] statistical method (e.g., non- parametric or MM estimation) will be used 1601 
instead.  1602 
 1603 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx     47 
 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  1604 
In secondary analyses, treatment group differences will be assessed for additional CGM metrics and 1605 
HbA1c.  For all secondary analyses (including sections 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7), the false discovery rate will 1606 
be controlled using the adaptive Benjamini -Hochberg procedure with <0.10 as the threshold for 1607 
statistical significance.   1608 
 1609 
Secondary glycemic metrics based on CGM data will include the following outcomes:  1610 
 1611 
CGM Metrics Related to Overall Control  1612 
- mean glucose  1613 
- % in range of 70 -180 mg/dL  1614 
- % in range 70 -140 mg/dL  1615 
- glucose variability measured with the coefficient of variation  1616 
 1617 
CGM Metrics Related to Hypoglycemia  1618 
- % <60 mg/dL  1619 
- % <54 mg/dL  1620 
- low blood glucose index  1621 
- hypoglycemia events  (defined as at least 15 consecutive minutes <70mg/dL)  1622 
 1623 
CGM Metrics Related to Hyperglycemia  1624 
- % >250 mg/dL  1625 
- % >300 mg/dL  1626 
- high blood glucose index  1627 
 1628 
The analyses for the above CGM will parallel those mentioned above for the primary % below 70 1629 
mg/dL outcome, with the exception that a transformation will not be use d for those metrics with a 1630 
distribution that is approximately normally distributed.  Summary statistics will be reported mean ± SD 1631 
or median (quartiles) as appropriate to the distribution. 1632 
 1633 
A comparison of primary and secondary results during the daytime a nd overnight will be made.  1634 
 1635 
HbA1c  1636 
Change in HbA1c from baseline to 13 weeks  will be compared between the two treatment arms using a 1637 
linear model while adjusting for baseline HbA1c and clinical center (random factor).   1638 
 1639 
Several binary outcomes will be compared between treatment groups using central lab HbA1c values.  1640 
• HbA1c <7.0% at 13 weeks  1641 
• HbA1c <7.5% at 13 weeks  1642 
• HbA1c improvement from baseline to 13 weeks >0.5%  1643 
• HbA1c improvement from baseline to 13 weeks >1.0%  1644 
• HbA1c relative improvement from baseline to 13  weeks > 10% 1645 
• HbA1c improvement from baseline to 13 weeks >1.0% or HbA1c <7.0% at [ADDRESS_458963] to handle 1649 
missing data.  If some HbA1c data will be missing , in addition to the completer -only analyses 1650 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx     48 mentioned above, sensitivity analyses will be perform in order to confirm that t he conclusions do not 1651 
rely on the statistical methods employed for handling missing data . Replication of the HbA1c analyses 1652 
with imputed data for subjects with missing both local and central lab HbA1c at 13 weeks will be done 1653 
using two methods:  1654 
- Rubin’s mul tiple imputation and  [ADDRESS_458964] likelihood  1656 
 1657 
 Additional Treatment Group Comparisons  1658 
• Insulin  1659 
o Total daily insulin (units/kg)  1660 
o Basal: bolus  insulin ratio  1661 
• Weight and Body Mass Index 1662 
• Clarke Hypoglycemia Awareness Scores  1663 
• INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_367219]  1664 
 1665 
The analyses for the above metrics will parallel those mentioned above for the secondary efficacy 1666 
outcomes .  1667 
 1668 
 Quality of Life Questionnaires  1669 
The following questionnaires will be completed at baseline and at 13 weeks:  1670 
• Fear of Hypoglycemia Survey (HFS -II) – total score and 3 subscales:  1671 
o Behavior (avoid)  1672 
o Behavior (maintain high BG)  1673 
o Worry  1674 
• Hyperglycemia Avoidance Scale – total score and 4 subscales:  1675 
o Immediate action  1676 
o Worry  1677 
o Low BG preference  1678 
o Avoid extremes  1679 
• Diabetes Distress Scale –  total score and 4 subscales:  1680 
o Emotional burden 1681 
o Physi cian-related distress  1682 
o Regimen -related distress  1683 
o Interpersonal distress  1684 
• Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale – total score   1685 
 1686 
For each questionnaire, mean ± SD values or percentiles appropriate to the distribution will be given 1687 
by [CONTACT_367237] s core and each subscale. For questionnaires administered to both 1688 
randomization groups comparisons will be made using similar linear models as described above for the 1689 
primary outcomes. Separate models will be run for the total score and each of the subscales  listed 1690 
above.    1691 
 1692 
 Subgroup Analyses  1693 
In exploratory analyses, the two primary outcomes (% <70 and >180 mg/dL) will be assessed [ADDRESS_458965].  1697 
iDCL Protocol 1_v10.0_2- 9-2018_ clean.docx     49  1698 
Interpretation of subgroup analyses will depend on whether the overall analysis demonstrates a 1699 
significant treatment group difference. In the absence of such an overall difference and if performed, 1700 
subgroup analyses will be interpreted with caution. For continuous variables, results will be displayed 1701 
in subgroups based on cutpoints although the analysis will utilize the variable as continuous, except for 1702 
age which will be analyzed both as a continuous variable and in two age groups. If there is insufficient 1703 
sample size in a given subgroup, the cutpoints for continuous measures may be adjusted per the 1704 
observed distribution of values. Cutpoint selection for display purposes will be made masked to the 1705 
outcome data.  1706 
- Baseline HbA1c (as continuous variable and in the two subgroups > 7.5% and <7.5%)  1707 
- Baseline CGM time spent <70 mg/dL  1708 
- Baseline CGM time spent >180 mg/dL  1709 
- Age: As a continuous variable and in these subgroups  1710 
o <25 1711 
o ≥25 1712 
- Gender  1713 
o Female  1714 
o Male 1715 
- Race  1716 
o White  1717 
o Non-White (split if sample size allows)  1718 
- Clinical site  1719 
 1720 
Additional analyses may be performed for subgroups defined based on the following baseline 1721 
demographic/clinical characteristics.   1722 
- body mass index,  1723 
- income, education, and/or insurance status, [ADDRESS_458966] -randomizati on safety 1729

- Severe hypoglycemia (as defined in Section 7.1)  1734 
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (as defined in Section 7.1)  1735 
- Other serious adverse events (SA E) and serious adverse device events (SADE)  1736 
- Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE)  1737 
  1738 
For the following outcomes, mean ± SD or summary statistics appropriate to the distribution will be 1739 
tabulated by [CONTACT_1570] :  1740 
- Number of SH events and SH event ra te per 100 person- years  1741 
- Number of DKA events and DKA event rate per 100 person- years  1742 
- Any adverse event’ rate per [ADDRESS_458967] one event will be compared using Fisher’s exact test.  1746 
 1747 
Any pre -randomization adverse events will be tabulated separately and will include subjects who were 1748 
never randomized.  1749 
 1750 
 Additional Tabulations  and Plots  1751 
The following tabulations will be performed according to treatment group without statistical testing:  [ADDRESS_458968] completion rates for each follow -up visit  1756 
- number and reasons for unscheduled visits and phone calls  1757 
- number of subjects who stopped treatment and reasons  1758 
- sensor use – hours of use and days with any sensor use per week - overall and by [CONTACT_24473]  1759 
- The daily frequency of downloaded BGM use -  overall and by [CONTACT_24473]  1760 
- Sensor performance metrics (difference, absolute relative difference, and International 1761 
Organization for Standardization criteria) – if applicable, by [CONTACT_91121].   1762 
- % time CGM data available  [ADDRESS_458969] and other reported device issues  1765 
- 24 hours plots with median line and IQR bands for % CGM <70 mg/dL, >180 mg/dL, mean, 1766 
70-180 mg/d L, and coefficient of variation  1767 
 1768 
 Tabulations in CTR Arm Only  1769 
The following tabulations will be performed for the CTR arm only:  1770 
- performance metrics, describing the inControl system and its components  1771

 1776 
 Sensitivity Analyses  1777 
If more than 5% of subjects have fewer than [ADDRESS_458970] -randomization CGM data, the two co- 1778 
primary analyses will be replicated  excluding such subjects. 1779 
 1780 
 Other Analyses  1781 
Additional analyses that will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan will include the following:  1782 
• Blinded CGM data  [ADDRESS_458971] of the follow -up period 1787

 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING  1792 
 1793 
 Case Report Forms and Device Data  1794 
The main study data are collected through a combination of electronic case report forms (CRFs) and 1795 
electronic device data files obtained fr om the study software and individual hardware components.  1796 
These electronic device files and electronic CRFs from the study website are considered the primary 1797 
source documentation. 1798 
 1799 
 Quality Assurance and Monitoring  1800 
Designated personnel from the Coordinating Center will be responsible for maintaining quality 1801 
assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems to ensure that the clinical portion of the trial is 1802 
conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, Good 1803 
Clinica l Practice ( GCP ) and the applicable regulatory requirements. Adverse events will be prioritized 1804 
for monitoring.  1805 
 1806 
A risk -based monitoring (RBM) plan will be developed and revised as needed during the course of the 1807 
study , consistent with the FDA “Guidance for Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk - 1808 
Based Approach to Monitoring” (August 2013).  Study conduct and monitoring will conform to  21 1809 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812.  [ADDRESS_458972]  eligibility and adverse events.  1812 
Therefore, the RBM plan will focus on these areas.  As much as possible, remote monitoring will be 1813 
performed in real -time with on -site monitoring performed to evaluate the verity and completeness of the 1814 
key site dat a.  Elements of the RBM may include:  1815 
• Qualification assessment, training, and certification for sites and site personnel 1816 
• Oversight of Institutional Review Board (IRB) coverage and informed consent procedures  1817 
• Central (remote) data monitoring: validation of d ata entry, data edits/audit trail, protocol review 1818 
of entered data and edits, statistical monitoring, study closeout  1819 
• On-site monitoring (site visits): source data verification, site visit report 1820 
• Device accountability  1821 
• Communications with site staff  1822 
• Patient retention and visit completion  1823 
• Quality control reports  1824 
• Management of noncompliance  1825 
• Documenting monitoring activities  1826 
• Adverse event reporting and monitoring [ADDRESS_458973] and progress of the study.  1831

Primary Analyses  1848 
The primary analysis in this study will be a combination of two different hypothesis tests comparing the 1849 
two treatment arms: 1850

 1861 
There were N=125 subjects randomized to open- loop CGM use who met the following crit eria: 1862

• age ≥14.0 years,  1864 
• at least 168 hours of CGM data (i.e. at least 50%) during the 2 -week mock run- in phase.  1865 
 1866 
2. Primary Analysis  1867 
The co -primary outcomes are:  1868 
• superiority in CGM -measured time below 70 mg/dl, and  1869 
• non-inferiority in CGM -measured time above 180 mg/dl over 3 months (non- inferiority limit 1870 
of 5%).  [ADDRESS_458978] the null hypothesis.  1873 
 1874 
CGM  time below 70 mg/dl  1875 
Among all 125 subjects in the JDRF  data, the mean % below 70 mg/dl over 13 weeks = 4.0%, the 1876 
mean % below 70 mg/dl during the 2 weeks run- in phase = 3.7%, and the correlation between the two 1877 
= 0.74. The SD for % below 70 mg/dl over 13 weeks = 3.3% (95% CI: 2.9%, 3.8%). A more 1878 
conservative correlation of 0.5 was used for an effective SD = 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5%, 3.3%).  1879

CGM time above 180 mg/dl  1881 
Among all 125 subjects in the JDRF data, the mean % above 180 mg/dl over 13 weeks = 27%, the 1882 
mean % above 180 mg/dl during the 2 weeks run- in phase = 27% , and the correlation between the two 1883 
= 0.80. The SD for % above 180 mg/dl over 13 weeks = 13% (95% CI: 11%, 15%). A more 1884 
conservative correlation of 0.5 was used for an effective SD = 11% (95% CI: 10%, 13%).  [ADDRESS_458979] both null hypothesis will be computed using Bonferroni adjustments.  1891 
 1892 
The total sample size was computed to be 110 for the following assumptions:  1893 
- 1:1 randomization scheme, 1894 
- 90% overall power that accounts for the two co- primary analyses,  1895 
- A 50% relative reduction in time <70 mg/dL of (i.e., 4.0% vs. 2.0% absolute time)  with an 1896 
effective SD of 2.8% and 2- sided type I error of 5%,  1897 
- A non- inferiority limit of 5% for the treatment group comparison of time >180 mg/dL and 1898 
assuming there is a true difference of 2.5% favoring the CTR group, with an effective standard 1899 
deviation of 11% and a 1 -sided type I error of 2.5%.  1900 
 1901 
The assumptions above with a sample size of N=110 give statistical power:  1902 
− 96% for the hypoglycemia  comparison (superiority) and  1903 
− 94% power for the hyperglycemia comparison (non- inferiority).   [ADDRESS_458980] 1906 
94% + 96% -  100% = 90%. 1907 
 1908 
4. Summary 1909 
For the primary anal ysis, the intervention will be considered effective if a statistically significant 1910 
reduction in % below 70 mg/dl along with an equivalence in % above 180 mg/dl over 3 months (with a 1911 
non-inferiority limit of 5%) will be found (co -primary outcomes). Assuming  an overall power >90%,  1912 
an effective SD of 2.8% and a 50% relative reduction in % below 70 mg/dl (or absolute reduction of 1913 
2.0% assuming baseline of 4%) along with an effective SD of 11%, an improvement of 2.5%, and a 1914 
non-inferiority limit of 5% in % abov e 180mg/dl, a minimum total sample size of [ADDRESS_458981]:  Feasibility of outpatient fully integrated closed - 1922

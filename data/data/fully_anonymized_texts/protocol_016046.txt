1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 To determine the maximum tolerated dose of methoxyamine given in conjunction        
with temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease. 
 1.2 To determine the dose limiting toxicities of the combination of methoxyamine and 
temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease. 
                    1.3 To determine the pharmacokinetics of these two agents when given alone or in 
combination, as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of methoxyamine after a single 
one-hour IV administration.  
 1.4  To determine  relative DNA damage, as single or double strand breaks by [CONTACT_311074] a su rrogate for tumor response 
to the drug combination. 
 
  
2. BACKGROUND  
 Base excision repair (BER) is a fundamental cellular process that re duces the cytotoxicity 
of alkylating agent chemotherapy. Heretofore, no therapeutic agents have targeted this 
DNA repair pathway.   Methoxyamine (MX, NSC-3801) is a small organic amine that inhibits base excision repair (BER) by [CONTACT_311075] /apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA (1).  It 
has been demonstrated that MX alters the AP site structure by [CONTACT_311076] a covalent linkage 
with the aldehyde moiety to form an MX-bound AP  site that is refrac tory to the catalytic 
activity of the apurinic/apyrim idinic endonuclease (APE), lead ing to the interruption of 
BER. Therefore, MX has been studied as a structural modulator of AP sites to enhance 
therapeutic effect of alkyl ating agents such as temozolomide (TMZ, NSC-362856).  
 TMZ is a therapeutic alkylating agent that is  efficacious in the treatment of gliomas, 
melanomas, carcinoid tumors and Hodgki n’s lymphoma. However, drug resistance 
remains a critical problem, often resulting in treatment failure in clinical use.   A major obstacle to effective treatment with TMZ in cancer is the presence of elaborate mechanisms of DNA repair. For instance, TMZ forms O
6-methylguanine (O6mG), 7-
methylguanine (N7mG), and 3-methyladenine (N 3mA) DNA adducts that are repaired by 
[CONTACT_311077].  The O6mG DNA adduct, a cytotoxic and genotoxic lesion, is 
repaired by O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferas e (MGMT). MGMT activity is a 
major mechanism of resistance to alkylating agents.  In contrast, cell death caused by 
O6mG adducts is promoted by [CONTACT_311078] (MMR) system, such that, deficiency 
in MMR is associated with  pronounced resistance to al kylating agents.  N7mG and 
N3mA DNA adducts are removed by [CONTACT_311079] (BER) pathway.  BER, is 
an important drug resistant fact or because it recognizes a vari ety of substrat es and has the 
ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_311066].  BER is the major pathway 
that protects cells against the potentially ha rmful effects of spontaneously and chemically 
occurring DNA damage, including  ( i) inappropriate bases; ( ii) abasic sites that are 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  7
 
formed by [CONTACT_28745]-catalyzed, spontaneous or  chemical-induced base release; and (iii ) 
DNA single strand breaks produced during the processing of damaged DNA.  Efficient 
BER minimizes the impact of these lesions in normal and tumor cells.  Thus, when BER 
is disrupted, these abundant N-methylated DNA adducts and intermediates generated in 
the repair process become highly cytotoxic.  Most importantly, BER disruption is able to 
by[CONTACT_311080] s such as MMR defects and high MGMT activity.   
  
In several preclinical studies, we have demonstrated improved therapeutic efficacy of alkylating agents by [CONTACT_311081]  (2,3).  We have demonstrated in in vivo  
studies that
 MX potentiates the antitu mor effect of TMZ in human tumor xenografts in 
nude mice.  Mice carrying SW 480 colon cancer tumors (AGT  expressing, MMR wt and 
p53 mutant) treated with MX (2 mg/kg) plus TMZ (120 mg/kg) had cessation of tumor growth lasting 50±13 days and very slow regrowth, yielding tumor growth delays of 70±14 days (p < 0.002) compared with untreated  tumors.  In contrast, TMZ (120 mg/kg) 
combined with O6benzylguanine (BG, a new th erapeutic agent being tested in clinical 
trials), gave rise to a tu mor growth delay (T2x-C2x) of 25±2.4 days but was accompanied 
by [CONTACT_311082] (maximum body weight loss from 26 to 20 g, 23%) and very low leukocyte counts (90% decreased) [ADDRESS_382659] treatment.  Thus, compared to 
BG+TMZ, treatment with MX+TMZ was associated with less body weight loss and less myelosuppression (3).  Therefor e, MX inhibition of DNA BER is a promising strategy to 
sensitize tumor cells to therapeutic alkylating agents.  In this first in human phase I clinical trial, methoxyamine was administered as a 5-day 
continuous intravenous infusion based on animal  data. Dosing starte d at a MX dose of 15 
mg/m
2/day for 5 days and plasma samples were  collected and analyzed for MX using 
validated methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters  were derived using a single compartment 
iv infusion model and plasma methoxyamine concentrations from 5 patients across 15 dosing cycles using WINNONLIN PK model 2 software.  Pharmacokinetic studies obtained from the 5 patients who enrolled in the study demonstrated an unexpected prolonged half-l ife of methoxyamine (4).  In humans, the 
half life (t½) of MX was estimated to be 45.3 hours (range: 32.1 - 68.8 hours) which 
represents a 10-fold increase when compared to the MX ha lf life observed in dogs (t½ = 
4.5 hours) and a 143-fold increase when compared  to the MX half life observed in rats 
(t½ = 19 min). The volume of distribution (V ss) was estimated to  be 1,437 L and the 
clearance (CL) was estimated to be 22.47 L/h. The Cmax (across all patients) was 41.4 ng/mL. Individual pharmacokinetic exposures and derived PK parameters are presented for each cycle for each patient in table 1, demons trating very little intr a- and interpatient 
variability.  Table 1. Individual pharmacokinetic exposures and derived PK parameters

The long half-life of methoxyamine in human plasma indicates that iv administration 
over a shorter time period than 5 days should achieve plasma concentrations needed for 
activity during the five day period of concurrent temozo lomide dosing.  A 60 minute 
infusion is desirable to facilitate patient convenience and accrual to the trial.  The 
estimated dose of methoxyamine given over 60 minutes required to produce a Cmax 
equal to the observed Cmax of 41.40 ng/mL obtained with 5 day continuous IV 
administration was therefore calculated as follows, and simulation data are included in appendix C: 
 
Amount of Methoxyamine (A) needed to produce an observed C max of 41.40 ug/L by [CONTACT_238678]: 
 
A = C max x V ss = 41.40 μ g/L x 1,437.27 L = 59,502.98 μg =59.50 mg 
 
Additional methoxyamine (A inf) required to compensate for methoxyamine eliminated during a 60 
minute infusion period: 
 
Ainf = A(1-e-kt) = 59.50 mg (1-e-(0.0153/h)(1 h) ) = 0.90 mg 
 
(k = 0.693/T 1/2 = 0.693/45.26 h = 0.0153/h) 
 
Therefore, the total methoxyamine dose (A total) given over 60 minutes by [CONTACT_311083] a C max of 41.4 ng/mL over 60 minutes was estimated as: 
 
Atotal = A + A inf = 59.50 mg + 0.90 mg = 60.40 mg 
 
The estimated total dose of methoxyamine given over a 60 minute i.v. infusion needed to produce a Cmax of 41.40 ng/mL ( 60.40 mg) corresponds to 30 mg/m
2 (assuming an 
average BSA of 2 m2).  Decreasing this calcul ated dose by 50% to 15mg/m2 provides a 
rational and safe starting methoxyamine dos e to administer intravenously over 60 
minutes.  In sum, a single dose of MX administered by 60  minute iv infusion in patients enrolled at 
dose level 1 (15 mg/m
2), represents a conservative init ial dose level based on human PK 
parameters obtained from five patients who received methoxyamine at doses of 15 mg/m
2/day IV over five days for a total of fifteen cycles.[ADDRESS_382660] MGMT-induced  resistance to this agent.6 The FDA noted that there 
was neurotoxicity as DLT from combining te mozolomide with methoxyamine in animal 
toxicology studies and they advi sed us to exclude patients with  brain metastasis or glioma 
from the initial Phase I study.  We now propos e to expand the scope of this study while 
maintaining the original aims by [CONTACT_1583] a “ dose behind” cohort of patients with brain 
metastasis or glioma.   This cohort will be treated with a 1 hr infusion MX dose that is 
one dose level below that of patients currently  enrolling with advanced malignancies but 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/[ADDRESS_382661] received prior temozolomide, the 
initial dose level -1 will be 100 mg/m2 of TMZ orally on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle and 
15 mg/m2 of MX i.v. over one hour on day 1. Once patients without br ain disease have 
accrued to dose level 2 of MX, we will begin to enroll patients with brain metastasis or 
gliomas at dose level 1. 
  
3. PATIENT SELECTION 
 
Given the animal toxicity data  and CNS involvement of a pr oportion of eligible patients, 
two cohorts of eligible patients will be enrolled in the trial: 
 
 Cohort A will include patients with  no CNS disease  
 Cohort B will include patients with  CNS disease (including recurrent or 
progressive malignant glioma s and/or brain metastatic disease). Brain metastases 
do not have to be new to pa rticipate in this study.   
 
Inclusion of two separate cohorts was chos en, because this design will allow us to 
address toxicity concerns generated by [CONTACT_311084] a cohort of patients with no CNS disease (cohort A) where development of potential treatment-related CNS toxicity 
will not be confounded by [CONTACT_094]-existing or disease-progression-related symptoms. Inclusion of patients with CNS disease in cohort B will allow us to evaluate the 
combination in the group of patients where TMZ is currently extensively evaluated and 
used.

 If none of the 3 patients at a dose level experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle, new patients may be entered at the next higher dose level.  
 If 1/[ADDRESS_382667] patient in the expanded cohort (4th at 
the given DL), experiences no DLT, th en the remaining 2 patients can start 
treatment without a necessary delay.  
o As of protocol v22, if 1/[ADDRESS_382668] s in Cohort A dose

 If the final dose level is deemed the MTD, [ADDRESS_382670] non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 or hematologic grade 4 drug-related toxicities (CTC 
version 3.0) occurring within the first 28 days of the study will be considered a DLT. 
 
Cohort A, Dose level 1
:  Two DLTs were observed in Dose Level 1 of Cohort A:  grade 
3 psychosis and grade 3 allerg ic reaction.  Upon further review of the hypersensitivity 
reaction, it is believed th at this was an idiosyncratic even t, and further expansion of this

dose level is warranted.  Dose level 1 of Cohort A will be expanded to 10 evaluable 
patients.  Further dose escalation will occur on ly if less than 4 out of the 10 patients 
experience a DLT.  Enrollment to subsequent  dose levels will follow the rules outlined 
above. 
 
4.2 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxici ty (DLT) and Criteria for Dose 
Escalation  
DLT in a given patient is defined as any grade III non-hematologic (thought to 
be MX related) or IV non-hematological  toxicity or any grade IV anemia, 
neutropenia or thrombocytope nia lasting greater than 7 days, that is felt to be 
related to MX or the MX + TMZ drug combination occurring during the first 
cycle of treatment.   MTD (maximum tolerated dose) will be  defined based on the toxicities 
observed during the first cycle of treatment   Definition of MTD: The MTD is defined as the highest dose tested in which 
none or only one patient experienced DLT attributable to the study drug 
combination, when at least six patients were treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. The MTD is one dose level below the highest dose 
tested in which [ADDRESS_382671] 6 patients will be treated at the MTD.  Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 5.  
Special consideration is given to the ev aluation of neurolog ic toxicity given 
the animal toxicity data and CNS i nvolvement of a proportion of eligible 
patients. 
 Specifically: - all patients will be evaluated by a staff Neurologist prior to initiation of treatment 
- patients will undergo frequent (every  4-8 hours) neurologic checks by a 
CRU RN during the 1-day inpatien t CRU stay on the first day of 
treatment. 
- Patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_941] c overing Oncology clinician during the 
1-day inpatient CRU stay on cycle 1. 
 
A neurology consult will be obtained for any observed treatment-related 
neurologic toxicity ≥ grade 2. For patients enrolled  in cohort B (patients with 
CNS disease) with pre-existing neurologic toxicity cleared for participation by [CONTACT_177421]-oncology team, a neuro-onc ology or neurology consult will be 
obtained for any observed treatment -related worsening in neurologic 
toxicities.  
CASE 1Y05  v2

Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according to the following 
scheme.  DLT is defined above.     
 
Number of Patients with DLT at a 
Given Dose Level Escalation Decision Rule 
0 out of 3 Enter 3 patients at the next dose level. 
>2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be 
declared the maximally admini stered dose (highest dose 
administered).  Three (3) additional patients will be 
entered at the next lowest dose level if only [ADDRESS_382672] 3 more patients at this dose level.  
 If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the 
next dose level. 
 If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the 
maximally administered dose.  Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if 
only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose. 
o As of protocol v22, if 1/[ADDRESS_382673] already treated three 
subjects in Cohort A dose level 6 and seven subjects in Cohort A dose level 7, none of whom 
experienced non-CNS toxicities  
<[ADDRESS_382674] be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose. 
 
Cohort A, Dose level 1 :  Dose level 1 of Cohort A w ill be expanded to 10 evaluable 
patients.  Further dose escalation will occur on ly if less than 4 out of the 10 patients 
experience a DLT.  Enrollment to subsequent do se levels will follow the rules outlined in 
Sec. 4.1. 
 4.3  Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Compazine or ondansetron in the usual doses may be used to manage constitutional symptoms of nausea  and vomiting. Steroids may be added 
based on the treating physicians di scretion. Blood products may be 
administered at the treating physician’s discretion. Growth f actors will not be 
administered during cycle 1, but can be administered in subsequent cycles 
based on treating physician’s judgment. 
 
4.4  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  16
 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
 Disease progression, 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of 
treatment, 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 General or specific changes in th e patient's condition that render 
the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
  5. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
On the day of starting each cycle, neutrophil and platelet hematologic parameters must have returned to eligibility values.  Furthermore, grade [ADDRESS_382675] return to a grade 2 or better. If these criteria are not met, therapy will be held by 1 week increments for a maximum of 2 weeks. If treatment cannot be given dur ing that time frame the patient will be 
removed from study.  Any grade 4 hematologic toxicity will resu lt in a dose reduction to the lower dose 
level for methoxyamine/temozolomide. If th is occurs at dose level 1, the dose of 
temozolomide will be decreased to dose le vel -1 (75 mg/m2/d for 5 days if in the 
CNS cohort; 100mg/m2 for 5 days if in the non-CNS cohort). 
 
 
6. AGENT FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT  
 
6.1 Temodar (Temozolomide) 
 
6.1.1 Availability: Temodar is commercially available.   6.1.2 Chemical Name - The chemical
 name [CONTACT_311098] 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-
4-oxoimidazo[5,1-d]-as -tetrazine-8-carboxamide.  
 6.1.3 Molecular Formula - C
6H6N6O2 
 6.1.4 Mechanism of Action - Temozolomide is not directly activ e but undergoes rapid 
non-enzymatic conversion at physiologic pH  to the reactive compound MTIC. The 
cytotoxicity of MTIC is t hought to be primarily due to alkylation
 of DNA. Alkylation 
(methylation) occurs mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine.  
 6.1.5 Pharmacokinetics - Temozolomide is rapi [INVESTIGATOR_311068]; peak plasma concentrations occur in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and 
extent of temozolomide absorption. Mean p eak plasma concentra tion and AUC decreased 
by 32 % and 9 %, respectively, and Tmax increased 2- fold (from 1.1 to 2.25 hours) when

 6.1.7 Route of Administration – Oral  6.1.8 Toxicity - The incidence of adverse even ts in the 158 patients in the Anaplastic 
Astrocytoma study for whom data are available.  In the absence of a control group, it is 
not clear in many cases whether these events sh ould be attributed to temozolomide or the 
patients' underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue and hematologic effects appear to be clearly drug-related. The most fr equently occurring side effects were nausea, 
vomiting, headache and fatigue. The adverse ev ents were usually NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria (CTC) Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate  in severity) and we re self-limiting, with 
nausea and vomiting readily cont rolled with antiemetics. The incidence of severe nausea 
and vomiting (CTC grade 3 or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectivel y. Myelosuppression 
(thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the dose-limiting adverse event. It usually 
occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative.  Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on 
average, within 14 days of nadir counts. Th e median nadirs occurr ed at 26 days for 
platelets [range 21-40 days] and 28 days for neutrophils [range 1-44 days]. Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil
 nadir and 20% (32/158) of  patients had a platelet 
nadir which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. (See WARNINGS). Less than 
10% of patients required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], blood transfusion or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression.   In clinical trial experience with 110-111 women and 169-174 men (depending on 
measurements), there were higher rates of  Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/µL) 
thrombocytopenia (< 20,000 cells/µL) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy: (12% versus 5% and 9% ve rsus 3%, respectively).  
 
In the entire Safety database for which he matologic data exist (N= 932), 7% (4/61) and 
9.5% (6/63) of patients over age [ADDRESS_382677] cycle, respectiv ely. For patients less than or equal to age
 70, 
7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Gr ade [ADDRESS_382678] cycle, respectively. 
 
Data released by [CONTACT_311086] 
(EORTC) in January 2014 shows that amongs t 44 patients receiving temozolomide 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  19
 
worldwide, hepatic injury, including fatal he patic failure was identified in patients 
receiving temozolomide. These events are rare but for patients with liver function 
abnormalities, the risk/benefit of  receiving temozolomide should be considered prior to 
initiation of this agent.  6.2.  METHOXYAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE :

Store at 25ºC; excursions permitted to 15-[ADDRESS_382680] ored upright at controlled room 
temperature ( 25ºC; excursions permitted to 15-30 ºC). 
 
3.  TRC102 Injection Preparation 
Methoxyamine HCl Injection will be pr epared in the pharmacy and diluted 
with normal saline in a 250 mL bag.  Following dilution in normal saline, 
Methoxyamine HCl Injection will be administered at room temperature within 
24 hours of preparation if refrigerated or  8 hours of preparation if maintained 
at room temperature.  Depending on the dose and patient weight, multiple 
vials may be required for a single dose.   
The following formulae should be used to calculate the volume of 
Methoxyamine HCl Injection to be added to normal saline: 
 Patient weight (kg) × dose leve l (mg/kg) divided by [CONTACT_311087] (mg/mL) = volume of Methoxyamine HCl Injection (mL) to be administered. 
The volume of Methoxyamine HCl Injec tion to be administered can be 
rounded up or down to the nearest 0.1 mL.  If an increment of 0.05 mL is 
calculated, the volume should be rounde d up.  The calculated volume of 
Methoxyamine HCl Injection is to be diluted in normal saline.  A 250 mL 
normal saline bag is recommended for th is purpose.  Appropriate judgment 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  21
 
should be exercised in withdrawing an  adequate amount of saline (if any) 
necessary to permit injection of the appropriate volume of diluted antibody 
into the appropriate sized  normal saline bag.   
 
4.The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretions of methyoxyamine.  
 
Methoxyamine is a small organic amine; it is very soluble in aqueous solution and 
plasma.  A [14C]-MX protein-binding study in mouse plasma at 37 C indicated 
insignificant protein binding.  100% of ra diolabelled MX was recovered from the 
samples after Centrifree processing, indi cating a lack of reactivity with plasma 
proteins. 
 6.2.3. Toxicology information:   Methoxyamine (MX) is a novel biochemical inhi bitor of the base excision repair (BER) 
pathway.  It has potential as a chemotherape utic agent through its ability to synergize 
with compounds whose DNA damage is normally repaired by [CONTACT_311088], such as the alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ).  In vitro  studies and xenograft models have 
confirmed synergistic cytotoxicity in tu mor cells treated with both MX and TMZ. 
 
(a) The toxicity of MX was st udied in Fischer 344 rats.   MX was administrated as a 5-
day continuous IV infusion in  sterile water.  Twelve dose groups, including vehicle 
control, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 200 and 500 mg/kg/ day were studied using 
4-5 males/dose group.  Body weight was meas ured baseline, and on days 1-5, 8, and 12.  
Blood was drawn for clinical pathology base line and on day 8 and 12.  Animals were 
sacrificed on day 12.  Histopathology was pe rformed on animals that received vehicle 
control, 2.5, 20 and 50 mg/kg/day.    
  Mortality:  all rats in th e 500 mg/kg/day group were found dead or sacrificed moribund 
on day 1.  All animals in the 200 mg/ kg/day group were found dead on day 2. 
 
Clinical Observations, Body Weights: anim als given 500 mg/kg/day had bradycardia 
dyspnea, convulsions, prostration and/or were comatose within the first few hours of the 
beginning of dosing.  There were no statically  significant changes in body weight in any 
group compared to the vehicle control group.     Hematology and Clinical chemistry: these para meters are not available for animals given 
200 mg/kg/day.  Animals that received 500 mg /kg/day that were sacrificed moribund had 
elevated AST/ALT (4-6X).  A decrease in  RBC (25-30%) was noted  on day 12 in rats 
given 50 mg/kg/day.   Histopathology: no drug-related le sions were seen in animals given 20 or 50 mg/kg/day.   
Conclusions: the maximum tolerated dose of MX given as a 5-day continuous iv infusion in rats is greater than 50 mg/kg/day (> 300 mg/m2/day) but less th an 200 mg/kg/day (< 
1200 mg/m2/day).   
CASE 1Y05  v2

(b) Multiple dose toxicity study of meth oxyamine and temozolomide in rats and 
dogs .  The effect of escalating doses of MX on the pharmacology and toxicity of a 
constant dose of TMZ was assessed in rats  and dogs on a 5-day schedule.  TMZ was 
given orally, and MX was administered as a continuous iv infusion. 
 
In rats:  vehicle control, MX alone (100 mg /kg/day), TMZ alone  (30 mg/kg/day), 
or 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg/day MX in comb ination with 30 mg/kg/day TMZ were 
studied using 10 rats/sex/dose group.  Body we ights were determined baseline, and on 
days 1-5, 8, 15, 22, and 33.  Blood was drawn for clinical pathology on days 8, 15, 22 and 
33.  Animals were sacrificed on day 8 or 33, and histopathology was performed.  
 
In dogs : vehicle control, MX alone (15 mg /kg/day), TMZ alone (2.5 mg/kg/day), 
5 or 15 mg/kg/day MX in combination with  2.5 mg/kg/day TMZ were studied using 2 
males and 2 females/dose group.  Due to adve rse clinical signs seen in males given 15 
mg/kg/day TMZ, females in these dose gr oups received 10 mg/kg/day MX TMZ.  
Body weights were determined at baseline,  and on days 1-5, 8, 12, 19, 26, and 33.  Body 
temperatures were measured baseline, imme diately prior to and at 2 and 4 hours after 
each TMZ dose, and on day 6-8, 12, 15, 19, 26 and 33.  Food consumption was measured 
daily on days 1-5 and weekly thereafter.  Blood was drawn for clinical pathology on days 
8, 12, 15, 19, 26 and 33.  One animal/sex/gro up was sacrificed on day 8 or 33, and 
histopathology was performed. 
 In summary, in both rats and dogs, MX  alone (1200-3000 mg/m2/day in rats and 
300 mg/m2/day in dogs) caused dose-limiting neur otoxicity (convulsions, tremors, ataxia, 
and/or head tilt).  TMZ alone caused minimal anemia in dogs (50 mg/m2/day) and minimal to moderate neutropenia in rats (180 mg/m2/day).  In rats, TMZ-induced neutropenia increased with increasing doses of MX.  Lethality also increased in rats with 
increasing doses of MX in combination w ith TMZ.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
in rats is 25 mg/kg/day MX + 30 mg/kg/da y TMZ. In dogs, the combination of MX + 
TMZ did not produce lethality.  The MTD is ~ 10-15 mg/kg/day MX + 2.5 mg/kg/day 
TMZ.  The recommended clinical starting dose of MX is 15 mg/m2/day when given as a 
5-day continuous iv infusion in combination with orally administered TMZ.  This dose is one-tenth the MTD in the most sensitive species (rat).  
 Pharmacokinetic interaction studies were  performed with TMZ and MX in F344 
rats and dogs (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center).  TMZ concentrations in rat and dog plasma 
were analyzed after treatment with TMZ a nd MX.  Results showed that MX did not 
appear to alter the pharmacoki netics of TMZ in either rats or dogs. (Plasma samples were 
obtained for TMZ analysis [ADDRESS_382681]-TMZ on day 5 and 10 min before the end of the 
MX infusion on day 6 for MX analysis.)  
 
(c) In vitro  studies.   In vitro  bone marrow assays were conduc ted to determine the effect 
of MX on the myelotoxicity of TMZ.  Gr anulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units 
(CFU-GM) were obtained from two human and two murine donors.   The study provided 
evidence that TMZ is likely more potent to  murine than human CFU-GM. Single agent 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  23
 
MX was well tolerated in both murine and human CFU-GM. Combination of TMZ with 
MX shows that MX mildly enhances TMZ toxicity to CFU-GM in both species. 
  
7. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
This protocol will utilize the Translational Research Core (TRC) of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center for the collectio n, processing, storage, and distribution of 
patient samples before and after therapy.

 The TRC will schedule patient sam
ple collection in direct communication with the 
clinical trials research nurse. For UH pa tients a representative from the TRC will be 
present during patient sampling, wherein every sample will be given a patient identifier, and collected in the appropriate tubes or vials.   1. Pharmacokinetic studies 
 
 PK blood sampling schedule for Temozolomide  (TMZ) and Methoxyamine (MX) during 
cycle 1 are shown in the table that follows .  Depending upon the PK data from initial 
patients, the timing of blood draws for corre lative studies may be revised for future 
patients.   PK data during and following single one-hour MX infusion may be obtained in all subsequent cycles (cycles 2 and beyond) as necessary.    Preclinical data have not provided any eviden ce of significant drug interactions between 
TMZ and MX. However, this needs to be c onfirmed. TMZ is not stable in plasma, so 
plasma sample isolation must be carried out  without delay. Plasma from one tube of 
whole blood will be used for both TMZ and MX determinations.  Collection Instructions for MX and TMX determinations: 
1. Draw 5 ml of blood into a lithiu m heparinized, chilled syringe.  
2. Immerse the tube in an icewater bath for 2 min.  
3. Centrifuge at 1500 x g and 4 deg. C. for 5 min.  
4. Transfer 1.0 ml of plasma  into each of two Nunc brand cryostorage tubes.  
5. To one tube, to be used for TMZ determination, add 0.1 ml of cold 1 M HCl.  
6. Cap, mix, label, and store frozen at -60 ˚C.

a) Methoxyamine determination  
 
An LC-MS/MS method for quantitative determination of MX in human plasma was developed.  In this method, MX and its stable isotope methoxyl-d
3-amine (MX-d3 as 
internal standard) were directly de rivatized in human plasma with 4-( N,N-
diethylamino)benzaldehyde.  The derivatized  MX and IS were extracted by [CONTACT_311089]-tert -
butyl ether, and separated isocratically on a Xterra C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm) using an 
aqueous mobile phase containing 45% acetonitrile  and 0.4% formic acid at a flow rate of 
0.200 ml/min.  Quantitation of MX was carried out by [CONTACT_27873]-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode of positive turbo-ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry. This method has been validated according to FDA guideli nes for bioanalytical method.  The linear 
calibration range for MX was 1.25-500 ng/ml in human plasma with a correlation 
coefficient ≥ 0.9993.  The intra- and inter-assay preci sion (%CV) at three concentration 
levels (3.50, 45.0 and 450 ng/ml) ranged 0.9-1% and 0.8-3%, respectively. The stability studies showed that MX met the acceptable criteria under all tested conditions.   
b) Temozolomide determination
 
 Analyses will be performed in the Core Pharmacology laboratory, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Hoppel.   2.  DNA strand break determination by [CONTACT_311090].
 
 The comet assay is based on the ability of denatured, cleaved DNA fragments to migrate out of fixed cells under the influence of an  electric field.  Undamaged DNA migrates 
slower and remains within the confines of the nuclei when a current is app lied. This assay 
is a simple assay but sens itively detects both single an d double stranded DNA breaks, 
resulting from AP sites as well  as other alkali labile DNA a dducts in individual cells.  To 
perform this assay, the cell suspension (1x 10
5 /ml cold PBS) is mixed with 1% low 
melting point agarose at 42 C at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v) and immediately pi[INVESTIGATOR_311070] (75  l) 
onto a CometSlide. When the agarose has set,  slides are electrophor esed in both alkali 
and neutral solution. DNA is stained using SYBR Green and the images of comets are 
visualized and captured using a microscope coupled with a digital camera. DNA damage 
is assessed based on evaluati on of the DNA “comet” tail shape and migration distance 
that are analyzed using Komet ve rsion 6.[ADDRESS_382683] shown that DN A strand breaks are correlated with the 
levels of AP sites in cells treated with TMZ. A 2 hr treatment with TMZ plus MX generated higher levels of DNA strand breaks (up to 2-fold greater), compared to TMZ 
alone. This demonstrates that the comet a ssay can be used to monitor drug effects on 
DNA damage in clinical studies. Analyses for DNA strand breaks by [CONTACT_311091].   Collection Instructions:

evaluations will then return to an ever y 8 week schedule. All responses will be

9.1 Definitions  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_107330] (RECIST) Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205-216, 2000].  Changes in only 
the largest diameter (uni dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provide d below. The term “evaluable” in 
reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_382686] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >
20 mm 
with conventional techniques (C T, MRI, x-ray) or as > [ADDRESS_382687] be recorded in millimeters  (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
9.1.2 Non-measurable Disease 
All other lesions (or sites of diseas e), including small lesions (longest 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  27
 
diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_382688] scan), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites,  pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic le sions are all non-
measurable. 
 
9.1.3 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximu m of five lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, represen tative of all involved orga ns, should be identified 
as target lesions and recorded and measured at  baseline.  Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of th eir size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitab ility for accurate repeated measurements (either 
by [CONTACT_311093] c linically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
for all target lesions will be calculat ed and reported as the baseline sum 
LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218]. 
 
9.1.4 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) should be identified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions 
include measurable lesions that ex ceed the maximum numbers per organ 
or total of all involved organs as  well as non-measurable lesions.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be  noted throughout follow-up.  
9.2  Guidelines for Evaluation  of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluati ons should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment a nd never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatment. 
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiat ed area might or  
might not be considered measurable.   
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-
up. Imaging-based evaluation is pref erred to evaluation by [CONTACT_311094] a treatment.  Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/[ADDRESS_382689], abdomen, and pelvis .  Head and neck tu mors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols. 
 
Ultrasound (US).   When the primary endpoint  of the study is objective 
response evaluation, US should not be used  to measure tumor lesions.  It is, 
however, a possible alternative to clin ical measurements of superficial 
palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesi ons, and thyroid nodules.  US might 
also be useful to confirm the complete  disappearance of superficial lesions 
usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.   The utilization of these techniques for objective 
tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context requi re sophisticated equipm ent and a high level of 
expertise that may only be available in some centers.  Therefore, the 
utilization of such techniques fo r objective tumor response should be 
restricted to validation purposes in reference centers.  However, such 
techniques can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained.  Tumor markers .  Tumor markers alone cannot be  used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper nor mal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific additional criteria for standardized usage of pr ostate-specific antigen (PSA) and CA-125 
response in support of clinical  trials are being developed. 
 
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be us ed to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., 
residual lesions in tumor types such  as germ cell tumors, where known 
residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) 
and progressive disease. 
  9.3  Response Criteria 
 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  29
 
9.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):Disapp earance of all ta rget lesions 
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of 
the longest diameter (LD) of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify 
for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
 
9.3.2 Evaluation of Non-target Lesions 
 
 Complete Response (CR): Disappear ance of all non- target lesions 
and normalization of tumor marker level 
 
  Incomplete Response/    
  Stable Disease (SD):   Persis tence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits 
 
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearan ce of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and th e progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or study chair). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initiall y above the upper no rmal limit, they 
must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response. 
    9.3.[ADDRESS_382690] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/[ADDRESS_382691] measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria (s ee section 9.3.1 and 9.4.1).

 Patients with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring

progression at that time shoul d be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Ev ery effort should be made to 
document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of 
treatment. 
 
 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual 
disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recomm ended that the 
residual lesion be invest igated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response status.

  9.5   Evaluation of response in pa tients with CNS disease (cohort B) 
 
In addition to evaluation of respons e using RECIST criteria, additional 
analyses will be performed on patien ts with CNS disease enrolled in 
cohort B. More specifically, contra st-enhanced MRI or  CT scans and 
neurological examinations will be used to determine the response to 
therapy.   The following modified definitions of response will be used in the additional analyses: 
 
 Complete Response: Complete disappearrance of all tumor on 
MRI/CT scan, off all glucocorticoids with a stable or improving neurological examination for a minimum of 4 weeks. 
 
 Partial Response: Greater than or  equal to 50% reduction in tumor 
size on MRI/CT scan, on a stable or decreasing dose of glucocorticoids, with a stab le or improving neurological 
examination for a minimum of 4 weeks. 
 
 Progressive Disease: Progressive  neurological abnormalities not 
explained by [CONTACT_167748] (e.g. anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, 
hyperglycemia, etc.) or a greater th an 25% increase in  the size of 
the tumor by [CONTACT_9268]/CT scan. If neurological status deteriorates, on a stable or 
 
 increasing dose of steroids, or if  new lesions appear on serial 
MRI/CT, further study treatment will be discontinued. 
 
CASE 1Y05  v2

 Stable Disease: A patient whose cl inical status and MRI/CT scan 
do not meet the criteria for Complete Response, Partial Response 
or Progressive Disease.  
  
  
10.  ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
This protocol will adhere to the policies of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan in  accordance with NCI regulations. 
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  
The following list of AEs ( Section 10.1 ) and the characteristic s of an observed AE 
(Section 10.2 ) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in 
addition  to routine reporting.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_382694] (CAEPR) provides a single, complete list of repor ted and/or potential adverse events 
(AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_110377].   In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset,
 the Agent Specific Adverse 
Event List (ASAEL), appears in a sepa rate column and is identified with bold 
and italicized  text.  This subset  of AEs (the ASAEL) contains events that are 
considered ‘expected’ for expedited reporting purposes only.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List (CAEPR) 
for Methoxyamine   
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potent ial Risks list (CAEPR) was developed to 
provide a single, complete list of reported and/ or potential adverse events associated with 
an agent using a uniform presentation of  events by [CONTACT_6764]. The table below 
identifies reported adverse events (AEs) that may be expected to occur with 
Methoxyamine and/or Temozolamide. The subset  of AEs that is used  to guide expedited 
reporting requirements [i.e., the Agent Speci fic Adverse Event List (ASAEL)], as 
presented in the right hand column, is identified with bold and italic  text. This subset 
contains events that are considered exp ected and may not need to be reported via 
expedited AE reporting.

2 dated 03/18/15  34
 
10.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T (SAE) REPORTING  
 
All adverse clinical experiences, whether obs erved by [CONTACT_271199], must be recorded, with deta ils about the duration and intensity of each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the study agent(s), and the patient’s outcome.  
The investigator must evaluate each adve rse experience for its relationship to the 
study agents and for its seriousness.  The investigator must evaluate all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered  clinically significant, the 
investigator must provide details about  the action taken with respect to the 
combination of drugs and about the patient’s outcome.  Adverse events will use the descriptions a nd grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Toxicity Criter ia (CTC), version 3.0. 
  
Severity Ratings 
 
The investigator will evaluate the severi ty of each adverse experience using the 
following definitions:  
 Mild-noticeable to the patient, does not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities, usually does not require additional therapy, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of the study drug. 
 Moderate-interferes with the patient’s  daily activities, possibly requires 
additional therapy, but does not re quire discontinuati on of study drug. 
 Severe-severely limits the patient’s daily activities and may require 
discontinuation of the study drug. 
 Serious, Life-threatening, or Unexpected  Adverse Experience (21 CFR 314.80) 
 
 A “serious” adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent, significant and/or perm anent disability/incapacity, requires 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or is a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  A “ life-threatening” adverse experience 
places the patient at immediate risk of death in the judgment of the 
investigator. 
 The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important 
medical event . Medical and scientific judgm ent should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such 
as important medical events that may not  be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_311072] e patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These should also usually be cons idered serious. Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/15  35
 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or c onvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of  drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 An “unexpected” adverse experience is one not identified in nature, severity, 
or frequency in the Investigator’s Broc hure or the product package insert for 
the study drug. 
 
Relationship to Study Drug 
 
 Probably Related-the experience occurs  within a reasonable time period 
following drug administration or follow s a known response for the drug and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_311095] (including 
use of concomitant medications). The definition of “related” being that there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience. 
 Unknown Relationship-the etiology of the experience is not known and the 
experience does not occur within a reasonable time period following drug 
administration and does not follow a known response pattern for the drug. 
 Definitely Not Related-the experience is not known to be caused by [CONTACT_50464]. 
 
Investigator Reporting Responsibilities  
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements. 
 All adverse experience reports must incl ude the patient number, age, sex, weight, 
severity of reaction (mild, moderate, seve re), relationship to study drug (probably 
related, unknown relations hip, definitely not related), da te and time of administration 
of test medications and all concomitant me dications, and medical treatment provided.  
The investigator will record this info rmation on FORM 3500 A (or Medwatch form) 
and will provide reports of adverse experiences on a regular ba sis during the study 
conduct.  The investigator is responsible  for evaluating all adverse events to 
determine whether criteria for “serious” and “unexpected” as defined above are 
present. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting 
 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Ve rsion 3.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage (http://ctep.info.ni h.gov).  All appropriate treatm ent areas have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0.  All advers e clinical experiences, whether observed 
by [CONTACT_56313] , must be recorded, with details about 
the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], th e action taken with re spect to the test 
drug, and the patient's outcome.  The inve stigator must evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship to th e test drug and for its seriousness. 
 The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory re sult is considered clinically significant, 
CASE 1Y05  v2
2 dated 03/18/[ADDRESS_382696] 
drug and about the patient's outcome. 
 
Investigator Reporting to the FDA: 
 
Adverse drug reactions should be report ed promptly to th e Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in writing by [CONTACT_104489]/physician engaged in clinical research if the type of effect is Serious, Unlisted/unexpected event, and at least 
possibly associated to the drug  and has not previously been reported in the 
Investigators brochure, or re ference safety information document, or literature.  A 
clear description of the suspected reaction should be  provided along with an 
assessment as to whether the event is drug or disease related.   
 The investigator/physician must also call the FDA as soon as an adverse reaction 
occurs.  The phone number is ([PHONE_6504].  A recorder is available after hours.  
Report these reactions to the FDA within ten (10) working days both verbal and 
written.  The address of the Food and Drug Administration is: 
 FDA  Division of Oncology   HFD-150  1451 Rockville Pi[INVESTIGATOR_311073], MD  [ZIP_CODE] 
 The phone number of the FDA is (301) 594- 5778.  Please ask to speak with Maureen 
Pelosi in the Division of Oncology  
10.[ADDRESS_382697] ance with NCI regulations. The Data and 
Safety Toxicity Committee will review all serious adverse ev ents and toxicity reports 
as well as annual reviews.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
For cohort A, a maximum of [ADDRESS_382698] that a 1.5- fold increase in TMZ and a 10 -fold increase in MX is being tested in 7 
dose escalation levels it is hi ghly unlike that the maximum nu mber of patients will need 
to be enrolled at each level.  
 
 The baseline levels (at 0h) of AP sites a nd DNA strand breaks will be compared to the 
levels at various time points (i.e. 2h, 4h a nd 122h) after treatment by [CONTACT_54959] T-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. The predictive value of PK parameters (e.g. AUC, C
max), levels 
of AP sites and levels of DNA strand breaks on clinical resp onse and grade 3/4 toxicity 
will be examined by [CONTACT_311096] r adjusting the dose level; their predictive 
value on time to event outcomes, such as disease progression free survival, will be tested using (extended) Cox model after controlling other f actors including dose level.

Abstract:  
Background:  MX is the first base excision repair  (BER) inhibitor ev aluated in humans. 
MX blocks the BER pathway by [CONTACT_311075]/pymidinic (AP) sites in 
DNA. In several preclinical studies, improved therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated 
with various chemotherapeutic agents including alkylating agents, such as TMZ. Initial 
results and correlative studies of the first in humans administration of MX are presented. 
 
Methods:  This ongoing phase I dose-escalation trial investigates the safety, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of MX given as an intravenous 
continuous infusion (CI) for 5 days in combination with TMZ given orally for 5 days on a 
28-day cycle. PD markers, including analys is of AP sites measured on DNA extracted 
from patients’ mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as  well as DNA strand break determined by 
[CONTACT_311097] e 5-day treatment with MX and TMZ, are 
included. 
 
Results:  [ADDRESS_382701] enrolled, 4 at dose-level (DL) 1 
(TMZ 100 mg/m2/day, x5days and MX 15 mg/m 2/day, x5days CI) and 1 at DL 2 (TMZ 
150 mg/m2/day, x5days, MX at same dose as in DL 1). Primary tumors include colon 
cancer (n=2), head and neck cancer (n=1), ra diation-associated sarcoma (n=1), thymic 
carcinoma (n=1). Treatment has been well tolerated. No treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation were reported. No grade [ADDRESS_382702] o ccurred. Grades 1-2 toxicities observed include: 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, dyspnea on exertion, anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, 
hypophosphatemia, dyspnea on exertion, nystagmus.  PK analyses on samples from the [ADDRESS_382703] PK 
profile different from the one observed in rats and dogs, where ha lf-life of MX was 
estimated to be 19 minutes and 4.5 hours re spectively. In humans,  MX half life is 
estimated to be 45.3 hours (range: 32 - 68.8 hours).  An increase in formation of AP sites over time in cells was detected after patients received a single dose of TMZ (100 mg/m2), reaching the highest levels [ADDRESS_382704] 60% reduction in 
detectable AP sites, due to the binding of MX to AP sites to form MX-bound AP sites. 
CASE 1Y05  v2

Comet assay in PBMCs following treatment with the combination of MX and TMZ 
detected a 1.5 to 3-fold increase of DNA strand breaks compared to single dose of TMZ.  Conclusions:  Initial data from the first in humans MX phase I clinical trial demonstrate 
that MX in combination with TMZ is well tolerated. MX has a distinct PK profile in humans, corresponding to a 10-fold increase in estimated half-life when compared to the 
half-life observed in dogs. PD demonstration of MX’s biologic activity on patients’ 
mononuclear cells has been demonstrated  even at the fi rst dose level.

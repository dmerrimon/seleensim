 CIP2023120529 - Rheo Knee 4 – Clinical Investigation Protocol- Revision 1.00 
© 2023 Iceland TMP0021 – Revision 8.[ADDRESS_237597] will be asked to provide feedback on the current 
prosthesis, by [CONTACT_199293] a set of questionnaires (including subset of PEQ) and perform 
tasks of daily living like e.g., walking up/down ramps and stairs, level ground walking in different speeds and walking on uneven terrain.  
The users will be fitted within the standard methods of prosthetic fitting and 
alignment will be documented. 
After initial fitting of the investigational device, the s ubjects will receive standard 
training on the investigational device. The required training steps and exercises as 
well as the performance of the subject will be observed. Comments and initial feedback from the subject will be documented. When the training is completed, and 
subjects feel comfortable an d safe they will take a shor t break. Afterwards they will 
be asked to perform the same tasks as with their prescribed prosthesis before. 
A standardized set of questions regarding the performance of the investigational 
device and the subject´s satisfaction will be asked as a semi-structured interview, 
and the responses are documented. After the first feedback round with the 
investigational device, different modes for descent acitivities may be tested.  The investigator may change the modes and settings. The changes might be subtle; 
subjects will be asked if they feel a differ ence. Eventually the subj ects shall evaluate 
if they prefer a mode. 
The activities are video recorded to visually compare the performance of the two 
devices. 
If the user feels comfortable and safe, he will be asked to use the investigational 
device for [ADDRESS_237598] the user after 2 weeks to check on any issues that may arise. 
The user has the option  to stop the trial at any time , an appointment will be made to 
switch to the prescribed knee. 
The second visit will be at 4 weeks after vi sit 1. During this visit subjects will 
complete the same functional tests and questionnaires as at visit 1 (excluding 
background information) on the investigatio nal device. They will then be fitted back 
to their prescribed device. 
See Table 1 below. 
Objective In this trial, the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the investigational 
device compared to the former Version Rheo Knee (XC) and in addition (mandatory) to other passive MPKs (e.g. C-leg 4, Genium, X3, Plié 3, Orion 3, Quattro, Allux) regarding performance improvements and satisfaction in descending activities for 
moderate to high active prosthesis users within the intended population for the investigational device. 
Additionally,  the overall satisfaction for acti vities of daily living will be evaluated after 
a certain time of use (4 weeks home use).

5 Investigational Device 
The investigational device is a pre-market device and will be labeled according to regulations concerning pre-
marketed investigational devices. 
See Table 2 for details on the investigational device. 
Table 2 Identification a nd Description of the Investigational Device  
Summary description of 
the investigational 
device and its intended purpose: The investigational device, Rheo Knee [ADDRESS_237600] and is a further development of a well-established technology.  
The device is classified as an “External assembled lower limb prosthesis” according 
to Title 21 §890.3500, bearing the product code ISW (Assembly, 
Knee/Shank/Ankle/Foot, External) 
 
It is 510(k) exempt, except for general requirements. 
 It is composed of a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee, a power supply and a 
configuration software. Sensors within the prosthetic knee prosthesis provide 
continuous real-time in formation. This data is utilized to control the braking torque of 
the joint via activating a magnetorheological actuator. Via the configuration software, 
running on an external computing device, a wireless link to the prosthetic knee 
prosthesis can be established. Through this the investigational device can be optimized with respect to the end users’ gait, physical characteristics and personal

6 Justification for the Design of the Clinical Investigation  
The term microprocessor-controlled (MPC) refers to components that are intelligently regulated in real time by 
[CONTACT_199299].[ADDRESS_237604] or moisture, and its 
increased requirement for maintenance and repair.15  
Microprocessor Controlled Knees (MPK) have become the standard of care for trans-femoral amputees of 
medium to high activity levels (K3-K4). While the func tional principles of the different knee joints remain the 
same, differences in the mechanical design can be found.  
The investigational device is a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee and employs sensory information, to 
automatically adapt knee dampi[INVESTIGATOR_199272]’s gait requirements, accounting for variations in 
forward walking speed, walking terrain, user gait styles and body size. The investigational device technology generates resistances with a microprocessor-controlled,  magnetorheological fluid, which enables continuous 
variation of knee joint resistances in both movement directions. The amount of current determines the viscosity of the fluid. Therefore, an adaptable friction moment is generated for both flexion and extension movements at 
the same time. In this study there are two types of comparator devices, hydraulic MPKs and previous version of the investigational device.   
Hydraulic MPKs consist of an integrated microprocessor-controlled linear hydraulic system in combination with a 
control algorithm. They generate knee joint resistances hydraulically with microprocessor-controlled, motorized 
valves. This enables continuous variations in the hydraulic resistance to be set for both movement directions. 
The magnetorheological fluid creates shear forces in comparison to an increase of pressure in a hydraulic system. The increased system pressure can lead to higher temperatures and risk of leakage.  
 
The previous version of the investigational device (RK III/RK XC) features the same intended use, same clinical 
purpose, same user population, same placement below the socket, uses a battery powered system and is 
controlled through a software application that can be user configured through a separate computer interface/mobile device. The investigational device is an enhancement of the previous version, functional 
features and indication are equivalent to previous version and the same critical functions apply. Features that 
have been added include a mechanical stance locking feature that allows the user to manually lock the knee in 3 
different positions in stance and the device will be waterproof. The investigational device also includes functions 
that were only included in the Rheo Knee XC configuration of the previous version; automatic cycling and running detection and a stair ascent mode.  
Results of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199273] 25 subjects indicate that the investigational 
device had similar or better performance compared to previous versions of the Rheo knee regarding satisfaction 
on descending activities. This investigation is designed  primarily to confirm these indications and that the 
performance of the investigational device regarding descending activities is comparable/no worse than Rheo 
Knee or hydraulic MPKs.   
 
 
 CIP2023120529 - Rheo Knee 4 – Clinical Investigation Protocol- Revision 1.00 
© 2023 Iceland TMP0021 – Revision 8.[ADDRESS_237605] acts as its own control. This is 
important for studying amputees as the group is a small proportion of the total population, and with specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria the total eligible population becomes very small, making it difficult to find and recruit 
subjects to attain an acceptable level of power. This limited population pool often results in a slightly heterogeneous sample, as the amputees available are few and far between, in every sense. Furthermore, no 
single amputation procedure and therefore amputated stump is exactly the same, making the experience of each 
amputee unique. The within-subject design significantl y reduces the individual differences when comparing the 
two conditions. 

 CIP2023120529 - Rheo Knee 4 – Clinical Investigation Protocol- Revision 1.00 
© 2023 Iceland TMP0021 – Revision 8.[ADDRESS_237606] will be a non-randomized single group repeated measures open label prospective design with 
observational and self-report measures. 
Amputees are a small proportion of the general p opulation. The population group specified in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria is a further subsample of amputees. For practical reasons, i.e. to achieve statistical 
power, it is therefore more feasible to use within-subject comparison rather than creating study arms to compare. 
Furthermore, as mobile amputees generally have and use a prosthetic device for their daily activities, within-comparison is feasible comparing to the subject’s previous device. 
All investigational activities will be conducted at the Össur Orlando site.  
As stated above the primary endpoint is Satisfaction on descending stairs, see Table 5, and the secondary 
endpoints are satisfaction on descending ramps, balance confidence and standing comfort in that respective order of significance. In addition, there are two exploratory endpoints on mobility and balanc e during ambulation. 
See previous chapter on objectives and hypothesis and Table 5 for rationale. 
Drop-outs and withdrawals will not be replaced. 
Instruments for data collection will include the following:  
The Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) measures pros thetic-related quality of life. It consists of 82 items 
grouped into nine subscales. In addition, there are indi vidual questions not contained in the subscales regarding 
satisfaction, pain, transfers, prosthetic care, self-efficacy, and importance18. This study will include a set of 
subscales from the PEQ, including specific questions on descending activities. 
TUG The Timed Up and Go (TUG) is a to ol used to test basic mobility skil ls by [CONTACT_199300] a chair (which should not be leaned up against a wall), walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back 
to the chair and sit down 
2MWT is a measurement of endurance that assesses walking distance over two minutes. 
ABC is a Patient-reported outcome measur e that asks individuals to rate how confident they  are that they will not 
lose their balance while performing 16 different activities. 
PLUS-M (Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility) is a self-r eport instrument for measur ing mobility of adults 
with lower limb amputation. 
Specific questionnaire: In-house generated questionnaire on specific features in the investigational device. 
Log file: User should log device use and events.

The equipment used does not require specific monitoring, maintenance, or calibration procedures.  
8.2 Investigational Devi ce(s) and Comparator(s) 
The subjects will be asked to use the investigat ional device as their primary prosthesis for 4 weeks. Individual 
exposure will differ  between subjects. Subjects are expected to use it  for their daily living activities as they would 
with any other prosthesis, for up to 18 hours a day depending on the amputee. The comparator device will not be 
used within the timeframe of the investigation. Subjects will evaluate and provide feedback on their exposure of 
the comparator prior to them being fitted to the investigational device. 
The comparator device  will be the former version Rheo Knee (XC) or any other passive microprocessor 
controlled prosthetic knee  (excluding Kenevo as it does not have the same intended patient population as the 
investigational device). They have the same intended use as the investigational device. Furthermore, they are 
indicated for the same condition and population group. Passive MPKs are widely accepted devices, providing 
clinical benefits to the user.  
Where possible, the subject will be using the remaining part of their cu rrent prosthetic system with the 
investigational device, as it was used with the comparator device. In some cases where a subject is using 
components from other manufacturers (e.g. feet not validated for use with the investigational device) compatible 
components will be provided.  
No other device, medication or intervention will be used. 
 
Up to 13 subjects are to be enrolled and therefore 13 investigational devices will be used, as the devices are 
intended to be used by a single patient; one for each subject. 
  
8.3 Subjects  
All subjects will be dispositioned as follows: 
 Screen Failure: Subject did not pass screening procedures, not called in for clinical visit; 
 Candidate for enrollment: Passed screening procedures, accepts to come in for clinical visit; 
 Enrolled: Subject signs informed consent and takes part in the first experimental session; 
 Fitted: Subject leaves the clinic on the investigational device; 
 Drop-out: Enrolled subject whose participation ended because they did not want to continue 
participation. 
 Discontinued: Candidate for enrollment or Enrolled subject whose participation ended because they 
withdrew consent, were withdrawn by [CONTACT_737], were lost to follow up, or died.

8.4 Procedures  
i) Recruitment  
Potential subjects will be identified from the selected customer base of Össur. Customer representative 
evaluates, based on previous experience of interaction with and servicing of patients, if a potential participant is 
cognitively capable. The customer representative informs the PI / LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199275]. If a potentia l participant fits the inclusion and exclusion criteria the LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199276]. During the telephone call the LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199277] a study. If 
interest is expressed at that  point they will answer some screening questions and  if the eligibility  criteria are met 
an appointment will be ma de for the clinical visit and si gning of the ICF. Questions re lating to the duration of the 
study, number of clinical visits required, and the investigational device will be answered. 
Potential risk of participati ng in the investigation will be explained to the subject at th is point to the candidate for 
enrolment. 
The LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199278]. 
ii) Test procedure  
There are two scheduled study ev ents. Up to [ADDRESS_237610] will be asked to provide feedback on the current prosthesis, by [CONTACT_199293] a set of 
questionnaires (including subset of PEQ) and perform tasks of daily living like e.g., walking up/down ramps and 
stairs, level ground walking in different speeds and walking on uneven terrain.  
The users will be fitted within th e standard methods of  prosthetic fitting and al ignment will be documented. 
After initial fitting of the investigational device, the subjects will receive standard training on the investigational 
device. The required training steps and exercises as well as the performance of the subject will be observed. 
Comments and init ial feedback from the subject will be docu mented. When the traini ng is comple ted, and 
subjects feel comfortable and safe they will take a short break. Afterwards they will be asked to perform the 
same tasks as with their prescribed prosthesis before. 
A standardized set of questions regarding the performance of the investigational device and the subject´s 
satisfaction will be asked as a semi-structured interview, and the responses are documented.  
The activities are video recorded to visually compare the performance of the two devices. If the user feels comfortable an d safe, he will be asked to use the investigational device  for [ADDRESS_237611] the user after 2 we eks to check on any issues that may arise. The user has the option to 
stop the trial at any time, an appointment will be made to switch to the prescribed knee. 
The second visit will be at 4 weeks after visit 1. During this visit subjec ts will complete the sa me functional tests 
and questionnaires as at visit 1 (excluding background info rmation) on the investigational device. They will then 
be fitted back to their pr escribed device and feedback will be collected. 
 
iii) Measurements  and data collection  
The same questionnaires, consisting of one valid instrument (subset of PEQ questions) and device and 
performance specific question naires, will be used and filled in at tw o separate points in time. Background 
information will be collected at  baseline only. An ac tivity report will be generated from the in vestigational device 
at visit 2.

10 Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Statistical desi gn and procedures 
The primary hypothesis will be assessed with descriptive statistics only, comparing the rates prior-evaluation 
(current device) and post-evaluation (investigational device). For hypotheses B, C, D, E will be assessed with mixed models effects where MPK type is used as fixed effect, subgroup analysis, and subject as random effect. 
F will be assessed with exploratory methods. All data will be analyzed exploratively for subgroup effects for input into further studies but not used to support claims.  
 Acceptance criteria for the data, as applicable, is defined in Table [ADDRESS_237612] methods and 
hypotheses . Subgroup analysis will not be performed as no subgroups are defined. 
10.2 Sample size calculation 
A convenience sample of up to 13 subjects are expected to complete the procedures. 
For pass/fail criteria, see Table [ADDRESS_237613] methods and hypotheses . 
11 Amendments and Deviations from the Protocol (CIP) 
11.[ADDRESS_237614] approved by [CONTACT_199302], or LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199284], and 
then be evaluated by [CONTACT_1201]/REB/REC and, where appropriate regulatory authorities, before being 
implemented. 
For non-substantial changes (e.g. minor logistical or administrative changes, change of monitor(s), telephone 
numbers, renewal of insurance) not affecting the rights, safety and well-being of human subjects or not related to 
the clinical investigation objectives or endpoints, a simple notification to the IRB/REB/REC and, where 
appropriate, regulatory authorities can be sufficient. 
11.2 Deviations 
Investigators are not allowed to deviate from this protoc ol without a formal approval from the IRB/REB/REC, if 
the deviation affects subject's rights, safety and wellbeing, or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Any such deviation from the protocol is to be documented in detail and the report sent to the IRB/REB/REC.  
Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, safety and well-being of 
human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the IRB/REB/REC. Such deviations shall 
be documented and reported to the sponsor and the IRB/REB/REC as soon as possible. 
Investigators can request for an approval from the sponsor for a deviation if the deviation does not affect 
subject's rights, safety and wellbeing, or the scien tific integrity of the clinical investigation. 
In case of a deviation from this protocol taking place without prior approval from the sponsor, and IRB/REB/REC as applicable, it shall be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199285]. The LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199286] a report to the sponsor no later than five days after the deviation was 
reported. The report shall include: 
 Reason for deviation 
 When deviation took place 
 Circumstances of the event 
 Identification of all subjects affected by [CONTACT_89629], if any 
o Details how each subject is affected, e.g. rights, safety or wellbeing 
 Details how this deviation might affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation

- Memory failure (user forgets clinicians’ training/advice). 
- Nascent Error (user performs well meant "optimization", short-cut or improvisation to unusual 
circumstances). 
- User performs activity which subjects  the investigational device to undue mechanical stress (jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_58448] 
a wall for example). 
- Droppi[INVESTIGATOR_199287] (when removing their prosthesis amputees often lean their 
prosthesis up against a wall which frequently resulting in th e limb falling to the ground). 
- User does not charge the prosthetic knee. - User does not have good control over the residual limb. 
 
For a list of foreseeable adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects, together with their likely 
incidence, mitigation or treatment see Chapter 7, and applicable annexes, in the Clinical Investigator´s Brochure 
[2]. 
13.3 Risk of Study (To Patient) 
At each visit a LPI, a certified  CPO/CP  or clinician , will be present to ensure the safety of the participants. The 
study adds no additional risk other than the risks identified above. Subjects will use the trial device as their 
primary prosthesis in the same manner as they would normally do on their current prosthesis. Thus, they are not 
required to do anything different from their routine clinical visit for acquiring a new MPK (the investigational 
device) and their daily living activities between study visits. 
13.4 Risk Mitigation 
For each device designed by Össur risk mitigation is part of the design process according to ISO [ZIP_CODE] [5] [4]. 
Furthermore, each participant fitted with the investigational device (Navii/Rheo Knee 4) for the first time , will 
be trained by a fully qualified professional until the user can demonstrate sufficient understanding of the product 
operation and demonstrate mini mum ability level in its operat ion. This process is the sa me as the usual training 
process deployed for normal fitting of a MPK device.  
As part of the training process, the participant will be informed on the risks inherent in using an investigational 
MPK device in an uncontrolled environment. Moreover, the participant will be provided with the product literature (e.g. Information for User), as well as being informed and trained on how to use the product. 
13.5 Risk-to-Benefit Rationale 
The residual risks of the investigation and the investigational device are minimal and are significantly out 
weighted by [CONTACT_199303]. 
13.6 IRB/REB/REC Review and Communications 
The study protocol (CIP), informed consent form, and other study documentation forms require IRB review and approval. Communication to and from the IRB shall be directed from or to the primary Össur contact, the Sponsor co-inves tigator/Monitor . Continuous communication will be maintained between Össur and the IRB, 
as required. Moreover, communication will be maintained between the LPIs and PI  [INVESTIGATOR_72616], as required. 
13.7 Vulnerable populations 
No vulnerable populations will be enrolled.  
13.8 Informed Consent 
The Local Principal Investigator (LPI) at each site, or any researcher qualified, will obtain from the subject, written signed informed consent form to his/her inclusion in the study, after explaining the rationale for and the 
 CIP2023120529 - Rheo Knee 4 – Clinical Investigation Protocol- Revision 1.00 
© 2023 Iceland TMP0021 – Revision 8.[ADDRESS_237615]'s involvement. 
The subject will receive a copy of the informed consent.  
The protocol consists of diff erent phases, subjects will consent only for the phase they part icipate in. Signing the 
ICF only applies to the current phase, for each phase the ICF will be signed again by [CONTACT_6992]. If a subject 
participates in one phase it does not mean they have to participate in the other phases. Enrollment for each phase is separate. 
The subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw from participation at 
any time, at his/her discretion and this will not have any consequences for the participant’s treatment. 
In case the information on the ICF changes, and subjects need to be provided with new information, the LPI [INVESTIGATOR_199288]. If the study must be postponed until 
IRB approval of the amendment is obtained this w ill be explained to the patient. 
Subjects that for any reason are un able to provide informed consent will not be enrolled in the study. 
13.9 Participant confidenti ality – Data management 
a)  Subjects will be assigned a study identification (ID) number. Th is ID will be used in all relevant 
documentation. Confidentiality of all relevant subject fe edback and information will be maintained through use of 
the identifying number only, in all documentation. The study sponsor, Össur, will remain the sole owner of the 
study data.  
Data will be collected and stored eit her through the Electronic  Data Capture (EDS) syst em Smart-Trial, or via 
paper based CRFs.  
A list connecting the ID to the subject ́s name [CONTACT_199317] (EDS) system 
Smart-Trial or in a locked file with the LPI [INVESTIGATOR_12758]. Only appropriately qualified individuals designated by [CONTACT_199304]. Access is controlled by [CONTACT_199305]. Accounts 
are enabled with designated permissions only. 
b)  Physical source da ta (e.g. signed Informed Cons ent forms and paper based forms as applicable) will reside in 
the Local Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_199289]. This will be physically locked and accessible to  the Investigator only. 
c)  Case report forms in Smart-Trial are developed in accordance with this protocol and are quality checked 
against the protocol by [CONTACT_199306], the same is true in case of paper-based CRFs. In Smart-Trial, 
validated fields and reference rules are used to control quality of data on entry and where required the order of 
data collection. In case of paper based CRFs they are reviewed by [CONTACT_1755] a study monitor to 
ensure completeness of data.  
Data that are missing or collected out of timeframe will be flagged. Smart-Trial contai ns audit history and data 
query functionality, in case of paper based CRFs, data queries are raised by [CONTACT_199307]. 
Data queries may be raised ad hoc or at scheduled monitoring visits. Data queries may be reconciled by 
[CONTACT_199308] (by [CONTACT_199309]-Trial) only. Wher e physical records are used these will 
be stored as source data in the investigator site file and attached to Smart Trial forms as scans if applicable. 
d)  The Smart-Trial system is va lidated as per the Össur QMS Soft ware Validation process PR-[ZIP_CODE] [7] 
reported in VAL1825 [8]. The validation of the software system consists of review of Smart Trial company 
validation records. The validation of individual case repo rt forms against the study protocol is performed by [CONTACT_199310]. 
e)  In case of electronic data collection; SMART-TRIAL (www.smart-trial.com) will be used as the primary 
Electronic Data Capture tool in this study. SMART-TRIAL is designed and developed in compliance with the 
PIC/S Guidance, PI-011-3 Good Practices for Computer ized Systems in Regulated “GxP” Environments, with 
software validation based on IEC [ZIP_CODE]. SMART-TRIAL is designed to enable the user to comply with Good 
Clinical Practice (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020), ICH GCP and other industry requirements, such as FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and 
HIPAA. f) All data in SMART-TRIAL is collected, trans ferred, and stored encrypted in databases, which are 
hosted on Microsoft Azure ISO certified servers that are managed by [CONTACT_69586]-TRIAL within the European Union 
(Dublin, Ireland). Backups are performed continuously throughout the day and stored within the same server. 
Given that Smart-Trial does send messaging to patients in research studies, as part of the informed consent 
process, (as reviewed  by  [CONTACT_36985]),  patients  will  be  as ked  to  c onsent  to  communications through these 
channels. Smart-Trial is adherent to CAN-SPAM and international equivalents.

g)   Photographs and frames in video recordings w ill only contain as far as poss ible the lower extremities of 
subjects and any ambulatory assistance provided with their hands only.  Frames containing the face or other 
identifiable features of subjects  will  be  blurred, cropped  or  deleted  if  accidentally  captured.  The data of 
subjects that are withdrawn  from  participation  will  be   retained.  Subjects may request that  their  research  
data  is  delinked  from  their  personally  identifiable data during the course of the study.   
h) In case of EDS, database entry is locked after final patient data is entered. Database is closed and de-
identified data exported by [CONTACT_199311]-investigator/Monitor on completion of close-out monitoring activities 
including resolution of all data queries. Smart Trial audit history is extracted for records of monitoring activities. 
Exported de-identified data is stored on password protected PC intranet for analysis. In case of paper based data 
collection, de-identified data is scanned and shared with the sponsor Co-investigator/Monitor after data collection 
is complete. 
Representatives of the sponsor, sponsor co-investigators and mo nitors, will be present at the study sites. A 
declaration of confidentiality to be signed by [CONTACT_199312], ensures necessary data protection. Sponsor 
representatives will only observe and not interact with subject during the investigational procedures. 
i) The data retention period for unlinked clinical data will be a minimum of 5 years in accordance with ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2020. Clinical investigation documents, including but not limited to CIP, CIB, CRFs and clinical 
investigation report(s) should be incorporated into the device technical documentation under the quality 
management system of the manufacturer. 
k)  A Clinical Investigation Report (C IR) will be generated by Ö ssur Medical Office. The report will be stored with 
the device technical file within Össur Quality Management System, along with the unlinked data and all 
accompanying investigational documents, according to the R&D and Quality documentation procedures. 
Subjects participating in the study can have access to the results, on demand, when the CIR is internally 
published.  
Study results, data, and documentation will be stored for a minimum of 5 years.

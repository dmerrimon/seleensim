1.1. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy – Epi[INVESTIGATOR_180107]/Biochemical Basis  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disorder of progressive weakness leading to  severe 
disability and ultimately death  caused by a deficiency of the dystrophin protein . DMD is the most 
common form of muscular dystrophy, affecting 1 in every 3,500 -6,000 live male births  (1). The 
symptoms of DMD are often fi rst noted at about [ADDRESS_211937] year of life. Proximal leg weakness impairs mobility and 
precludes  the ability to run or to rise from a squatting position. Complete loss of ambulati on 
follows, with a progressive decline of upper extremity strength and function. D eclines in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_180109], ultimately culminating 
in early lethality  (1, 2).  The impact of this debilitating condition on those affected by [CONTACT_180157].  
The biochemical basis of DMD is the absence of a functional dystrophin  protein  that is essential 
for healthy muscle function and muscle fiber integrity.   In normal striated muscle , the cytoplasmic 
dystrophin protein links intracellular actin  with the extracellular matrix to provide structural 
stability of the muscle cell membrane.  In the majority of patients with DMD, dystrophin protein 
is not produced bec ause of out -of-frame mutations characterized by  a deletion of one or more 
exons from the dystrophin gene , which is located on the short arm of the X chromosome .  
Dystrophin mutations in which some dystrophin protein function remains are associated with a 
similar , but often milder phenotype , classified as Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). DMD and 
BMD exhibit  X-linked recessive inheritance.  
1.2. Current Natural History, Disease Management and Treatment Recommendations  
The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Res earch Group  (CINRG)  (3) is co nducting the 
largest prospective multicenter natural history study to date in DMD, the CINRG Duchenne 
Natural History Study (DNHS)  (4, 5).  The st udy includes >400 boys and men with DMD, followed 
for up to a decade at present.  The study has annual follow -up visits.   These visits include timed 
function tests, muscle strength, questionnaire functional assessments, pulmonary function tests and 
quality  of life assessments.  The DNHS database may be used as a reference dataset for the analysis 
of the cases in this study and Study NS-065/NCNP -01-201.

through all stages of the disease.  To date, treatments focus on  optimizing strength and function 
through the use of pharmacological interventions, physical therapy and assistive and adaptive 
devices.  
1.2.1.  Glucocorticoid Treatment  
At present, treatment with glucocorticoid (GC) medication is the only pharmacological 
intervention that has been shown  to slow the decline of strength and function in DMD patients. 
The two main GCs used in DMD are prednisone and deflazacort  (EMFLAZA ™). Dai ly oral 
administration of prednisone or deflazacort stabilizes or improves strength and prolongs 
ambulation  (6-11). The mechanism by [CONTACT_180158], including anti -inflammatory actions.  The immunosuppr essive effects of GCs may 
not be beneficial, and other immunosuppressants have not shown benefit  (8). 
In 2005, the American Aca demy of Neurology issued a practice parameter regarding GC treatment 
in DMD and recommended that GC should be offered as treatment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_180110]  
(12).  The significant side effects of GCs include cushingoid f eatures, adverse behavio ral changes, 
obesity, growth retardation, increased risk for bone fractures, gastritis, delayed puberty, cataracts, 
hypertension, glucose intolerance, susceptibility to infection, and masking of response to stress 
(13). On February 9, 2017,  the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved 
EMFLAZA ™ to treat patients 5 years  of age  and older with DMD.   
1.2.2.  Dystrophin restoring interventions  
New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_180111] .  Small molecules that can read 
through nonsense mutations could potentially treat approximately 10% of DMD patients  (14).  
Exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which uses antisense oligonucleotides to alter the splicing pattern of the genes is 
designed to bring out -of-frame deletions into frame.  The technology of exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180112] a specific sequence in the messenger ribonucleic acid 
(mRNA) to alter splicing of exons.  By [CONTACT_77203], specific exons c an be excluded from the final 
transcript that is exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus; hence the term ‘exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ .  By 
[CONTACT_180159], the out -of-frame deletion can be enlarged to include the adjacent 
exon such that the resulti ng deletion is in -frame (15-17).

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 17 of 112 This new type of treatment could potentially treat more than 85%  of DMD patients who have large -
scale deletion or duplication mutations in the dystrophin gene  (15-17).  The ful l characterization 
of DMD patient mutations and further development of the technology  will be crucial to fully 
realize these novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_180113].  
To date, [ADDRESS_211939] been brought to the stage of human clinical trial : 2’O-
methyl phosphorothioate (2’O -Me) antisense oligonucleotides (18, 19) and phosphorodiamidate 
morpholino oligomers (PMO) for skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 51 in the dystrophin gene  (20-22). 
A 48 -week study of the 2’O -Me compound drisapersen did not reach significance in the six -minute 
walk test (6MWT), which was its primary outcome measure for a Phase II  study (18). The PMO 
compound eteplirsen was tested in a 48 -week study with the number of muscle fibers with restored 
dystrophin as its primary outcome measure  (20). Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®) was approved  by [CONTACT_180160] 19, 2016 . 
1.3. Background on NS-065/NCNP -01 
NS-065/NCNP -01 is a novel antisense oligonucleotide for the treatment of DMD, which has been 
discovered jointly by [CONTACT_180161] (NCNP) , which is a National 
Research and Development Agency in Japan , and Nippon Shinyaku Co., Lt d.  Details of data 
summarized in the following sections can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  
NS-065/NCNP -[ADDRESS_211940] with the dystrophin gene ribonucleic acid (RNA), and 
alter the exon/intron splicing patterns.  The mechanism of action is for NS -065/NCNP -01 to bind 
to a specific sequence in or near exon 53 of the dystrophin pre -RNA transcript, and block the 
exon/intron splicing of exon 53, leading to mature mRNA transcripts that lack exon 53.  NS-
065/NCNP -01 is thou ght to be effective on DMD patients with exon deletions amenable to 
skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 53 such as 43 -52, 45 -52, 47 -52, 48 -52, 49 -52, 50 -52, or 52.  The loss of exon 53 
restores the mRNA reading frame, thus converting a DMD (out -of-frame) deletion mutation to  a 
Becker -like (in -frame) deletion mutation.   In-frame deletion mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_180115] a shortened dystrophin protein, although the resulting Becker -like dystrophin 
protein will be smaller in molecular weight compared to the normal dystrophin protein, and likely

CX3CL1) in hum ans.  
NS-065/NCNP -01 did not display any adverse effects in in vitro  and in vivo  cardiovascular, in vivo  
CNS, or in vivo  respi[INVESTIGATOR_9012].  
1.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic  (PK) and toxicokinetic  (TK) analyses revealed no apparent species differences 
for NS -065/NCNP -01.  None of the in vitro  or in vivo  metabolism studies showed any distinct 
evidence of metabolism of NS -065/NCNP -01.  After IV administration, T max occurred at the first 
sampling time afte r the injection or at the end of the infusion for mice, rats, and monkeys. C max 
and AUC increased with dose, and most increases were approximately proportional to dose, with 
some increases being greater than dose proportional.  For rats, the mean values fo r t1/2 were 1.19, 
1.19, and 10.5 hours for 6, 20, and 60  mg/kg.  For monkeys, the mean values for t 1/2 ranged from 
1.7 to 3.5 hours.  For mice and monkeys, exposure did not change with 12 or 13 weeks of repeat 
dosing.  
Results for IM administration of NS -065/NCNP -01 to monkeys compared to IV administration 
indicate complete bioavailability, a longer time to T max, a similar half -life for elimination, and no 
increase in exposure with repeat dosing.  
The fraction of NS -065/NCNP -01 bound to rat, monkey, and huma n serum proteins was low, 
≤40%, for all species and was independent of concentration.  The distribution of NS -065/NCNP -
01 into red blood cells was ≤2.5%, ≤6.7%, and ≤3.5% for rat, monkey, and human, respectively, 
indicating low distribution of NS -065/NCNP -01 to red blood cells.  Quantitative wh ole-body 
autoradiography ( QWBA ) studies showed wide tissue distribution of [14C]NS -065/NCNP -[ADDRESS_211943] concentrations observed in the kidney, and general 
distribution to muscle tissu es.  For both rats and monkeys, renal excretion was the major route of

Most of the radioactivity was excreted within the first 24 hours.  However, small measurable 
amounts continued to be excreted in the urine and feces throughout the seven -day collection 
periods.  
The degree of inhibition of CYP1A2 by [INVESTIGATOR_149107] -065/NCNP -01 was low and the type of inhibition 
could not be determined.  The inhibition was less than 30% for the other tested CYP isozymes: 
2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. NS -065/NCNP -01 was not an i nducer of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5.  
1.3.4.  Toxicology  
Repeated administration of NS -065/NCNP -01 via the clinically relevant route of administration 
(weekly IV injections) in both mice and monkeys resulted in decreases in red blood cell 
parameters, increased values for cytokines and histopathological effects in the kidney, testes and/or 
urinary bladder.   The kidney is the primary target organ in both mice and monkeys, as shown by 
[CONTACT_180162] e ffects (1000 mg/kg/dose in 
13- and 26 -week mouse studies or 600 mg/kg/dose in a 12 -week monkey study) and by 
[CONTACT_180163] (≥240 mg/kg/dose in 13 - and 26 -week mouse 
studies, ≥200 mg/kg/dose in a 12 -week monkey study  or 360 mg/kg/dose in a 39 -week monkey 
study) occasionally accompanied by [CONTACT_180164].   This observation is 
consistent with the PK data that show high tissue distribution to the kidney and excretion via the 
urine.  An additional his topathological finding in a 26 -week mouse study was the presence of 
cytoplasmic eosinophilic material in the transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_180117] 60 
mg/kg/dose and above.  At high dose (1000 mg/kg/dose in 13 - and 26 -week mouse studies or 600 
mg/kg/dose in a 12 -week monkey study), reductions in red blood cell parameters were also seen.  
Higher doses in mice (≥240 mg/kg/dose in a 13 -week mouse study or 1000 mg/kg/dose in a 26 -
week mouse study) showed increased values for interleukin -6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor -alpha 
(TNF -α) and/or monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1) and alterations in complement; 
these findings were considered to be due to irritation of the injection site.  Data from [ADDRESS_211944] reversal of these effects in both species.

studies or in the 39 -week monkey study.  Anti -NS-065/NCNP -01 antibodies were detected in one 
monkey at 200mg/kg in the 12-week monkey study.  However, antibody detection was not 
considered to affect the toxicological evaluation in this study, since skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180118] i n exposure to NS -065/NCNP -01 was observed after repeated dosing.  Based on these 
data, the NOAELs were concluded to be 60 and 15 mg/kg/dose in 13 -week and 26 -week mouse

mice v ia intravenous route with a bolus injection. After the terminal necropsy, macroscopic 
examinations showed a mass and/or thickening in one side of the ureter in one mouse at 50 mg/kg, 
in two mice at 150 mg/kg, and no findings at 500 mg/kg dose group. In sub sequent 
histopathological examinations on these three mice, transitional cell carcinoma was noted. 
Histopathological examination of the ureters for the other mice was conducted and no further 
tumorigenic changes were identified. Additionally, no treatment -related tumors were noted in any 
other organs.  The blood concentration of NS-065/NCNP -01 in mice who received 50 mg/kg/wk 
was lower than the blood concentration of NS-065/NCNP -01 expected in human patients who will 
receive 80mg/kg/wk.

Among the mild and moderate AEs, an increase in urine beta-N-acetyl -D-glucosaminidase  (Grade

Initially, testing appeared to reveal p roteinuria in 8 of 10 patients.  However, it was subsequently 
determined tha t there was a cross reaction between NS -065/NCNP -01 and the pyrogallol red dye -
binding method which was used for  urinary protein measurement resulting in a false positive result 
for protein in the 24 -hour pooled urine samples.  To evaluate the 24 -hour pool ed urine samples for 
protein , Coomassie brilliant blue method was used to re -measure urinary protein in the frozen urine 
samples and none of the retested samples showed urinary protein levels exceeding the normal 
range of the institution (i.e., 31.2 to 120  mg/day).   Current  studies utilize a urine protein

NS-065/NCNP -01 exhibited no cross reactivity with the Benzethonium Chloride Method up to 
500 mg/dL.   
The 24 -hour po oled urine samples did not show increased levels of albumin.  Spot measurements 
of urinary albumin w ere positive in 7 patients  (Grade 1) .  
 Interleukin levels were increased  (Grade 1) in the serum  in 6 out of 10 patients  (high IL-[ADDRESS_211946] ), and some level of anemia 
(Grade 1) was observed in 7 out of 10 patients.   
Increased levels of brain natriuretic peptide  (BNP) in serum  (Grade 1)  were present in four patients .

accommodate patient recovery following the scheduled biopsy during Week 25  of Study NS -
065/NCNP -01-201, patients will be allowed a visit window of 7 days ( ±3 days) from the Week [ADDRESS_211949] infusion in the extension study.  
All W eek 25 study assessments, including muscle biopsy, of the NS -065/NCNP -01-[ADDRESS_211950] 
infusion of this extension study on the same day as the W eek 25 study visit of the NS -065/NCNP -
01-201 study, provided  all study assessments (including muscle biopsy) of the NS -065/NCNP -01-
201 study are completed prior to infusion .  
Dose selection for Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 was based on exposure data in humans compared 
to mice and monkeys over  a comparable 12 -week treatment period.  Based on the t 1/2 values, the 
kinetics for monkeys are closer to human kinetics than the kinetics for mice.  The AUC values for 
monkeys are higher than those for mice at similar doses.  In the 12 -week mouse study, the AUC 0-
24 values were 83.5, 421, and 12,300 µg•hr/mL for 60, 240, and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively.  In the 
12-week monkey  study , the mean AU C0-24 values were 270, 963, and 5,581 µg•hr/mL for 60, 200, 
and 600 mg/kg, respectively.  Hepatic and nuclease metabolism of NS -065/NCNP -01 was similar 
for monkey and human sources.  Overall, there was no apparent degradation or metabolism of NS -
065/NCNP -01 in the presence of hepatic microsomes, deoxyribonuclease I or phosphodiesterase 
I.  Because monkeys are larger animals than mice, and because the half -life and metabolism is 
similar for humans and monkeys, the results of the monkey studies were chosen fo r the estimation 
of AUC values for human subjects.  
Figure 1 shows the mean AUC 0-t values from the human clinical study and the mean AUC 0-24 
values from the single dose and 12 -week monkey studies.  The mean AUC values from both the 
monkey and human wer e approximately linear up to 200 mg/kg.  At 200 mg/kg/day in Study 
TX1076, there were very slight effects on the kidneys of one of three male monkeys.  The effects 
were more pronounced at 600 mg/kg/day, affecting three of three animals.  There was little o r no 
difference between Day 1 and Week 12 for either the humans or monkeys.  The single -dose 
monkey study used doses that overlapped the doses used in the 12 -week studies of humans and 
monkeys.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 112 The individual AUC values for doses up to 200 mg/kg were subje cted to regression analysis fitting 
the equation y = mx.  The intercept was set to 0 since vehicle -treated animals had no measurable 
concentrations of NS -065/NCNP -01.  The results for both Day [ADDRESS_211951] 
and 12th dose.  Using the results for monkeys only, the coefficient of determination, r2, was 0.9622, 
indicating a good fit to a line defined by [CONTACT_12265] = 4,756 x Dose.  The regression anal ysis was 
repeated using both the human and monkey results.  The resulting equation was AUC = 4,760 x 
Dose with r2 = 0.9608.  The addition of the human results changed the slope by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 0.1%, and the 
fit remained good.  The results are shown in Figure 2, and Figure 3 is an expansion showing the 
results between 0 and 80 mg/kg.  At a  dose of 60 mg/kg given to human subjects, the expected 
average AUC 0-t after either the first or multiple doses would be expected to be approximately 
286,000 ng•hr/mL.  
In the 12-week  toxicity study using monkeys, the NOAEL dose was 60 mg/kg/dose, and very slight 
effects were seen at the 3.3 -fold higher dose, 200 mg/kg/dose.  A dose of 80 mg/kg is only 1.3 -
fold higher than a 60 mg/kg and less than ½ the 200 mg/kg dose where slight adverse effects were 
observed.  It is possible that a human dose of 80 mg/kg p roducing an average AUC of 381,000 
ng•hr/mL would have an acceptable safety profile.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase II , open-label, extension study to assess the safety and efficacy of NS -065/NCNP -
01 Injection in boys with DMD  after completing the 24 -week dose -finding study NS -065/NCNP -
01-201.  
Patient s must complete all study assessments of  the Week 25  of Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 
before performing any study assessments  in this extension study.  In this extension study (NS -
065/NCNP -01-202) p atients  will continue to receive  weekly study drug infusions at the dose level 
up to 80 mg/kg/week  for up to 192 weeks (up to a total of 216 weeks of treatment  in Study NS-
065/NCNP -01-201 and 202 ) or enrollment in a separate long -term follow up program of NS-
065/NCNP -01, whichever is earlier  . Once sites receive IRB a pproval of Protocol Amendment 10, 
all subjects who were previously in the low dose cohort of 40  mg/kg/week will receive 80  
mg/kg/week after obtaining patient consent/assent.  Week 193 is a comprehensive assessment at 
the beginning of the extension visits incorporated in protocol amendment 10, and Week 217 is the 
final study assessment for the treatment period ending with Week 216.   If the site is selected to 
participate in the separate long -term follow -up program and the patient agrees to participat e by 
[CONTACT_180169] -065/NCNP -01-202 study, then the 
patient should complete the Early Termination  visit and transition to the new study . The decision

7.1. Time and Events Schedule  
The schedule of study assessments is described in Table 1; however, a patient can be seen at any 
time for reasons of safety. Study events are divided into the following  phases : 
• Informed Consent :  Execution of the Informed Consent/HIPAA authorization /Assent  will 
take place prior to or during the Week 24 study visit of Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-201. 
• Treatment  Phase : The up to 192-week (up to a total of 216 weeks of treatment  in Study 
NS-065/NCNP -01-201 and 202 ) interval of Study NS-065/NCNP -01-202, starting with 
administration of the first dose of study medication at Week 25 and continuing through 
the time of administration of the final dose of study medication.   If the site is selected to 
participate in the separate long -term follow -up program and t he patient agrees to 
participate by [CONTACT_180169] -065/NCNP -
01-202 study, then the patient should complete the final study visit and transition to the 
new study.  The decision to transition to the long-term follow up program  will be made 
jointly by [CONTACT_102]/caregiver and investigator.  
• Post-treatment  Follow -up Phase : The up to 192 -week Treatment Phase in study 202 (i.e. 
up to 216 weeks for the combined studies NS -065/NCNP -01-201 and 202) is followed by 
a final study visit with comprehensive safety and clinical efficacy assessments at the Week 
217 visit.  A 30 -day follow -up interval begins after completion of the week 217 visit and 
ends after a final phone call for collection of any information about adverse events and 
concomitant medications for all participants. This 30 -day follow -up interval and final 
phone call will only occur for patients who do not continue into a separate long -term 
follow up program of NS -065/NCNP -01. For subjects who do continue into t he long-term 
follow up program, the Week 217 visit or the Early  Termination (ET)  visit will also serve 
as the baseline visit for the follow -up study.   
Subjects who terminate the 202 study before completing the 216 week treatment period 
will undergo an Early Termination (ET) visit which should include all safety and efficacy

the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Life-threatening Experience: Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the site PI, at immediate 
risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e. does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180132].  However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180133] (e.g., life -threatening; required

9.3. Severity  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an adverse event.   
The severity of the advers e event will be characterized and recorded  as “mild, moderate, severe , 
life-threatening or death ” according to the following definitions:  The CTCAE v4.0 3 guidelines 
for severity assessments will be used to grade adverse events for this trial  (available at  
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html) . The CTCAE v4.0 3 listed guidelines for severity 
assessment are:  
• Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only or 
intervention not indicated  
• Moderate : minimal, local or noninvasive inte rvention indicated or limited age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Severe : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; or disabling; or lim iting self -
care ADL  
• Life-threatening:  life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated  
• Death:  Death related to AE

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between  the investigational product 
and the adverse event.  The degree of “relatedness” of the adverse event to the investigational 
product may be described using the following scale : 
Not Related  
• Not Related : No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause.  
• Unlikely : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible). Diseases or other drugs provide plausible 
explanations.  
Related  
• Possible : Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, 
involvement of the investigational product cannot be excluded.  
• Probable : Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but un likely.  The event may 
respond if the investigational product is discontinued.  
• Definite : Established temporal association with administration of the investigational 
product with no other more probable cause.  The event should resolve when the 
investigation al product is discontinued and recur on re -challenge.

9.5.1.  Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent 
to study completion) will be collected on the adverse event eCRF.  Each adverse event is to be 
evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the investigational product.  
For each adverse event, the following information will be recorded:  
• Description of the event (e.g., headache),  
• Date of onset , 
• Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing),  
• Action taken as a result of the event,

A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
adverse event (e.g., fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest x -ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”).  
The Investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of th e patient and the response to treatment 
in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the adverse event.  The question of 
the relationship of adverse events to investigational product administration should be determined 
by [CONTACT_180188].  
Clinically significant (CS) changes from time of informed consent  will be documented as AEs on 
the AE eCRF. CS changes are physical findings that have medical relevance and m ay result in an 
alteration in medical care.  
9.5.2.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs, including death due to any cause and whether or not deemed drug -related or expected, 
must be reported within the study EDC system  (eCRF) within 24  hours (1  working day) o f the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_180137] .

source documentation.  
For all adverse events that require the patient to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s ). 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by 
[CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_180138], but without further recording in the 
eCRF. The sponsor and designated CRO retain the right to req uest additional information for any 
patient with ongoing AEs /SAEs  at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
9.10. General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Labs  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tes ts as they become 
available and to sign and date the results indicating review.  For each laboratory test outside of the 
laboratory normal range, the Investigator must ascertain if this represents a clinically significant 
change from baseline for the indiv idual patient.  The Investigator may repeat a laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify results of the original laboratory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and clinically significant change from 
baseline for the patie nt, the Investigator should determine if it qualifies as an adverse event, and if 
so, an appropriate eCRF will be completed.  All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
occurring during the study and that were not present at baseline should be fol lowed and evaluated 
with additional tests if necessary until diagnosis of the underlying cause, or resolution.  
9.11 Monitoring of Urine Analyses  
Any instances of hematuria or other potentially clinically significant abnormalities on urinalysis 
will be confirmed at the following week’s visit, or sooner at discretion of the investigator. 
Confirmed clinically significant treatment -emergent abnormaliti es will be recorded as AEs and 
discussed with the study chair and medical monitor. Abnormalities will be monitored and 
evaluated with additional tests or consultations, if necessary, until the underlying cause is 
determined, or the event is brought to an a cceptable resolution. Additional clinical and laboratory

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 74 of 112 information will be collected and documented in order to better characterize abnormalities and 
identify etiology and appropriate management.  
9.12.  Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Electrocardiog rams  
If a clinically significant ECG abnormality occurs that was not present at baseline ( Screening Visit 
of Study NS -065/NCNP -01-201) and the Investigator determines that the abnormality is related to 
investigational product, the abnormality will be discu ssed with the Medical Monitor. The ECG 
abnormality will be monitored and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary)  until the 
underlying cause is determined or the event is brought to an acceptable resolution.  Additional 
clinical and laboratory inform ation will be collected and carefully documented in order to better 
characterize the ECG abnormality and rule out alternative causes.  ECG findings determined to be 
a clinically significant change from baseline should be reported as an adverse event regard less of 
causality.  
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be completed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.13 Intravenous (IV) Access Considerations  
Investigational product dosing will be administered through IV infusion.  Peripheral venous access 
(IV cathe ter that empties into a peripheral vein in the arms, hands, legs or feet) is the preferred 
route of IP administration for this study.   
Central venous access (IV catheter that empties into a large central vein) will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis fo r participants who have difficulty with peripheral venous access.  An 
implantable central venous access (CVA) port is the preferred option of central venous access, if 
necessary, for this study.  The Sponsor will decide whether or not to approve this optio n after 
discussions with the site PI, Study Chair and Medical Monitor have ensured mutual agreement that 
central venous access will still maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio for the participant in this study.  
Before final decision, NS Pharma will obtai n documentation from the site investigator that the 
consulting surgeon who will place the port holds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180120] a board eligible/board 
certified surgeon.  The decision, rationale and conclusion regarding the maintained positive 
benefit/risk rat io will be detailed in writing and sent to the requesting site.  Central venous access 
should not be implemented without Sponsor approval.

contraindication, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_180121] a totally implantable 
central venous access device (port).  
9.14.  Medical Monitor  
The Medical Monitor (MM , in the SMP also referred to as MSO ) in this study  will assist the 
Sponsor and clinical sites with the review, assessment and reporting of adverse event cases, and 
the discussion of safety reporting issues and application of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_180139].  The MM 
will interact with the S ponsor’s pharmacovigilance team and the stud y sites to gain a full 
understanding of the reported cases to ensure the assessment and narrative of AE cases is accurate 
and captures the appropriate medical detail of the event for recording and reporting purposes.  The 
MM will work closely with the  Study Chair and the  DSMB as appropriate.  
9.15.  Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
CINRG has a standing DSMB that is made up of at least:  
• Two medical doctors with experience in DMD;  
• One medical doctor who is familiar with the interventions and the anticipated ad verse 
events;  
• A statistician; and  
• A patient advocate.  
It is the responsibility of the CINRG DSMB to review data quality, relevant safety data and AEs 
for all patients enrolled in the study and to make recommendations to the Study Chair, Medical 
Monitor and Sponsor regarding the ongoing conduct and monitoring of the study.  
The DSMB will first meet to review and approve the study protocol.  The DSMB wil l then meet 
every 6 months or as needed. Additional DSMB reviews may be requested by [CONTACT_64362], 
Medical Monitor or Sponsor, as needed.  DSMB meetings may be held via teleconference as 
necessary.  
A summary  safety report will be produced every 6 months  in collaboration between the clinical 
CRO, data management group and statistician and provided to the DSMB for review.  The report 
will include safety data and study progress data (enrollment, data completion and data quality).  
Upon completion of safety data reviews, the DSMB may recommend revision or modification to

10.1  General Considerations  
The statistical analyses described in this section will be performed as further outlined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock .  The SAP will 
supersede the protocol if there are  any differences between the two documents in the plans for data 
analysis  and the differences will be noted in the SAP .  The SAP will be included as an appendix 
in the clinical study report for this protocol.  Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9. 4 
or higher . 
Patients will be enrolled in this study after completing Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-201 and will 
continue with the study dose (40 mg/kg/week or 80 mg/kg/w eek) they received in Study NS -
065/NCNP -01-201.  Results for this study will be summarized by [CONTACT_180191].    
 
Statistical analyses will occur at the following times:  
• Every [ADDRESS_211992] report, and the report formats will be updated at the DSMB's requests as the data 
develop. The DSMB will review completeness of efficacy data, but will not review the 
efficacy data itself.  
• At the conclusio n of the study.  A summary report will be generated on all baseline 
characteristics, safety assessments and efficacy assessments, addressing each of the 
primary, secondary and exploratory objectives of the study.   
All statistical tests will be performed at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 with no corrections 
for multiple comparisons or multiple outcomes. Note however, that s ince this is an early phase 
extension  study, with a focus on safety, the emphasis will not be on statistical tests (i.e.,  
p-values).  
10.2  Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately  16 patients from Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-201 will enter this study.  Because this 
is an open -label extension study conducted in patients who complete Study  NS-065/NCNP -01-
201, the sample size is not based on any statistical considerations.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________  
NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 78 of 112 10.3  Analysis Populations  
All analyses will be based on the actual treatment  each pati ent received. Two populations will be 
defined for data analysis: the Safety Population and the Full Analysis Set.  
Safety Population  
All patients who receive at least one dose of NS -065/NCNP -01 Injection 250  mg in both the dose -
finding (NS -065/NCNP -01-201) and extension study (NS -065/NCNP -01-202) will be included in 
the Safety Population. The Safety Population is the primary analysis population for safety 
assessments.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All patients who receive at least one dose of NS -065/NCNP -01 In jection 250  mg in both the dose -
finding (NS -065/NCNP -01-201) and extension study (NS -065/NCNP -01-202) will be included in 
the FAS. The FAS is the primary analysis population for clinical efficacy and exploratory PD 
assessments.  
10.4  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Summaries of patient  demographics (age, race,  ethnicity  and dominant hand ), baseline safety 
characteristics (anthropometrics, vital signs, physical examination, hematology, chemistry, BNP, 
urinalysis, ECG and antibodies) , and baseline efficacy parameters will be done by [CONTACT_15994].  Note 
that two sets of baseline values will be su mmarized, Screening Visit (from Dose -finding Study 
NS-065/NCNP -01-201) and Week 25 (from Extension Study NS -065/NCNP -01-202).  
Any differences in distribution of baseline characteristics will be noted, although with such a small 
study, it is to be expected  that some differences will emerge.  
10.5  Safety Assessments  
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population and will address one of two co -
primary objective s of the study.  All safety assessments will be based on actual treatments received 
by [CONTACT_180192].

Physical exam results will be summarized by [CONTACT_180194] (beyond the DMD diagnosis) and in particular any changes in the physical exam ove r time. 
Any new adverse events (AEs) occurring after the time of enrollment into NS -065/NCNP -01-202 
(defined as the time of IP infusion at the Week 25 visit) will be considered for analysis for this 
study.   For AEs starting in study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 whic h are not resolved at the time of 
enrollment into NS -065/NCNP -01-202, any change in outcome or relatedness will be reported in 
study NS -065/NCNP -01-201.  For AEs starting in study NS -065/NCNP -01-201 which increase in 
severity or becomes serious after enrol lment in study NS -065/NCNP -01-202, a new AE will be 
reported in NS -065/NCNP -01-202. 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994] .  Coding will be done by 
[CONTACT_6657] (using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)). Level of severity will be assessed using the CTCAE grading  system . Summaries will 
include: 
A. Summaries at the patient level   
How many patients had any TEAE, any SAE, highest severity of TEAE within a patient across all 
infusions, highest relationship level of TEAE within a patient across all infusions, highest 
intervention level regarding investigational product (e.g., discontinued, vs. reduced dose vs. 
temporarily stopped vs. no interruption in infusions), and worst out come within a patient (e.g., AE

2Introduction/background 
Influenza and pneumonia are the most common infection-related and vaccine-preventable causes of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017].  90%  of influenza-related deaths occur  among adults aged >[ADDRESS_690423] risk and  debilitated  seniors that  
may acquire  influenza. Two influenza vaccines are now available that are FDA approved  
specifically for  persons over age 65: the newly approved adjuvanted seasonal  influenza vaccine 
(Fluad) and the high  dose  (HD) vaccine  that was approved in  [ADDRESS_690424] dose (SD) vaccine remains  unclear from existing immunologic and clinical evidence. 
For Year 2, we will be adding a  3rd vaccine substudy, recombinant FLUBLOK.  
FLUBLOK is  a newer  FDA  approved  influenza  vaccine that  has a higher amount of HA in the 
formulation than  SD, and has a unique feature of not being  produced in eggs.   None of the three 
vaccines have been compared head-to-head and an industry-sponsored study is unlikely to be conducted to evaluate relative  efficacy  or effectiveness due  to uncertainty as to  whether  
manufacturers will  gain additional  market advantage  while  risking uncovering relative  
inferiority.
Both  Fluad, HD, and FLUBLOK vaccine have been shown to be  more  effective  than  SD 
vaccine in trials  conducted in different cohorts.  HD vaccine and  FLUBLOK are  more expensive 
than SD vaccine, and Fluad is less expensive  than HD vaccine.   As an adjuvanted vaccine, Fluad  
has been  shown to have higher levels  of heterologous immunity to drifted  influenza  strains  than 
non-adjuvanted (SD) vaccine - another potential  advantage of Fluad over HD vaccine, which is 
non-adjuvanted.  This project’s rationale and  innovation derive from  its ability  to determine  the 
best use of these two vaccines  in the setting of  one of the most vulnerable elderly  populations - 
those living in nursing homes (NH) and  other various long-term care institutions. 
  
Increased response  to HD  over SD influenza vaccine in geriatric adults  
In 2009, HD influenza  vaccine  consisting of 4 times  the antigen of  SD vaccine  was 
licensed for  use in persons over  the age  of 65. In studies prior to  its approval, the anti-influenza 
titers as  determined by [CONTACT_531833] 
(Falsey et al.,  2009) .  
Clinical  efficacy of HD vaccine has been demonstrated in  a large clinical trial (n=31,989) 
in which HD vaccine was 24.3% better at preventing laboratory confirmed  influenza than SD 
vaccine overall (DiazGranados  et al., 2014).  A retrospective cohort study of 2.5 million 
Medicare recipi[INVESTIGATOR_531807] 22%  more effective than SD at prevention of 
probable influenza based on  diagnosis codes  and treatment and  22% more  effective  at prevention 
of influenza hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531808] (Izurieta et al., 2015) .  A VA-wide retrospective 
study using the national VA  database  only showed benefit of HD over SD  in veterans age 85 and 
older (Richardson et al.,  2015), but notably employed a differently defined clinical endpoint  than 
the other clinical  efficacy studies (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46990] a primary diagnosis of pneumonia or  
influenza without  any requirement of lab confirmation or treatment regimen).    We ran a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_531809] 30% less likely to  have any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531810] (adjusted relative risk 0.701; 95% CI:  0.543, 0.905; 
p=0.006) in an  A/H3N2  dominant season (unpublished).
Version 
[ADDRESS_690425] with laboratory confirmed  documentation  of 
prevention of  disease as HD  vaccine has been.   There  are, however, multiple studies  that support 
greater protective efficacy  from Fluad than SD.  Mannino et  al showed  in a large cohort study 
conducted in Italy over 3 seasons that the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531811] 25% lower in patients receiving Fluad relative  to SD vaccine (Mannino et al., 2012).  This  
difference in protection is very similar to that observed in two of the HD vs. SD studies  
discussed above.    Other studies focusing on nursing home patients including  VanBuynder  et al  
demonstrated in a case control study that Fluad was superior to non-adjuvanted vaccine in  
protection from disease (Van Buynder et al.,  2013), and  Iob et al found that  Fluad was superior  
in effectiveness to  the conventional vaccine, reporting protection rates of 80% vs. 57%  
respectively (Iob et al., 2005).  
Increased Efficacy of FLUBLOK in  adults
Dunkle et at performed a  large RCT enrolling individuals age 50 and older comparing  
FLUBLOK and SD vaccine  (Dunkle,  et al, 2017). They found the probability of influenza-like 
illness was 30%  lower  with FLUBLOK than with SD Quadravalent  vaccine (95% confidence 
interval, 10 to 47; P  = 0.006) and satisfied prespecified criteria for the primary noninferiority 
analysis and an exploratory superiority analysis of FLUBLOK  over  SD.  
Justification/rationale/significance of the study 
Scientific Rationale 
As the primary endpoint we are using pre-  to post-vaccine changes  in HAI titers to 
compare seroconversion  rates and post-vaccination  HAI titers  to calculate  the ratio  of the 
geometric mean titers in the two treatment  groups. HAI  is an in  vitro bioassay that determines a  
subject’s serum  levels of anti-influenza  antibodies.  The FDA uses this as a standard 
immunogenicity assay  for licensure.  We will follow the guidelines set out in  the FDA guidance 
document discussing  non-inferiority immunogenicity studies.   As additional methods to  assess 
immunogenicity we  are adding an assessment of anti-NA by [CONTACT_531834] 
(NAI) and SVN assays.   Dunning et al recently  supported the use of NAI and SVN assays as a 
correlate for protection in a trial of geriatric subjects (Dunning et al., 2016).  Memoli  in a healthy 
human challenge  model showed that NAI  is more  predictive of protection  and reduced disease  
than HAI (Memoli  et al., 2016).
In the large HD vaccine  clinical  efficacy trial (n=31,989) one third of subjects also  had 
immunogenicity data that allowed  looking for correlations of immune assays  with protection 
(DiazGranados et al., 2014). Their conclusions were that  HAI  and other immune  assays  are 
potential correlates of influenza  vaccine protection in older  adults, and  that the protective 
thresholds for the  HAI assay in the elderly appear consistent with  those previously described for 
younger adults, provided the assay virus matches  the circulating virus (Dunning et al., 2016).  
Significance
        Data compi[INVESTIGATOR_531812] 2011-[ADDRESS_690426] in the  
US. Overall, these provider sectors served  over  8 million people annually (2013).  Our study  will 
focus on residents  in long term care (LTC)  facilities,  but the findings  of our study are  highly 
relevant to persons frail enough to require such  services in all of settings where the vast  majority 
are at least [ADDRESS_690427]  mortality.  
Deaths due to  pneumonia and influenza  and chronic lung disease were 20 times  higher  among 
NH residents compared to community residents (Menec et al., 2002).  The current availability of two vaccines  specifically for  the elderly  that both appear to work better than SD vaccine 
begs the question: is the newer and less-costly  Fluad vaccine non-inferior or even  superior 
to HD vaccine?  The proposed study aims to initially address non-inferiority as this  is feasible in  
the clinical trial R01  grant structure  and a  critical first step to  obtain head-to-head data from  the 
same trial, cohort and  vaccine years.  Our  proposed study itself  may  provide direct guidance on 
vaccine usage or inform  a future trial assessing actual  superiority  should that be  appropriate  
based on the results of our study.
        HD vaccine is increasingly used by [CONTACT_531835][INVESTIGATOR_531813] (ACIP), the CDC committee  responsible  for making  the vaccine  recommendations for 
the U.S..  A finding of  non-inferiority in the primary endpoint  would provide  a strong rationale 
to consider using Fluad over HD that could result in some cost  avoidance  across large long-term 
care system in the  U.S.   We are not powered  for a superiority analysis but in a  non-inferiority 
trial if the findings  are substantial enough they may show  superiority.
        In the normal  seasonal setting, influenza  strains  drift  antigenically and  therefore vary 
from year to year.  The CDC’s prediction  many  months before the vaccination season sets the 
composition for the  next season’s vaccine,  but does not  always correctly anticipate the exact  
strain match that eventually actually  circulates.   We  have Medicare claims data and  modeling in  
the NH population that  there is a significant increase  in death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531814] A/H3N2 predominates (Pop-Vicas et al., 2015) .  In 
those mismatched years in particular, heterologous  immunity or immunity to  other non-exact 
match strains becomes much more  important if the  vaccine is  going to  provide  any benefit  that 
season. Fluad  is an adjuvanted vaccine  that has been  shown to have a more broad-based  or 
heterologous immunity than SD  vaccine  that is not adjuvanted (Ansaldi et al., 2008; Frey et al., 
2014). HD is also not adjuvanted. Broad based  immunity is especially  desirable  for A/H3N2 
immunity as that has  had [ADDRESS_690428] 5 years while circulating 
A/H1N1 has  been  the same for  5 years; i.e., vaccine  mismatch is more likely with the A/H3N2 
circulating strain. A/H3N2  is associated with the majority of influenza hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531815] (Centers for Disease  and Prevention, 2010).
For the recombinant FLUBLOK arm,  there  is emerging data that indicates that  the 
method of  producing  the vaccine may  be highly clinically significant.  There are important egg-
induced mutations in the production process  of the recent A/H3N2 strains.  The egg-produced 
vaccines induce antibodies to A/H3N2 that have substantially less blocking  ability to wild type 
circulating A/H3N2  than  do antibodies elicited by [CONTACT_531836],  that is produced from a  wild type 
sequence without mutations (Zost  et al).  If this deleterious  issue of egg-adapted mutations 
continues, there may be  a major push in the future toward non-egg-produced vaccines such as 
Version 
[ADDRESS_690429] from egg-based  vaccines. This supports the 
need and significance  for having head to head comparative studies of FLUBLOK, HD and  AD.   
Purpose, including specific aims and/or  hypotheses 
Hypothesis: Adjuvanted flu vaccine, Fluad, is not immunologically inferior  to HD influenza 
vaccine in older persons living in long-term  care.   
Objectives:
Primary:
To determine if Fluad is immunologically non-inferior to HD  flu vaccine in  long term care 
residents over age 65.  
     As the  primary  endpoint we will evaluate  the hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titer rise 
following vaccination to assess overall differences and seroconversion  rates  (4-fold  rise in  
antibody titer)  and post-vaccination  geometric  mean HAI titer of at  least  40 in the treatment 
groups. HAI is an  in vitro bioassay testing subjects’ sera for specific anti-influenza antibodies to  
each strain in the  vaccine.  The  FDA  uses this as the  standard immunogenicity assay for  
licensure.  We  will follow  the guidelines set out in the FDA  guidance document on non-
inferiority immunogenicity studies for the analysis  plan.  We will also perform neuraminidase 
inhibition (NAI) assays and serum virus neutralization (SVN)  assays there are recent data that  
NAI and SVN assays  may  be a better correlate of protection than HAI.
Secondary:
Aim 2:  Secondary  objective: To determine  if Fluad has greater  heterologous immunity  than  HD 
vaccine.
      HAI, NAI, SVN assays will be  performed with heterologous A/H3N2 strains to determine if 
Fluad has an  increased breadth of both B and T cell  responses as would be predicted from an  
adjuvanted vaccine.
Aim 3: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_531816]: To determine if  Fluad has similar protective efficacy to  HD 
vaccine.   We will perform a record review and obtain blood 2-[ADDRESS_690430]  review and  speaking with the Director of Nursing,  we will obtain dates 
and diagnoses of influenza, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], any  “influenza like  illness” (ILI), and  other  
illnesses, diagnostic  tests, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531817].   From the  
remote blood sample, we  will determine  if there  is serologic evidence  of influenza infection with 
a 4-fold titer  rise beyond  the post-vaccine titers. In exploratory analysis we will compare efficacy 
of prevention  of influenza  infection of Fluad vs. HD using the  record  review and laboratory 
assessments.   We will also be able  to examine the concordance in  this long  term  care population  
between record review and titer  rise methods as evidence of infection that  may  aid in future 
study design.
Aim 4:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_531818]:   To compare the immunogenicity of recombinant flu vaccine 
(FLUBLOK) to the  AD and HD influenza vaccines.

6We propose a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial to  enroll  500 Long Term Care residents 
age 65 and older to receive either  Fluad or  HD vaccine at 1:[ADDRESS_690431]-influenza  season  and coded for blinded  laboratory  analysis.  
The FLUBLOK pi[INVESTIGATOR_531819] a substudy of the current AD Fluad  vs. HD Fluzone study 
(UH IRB 10-27-29), and  subjects will be consented on  a separate FLUBLOK ICF.
Population:  [ADDRESS_690432] Ohio 
area.  Up to an  additional 120 subjects will be added to  FLUBLOK substudy.
50:50 male:female ratio.   
Study Duration: [ADDRESS_690433] Duration: estimated  6-[ADDRESS_690434] received  agreement currently form Seqirus (maker of adjuvanted vaccine), and are 
talking with [COMPANY_011] Pasteur (maker of high dose vaccine), to  donate regular dose flu vaccine for 
use by [CONTACT_531837].  This will be  used as an incentive to  the 
facility to agree to let us be a  recruitment site.  The vaccine will be sent directly  from the 
manufacturer as a  donation to the employee  health team at the LTC  site, so that we do not have  
to be involved in the  handling, prescribing, or monitoring of the vaccine.  If a LTC facility agrees 
to allow us to enroll, we  will provide  the manufacturer with  the name [CONTACT_3669]  [CONTACT_531838].   
We do not believe this is a coercive relationship  with the long term  care  facility because they 
will get the vaccine once they agree to participate  for the  season, regardless  of whether  we 
recruit one or many  from  their site.  We will also give  all participating facilities an  $1000 
participation stipend,  to cover any administrative  and staff costs that  participation in the study 
may incur.  The nursing and administrative  staff (administrator,  DON,  ADON, Social Worker,  
Unit Nurses) at the long term care  facility  support the study in  the following ways; they review  
the census with the  study team during our initial meeting and prescreening, and help identify 
those residents that  meet study inclusion criteria, and those residents that are not eligible for 
recruitment due  to study exclusions.  Additionally, the LTC administrative and nursing staff 
(Social Worker, Director of Nursing, Assistant Director of Nursing,  Unit Nurses) helps the study 
team identify which residents can  self-consent, and  which ones utilize a LAR for their health 
care decisions. The LTC facility nurses and social workers, also helps the study team to identify  
residents (location), discusses medical conditions of the potentially  eligible  residents to  
determine if they  are still eligible  for recruitment  or self-consenting, discusses  medical 
conditions with the  study  team  of consented  residents to determine if  they are  still eligible at the 
time of  vaccination, reviews the  enrolled  residents’ medical conditions with  the study staff at the 
end of study  participation to determine if they had the influenza virus and/or other medical  
conditions that  the study will be  documenting  for the  study. The long term care facility  also 
supports the  study on the day of  vaccination,  by [CONTACT_1541] a  nurse who helps  identify  consented  
residents.  With  regards  to the  administrative  support,  a designated  nurse, the Director of 
Nursing, or  the administrator at the LTC  facility  is in touch with  the study staff  throughout the  
duration of the  study.  The study coordinator sends regular updates, as to which  residents  
Version

7consented onto  this study.  This is important so that  the LTC facility nurse doesn’t consent a 
resident for their own flu  vaccine, when the resident and/or LAR already consented onto  the 
study.  The LTC facility staff is not involved in any  recruitment activities  for the  study,  but lends 
support to the study team with  regards  to medical information and  updates,  and on vaccination 
and blood work days. 
Consenting will take place at various  long term care facilities in  Northeastern Ohio and  with  an 
IRB approved written Consent Form, which we will review with either the resident or the LARs  
on the phone.  We will speak to the  LTC Administrator, Director of Nursing,  Assistant Director 
of Nursing,  Social Worker, and Unit Nurses to determine if a  resident can make their own health  
care decisions and consent for  their routine care,  or if a Legally Authorized Representative 
(LAR) is  needed.  If  the nursing staff deems  that the resident can consent for themselves,  we will 
approach them  directly to initiate the consenting process. The consent process should take 
approximately [ADDRESS_690435]  an 
understanding.  If the resident is  not able to understand the study, we will proceed to  the LAR 
consent. If the nursing staff (LTC  Administrator,  Director of Nursing, Assistant Director of 
Nursing, Social Worker,  and Unit Nurses) deems that the resident cannot  physically  or mentally 
give informed  consent, as  documented in their facility medical  record,  we will send an  IRB 
approved Study Consent Form, Letter to LARs, LTC Facility Letter of Support, Study Brochure, 
and addressed stamped  envelope to these potential  subjects’ LAR.  We will follow  up with a 
phone call to review  the Study Consent Form and if  they  would like to enroll their family 
member onto the study,  we will ask them to appropriately sign the Consent  Form and send it 
back to us, in  the provided envelope.  If a resident is physically and mentally able to  sign an 
Assent Form, the study staff will review the Assent Form with the resident.   If a subject is 
determined to  be physically or mentally not capable of signing any documents, (as documented 
in the medical records  and confirmed by [CONTACT_531839], Assistant Director of Nursing, 
Social Worker, and/or Unit Nurse),  then  we will waive Assent  and will file the medical 
documentation along with the LAR consent. LARs  will be mailed a  copy of the signed Consent 
Form for their records, and we  will provide  a copy  to the nursing administration at the LTC 
facility. The Consent Form will have study contact [CONTACT_3031], so they can withdraw consent at  
any time.
This process will begin  months before  the anticipated vaccination time frame, to  allow plenty  of 
time for mail correspondence,  phone calls, and  consenting. 
The research team will make sure that  the residents  and LARs  understand that participation  is 
voluntary, and if they choose  not to enroll  onto the study, they will receive the standard  of care 
flu vaccination that the LTC facility provides.
For year 2 of  the study, we will be modifying the  recruitment plan as follows: 
The study team  will meet with the LTC Administrator, Director  of Nursing, Assistant Director of 
Nursing, Social Worker,  and Unit Nurses to review the study, sign a  Letter of Agreement to  
collaborate on the study,  and narrow  down the census to  those  residents who meet the study’s  
inclusion/ exclusion  criteria.  From there,  the study  team and Director of Nursing, Assistant 
Version

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
8Director of Nursing, Social Worker, and/or Unit Nurses will come  up with a list  of residents who  
are possibly eligible for  recruitment onto the study.  For those  residents  who need an LAR, a pre-
recruitment letter from  the LTC facilities  administration will be sent out.  This letter  would give 
an overview of the  study,  state  that the LAR will be receiving more details  about the study in  a 
future mailing  from the study team, and also state that if the family member prefers  NOT  to 
receive any communication  from the study team, please call the LTC facility  to let them  know.   
The study team  will suggest  to the LTC facility  nursing  team  and administrator to  also pre-
communicate about  the study through an email and /or newsletter that will let the residents and 
family members know about the study in advance of the study team's mailing.
Recruitment for the FLUBLOK pi[INVESTIGATOR_531820] 2:
Any long term care facilities  that participated on Year 1 of the study can participate on Year 2, as 
long as we  do not repeat subjects.  For the FLUBLOK  substudy, we can recruit  from  those 
subjects that participated in Year 1 and received either the adjuvanted Fluad  or the HD Fluzone.  
Since enrolled subjects from Year 1 cannot participate for a  2nd year  on the Fluad vs.  HD 
objective, these previously enrolled subjects would be eligible for recruitment on the FLUBLOK substudy, and therefore,  we will use our previously described screening and recruitment methods 
to consent  these subjects for enrollment  to receive  the FLUBLOK vaccine.   We will consent 
these subjects on a separate  FLUBLOK ICF.  We  may  also recruit FLUBLOK subjects from new 
long term  care facility  sites that  did not previously  participate on the study, and  we will use  the 
same previously described consenting methods, and  consent with the  FLUBLOK ICF.  If we hit 
our recruitment goals on the primary  endpoint  (Fluad vs HD Fluzone objective), then any 
additional long term care  residents that we may recruit will not be randomized to receive Fluad 
or HD  Fluzone, but rather  will be enrolled in  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_78382]  4 FLUBLOK arm.  These  residents 
will be consented on another ICF,  that was  modified specifically for FLUBLOK.

Study procedures
The intervention is randomization  to one of  the two FDA approved  seasonal influenza vaccines 
(Fluad(AD) and  FLUZONE HD (HD)) at  1:1 ratio.  The HD vaccine will serve as the control, 
and the newly FDA-approved AD will be  the comparator.  We will obtain 20 ml of blood up to  2 
weeks prior to  the vaccine,  or right before the vaccine is given.  The second blood  draw will be 4 
weeks +/- [ADDRESS_690436]  will then  be enrolled as long as 8 months  if they  are enrolled in  
September and the flu season  lasts until  April.
 
We will obtain  the following PHI in the prescreening: name, birthdate,  race,  ethnicity, gender, 
facility name [CONTACT_531853], and  whether  a resident can self-consent or needs to use the 
LAR method of  consenting.  If a resident cannot  self-consent, we will obtain  the name,  mailing 
address, phone  numbers, and relationship of an LAR.  We may also  collect  contact [CONTACT_531840] a secondary contact/secondary  LAR, when appropriate, during  the pre-screening process.  
Some residents may  have two LARs/POAs listed in the medical record. 
 
 After a resident  is consented and found still eligible, they will be randomized using the UH 
based study database,  RedCap, to receive  one of the two licensed study influenza vaccines.  
Subjects will be  assigned  a donor code  at that time that does not  indicate  which  vaccine they  
have received so the  lab analysis can  remain blinded.  Study  staff will bring enough  supply of 
each vaccine for  either type of randomization and  maintain the cold chain according to pharmacy 
policy so unused vaccine can be  returned to the UH monitored study refrigerator.  Vaccine  will 
be given by [CONTACT_531841], since it is a standard  of care vaccine that would  have  been given by [CONTACT_531842].  The first blood draw  will be up to 2 weeks prior to the vaccine,  or right 
before the vaccine is given.   All blood draws will be  obtained  by [CONTACT_531843].  
Then at 4 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_690437] of care  as far  
as the vaccine is  concerned, since  the subjects should be receiving one of the FDA  approved 
vaccines though the  course of their  routine health  care. 
These are the  side effects of the vaccine that are listed  on the  package  inserts. They were 
mostly mild  in severity. 
FLUAD vaccine: most  common (≥ 10%)  local  (injection site) adverse reactions were injection 
site pain  (25%)  and tenderness (21%).    The  most  common (≥ 10%) systemic adverse  reactions  
observed in clinical studies were muscle aches (15%), headache (13%) and fatigue (13%).
FLUZONE High Dose  vaccine: most common injection-site reaction was pain (>30%); the most  
common solicited systemic adverse events were muscle aches,  malaise,  and headache (>10%).   
FLUBLOK: In adults [ADDRESS_690438] common (≥10%) injection site 
reactions were tenderness (34%)  and pain (19%); the  most  common  (≥10%)  solicited  systemic 
adverse reactions were  headache  (13%) and fatigue  (12%).
A Federal law, called  the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act (GINA),  effective May 21, 
2010, generally  makes  it illegal for health insurance companies, group health  plans,  and most 
employers to discriminate against  you based on your genetic information. This law  generally will 
protect you in the following ways: 
Health insurance companies and  group health plans may not request  your genetic 
information that  we get from this research.
Health insurance companies and  group health plans may not use your genetic 
information when  making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.
Employers  with [ADDRESS_690439]’s  name,  birthdate, 
or medical  record number. 
Privacy risk
Participation in this study  will involve a  loss of privacy, but  information  about the  subject  will be 
handled as  confidentially as possible. The research records will be labeled with  a code number.  
This study  does not focus on PHI factor that  are often considered controversial  or sensitive.   
There is no alternative to obtain this type of data  and comparison if  done in  humans.  There are 
minimal risks above standard of care  so we feel  the study is justified and  the risk has been 
minimized with only small  blood draws  to do the study beyond what  is normal standard of care.
Compensation for injury
The subject  will have to pay for  costs to any research related injury.  The sponsor is not  
responsible for  this. We have  adopted this language that  the IRB  recommended for our  consent 
form. 
If injury occurs as a  result  of the subject’s involvement in  this research,  medical treatment is 
available from  University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531822]’s medical 
insurance will be  responsible for the cost  of this  treatment.  A research injury is an injury that 
happens as a result of taking part  in this research  study.   If a subject is injured by a  medical  
treatment or procedure that they would have  received even if they weren’t  in the study, that is  not 
considered a “research injury”. There are no plans for payment of medical expenses or other payments, including lost wages, for any research related injury.  To  help avoid  injury, it is very  
important to follow all study directions.
Benefits to subjects 
The subject  may directly benefit from participating  in this study because they  will be  receiving a 
flu shot.  This is one of the shots that they  should have normally received  through their routine  
recommended healthcare at the LTC facility, so this  is not necessarily an  additional  benefit since 
these vaccines are the  commercially purchased vaccines.  Their participation  may aid  in deciding 
which of these two vaccines  is optimal and would be  recommended in  the future.  The subject 
will receive  up to $[ADDRESS_690440] 
There are no costs to the subjects. 
Alternative(s) to  participation 
The alternative is to not participate  and continue  to receive the normal care at The  LTC facility.
Payment to the  subjects  (include both reimbursement and incentives) 
Subjects will receive  $20 for the completion of each blood  draw, which  will be deposited either 
into their  Resident Account or the Family Activity  Council Account at the Long Term Care 
facility.  There are no expenses.
Plan for obtaining informed consent 
We will follow the policy of the LTC  facility administrative and nursing staff (LTC 
Administrator, Director  of Nursing, Assistant Director of Nursing, Social  Worker, and  Unit 
Nurses) as an  initial  guide for obtaining  consent  directly from the resident or determining if we 
will need to use the LAR method of consent.  
We will speak to the DON, ADON, Social Worker  and nursing staff on each unit of the facility 
to determine if a  resident can  make their  own health  care decisions and  consent  for their routine  
care, or if  a Legally Authorized Representative  (LAR) is  needed.   If the nursing staff deems that  
the resident can  consent  for themselves,  we will approach the resident in  a private location to 
initiate the consenting process.    We will review the current IRB  approved  ICF with the resident, 
asking them several questions about the study to confirm they have  an understanding.  We will 
ensure that they can explain the purpose  of the study and ask the resident questions  about  the 
study to  confirm  that they have an  understanding  of what the study entails.  The  consent process 
should take approximately  60 minutes.  If the resident appears to  not understand the scope of the 
study, we will proceed to the LAR method of consenting.  
If the nursing staff ( Director of Nursing,  Assistant  Director of Nursing,  Social Worker, and  Unit 
Nurses) deems that the resident cannot  physically  or mentally give informed consent, as 
documented in  their facility   medical  record,  we will send an  IRB approved Study Consent From, 
Letter to LARs, facility Letter of Support, Study Brochure, and addressed stamped  envelope  to 
these potential subjects’  LARs.   We  will follow up with  a phone call to review  the Study 
Consent Form and if they  would  like to enroll their family member  onto  the study, we will ask 
them to appropriately  sign the Consent Form and send it back to us, in  the provided envelope.  If 
a resident is physically and mentally  able to sign an Assent  Form, the study staff  will review  the 
Assent Form with the resident.  If a subject  is determined to be physically or mentally not  
capable of  signing any  documents (as documented in their  nursing home record and confirmed 
with either the DON, ADON, or Unity nurse),  then we will waive Assent  and will file the 
medical documentation  along with the LAR signed written Consent Form.  LARs will be mailed  
a copy of  the signed Consent Form for their  records,  and we will give a copy  to the nursing 
administration at  the LTC facility.   The Consent Form will have study contact [CONTACT_3031], so 
they can withdraw consent  at any time.

administered is approved by [CONTACT_531844].  
If a subject  refuses the  research blood draw,  a later attempt will be made.  Subjects who  refuse 
the research blood draw will still remain in the study for data  collection.
Provisions for subjects from  vulnerable populations 
This study  examines  the responses of influenza  vaccine in  Long Term Care residents.  The whole 
premise of  the study  is to study this population that  is more impacted  by [CONTACT_531845] a  
result, stands to benefit  the most from using the most effective  flu vaccine.  If the  person cannot  
consent for themselves we will use  the Legally  Authorized  Representative (LAR) and an  Assent 
form.  All of the  subjects are residents of the LTC facility.  As a result, the LTC facilities have an 
assessment and clinical practice plan for each  resident if they are able to consent  for their  routine 
care or if  the use of an  LAR  is needed.   We will follow the LTC facility and nursing team’s   
initial lead  (speaking with the LTC Administrator, Director of Nursing,  Assistant Director of 
Nursing, Social Worker,  and Unit Nurses).  If a  resident uses  an LAR to make his/her healthcare 
decisions, we will not even attempt to consent a resident directly.  We will use the  LAR method  
of consenting.  If a resident  is deemed able  to make  his/her own  healthcare  decisions and  consent  
for themselves, we  will approach  the LTC resident  and initiate a self-consenting  process.  In the 
process of consenting, we  will review the consent  and ask questions  to assure  the resident’s 
understanding.  If our study staff members  feel that the subject is not able to understand  the 
consent form and the study, we will then proceed to the LAR method  for consenting or just not  
enroll the subject, if LAR consenting is not possible.
 For illiterate  or blind  residents, we will have a  witness present who will sign the witness line  on 
the informed consent, if a  subject would like to enroll.  It  is beyond the scope and  budget of our  
study to  have consents  in multiple languages  and access to  translators, therefore we will not 
include this  population.  In our experience in this population this occurs very infrequently.
Plans for the subjects at the end of the protocol 
At the end of  the study,  enrolled subjects  will continue to  receive their normal standard of care 
that the LTC facility provides. 
Data safety  monitoring  plan or Data  safety monitoring board or committee  
Prior to writing the  IRB  protocol  [CONTACT_531854]  had [CONTACT_531855] at NIAID review the application.  
He said that  a DSMB is  not required.  So we do not plan to  have  a DSMB.  Here is the rationale 
for our case we made to him.  The study is low risk -- all subjects are receiving a standard of care  
FDA approved seasonal influenza vaccination,  a risk they would incur as residents  of the facility 
even if  they were  not participants in the study.  The  new risks from the study are access to 
HIPAA data and  blood sampling  on three  occasions,  all low-risk activities and none  traditionally 
requiring additional DSMB oversight.

[ADDRESS_690442]  for vaccine adverse event  reporting (VAERS). Since both vaccines are part 
of FDA-approved and ACIP-recommended  routine care, additional oversight and monitoring 
above standard mechanisms is  not warranted.   As the study  is still  formally a clinical  trial we will 
still monitor the events reported through the established mechanism.  Our LTC sites will be instructed to notify us with  any events to subjects.  We will also be on site at week 4, at the 
minimum, for  the second blood draw and for  an in person assessment as well.
The LTC sites will be  visited at the follow-up blood draw at  4 weeks unless some  SAE  
evaluation would  require a visit earlier.   The vaccine  is part of what would normally be  routine 
care at the LTC sites, so they should not need extensive  specific monitoring. 
How will data (electronic and  hardcopy  files) be maintained 
Primary data sheets and  paperwork in hard copy will be stored  in a locked room and  lock  
drawer.  Any electronic files that have any link of subject PHI and study code will be stored  on 
password protected files.  The study will be using the secure research database, RedCap, which is housed on the UH server.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_531824].  The de-identified  data for the study will be used for 
publication of the results of the objectives.  The data will also  be loaded onto  ClinicalTrials.gov.  
How long  will research data be stored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_531825]  [ADDRESS_690443] by [CONTACT_3486], their  staff, and 
the sponsor(s)  and their agents.   The  records  will be  viewed in  a private  room  and protected 
against viewing by [CONTACT_531846].  There will be no discussion outside closed doors regarding  any information pertaining to data collected.  All  samples will be  labelled  with  
the deidentified code right on site to protect  their confidentiality. 
Data/Sample confidentiality plan 
We will establish  a study code  when  subjects are enrolled.  This  will happen by [CONTACT_531847].  The samples will be  obtained  by [CONTACT_531848].  The samples will be  labeled on site with  the study code and date  
only.  All PHI will be stored on the  secure study database, RedCap, and  lab data will then only  
be linked to the  code.  Data  will be entered  directly  into RedCap,  housed on the UH server.  If 
any source documents are  collected,  or study data  is collected on a  data sheet, they will be stored

collected by [CONTACT_138314], as well as study consent  forms, will be  stored in  one of the 
aforementioned offices.   The study code for each  enrolled resident  is assigned through  the secure  
study database,  RedCap.   Enrolled participants are  identified through their  study code, and are 
also randomized to receive one of the  two study vaccines through  the RedCap study database.   
The blood  samples will only  be labeled with the participant’s study code and date of collection. 
 Only IRB  authorized study personnel  will have  access to the RedCap database, as well as to  the 
source documents. 
Data/Sample security plan 
As is mentioned in the  previous section, source  documents such as data collection tools (if used), 
and Consent Forms will be stored in a  locked  room, in a  locked cabinet.  Most data will be 
entered directly into the secure study database, RedCap, housed on the UH server.  If any source documents are collected, or study  data is collected on a primary data  sheet, they  will be  stored in 
a locked cabinet, either in the locked offices of PI [INVESTIGATOR_531827], BRB 1022, Study Coordinator 
Sabina Rubeck,  BRB 1035, or in the  office of Nurse Coordinator Beth Bednarchik,  at the UH 
CRC.  All PHI collected by [CONTACT_1758], as well as  study consent forms, will be stored  in one  of the  
aforementioned offices.   Only  the PI, and authorized members of the study team who are listed 
on the protocol will have access to the  RedCap database, as well as any PHI. 
All blood samples are  coded,  and therefore  can be accessed by [CONTACT_105]-study staff.  The samples will 
be stored primarily at the  CWRU lab  BRB  1001. 
Any electronic files that have any link of subject PHI and study code will be stored  on password 
protected files.  The coded data  for the  study  will be  used  for publication of the results  of the 
objectives.  The data will also be loaded  onto ClinicalTrials.gov.  We will keep the  raw data as 
long as is dictated  by [CONTACT_531849].
 
Data analysis plan 
Study Outcome Measures
As the primary endpoint we are using pre-  to post-vaccine changes  in hemagglutinin 
inhibition assay (HAI) titers to compare  seroconversion rates  and post-vaccination HAI titers to  
calculate the ratio of the  geometric mean  titers in the two treatment  groups. HAI is an in vitro 
bioassay that determines a  subject’s serum levels of  anti-influenza antibodies.  The  FDA uses  
this as the Gold Standard immunogenicity assay for  licensure.  We will follow  the guidelines set  
out in the FDA guidance  document discussing non-inferiority immunogenicity studies.   SVN and 
NAI assays  will be evaluated using the same  methods.
Sample Size Considerations
Due to  the clinical importance  of the A/H3N2 flu strain, we will focus this  power analysis 
on the A/H3N2  strain.   Between 1976 and 2007, the  CDC estimates that on average  three times 
more people died from  influenza during A/H3N2-predominant seasons  than in  non-A/H3N2 
predominant seasons (Centers  for Disease  and Prevention, 2010). Even the current A/H1N1 
strain, which has circulated since  2009 as the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 strain,  is a less important

16cause of morbidity and mortality in the  elderly attributed to sustained pre-existing cross-reactive  
antibody titers to older strains that offer some protection (Hancock et al., 2009).
         We used the criteria and  comparisons proposed by [CONTACT_531850] a  non-inferiority 
immunogenicity trial  (FDA,  2007).  They focus on changes  in influenza antibody titers  (our  
primary endpoint).  The  study should be adequately powered to  assess the co-primary endpoints 
for HAI antibodies 1) post-vaccination  geometric  mean titer (GMT), and 2) seroconversion  rates.  
Seroconversion is a 4-fold rise in GMT pre- to post-vaccination as long as pre-titer at  least  1:10 
and in pre-titer <1:[ADDRESS_690444] achieve >1:40.
To demonstrate non-inferiority  in such a study: 
• The upper bound of the  two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of the GMTs
 (GMT  HD vaccine/GMT  Fluad) should not exceed  1.5.  
• The upper bound of the  two-sided 95% CI on the difference between the seroconversion rates 
 (Seroconversion HD vaccine – Seroconversion Fluad) should not exceed 10%. 
This power calculation will address  both of those primary  endpoints.  No trials directly  
compare adjuvanted flu vaccine  (Fluad) to HD flu vaccine or give  sufficient detail in  the same 
vaccination season  to allow use of exactly the same  flu strains.   As a result, we must  use the 
GMT and seroconversion  data from two large trials each over  3500 subjects  that compared Fluad 
or HD  to the SD vaccine and that reported both GMT and seroconversion  data (Falsey et al., 
2009; Frey et al., 2014). Calculations were performed in  R using  the TrialSize package and  
power simulations were performed to confirm  the results. The numbers below are the per-group 
sample sizes required for  80% power. 
Titer Seroconversion

H1N1 24 23
H3N2 243 144
B strain 571 168
To power the A/H3N2-specific  analysis, we  require [ADDRESS_690445] non-inferiority in  A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 with 
80% power. Assuming  our observed  titers are similar to those from  published studies, this 
sample size  will be sufficient to demonstrate  superiority of Fluad  in A/H1N1. In order to achieve 
this sample  size, we will overenroll by 15%.  This degree of over  enrollment  is informed  by [CONTACT_531851]’  expectation, willingness, and  ability to  have  the three 
blood draws obtained.
For the FLUBLOK pi[INVESTIGATOR_531828] a power

Participant Enrollment  and Follow-Up
Version 
[ADDRESS_690446] a high likelihood  of 
still being a LTC resident present in the  same facility  for the  second  blood  draw.  This  will be an 
important criterion for inclusion into the  study.    This is generally the case with  LTC residents 
because length  of stay is  on the time scale of months to years rather than days to weeks.
Analysis Plan
The FDA guidelines  (listed above)  for demonstrating non-inferiority  for a seasonal flu 
vaccine dictate the  analysis of the co-primary  endpoints.  The ratio of the geometric mean  titers 
will be assessed using tests  of means on the log-transformed titers.  The upper  limit  of the 95% CI 
of the difference (HD  – Fluad) in the mean  log titer  will be compared to log(1.5). The difference 
in the seroconversion  rates will be assessed  with a two-sample proportion test. The upper limit of 
the 95% CI of the difference (HD – Fluad) in the seroconversion rates will be compared  to 0.1. 
These analyses will be  performed on HAI titers of all three strains  obtained from studies of  pre- 
and post vaccination serum.
    For practical recruitment purposes we have to run the study over  2 years to  recruit 
sufficient numbers of the  full cohort  for A/H3N2 analysis based  on the sample size calculation.  
At the conclusion of our  study, we can  summarize  the A/H3N2 HAI titers and seroconversion  for 
each year separately; but our non-inferiority  hypothesis is powered based on combining the years 
to include the  total enrolment  for the A/H3N2 analysis.  Since we will recruit  enough  subjects  
each year due to small number  of subjects needed to power the A/H1N1 analysis,  we will 
perform and report separate analysis for  each year  studied  as well as combining the data.  For the  
B strain we  are underpowered  and will combine the  two years for this  exploratory result.
We will perform analyses on the other assays (NAI and SVN) on samples obtained at 
pre- and post- vaccination from all [ADDRESS_690447]-season 
blood draw for  Aim 1 as  a secondary analysis  for differences in the ability of titers to hold in  one 
vaccine vs. the  other for the length of the season.  We will also run the NAI on the A/H3N2 only  
(for feasibility to keep assay number  reasonable) on the  post-season  sample  to assess if  there are  
differences in maintaining  anti-NA titers between the two vaccines.  Any statistical tests 
performed for  these assays are not powered to detect  superiority or non-inferiority while 
preserving our study-wise error rate  and will be considered exploratory in  nature.
Blood draws  will be  analyzed for humoral  and cell  mediated immune assays to  determine flu-
specific cells  and antibody  titers and immune status.  Cells may be analyzed by [CONTACT_531852].  We will not be  
making any DNA or doing  any DNA gene analysis.  No identifiable raw RNAseq files will be 
released that could be transcribed back to DNA for gene  analysis purposes.
Analysis of  FLUBLOK will be performed using the HAI and SVN assays as above and 
compared to  the adjuvanted and  high dose vaccines.  NAI assays will not be used for this vaccine  
as it does not contain HA.  If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_531830]-inferiority studies we  will 
also use Mann-U non-parametric  tests to study differences  in the mean responses between the 
vaccine groups.

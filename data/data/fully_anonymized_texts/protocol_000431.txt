 Background:  
As of April 3, 2020, COVID -19 has been confirmed in over 1 million people worldw ide, 
with an estimated symptomatic case fatality ratio of around 1.4%.1,[ADDRESS_475400] commonly presents with flu -like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe 
hyperinflammatory phase marked by [CONTACT_171958][INVESTIGATOR_1506] s yndrome (ARDS) and 
hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].3,4 Though there is spectrum of clinical course, many progress to 
the hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms, often requiring intensive care unit 
(ICU) level care and mechanical ventilation.4 Accumulating evidence suggests that the 
pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_379908] 
(CRS)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).3 CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory 
syndrome on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), typi[INVESTIGATOR_379885], typi[INVESTIGATOR_379886].[ADDRESS_475401] demonstrated pathologic f indings consistent with MAS such as 
mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and alveolar 
congestion, splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis, as well as a 
lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate i nfiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying liver necrosis 
and sinusoidal congestion.6 Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH overlaps with that 
seen in patients with  severe COVID -19 and includes elevated levels of IL -1, IL -2, IL -7, IL -6, G-
CSF, MCP - 1, and TNF -α as well as elevated D -dimer, C -reactive protein, LDH and 
troponins.5,7,8 Moreover, preliminary data from a non -randomized series of COVID -19 patients 
with “severe or critical COVID -19” from China who were treated with tocilizumab (in addition 
to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) showed they h ad dramatic improvement in fever, arterial oxygen saturation 
and inflammatory markers within the first [ADDRESS_475402] studying the role of 
immunomodulatory therapy in cluding modulation of IL -1 and IL -6 and downstream pathways in 
the setting of CAR -T induced MAS ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and agents such anakinra 
and tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles. 
There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy in 
COVID -19 disease to both halt disease p rogression in patients at an individual level and prevent 
the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level, to which end there are 
numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of COVID -19 
infection (ChiCTR2000029765, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], TOCOVID -19). Based on the MGH experience 
thus far with COVID -19, including more than 200 patients to  date, the need for mechanical 
ventilation has been approximately 30%. With the upcoming surge anticipated between April 
17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU beds. We propose a trial of IL -6 
Version 4: August  18, 2020

 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease course to try to prevent progression of 
COVID -19. 
 
Hypothesis:  Early intervention with immunomodulatory therapy targeting the IL -6 axis for 
COVID -19 associated cytokine -release syndrome (CRS)/macrophage -activation syndrome 
(MAS) can limit progression of hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_379887], 
mech anical ventilation and improve mortality.  
 
Aim 1:  To determine if IL -6 blockade can prevent progression of COVID -19 when given early in 
the disease process.  
 
Aim 2:  To understand the biomarkers associated with progression of COVID -19 and with 
improvement of illness.  
 
Intervention : Subjects  will receive the standard treatment for COVID -19 per MGH guidance and 
be randomized (2:1) to one of the following arms:  
1. Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg x 1, to a maximum dose of 800 mg (n=1 85)

Endpoints and Statistical Analysis Plan:  
The following analysis samples are defined for safety and efficacy analysis:  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Sample : Subjects  who are randomized regardless of treatment adherence or 
availability of follow -up data will be included in the intention -to-treat analysis set (ITT). All 
analyses of the ITT will be based on each subject’s randomized treatment  assignment.  
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Sample : Randomized subjects who receive any amount of the 
study drug  before intubation or death.  
• Per-Protocol (PP) Sample : Randomized subjects who receive the full dose of the study drug before 
intubation or death. Patients who do not recei ve the full dose of the study drug will be excluded 
from the PP population. Subjects who had a major protocol deviation that may impact the validity 
of the efficacy analysis are excluded from the PP population  
• Safety  Sample : Randomized subjects who receive  any amount of the study drug. Safety analyses 
will be based on the medication that was actually dispensed to each subject.  
 
The primary analysis for this trial will be the analysis of the mITT population.   
 
A final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is included with this amendment. All data collected 
within the trial will be summarized by [CONTACT_379911], graphs, or raw data listings. Descripti ve statistics for continuous 
variables will include the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third 
quartiles, minimum and maximum values for the observed value, and change from baseline. 
Analyses of categorical variables will inc lude calculations of frequencies and percentages.  
 
ENDPOINTS  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint  is the time from administration of the investigational agent (or placebo) to requiring 
mechanical ventilation and intubation, or death for subjects who die  prior to intubation.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints  are: 
1. Time from administration of the investigational medication (or placebo) to at least one point  
worsening on the clinical improvement scale (Table 2) for subjects requiring supplemental oxygen

The proportion of adverse events graded by [CONTACT_3989] v5.0 will be evaluated.  
Recruitment Procedures:   
 
Upon admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study team will determine if the patient meets the eligibility 
requirements of the study by [CONTACT_338224]. The study team will ensure that the 
patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria  
 
If the patien t is eligible and expresses interest, a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_379913]. If the primary team agrees to allow the study 
team to approach the patient, a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_379914]. The 
member of the study team will reinforce with the patient that he or she does not have to 
participate and the decision not to participate w ill not affect his or her care at any time. The 
patient will be told that should he or she choose to participate, he or she may contact [CONTACT_379915]. If the patient expresses interest, the primary care team will be sent an 
electro nic version of the consent form, which the team will then send to the patient. The patient 
will be given sufficient time to decide if he or she want to participate in the study. The patient 
will be encouraged to speak with their other doctors or family mem bers about this study. After 
an appropriate interval of time, the study team will then call the patient back to ascertain the 
patient’s final decision whether to participate in the study. A healthcare worker not associated 
with the study will also join the  telephone final consent call to serve as an additional witness. A 
copy of the signed consent will be given to the patient.  
The study team will follow the PHRC policy on Recruitment of Research Subjects and the 
Partners IRB’s guidance with regard to Conse nting in COVID Research that is More than 
Minimal Risk. No identifiable information will be stored during the pre -screening process except 
for subjects  who are expected to consent to the study. All records of identifiable information will 
be destroyed if subjects  do not consent to the study.  
Consent Procedures:  
Subjects may be recruited in the in -patient setting. If the patient is eligible and expresses interest, 
a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_379916]. 
For subjects,  enrolled inpatient where the study team is unable to obtain a signed consent form 
due COVID -[ADDRESS_475408] with attestation and signature [CONTACT_379935].  
In patient consenting: Subjects  
1. Consent form provided via email or other electronic means but does not include ability to 
sign electronically. When sent by [CONTACT_6968] a copy of the email should be retained in the 
Version 4: August  18, [ADDRESS_475409] phone conversation /virtual visit  with person consenting and the 
witness.  
3. Patient signs the hard copy consent and it is retained in the room. If it is not possib le for 
the patient to physically sign, the patient provides verbal agreement to participate.  
In patient consenting: Study Investigators  
1. Conducts consent process via [ADDRESS_475410], the primary care team will be sent an electronic version of the 
consent form, which the team will then send to the patient.  
2. Prints and signs paper consent document as person obtaining consent   
3. Completes *COVID -19 Attestation/Witness Form noting either the subject signed a 
separate copy of the consent that was retained in the isolation room, or that the subject 
consented verbally and the reason preventing subject signature [CONTACT_379936].  
4. Documents in a note to file or in a COVID -[ADDRESS_475411] that the 
consent form was provided to the participant, consent was obtained, the method used to 
obtain consent, date/time, and witness name.  
5. The *COVID -19 Attestation/Witness Form is stored with t he signed consent form in the 
study record and a copy of the consent form is uploaded to EPIC.  
The patient will be given sufficient time to decide if he or she want to participate in the study. 
The patient will be encouraged to speak with their other docto rs or family members about this 
study. After an appropriate interval of time, the study team will then call the patient back to 
ascertain the patient’s final decision whether or not to participate in the study. A healthcare 
worker not associated with the s tudy will also join the telephone final consent call to serve as an 
additional witness. Both the unassociated healthcare worker and the study investigator will sign 
the consent and that consent will be stored. A copy of the signed consent will be given to the 
patient.  
Consent to participate in the study will be obtained from subjects  themselves whenever possible; 
the use of surrogates for decision -making purposes will be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 
If a surrogate is required to provide consent for  a patient, the same consent process described in 
the previous section will be utilized. The PHRC preferred order of surrogates will be followed, 
and the study team will document the relationship of the surrogate to the patient in the research 
Version 4: August  18, [ADDRESS_475412] positive for LTBI 
prior to proceeding with any research activity. Moreover, if a patient is unable to provide 
informed consent due to their medical condition, then the patient’s legally authorized 
representative will be provided with this Consent Addendum and may provide verbal consent on 
behalf of the subject.  Verbal consent will be obtained.

randomization to each patient for  the infusion. The TCZ vials need to be stored at a 
temperature of 2ºC –8ºC.  
• The infusion bag of TCZ should be made up using standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379892].  
• The infusion bag must be made of one of the following materials: Polypropylene,  
Polyethylene or  Polyvinyl chloride.  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 14 of 35 
 • The infusion bag of study medication (after it has been prepared using 0.9% saline) may be 
stored at 2 - 8°C or at room temperature for 24 hours providing that the infusion is prepared 
aseptically and should be protected from light. Be fore administration, allow the infusion bag 
of study medication to return to room temperature over 1 to 2 hours depending on ambient 
room temperatures.  
• TCZ will be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_218447] a peripheral vein 
over a 1 -hour period. In exceptional cases, this time may be extended to up to 6 hours.  A 
central line is acceptable but please do not mix with other drugs.  
• Please refer to protocol section for the management of potential hypersensitivity reaction 
(including anaphylaxis). If a patient has symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions/ 
anaphylaxis, or requires an interruption of the study drug because of symptoms of 
hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis, administration of TCZ must be discontinued 
immediately  
TRAINING AND MONITORING OF SITES  
Training of Site Investigators and Staff for the Study Protocol  
1. Site training will be done  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. John Stone and the core administrative staff  on Zoom. 
Training will cover  the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: Introduction to the Study, St udy Protocol, Study 
Recruitment and Consent, Study Drugs, the EDC, Labs, Monitoring and Reporting, and 
Abnormal Situations. Study coordinators must attend  protocol training . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_379893], recruitment, inclusion/exclu sion criteria, and EDC 
training.  Sites will also receive additional individualized support while enrolling their 
first participants in the form of frequent phone calls from Central staff as well as the 
opportunity to complete the first visits while centra l staff are on the phone to answer any 
questions. DCC staff will also be available for personal site training on the EDC as 
needed and to answer questions as they arise.  
• The investigators and all staff involved in the study will have completed their requir ed 
Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI). Each study staff member will be trained in the 
protocol and specific procedures for each study visit by [CONTACT_30967]. New study 
staff members will be trained on the protocol and, if necessary, spe nd a visit shadowing 
another trained staff member before carrying out protocol tasks on their own.    Prior to 
conducting subject visits, investigators will be asked to sign off that the site staff members 
have been appropriately trained in the study proto col.  
• Training and delegation of responsibility will be documented in the Delegation of 
Responsibility Log and tracked via the trial website (where the training modules will be 
posted).  
Training for Electronic Data Capture  
One of the key training modules will focus on use of the EDC.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_58367]:  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 15 of 35 
 • Appropriate use of credentials to log -in  
• EDC security  
• Navigating the EDC  
• Recording information on the eCRFs  
• Screening  
• Enrollment and Baseline  
• Randomization  
• Concomitant Medication  
• Follow -up Visits  
• Source documentation  
• Submitting adverse event reports  
• Revising data and audit trails  
• Additional one -on-one training will be provided to sites on an as -needed basis, as well as 
guidance for each site to get registered on the EDC.  
Monitoring of Site s 
• Monitoring will occur throughout the study period. Internal reports will be generated 
regularly to identify missed visits, missing data, and other data clarifications.  Additionally, 
queries report will be generated by [CONTACT_379917]. Core staff will periodically request that a site provide 
additional documentation and regulatory files. This documentation will be mailed, or faxed 
by [CONTACT_379918].  
• Tran sitional Medicine group will oversee data monitoring.  
• The DCC will be able to track a site’s progress via the EDC. Should a site consistently 
deviate from the protocol or not perform to a sufficient level, the DCC will recommend 
intervention by [CONTACT_370999].  The Administrative Core will investigat e the source 
of the deviations, and will provide additional training or coaching as needed, as well as 
decide to drop an enrollment site if necessary.   
Clinical Sites  
Use of the EDC will enable frequent monitoring of study sites to ensure protocol adherence. The 
DCC will have immediate access to all data that is entered on the EDC, and will be alerted to any 
issues, including the ones listed below:  
• Non-compliance with protocol  
• Missing data  
• Out-of-range data  
• Out-of-window visits  
Power Calculation and  Statistical Considerations:  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 16 of 35 
 A full SAP is included with this amendment. All study -collected data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_379919], graphs, and/or 
raw data listings. Descriptive stat istics for continuous variables will include the number of 
subjects , mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum 
values for the observed value, and change from baseline. Analysis of categorical variables will 
include frequency and percentage.  
The baseline value is defined as the last measurement collected prior to the administration of study 
drug, unless otherwise specified.  
The primary endpoint is the rate of requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation. The control 
group is assumed to have a 30% chance of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation by 28 days, 
which corresponds to a 70% chance of not requiring mechanical ventilation. Our assumption is 
that the investigational treatment tocilizumab will increa se the likelihood that a patient will not 
require mechanical ventilation to 85%. At the outset, the target enrollment was 278 patients to 
achieve 85% power. However, the enrollment rate significantly slowed as the pandemic surge 
waned in the [LOCATION_011] area, a nd in early June the decision was made to reduce the target enrollment 
to 243 (80% power).  With a total of 243 subjects ([ADDRESS_475414] care), we will have 80% power to demonstrate such a difference, assuming two -sided 
tests and an alpha of 0.05.  
An interim analysis was to be performed when approximately 50% of the subjects had enrolled or 
approximately 40% of subjects had completed Day 28 or withdrawn prior to Day 28. Both efficacy 
and futility of the study were t o be assessed at the time of the interim analysis. However, due to 
the rapid study initiation and enrollment, two thirds of the target N had already been enrolled and 
more than 50% of the subjects had already completed the [ADDRESS_475415] 180 patients enrolled.  
 
Risks and Discomforts  
 
Risks Associated with TCZ Use  
 
• Infection.  Subjects  treated with TCZ are at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_379894], including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial, invasive 
fungal, viral, or other opportunistic infections. The overall safety profile of TCZ in GCA  
subjects  (defined in the GiACTA trial) was comparable to the one observed in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) subjects , except that there was an overall higher incidence of infections in GCA 
subjects  relative to RA subjects . The rate of infections was 200.2 per 100 patient -years in the 
TCZ QW group and 160.2 per 100 patient -years in the TCZ Q2W group, as compared to 156.0 
per 100 patient -years in the PBO+26 and 210.2 per 100 patient -years in the PBO+52 
groups.  The rate of serious infections was 9.7 per 100 patien t-years in the TCZ QW group and 
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 17 of 35 
 4.4 per 100 patient -years in the TCZ Q2W group, as compared to 4.2 per 100 patient -years in 
the PBO+26 and 12.5 per 100 patient -years in the PBO+52 groups.  
 
• Hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been 
reported in association with TCZ and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been 
reported with intravenous (IV) infusion of TCZ. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity 
reactions that requi red treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of 
subjects  in the 6 -month controlled trials of IV TCZ, 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of subjects  in the IV 
all-exposure RA population, 0.7% (8 out of 1068) in the SC 6 -month controlled RA trials, and 
in 0.7% (10 out of 1465) of subjects  in the SC all -exposure population. In the systemic juvenile 
inflammatory arthritis (JIA) controlled trial with IV T CZ, 1 out of 112 subjects  (0.9%) 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the 
polyarticular JIA controlled trial with IV TCZ, 0 out of 188 subjects  (0%) in the TCZ all -
exposure population experienced hypersensitivi ty reactions that required treatment 
discontinuation.  
• Neutropenia . Decreases in neutrophil counts have been observed following treatment with 
TCZ.  
• Thrombocytopenia . Decreases in platelet counts have been observed following treatment 
with TCZ.  
• Elevated liv er enzymes . Transaminase elevations have been observed following treatment 
with TCZ. These elevations did not result in apparent permanent or clinically evident hepatic 
injury in clinical trials.  
 
• Lipid abnormalities . Increases in lipid parameters such as  total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
LDL cholesterols, and/or HDL cholesterol has been observed following treatment with TCZ.  
• Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations.  Events of GI perforation have been reported in clinical 
trials, primarily as complications of di verticulitis in RA subjects . No GI perforations were 
reported in GCA clinical trials.  
• Immunosuppression and potential risk of malignancy.  Although no imbalance of 
malignancies was observed in controlled clinical trials of TCZ, malignancies have been 
identified as a concern for other immunosuppressive agents.  
• Demyelinating disorders. The impact of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating disorder s is 
not known, but multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
were reported rarely in clinical studies.  
• Live vaccines.  Vaccination with live vaccines may lead to infection in subjects  under 
immunosuppressive therapy including  TCZ.  
• Pregnancy.  The limited available data with TCZ in pregnant women are not sufficient to 
determine whether there is a drug -associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.  
• co

Risks of Blood Draw  
 
The total blood draw volume for the study (assuming that  a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] 28 days) is 
171 ml (36 teaspoons) .  This total volume of blood will be drawn over 28 days at the following 
intervals:  baseline, and then on days 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28.  If patients are discharged before [ADDRESS_475416] blood drawn for any visits after leaving the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  An additional 10 mL (2 
teaspoons) will be collected at baseline amount for subjects undergoing LTBI testing. Attached 
appendix C for collection timetable.  
 
SAFETY REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
ASSES SMENT OF SAFETY  
Specification of Safety Variables  
• Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious  
adverse events (SAEs) per protocol. This includes all events of death, and any study specific  
issue of concern.  
Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),  
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product  
(IMP) or other protocol -imposed intervention, regardles s of attribution.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with COVID -19  that were not 
present prior to the AE reporting p eriod.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations)  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatmen t run-in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655] -specified AE reporti ng period.  
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if any of the following criteria are met:  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 19 of 35 
 • It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the IMP.  
• It is considered a signific ant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] 
(e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above).  
METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES  
• The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and 
Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs and SAEs as described in section J where the patient has 
been exposed to Genentech product must be reported Reporting period begins after informed 
consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment and  ends [ADDRESS_475417] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. 
After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment (Modify statement depending  up on section g).  
Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_168204], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the Toclizumab 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE  causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the 
Toclizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s cli nical state, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the 
Toclizumab or with similar treatments; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of 
the Toclizumab or dose reduction and, if a pplicable, reappears upon re - challenge.  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 20 of 35 
 No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the Toclizumab (e.g., preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has 
no plausible tem poral relationship to Toclizumab  administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_475418] dose of study drug).  
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package 
Insert (P.I) or current Investigator Brochure (I.B).  
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the P.I or current I.B or not identified. This 
includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description 
in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under this definit ion, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
For subjects  receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each 
protocol -mandated therapy.  
PROCEDURES FOR ELI CITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should be 
adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last cli nical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a.   Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixi s, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report 
the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be 
reported as follow -up information.  
b.   Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section I), 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parti es. When recording a death, the 
event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single 
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 21 of 35 
 medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, report “Unexplained De ath”.  
c.   Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be re -
assessed throughout  the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_379920] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
d.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210821]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379895] u ndergo a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13587], record the heart co ndition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15429]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13589]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379896]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13591]  
e.   Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity  grading scale for the NCI CTCAE v 5.0 Update current versions) will 
be used for assessing adverse event severity. Below Table should be used for assessing severity 
for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

a. Instrum ental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the to ilet, 
and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_379921].  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event  
d. Grade [ADDRESS_475419] dose of study drug, a 
report should be completed and expeditiously submitted to Genentech, Inc. Follow -up to obtain 
the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or 
spontaneous, sho uld always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. 
Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the 
study drug should be reported as an SAE.  
g.   Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior Toclizumab exposure. If the investigator 
should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenita l anomaly in a subsequently 
conceived offspring of a female subject [add if applicable -including pregnancy occurring in the 
partner of a male study subject] who participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE 
adequately to Genentech drug Safet y during follow up period  
h.  Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports  
The Sponsor agrees to conduct the Case Transmission verification to ensure that all single case 
reports have been adequately received by [CONTACT_379922] G enentech a 
Quarterly line -listing documenting single case reports sent by [CONTACT_379923].  
Version 4: August  18, 2020   
Page 23 of 35 
 The periodic line -listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of the 
agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be received within the time period mutually 
agreed upon.      
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the 
discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case -by-
case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive reconciliation guidance 
documents within the ‘Activation Package’.

At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification report will be sent to 
Genentech  
i.   AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
AESIs a re a subset of Events to Monitor (EtMs) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
product, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_379925]. Such an event might require further investigation in ord er to characterize 
and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_379926] (e.g., Regulatory Authorities) may also be warranted.  
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the follow ing: 
• Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s law:

o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with clinical jaundice  
• Data related to a suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] (STIAMP), 
as defined below:  
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  A 
transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory 
findings that indicate an infection  in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies 
only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected  
The Tocilizumab Events  of Special Interest are:  
• Serious and/or medically significant infections

 Appendix B: Latent Tuberculosis Risk Assessment during the collection of informed consent  
Given the risk of tuberculosis infection in the setting of immunomodulation, the following guidance is 
made for evaluation of latent and active tuberculosis:  
Scenario 1:  
1. History : Active tuberculosis highly suspected or diagnosed1. 
2. Testing : Positive microbiology data or concerning radiography including unexplained cavitary 
disease supporting active tuberculosis infe ction.  
3. Decision :  
o Patient is not eligible for tocilizumab trial.  
Scenario 2:  
1. History : Patient origin from a highly endemic part of the world.  Low risk for active TB by 
[CONTACT_969]1. 
2. Testing : None available, no IGRA or testing documented in chart.  
3. Decision :  
o Patient to be screened for tuberculosis ideally with IGRA (T -spot or Quantiferon) if not 
available, use TST2 
o Ideally, this testing will be sent before the patient receives the investigational treatment, 
but treatment with tocilizumab or placebo can proceed  while the results of IGRA testing 
are pending  
o Proceed with enrollment in tocilizumab trial  
o If LTBI testing is positive, the patient will be evaluated for the start of possible treatment 
for LTBI if that is appropriate in the context of his overall clinical situation. If the clinical 
situation is not amenable to starting LTBI treatment or if the start of treatment can be 
reasonably deferred, then the start of LTBI treatment may be deferred until the outpatient 
setting. Consultation from the Infectiou s Diseases service will be obtained as needed. If 
treatment is deferred until discharge, the need for the initiation of LTBI will be conveyed 
to the subject’s outpatient physician  at the time of discharge . 
Scenario 3:  
1. History : Patient origin from a highly  endemic part of the world.  Low risk for active TB by 
[CONTACT_969]1. 
2. Testing : Positive IGRA or testing documented in chart, no treatment documented  
3. Decision :  
o Proceed with enrollment in tocilizumab trial  
o The patient will be evaluated for the start of possible treatment for LTBI if that is 
appropriate in the context of his overall clinical situation. If the clinical situation is not 
amenable to starting LTBI treatment or if the start of treatment can be reasonably 
deferred, then the start of LTBI treatment may b e deferred until the outpatient setting. 
Consultation from the Infectious Diseases service will be obtained as needed. If treatment 
is deferred until discharge, the need for the initiation of LTBI will be conveyed to the 
subject’s outpatient physician  at the time of discharge . 
Scenario 4:  
1. History : Patient origin from a highly endemic part of the world.  Low risk for active TB by 
[CONTACT_969]1. 
2. Testing : Positive LTBI testing documented in chart, has completed treatment for LTBI  
3. Decision :  
o Proceed with enrollment in tocilizumab trial.

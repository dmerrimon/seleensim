2.1 Study Rational e 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major complication  occurring in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67477] s. 
Although anticoagulants and mechanical prophylaxis are commonly used to prevent VTE it 
remains a leading cause of complications and death in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63840]. Anticoagulation has been demonstrated to reduce the rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303623], but also has increased rates of bleeding complications. Mechanical prophyl axis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_303624]. However, existing methods of mechanical thromboprophylaxis have some limitations including equivocal efficacy and subject  discomfort, 
which may undermine adherence .  The new Osc iPulse  device was designed based on recent 
advancements in our understanding of the molecular basis of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) 
formation to improve the efficacy of mechanical devices in preventing DVT/VTE. The objective of this study is to evaluate device design with respect to initial clinical safety and device functionality.  
2.2 Background and Relevant Literature  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disease with over [ADDRESS_371262] VTE events are 6% at 30 days and 21% at [ADDRESS_371263]-thrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Approximately 50% of VTE cases are attributable to current or preceding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], while 12% and 7% are associated with trauma and neurological disease with extremity paresis, respectively
3. Immobilization and lower- limb paralysis are 
independent risk factors for VTE in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67477] s4. Thes e well -recognized risks establish 
the need for effective VTE prevention in high-risk populations. If administered appropriately, a significant number of VTE cases will be preventable by [CONTACT_303633].   
Thromboprophylaxis strategies can be categorized into pharmacological (with anticoagulants) 
and mechanical (with gradual compression stockings [GCS] or intermittent pneumatic compression [IPC] devices). Current clinical practice guidelines suggest using pharmacological thromboprophylaxis over mechanical  thromboprophylaxis, and they are often used in 
conjunction with each other 
5,6. However, many subject s are not suitable candidates for 
anticoagulants because of contraindications such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia. In suc h cases, 
mechanical thromboprophylaxis provides the only prophylactic option. In suitable acutely ill medical subject s who do not receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the American Society 
of Hematology VTE guideline suggests mechanical prophylaxis over no prophylaxis. One of the advantages of mechanical prophylaxis is its favorable safety profile. Although possible, the risk of serious harmful effects associated with the currently available options for mechanical thromboprophylaxis, such as limb ischemia or skin ulceration, are exceedingly rare.  
The benefit of mechanical prophylaxis, however, remains controversial. In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of stroke subject s
7, mechanical prophylaxis ( GCS and 
IPC) did not show a significant reduction in VTE or death. In another large RCT in stroke

removed from the study and further testing or treatment will be at the discretion of the clinical team.  
Direct benefits to the participating subjects include the potential benefit of VT E prevention by 
[CONTACT_303634] t hromboprophylaxis. Indirect benefits include collecting more clinical data in terms 
of safety and tolerability to assist the development of better devices for VTE prevention in the 
future.

4.2.1  Screening and Enrollment  Phase 
Part 1: Subjects who are recruited from the general population will be screened for eligibility by 
[CONTACT_303635]. Subject demographics will be collected; however n o medical record review will be conducted . Written informed 
consent will be obtained from eligible subjects.  
Part 2: S ubject s who are admitted  for inpatient care following admission to Penn  Presby[CONTACT_303636]. Written informed consent will be 
obtained from eligible subjects  by [CONTACT_303637]. Video consent 
may be used.  
4.2.2  Study Intervention Phase  
Part 1: Enrolled healthy subjects will have the OsciPulse  device applied by [CONTACT_303638] . The subject will wear the device for a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_371266] will receive 
an ultrasound scan of the deep venous system of the thigh/groin region to measure hemodynamics at a venous valve during immobility and during use of the OsciPulse  device. 
Finally, the subject will participate in a questionnaire evaluation of their comfort and experience with the OsciPulse  device.  Participant s will be compensated at $50/ hour for their participation. 
Part 2: After informed consent is obtained, baseline demographic and clinical data will be 
collected. The subject s will be randomized with equal allocation to either of the two treatment 
sequence groups:  
• Group A ( OsciPulse  device then standard IPC device)  
• Group B (standard IPC device then OsciPulse  device)  
For group A, the OsciPulse device will be applied  to the subject  on both legs in the first [ADDRESS_371267] if the device was removed during the testing 
period.. During the 3-hour period the study team will monitor for adverse events and a hemodynamic ultrasonography may be performed  (when  feasible)  following the Ultrasound 
SOP. After [ADDRESS_371268] s will 
undergo the same procedure for compliance monitoring, adverse event monitoring, hemodynamic ultrasonography ( when  feasible) , and questionnaire evaluation.  
For group B, the same procedure will be performed but with the standard IPC in the first 3 hours and the OsciPulse  device in the next 3 hours.  
Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_371269] completed the study if he or she has completed the

4.4 Allocation to Interventional Group  
All enrolled subjects will be assigned to both interventions.  will allocate the treatment 
sequence groups (group A: OsciPulse then IPC and group B: IPC then OsciPulse) in a 1:[ADDRESS_371270] compensation, and a randomization form for either group A or for group B. This group of 4 envelopes will maintain the 1:[ADDRESS_371271] the envelope with corresponding study-ID number—this will serve as the patient randomization. This process will be repeated 4 
additional times in order to provide randomization for subjects 5 – 20. Once the envelope has been selected, the study team member will open the envelope, deliver the GreenPhire card to the subject and record the subject’s intervention group onto a spreadsheet.  The randomization sequence spreadsheet, randomization assignment sheet, and envelope will be kept and maintained a , which will be secure and accessible only by  [CONTACT_303639].   
4.5 P rotocol -defined Enrollment Hold 
Part 2: In the event a disproportionate number of subjects are enrolled with a singular diagnosis, 
the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor may pause the study to enrollment to reevaluate 
or revise, or both, the enr ollment strategy, the intended subject population, the statistical 
analysis, or several of these activities.

10 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect  (AE/ADE)  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
intensity or the character of the condition changes. A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any of the following conditions is met: 
● Is not otherw ise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
● Suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
● Is of a degree that requires active management

 Protocol V6.0 (1 Jun 2022)  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_371278] (UADE)  
Unanticipated adverse device effect  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
10.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that , 
in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, is:  
● fatal 
● life-threatening  
● requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
● results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
● a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
● an important medical event  
● require intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355]. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_371279]  (AESI)  
Newly developed DVT , pulmonary embolism, peripheral nerve palsy, skin ulceration NPUAP 
category III and IV, limb ischemia due to OsciPulse  or IPC device are adverse events of special 
interest .  These events may be related to use of the OsciPulse device and any incidence of these 
events should be reported to the sponsor.  10.[ADDRESS_371280]’s participation in the study for the presence of adverse events by [CONTACT_299204]. The subject  will be questioned about adverse events during 
the 6-hour Interventional Phase of the study.. Information on all adverse events will be recorded in a timely manner in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF) in PennCTMS.   
While in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the  team will assess for the development of adverse events by [CONTACT_303645]. The development of adverse 
events will be reported to the principal investigator [CONTACT_49114]. After discussions with the clinical team it will classify these events as definitely related, pr obably related, possibly related, unlikely or 
unrelated to the OsciPulse  device or study procedures.  Serious adverse event s (SAE), will be 
reported to the principal investigator (PI) by [CONTACT_16470] 12 hours of the event . The 
SAE CRF will be completed  within 24 hours and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_303626].

All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded. The clinical course of 
each adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study p eriod and is considered to be possibly related to 
the study intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
10.2.1  Severity of Event  
The following guidelines will be used to describe severity. 
• Grade 1 (Mild): Awareness of symptoms t hat are easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate): Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity.  
• Grade 3 (Severe): Extreme distress, causing significant im pairment of functioning or 
incapacitation. Prevents normal everyday activities.  
• Grade 4: Life threatening or disabling adverse event.  
• Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event.  
10.2.2  Relationship of AE to Study  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to the study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be considered. 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (de-challenge) should be clinically plausib le. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically 
definitive, with use of a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reas onable response on withdrawal (de-challenge). Re- challenge information is 
not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medical device). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related”

soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be 
upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the OsciPulse device) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments). 
• Unrelated – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternati ve, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370]. 
10.[ADDRESS_371281] conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible .  
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial report includes: 
● Study identifier  
● Subject number 
● A description of the event 
● Duration (start and end dates)  
● Expectedness  
● Action taken  ● Severity Grade  
● Relationship to study treatment or process 
● Current status 
● Whether study intervention was discontinued 
● Whether the event is serious and the reason why the event is classified as serious  
● Investigator assessment of the association  
between the event and study intervention  
Additionally, all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device effects and subject complaints) will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal polic ies.  
Reporting Period: Adverse events will be reported from the time of informed consent until study completion  at [ADDRESS_371282] (IRB) . The study sponsor is responsible for conducting an 
evaluation of the event and shall report the results of such evaluation to the FDA Center for Device and Radiologic Health (CDRH)  and to all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators 
per the applicable regulation. 
10.3.1  Follow -up report  
If an S AE/UADE  has not resolved at the time of the initial report and ne w information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new 
or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted.

The investigator is responsible for e nsuring that all SAE s are followed until either resolved or 
stable.  
10.3.2  Investigator Reporting: Local Reporting Requirements   
The investigator will adhere to local regulatory reporting requirements including the IRB/EC of 
record reporting requirements as well as IRB reporting requirements per 21 CFR 812.  These 
additional reporting requirements include: failure to obtain informed consent, UADEs, device recall/repair/disposal, change in risk determination, or FDA or IRB withdrawal of the study. 
10.4 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the study Sponsor  
The following shall be reported to the Sponsor and Medical Director within 24 hours.   10.4.1  SAE and UADE  
Every SAE  and UADE  regardless of suspected causality (e.g., relationship to study product(s) or 
study procedure(s) or disease progression) must be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_371283] be reported to the Sponsor as a follow-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. A SAE considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event. 
New information regarding the SAE will be reported as it becomes available and in the same 
manner that the initial SAE (i.e. SAE form). The investigator must follow the event to resolution or until the event is deemed and documented irreversible, whichever is longer. 
10.4.[ADDRESS_371284] (see sectio n 11.3) must be reported to the Study sponsor 
within 3 business days of learning of the deviation.  Reporting shall be done using the Sponsor

be retained.  
11.3 Protocol Deviations  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_303628], in particular: 
• Who deviated from the protocol 
• What was the deviation  
• When did the deviation occur 
• How did the deviation happen 
• What is the impact of the deviation  
• A root cause analysis of why the deviation occurred  
If the assessment results in a determination that any of the following are potentially affected, the deviation would be considered of significant impact: 
• having the potential to adversely affect subject safety; OR  
• increases risks to participants; OR  
• adversely affects the integrity of the data; OR  
• violates the rights and welfare of participants, OR  
• affects the subject’s willingness to participate in research.  
• there is a potential for an overall impact on the research that should be shared with the IRB for consideration and development of next best steps to address it  
Deviations of significant impact are to be reported to the study sponsor (see section 11.3) and according to local reporting requirements.  
11.4 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
11.4.1  Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Video consent may be 
used as well, which will be signed by [CONTACT_3184] a CRC witne ssing the consent process, as 
well as the consenting physician  at the earliest convenience. Recorded full face images during 
this process will be kept on an encrypted, password protected drive in the  offices and will only be available to the study team.  Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask

questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with 
their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study-specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693].   
11.4.2  Study Discontinuation and Closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_282037] [INVESTIGATOR_303629]. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_101514]. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements 
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met 
• Determination of futility

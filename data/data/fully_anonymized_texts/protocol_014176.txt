Version: 19 February  2019        Page 12 of 124 Study Treatment 
Dosing Schedule:  Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively  as a single administration via 
“surgical site” infiltration /instillation  prior to wound closure.   
“Surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 5 cm in all directions 
(lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision and osteotomy sites and 
surrounding tissues.  
Anesthesia:  The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia supplemented by [CONTACT_806755] (AC)  block  AND an IPACK infiltration  (Interspace between the Popliteal Artery 
and the Capsule  of the posterior Knee between  the femoral condyles ).  Recent 
literature suggests the AC+IPACK approach is the new “best practice” to supplement 
anesthesia  as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for TKA ( Cullom 
2017, Sankineani  2018).  Perform the A C+IPACK local anesthetic regional blocks 
under ultrasound guidance  prior to the start of surgery .   
• Using ropi[INVESTIGATOR_806715] e (Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_84685])  
o AC block : 20 mL using 0.5% (100 mg)  
o IPACK infiltration : 20 mL using 0.2% (40 mg)  
A tourniquet will be used in all subjects. After exsanguination, but prior to  surgical 
incision , perform surgical site infiltration with Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_84685] 0.2% 30 mL ( 60 mg).   
The t otal Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_806716]  200 mg .  See Appendix M  (Section 17.12 ) for 
guidance on Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_806717].   
Dose Groups:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32734]  (3 Exploratory Cohorts) : 
• Cohort #1: total N=18 randomized 1:1 CA -008 5 mg or  placebo  (100 mL)  
• Cohort #2: total N= 18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 10 mg or  placebo  (100 mL) 
• Cohort #3: total N= 18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 15 mg or  placebo  (100 mL)  
Second Stage  (100 mL volume) : 
• CA-008 (dose groups to be determined ) 
• Placebo  
Injection of Study 
Treatment:  Prior to  hardware  placement,  100 mL of study treatment should be infiltrated/instilled 
as follows:  
1. Infiltrate 15 mL divided equally  throughout  the posterior capsule  
With the leg in full extension, perform the following ( working from top to bottom  or 
using another standardized method per surgeon discretion) : 
2. Infiltrate 1 5 mL circumferentially around the distal femur   
3. Infiltrate a total of 30 mL  divided equally  into the medial and lateral gutters  
ensuring coverage of  the periosteal borders  
4. Infiltrate 10 mL  around  the peripatellar  region  
5. Infiltrate 10 mL divided equally medial and lateral to the tibial tubercle  
Following closure of the joint capsule,

T96h as an inpatient.  Safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed and blood 
drawn and urine collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.  Subjects will be 
required to meet standard criteria for discharge to outpatient status .  Subjects will 
continue to be monitored as an outpatient after discharge through D29/W4 for various

4), however rescue may be requested at any time and medication will be provided 
when requested.  
Analgesia during the 
Outpatient Period:  
 Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take 
a combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics  at an appropriate dose per medical 
judgment to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
If a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 12h prior to discharge from the 
inpatient unit (i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is delayed) , then 
prescribe no more than 9 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg (1 PO tid prn) per investigator 
discretion for the initial outpatient period . 
Document the number of tablets prescribed and also document any additional 
prescriptions required if the subj ect’s pain continues to be an issue requiring additional 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_806719].  
If needed for pain management, the following oral OTC analgesics will be 
recommended for subjects to self -administer (note that these medications will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_13099] r):  
• A nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) (e.g., ibuprofen 200 mg prn 
up to qid [Advil® or Motrin®] or naproxen 220 mg prn up to tid [Aleve®]) or 
other NSAID per investigator discretion and  
• Acetaminophen 1000  mg prn up to tid or 650 mg up to qid (3g daily maximum 
limit)  
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during the outpatient period may suggest the need 
for an unscheduled in -person visit to assess the surgical site.  If such a situation occurs, 
the Investig ator should use clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but to 
capture this event as an adverse event (AE) and document any required treatments.

Efficacy Parameter 
Assessment Times:  1. NRS scores will be assessed as follows:  
• During the inpatient stay, NRS at rest beginning with the PACU admission 
may be assessed once the subject is awake.  If the subject is able to  provide 
responses, obtain NRS scores at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and every 4 
hours (if awake at time of assessment) until discharge from the inpatient unit.   
Time windows: for T0.5 to T2 (± 5 min ) and from T4 onward (±15 min ). 
• Pain scores may be  skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_1113624] may not miss two consecutive assessments.  
• An additional NRS assessment must be obtained prior to rescue medication 
request (±15 min) .  The T12, T24, T48, T72 and T96h assessments must be 
completed even if the subject is asleep at these times.  
• During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1 (after T24 ) perform 
the following  each morning  at 0800h (±2 h) and each evening at 2000h (±2 h) 
document the NRS at rest  and after physical therapy or transfers to/from bed or 
wheelchair (inpatient) or ambulation for approximately 10 yards (inpatient or 
outpatient) .  Actual assessment times must be documented .  If however these 
twice daily assessments coincide with timed assessments of NRS at rest, then 
the time assessment at rest is used in place of the twice daily assessments , but 
the assessment with ambulation should still be performed .  Resting pain scores 
are performed on the schedule noted above in the first bullet.  
• During the outpatient period (a fter T96h  through  W2), instruct the patient to 
document, if possible, their NRS scores twice daily at 0800h (±4h) and 2000h 
(±4h) at rest and on ambulation (e.g. with the use of a walker or a cane)  for

Statistical 
Considerations:  
 All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the Safety 
Population.  Efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT population.  PK 
analyses will be performed using the PK population.  All summaries will be grouped 
by [CONTACT_3433] e actual treatment received.  Subjects receiving vehicle placebo will be combined 
for summaries.  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_84775], 
including Treatment -Emergent AEs.  AEs leading to discontinuation from the study , 
AEs related to study treatment and AE severity will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].   
Actual and change from baseline in clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, and ECGs 
will also be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  These data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics including n, mean, SD, SEM (if appropriate), 
median, minimum and maximum.  Abnormal values will be determined and flagged in 
the listings.  Laboratory shift tables displaying the change (number of subjects) relative 
to the normal range from baseline to each study visit will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_84777].  The Investigator should exercise medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clin ically significant.  
While the study is not specifically designed to detect a significant difference in efficacy 
between CA -008 and placebo, efficacy analyses will be performed as secondary 
endpoints.

5.1. Background  
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_84712] -[ADDRESS_1113654] -surgical pain following a single local administration  (for 96h and beyond) .  CA -008 
is a prodrug of trans -capsaicin (trans -8-methyl -N-vanillyl -6-nonenamide) , the substance in chili 
peppers that produces the sensation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_84713].  Capsaici n is a transient receptor potential 
cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid), member 1 (TRPV1) agonist.  TRPV1 is a ligand -gated, 
nonselective, cation channel preferentially expressed most densely in C -fiber nociceptors and to 
a lesser extent on Aδ –fiber no ciceptors (Babbar 2009, Caterina 2001 ). TRPV1 responds to 
noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, and integrates 
simultaneous exposures to these stimuli (Suresh 2010, Surh 1995, Tominaga 1998 ).   
Capsaicin exposure  to TRPV-1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals  results in initial 
excitation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for some 
time after removal of capsaicin from the site.  Capsaicin, however, is virtually insoluble in 
aqueous media  or local anesthetic solutions which means that capsaicin formulations tend to be 
quite hydrophobic and viscous making them hard to inject and less likely to permeate surgical 
site tissues.  Anesiva, which had been developi[INVESTIGATOR_806727] -surgical 
pain and osteoarthritis, solubilized capsaicin in polyethylene glycol  300 (Hartrick  2011 ).  The 
product was instilled into the open surgical site and after waiting for [ADDRESS_1113655] or had clinical development programs for such products.  
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development program (CTNX -4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin for chronic osteoarthritis  and Morton’s neuroma (see 
http://centrexion.com/our -pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]/ ).  Note that Centrexion is using the Anesiva highly viscous 
polyethylene glycol formulation for its intraarticular knee joint injections.

Version: [ADDRESS_1113656].  The 
free base form of CA-008 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149160] a 
cyclic urea,  as shown in the scheme below:  
 
CA-008 was specifically selected for development due to its short half -life (<5 min) at neutral 
pH.  In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and CA -101 as the 
sole degradants.  
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity.  
While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was evaluated in all nonclinical 
studies with CA -008 and it was shown to be inactive .  The toxicokinetic profiles for CA -008, 
CA-101, and capsaicin were determined in GLP safety studies  and the PK profile for various 
doses w ere determined in a Phase 1 ascending dose safety study in patients undergoing 
bunionectomy . 
5.3. Previous Human experience  
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by [CONTACT_28474] -008 in vivo.  In addition  to consumption in hot spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716] (chili peppers), 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for OTC and prescription use (Qutenza; 
8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with post herpetic neuralgia) , is 
frequently used int radermally in experimental pain models,  and has been studied clinically for 
wound instillation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; capsaicin for instillation).   
A first-in-human study (Study CA -PS-2017 -101) evaluated  the safety and tolerability of CA-[ADDRESS_1113657] metatarsal osteotomy for correction of 
hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a  bunionectomy.  This study also evaluated

our clinical development plan.   This study was originally designed to look at 4 different doses of 
CA-008 (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg) , however based upon the relatively benign adverse 
event (AE) profile, the Data Manag ement Committee gave the go -ahead for a 5th cohort (4.2 mg) 
to be added .  The safety, efficacy and PK results for the Phase 1 bunionectomy study are shown 
in the current Investigators’ Brochure.    
Additionally, a follow -on Phase 2 bunionectomy study (CA-PS-201) was completed  with 147 
subjects enrolled and randomized to one of 3 active doses: 0.05 mg/mL (0.7 mg), 0.15 mg/mL 
(2.1 mg) and 0.3 mg/mL (4.2 mg) vs. placebo in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1113658] dose of 4.2 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of AUC 0 -96h (p=0.005) and key secondary efficacy endpoints: AUC 
0 to week 1 (p=0.036); mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (reduced by 50%, p<0.002); and percent of

5.4. Study Rationale  
CA-008 is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery.   
5.5. Dose  Rationale  
5.5.1.   Selection of Doses  
The safety of CA -008 was established in relevant animal models and supported by [CONTACT_149188] (CA-PS-2017 -101 and CA -PS-201) and knowledge from prior human 
studies with an injectable formulation of c apsaicin.  Taken together, the character ization of the 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology profiles are considered sufficient to support the 
intended use of CA -008 in th is study.  
5.5.2.  Selection and Timing of Dose  
CA-008 is a pH labile prodrug of capsaicin that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149163].   Decision for single administration at the time of surgery is based on capsaicin’s 
mechanism of action. Capsaicin exposure results in initial exci tation followed by a functional 
desensitization of TRPV -1-expressing nociceptors which continues for some time after removal 
capsaicin from the site.   Administration while the patient is under anesthesia for the procedure 
supplemented by a regional local anesthetic block or local anesthetic infiltration of the surgical 
site should sufficiently address  any transient pain that results from TRPV1 agonism.  
Administration of CA -008 during the wound closure process is ideal for delivering therapy to the 
surgica l site, thus optimizing target engagement.  During closure, the surgical tissue is exposed 
and visible  which allows for  complete and adequate delivery of CA-008 (and capsaicin)  to the 
potential areas where noxious pain is generated.

7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , two stage study 
(exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_806729] a parallel  design stage) evaluating  a single dose  of CA -008 
vs. placebo injected/instilled during an elective  TKA .   
The choice between the two doses of CA -008 for cohort #1 of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_806730] s tudy w as 
based upon the topline results from the Phase 2 bunionectomy study.  Additionally, two more 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_806731].  
After an interim unblinded analysis of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_806732]  (cohorts #1 through #3) , a second 
stage will be performed  with dose  and volume level s, sample size and number of CA -[ADDRESS_1113660], the postoperative assessments  will be conducted in two parts:  
• Inpatient period  which starts with completion of study treatment injection (T0) and 
continues through 96h  (T96h ).   
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various 
follow -up visits to day 29 ( D29±2) (W4) after surgery  or later if necessary for ongoing 
safety assessment s.  Note that additional follow up visits could occur after D29/W4 to 
follow adverse events (AEs) to resolution or establishment of a new baseline.

• Cohort #2: CA-008 10 mg vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Cohort #3: CA-[ADDRESS_1113667] or designee may use unblinded vials identified as to contents .  
However, at the time of reconstitution, the anesthesia and surgical team and study site personnel 
will be blinded as to study treatment.  At time of use, the concentrate will be completely 
reconstituted and used for treatment (see the Pharmacy Manual).  These details will be reflected 
in the Unblinding Plan and the Pharmacy Manual.  
9.1.3.  Study Treatment Storage  
Study treatments will be shipped to sites and stored at -20°C (-15°C to -30°C) until the day of 
surgery.   All study treatment  should be stored in a secured area and in accordance with the

time, IV fentanyl 25 -50 mcg q5 min prn for moderate -to-severe pa in (≥ 4) as reported by 
[CONTACT_149186] 0 to 10 numerical rating scale of current pain intensity (NRS).  After discharge 
from the PACU, subjects are followed through T96h as an inpatient.  
From the time of discharge from the PACU through T 48h administer  IV hydromorphone 0.5 mg

After T12h, administer PO oxycodone 5 mg q2h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 4 and ≤ 6) or 10 mg 
q2h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7).  From T12 through T48h, IV hydromorphone may be used as 
rescu e in addition to PO oxycodone for moderate -to-severe pain.  After T48, only PO oxycodone 
may be used as rescue.  If a subject still requires IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_84689] T48, then the subject 
should undergo an early termination due to lack of efficacy.  
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain scores ( NRS ≥ 4), however rescue 
may be requested at any time and medication will be prov ided when requested.  
9.2.3.  Outpatient Analgesic Medications  
Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participan ts will be instructed to take a 
combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics at an appropriate dose per medical judgment 
to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
Outpatient period: after T96h discharge through D29/W4, if needed for pain management, the 
following oral OTC analgesics will be recommended for subjects to self -administer (note that 
these medications will not be provided by [CONTACT_456]):  
• A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (e.g., ibuprofen 200 mg prn up to qid 
[Advil® or Motrin®] or naproxen 220 mg prn up to tid [Aleve®]) or other NSAID per 
investigator discretion and  
• Acetaminophen 1000 mg prn up to tid or 650 mg up to qid (3g daily maximum li mit) 
If a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 12h prior to discharge from the inpatient unit 
(i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is delayed) , then prescribe no more than 9 
tablets of oxycodone 5 mg (1 PO tid prn) per investigator discretion for the initial outpatient 
period .  If refills are necessary, an unscheduled visit may be important to understand why there is 
continued pain, as p ersistent pain or pain exacerbations during this period may suggest the need 
to asses s the surgical site.  If such a situation occurs, the Investigator should use clinical 
discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment but  capture this event as an AE and document any 
required treatments.

characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
Subjects  who have provided written informed consent will be assigned a unique number in the 
screening process. This number will be used to identify the  subject  throughout the study.  
In the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32734], subjects in each cohort will be randomized to either the active medication  or 
placebo.  Subsequently, the number of active tr eatment groups and sample size will be 
determined after the interim unblinded analysis of topline data from cohort #[ADDRESS_1113673] and/or monitoring of this study w ill not be aware of the 
treatment group assignments.  Note that t he placebo is identical in appearance to CA -[ADDRESS_1113674]’s safety in managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the 
site by [CONTACT_2329] a code break module.  The code break module will be provided by [CONTACT_95346]. If possible, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_373431]. Whenever a treatment sequence is prematurely unblinded, the 
reason, date and time of the unblinding, and the individual who broke the blind must be 
documented. Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the participant from the study.  
It is assumed that the need to unblind a study subject’s treatment assignment will occur in the 
setting of an SAE, and therefore, all procedur es for the reporting of a SAE must be followed .

to participate or continue to participate in the study.  
On a case -by-case basis, the Investigator is permitted to al low the use of some concomitant 
medications, for example, to treat an AE, if the Investigator determines that the medication will 
not affect the subject ’s safety or study integrity. Wherever possible, the Investigator should 
obtain approval from the Medica l Monitor prior to administering the medication.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Anesthesia and Surgery  
The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia with either supplemented by [CONTACT_806755] (AC)  block  AND an IPACK infiltration  (Interspace between the Popliteal Artery and the 
Capsule  of the posterior Knee between  the femoral condyles).  Recent literature suggests the 
AC+IPACK approach is the new “best practice” to supplement anesthesia as part of an enhanced 
recovery  after surgery (ERAS) for TKA ( Cullom 2017, Sankineani 2018 ).   
Perform the AC+IPACK local anesthetic regional blocks under ultrasound guidance prior to the 
start of surgery.  The dose of IV fentanyl administered during surgery should be [ADDRESS_1113677] discretion.  
• Using ropi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_84685])   
o AC block : 20 mL of 0.5% (100 mg)  
o IPACK infiltration : 20 mL  of 0.2%  (60 mg)  
A tourniquet will be used in all subjects. After exsa nguination, but prior to surgical incision, 
perform surgical site infiltration with Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_84685] 0.2% 30 mL (100 mg).   
The total Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_806737] 200 mg.  See Appendix M  (Section 17.12 ) for guidance on 
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_806717].  
10.1.3.  Surgery Phase : Administration of Study Medication  Into the Surgical Site  
Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single administration via  “surgical 
site” infiltration.   The “surgical site” is defined as th e area extending approximately 5  cm in all 
directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision  and osteotomy  sites and 
surrounding tissues which may be affected by [CONTACT_806761] .   
Note that T0 is the time that the study treatment injection/instillation is completed.

amendment to follow the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32734].  
10.1.4.  Inpatient Phase : Time 0  (Post -Surgery) to Day 4  (Discharge)  
Following surgery, subjects will be transferred to the appropriate recovery unit where they will 
undergo an assessment of safety and efficacy over the next 96 hours. The schedule of 
assessments are as follows:  
• Subjects with inadequately controlled pain may request rescue at any time; however, subjects 
will be encouraged to receive rescue medication only w ith an N RS ≥ 4.   
• Pain intensity (assessed with NRS):   
o During the inpatient stay, beginning with the PACU admission and after the subject is 
awake: assess the NRS at rest at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours , and every 4 
hours (if awake at time of assessment) until discharge from the inpatient unit.   Time 
windows: for T0.5 to T2 (±5 min) and from T4 onward (±15 min).  
o Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_1113678] is asleep at these times.  
o Pain intensity (NRS) will be completed at the time of rescue medication request (±15 
minutes).     
o During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1 (after T24): each morning on 
ambulation at  0800h (±2h) and each evening at 2000h (±2h)  document the NRS after 
physical  therapy or with partial or full weightbearing for transfers to/from bed or frank 
ambulation of approximately [ADDRESS_1113679].  If

T1, T1.5, T2, T2.5, T3, T4, T6, T8, T12, T16, T24 , T30, T36 and T48h for a total of 20 
samples).   
• 24h urine collection in two aliquots: end of surgery to T6h and T6h to T24h.  
• Subject completes Patient Global Evaluation (PG E) assessment  and KOOS survey  at T96h 
(±4) prior to discharge  
• Investigator completes Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE) assessment at T96 (±4 ) prior to 
discharge .  Note that the IGE may be performed by [CONTACT_521747] -investigator.  
• Record rescue medication consumption and concomitant medications  throughout the 
inpatient period . 
• Record AEs throughout the inpatient period (Section 17.11  Appendix K may be useful to the 
investigator for assessing systemic [general] AEs)   
After completing the assessments through T96h, the diary for at -home use will be reviewed and 
subjects will  be discharged from the study center with diary to record pain assessments and pain 
medication at home.  Subjects will be provided routine standard of care for pain management 
after discharge from the study center.  Subjects will be instructed to return to  the study center on

10.2. Subject Completion and Withdrawal  
10.2.1.  Subject Completion  
A subject is considered to have completed the study once all end -of-study assessmen ts are 
completed at D29 (or later if necessary ), or at the last visit upon early termination of the study.  
10.2.2.  Subject Withdrawal  
A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time 
for any reason. A subject’s p articipation must therefore be terminated immediately upon his/her 
request, and the reason(s) for discontinuation appropriately documented.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Safety reasons, including AEs or significant concomitant illness, injury, or urgent 
surgeries/procedures that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant extent, require discontinuation of study drug, or both  
▪ At the request of the Spo nsor, regulatory agency, or Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
▪ Subject is lost to follow -up 
▪ Subject treatment allocation is unblinded (i.e., individual code break; Section 9.4) 
▪ Death of subject  
A subject may also be discontinued from the study, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor, for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Subject refuses or is unable to adhere to the study protocol  
▪ Major prot ocol violation  
▪ Pregnancy  
▪ Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
▪ It is not considered in the best interest of the subject to continue  
▪ Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or study)  
The Investigator must maintain a record of all sub jects who discontinue from the study prior to 
completion; the reason(s) for study discontinuation will be documented. I f a subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to obtain and record 
Clinical Trial  Protocol CA -PS-203               Confidential  
 
Version: 19 February  2019        Page 68 of 124 the reason(s) for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject is not obligated to 
provide such a reason.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have 
terminated as of the date of their elec tion, however they will be asked to return to the site or their 
surgeon , if willing and at their convenience, to ensure adequate wound healing.  If a subject 
should refuse  to complete early termination/Follow -up procedures or continued data collection, 
this information will be recorded.  
10.3. Study Procedures  and Assessments  
10.3.1.  Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by [CONTACT_149192]. The subject must voluntarily provide wr itten 
informed consent on an ethics -approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any 
study -related procedures. The subject’s source  records must document that the consent process 
has been completed and that written informed consent has been ob tained from the subject prior 
to the initiation of any study -specific procedures. Documentation that the subject was given 
adequate time to ask the Investigator (or designee) questions about their participation in the study 
and that a signed and dated copy  of the ICF was provided to the subject should also be included 
in the medical records or clinical chart.  
10.3.2.  Demographics  
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birthdate), sex, race, and ethnicity.  
10.3.3.  Medical and Surgical History  
The complete medical and surgical history will include histories of acute, chronic, or infectious 
disease; surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecting major body 
systems. All findings on medical history will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737] f or clinical 
significance.  
10.3.4.  Medication History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medications/natural health products, 
or investigational drugs) taken by [CONTACT_12539] [ADDRESS_1113683] a same sex partner.  Examples of 
medically acceptable forms of contraception include true abstinence, hormonal contraceptives 
(combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch or vaginal ring, intrauterine device or system, progestin implant or

Version: 19 February  2019        Page 69 of 124 injection), bilateral tubal ligation, or double -barrier methods (i. e., male condom in addition to a 
diaphragm or a contraceptive sponge).  
Female subjects of non -childbearing potential are not required to use contraception or undergo 
pregnancy tests; however, they must be surgically sterile ( e.g., hysterectomy and/or bila teral 
oophorectomy or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy, as determined by [CONTACT_806762] h istory) or 
congenitally sterile  or must be post -menopausal. Post -menopausal is defined as being 
amenorrheic for at least one year without another cause.  
Male subjects, unless in  a relationship with a same sex partner or a female partner who is of non -
childbearing potential (see above), must either be sterile (surgically or biologically) or commit to 
using double -barrier methods ( i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a contraceptive 
sponge)  during the study .   
10.3.6.  Subject Pain Assessment Training  
Subjects will undergo study participation education on pain assessments and written testing 
procedures according to the Schedule of Study Procedures.  
10.3.7.  Digital Photographs of the Surg ical Site  
During the informed consent process, subjects will be asked if they are willing  to allow digital  
photographs to be taken  of the surgical site . This is optional,  and their response will in no way 
affect their inclusion in the study. Their response will be included on the ICF.  
10.3.8.  Numerical Rating Scale for Pain Intensity  (NRS ) 
The NRS  is an 11 -point scale with anchors 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst possible pain)  (Section  17.2 
Appendix B).   
Subjects will report or record the intensity of their current pain at designated  times  during the 
study after  administration of study treatment .  Subjects should be at rest for at least 5-[ADDRESS_1113684] noted any 
worsening pain (rebound pain) at the surgical site since the prior visit report ( Section 17.3 
Appendix C) . 
10.3.10.  Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  
Subjects will complete the KOOS survey at designated  times  during the study after  
administration of study treatment  (Section 17.13  Appendix M).  The KOOS survey was 
developed in the 1990s as an instrument to assess the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_806742] -PS-203               Confidential  
 
Version: 19 February  2019        Page 70 of 124 associated problems (see http://www.koos.nu/ ).  Note that for purposes of this study, responses 
in the KOOS will not be considered or captured as spontaneous AEs.  
10.3.11.  Patient Global Evaluation (PGE)  
Each  subject will be asked to report their satisfaction with the study treatment for pain  using a [ADDRESS_1113685] will be asked the following question:  
“How would you rate the study treatment  that you have received for pain? Poor (0), Fair (1), 
Good (2), or Excellent (3)”  (see Section 17.4 Appendix D). 
10.3.12.  Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE)  
The investigator will report their satisfaction with the subject’s study treatment for pain using a 
4-point scale  at designated  times  during the study after  administration of study treatment .  A 
study investigator will be asked the following question:  
“How w ould you rate the study treatment  that the patient received for pain? Poor (0), Fair (1), 
Good (2), or Excellent (3) ” (see Section 17.5 AppendixE Appendix E). 
10.3.13.  Rescue Medications  
The details of rescue medication (doses and times) will be recorded beginning from the end o f 
surgery through 14 days after the end of surgery (D15 visit) or to Early Termination Visit  if 
applicable .  Subjects will be instructed on the proper use and timing of rescue medication.

*Note that for non-tolerant  patients, we are using the 6:[ADDRESS_1113686] them to the clinical si te in a timely manner. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to review and sign all lab reports expeditiously, to document 
appropriate safety monitoring of study subjects. The Investigator should sign and date each lab 
report concurrent with her or his review and should indicate the clinical significance of each 
abnormal/flagged value by [CONTACT_12542] “NCS” (not clinically significant) or “CS” (clinically 
significant), for example . Notations indicating that a value is clinically significant should also 
include a brief description of the underlying disease or condition that is associated with the 
value, e.g., “CS/mild anemia.” In general,  and as determined by [CONTACT_093] , abnormal, 
clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated wi th an item recorded in 
medical history or with an AE.  
Additional laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the results of 
any tests fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to ensure safety.

10.3.15.  Urine Drug Screen and Alcohol Test  
Urine d rug screen and alcohol breath /saliva  tests will be completed  at screening  and pre -
procedure . All subjects will be tested for drugs -of-abuse ( e.g., amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, methadone , 
methamphetamine, tricyclic anti -depressants, oxycodone and others ). 
 
The drug and alcohol screens will be performed in -house at the Clinical Unit. If any of these tests 
are positive, the subject will not be allowed further participation in the trial. How ever, a positive 
test may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator .  
10.3.16.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will consist of  BP, HR, and RR  and temperature following a rest period. Vital signs 
will be assessed per the Schedule Assessments.

Version: 19 February  2019        Page 73 of 124 10.3.17.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
12-Lead EC Gs will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments after the subject  has been 
resting in a recumbent/supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes. The ECG variables will include 
ventricular heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. ECGs will be signed and dated 
by a medically -qualified individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether any 
abnormalities are clinically significant. In  general, abnormal, clinically significant ECGs are 
expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history (e.g., at Screening) or with an 
AE (if it occurred post study treatment).  Note that for QTc, clinically significant changes in 
ECG (using  QTCf , should be <450 msec  for male subjects  / < 470 msec for female subjects .  
Clinically significant changes in ECG are : an increase of QT cF of 30msec or greater, as well as 
any other changes deemed by [CONTACT_806764]. 
10.3.18.  Physical Examination  
A complete PE including all major body systems (HEENT, neurologic, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, dermatologic and musculoskeletal systems) will be performed at Screening .  A 
focused interim or targeted PE wi ll be performed pre -surgery and after surgery during the inpatient 
and outpatient periods (see Table 1).  
Body weight (kg ), in indoor clothing, but without shoes , will be measured at Scre ening  and 96 
hours.  Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured, and BMI will be calculated at Screening only. 
BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2.  The site should use NIH website BMI calculator (available at: 
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi -m.htm ). 
10.3.19.  Surgical  Site Assessment   
The s urgical  site should be assess ed per the Schedule of Assessments  to determine if any site 
related AEs have occurred .   The investigator will evaluate their satisfaction with the healing of 
the wound during this Surgical Site assessment using an 11 -point scale (0 -10) where a score of 0 
is “Completely unsatisfied,” and a score of 10 i s “Completely satisfied.”  (Section 17.6 Appendix 
F).  Assessments will also be performed  at each of the Follow -up visits  or at the time of early 
discontinuation. When assessed on Day 29, if the Investigator observes insufficient wound or bone 
healing  or to ensure an ongoing AE has resolved , the subject will be scheduled for a follow -up 
visit.  
If  there are skin reactions a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], e.g., more than expected erythema, 
drainage, bruising or hematoma, induration, swelling or other skin changes, they should be 
documented as AEs, graded for severity and followed regularly until resolution or establishment 
of a new baseline  (the grading guide for atypi[INVESTIGATOR_521737]: Section  17.7 Appendix G).

11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety 
Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs in this study.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
that does no t necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally associated  with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
Since this is a study using a surgical pain model, findings that are “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” for the surgery 
should not be captured as a n AE.  Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_806744].  
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable  possibility that the 
drug caused the event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a  causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
11.1.1.  Relationship  to Study Treatment  
A qualified investigator must make the determination of relationship to the investigational 
product for each AE.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_104841].   
 
Causality 
Category  Description  
Unlikely related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration which  makes a causal 
relationship improbable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide more plausible  explanations.  
While temporal sequence may be an important factor in determining 
causality: i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the 
study treatment, it may well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a concurrent 
medical condition or concomitant medications administered during or 
after surgery were more likely than not to be responsible for the AE.  
The investigator should use clinical judgment to evaluate the evidence 
and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that study

Version: 19 February  2019        Page 78 of 124 treatment actually cause d the AE or whether based upon the evidence it 
is more likely that something else is responsible.  If the former, choose 
“possibly related” and if the latter, “unlikely related.”   
For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be 
consi dered an AE not related to study treatment.  
Possibly related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, which also may be 
explained by [CONTACT_149196].  In such 
cases, if the investigator using clinical judgment is unable to rule out a 
reasonable possibility that study treatment was partly responsible, then 
choose “possibly related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible rela tionship 
to study treatment will be defined as a “Suspected Adverse Drug 
Reaction”.   
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, in which the investigator 
has de termined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to other 
factors.    
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship 
to study treatment will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.  
 
11.1.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs must be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new 
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -related 
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings tha t the 
Investigator feels are clinically significant.  
Disease -related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs 
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
Information collected concerning AEs will include th e following:  
▪ Name [CONTACT_12581]  
▪ Onset date  
▪ Resolution date  
▪ Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or potentially life -threatening)  
▪ Relationship to study treatment  
▪ Action and outcome

study treatment will be followed unt il resolution or stabilization.  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or reaction is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
▪ Death  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
▪ Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect (in an offspring)  
▪ An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a pre -existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84747] ≥ [ADDRESS_1113692] be

o SAE Reporting email: MedicalMonitorCA -[EMAIL_15344]  
▪ The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor is available for questions about safety -related issues  or to 
request waivers to modify postoperative patient care : Mike A. Royal, MD JD MBA; 858 -
204-1112 or mike@ concentricanalgesics.com . 
▪ The initial report should include all information known at the time of the report (additional 
information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting to obtain 
resolution or follow -up information.  
▪ The site w ill enter into the electronic database (or fax, if the database cannot be accessed for 
any reason) an SAE report, or similar form, that includes the following information, as 
available:  
o Subject ID  
o Basic demographic information (age, gender, weight)  
o Outcome s attributed to the event (death, life -threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [new or 
prolonged], disability, congenital anomaly, required medical intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment/damage, etc.)  
o Onset date and severity of the event  
o Brief description of the  event including frequency and severity of symptoms leading 
to diagnosis  
o List of relevant test results and laboratory data  
o Any other relevant history  
o Whether the study treatment was discontinued  
o Investigator ’s assessment of causality  
The CRO Medical Monitor or another representative of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_521755]. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE repo rt and the 
AE CRF.  The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to 
the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information on the SAE, and notifying 
the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details sur rounding the event. In the event there is a 
question as to whether the AE is serious, the event should be reported.

Version: 19 February  2019        Page 81 of 124 11.2. Severity Grading for AEs  
Grading the severity of AEs is per investigator discretion (the guidance reflected in Sections 
17.9, 17.10  and 17.11 ; Appendices I, J and K may be helpful ).   Additionally,  the following 
general guideline may be helpful : 
• Grade 1 (mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms requiring no treatment, only clinical or 
diagnostic observation  
• Grade 2 (moderate) = event or symptoms limit age -appropriate activities of daily living  
(ADLs)  more than is expected from the surgery itself , requiring minimal treatment or 
local noninvasive intervention indicated .   
• Grade 3 (severe) = medicall y-significant but not immediately life -threatening, 
significantly limiting of self -care ADLs, requiring of medical treatment and may require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].   
11.3. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant at any time during the study, the Investigator must notify 
the CRO Medical Monitor or designee within [ADDRESS_1113695] through the pregnan cy term, and report to the 
CRO Medical Monitor or designee the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal or neonatal 
outcome. Information on the status of the mother and the child will be forwarded to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee. Any premature t ermination of the pregnancy will also be reported 
on this form. Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an SAE, 
any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE  and will be followed as such. A spontaneous abortion is considered to be an  
SAE.

This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigator and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, compl eteness, and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee will 
review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies  will be resolved with the Investigator, as 
appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated,  and remedial action instituted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
terminati on and regulatory authority notification.  
12.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include , but are not limited to , original documents, data and records such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, 
participant diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and 
pharmacy records, etc. T his study will use electronic data capture (EDC). At a minimum, all data 
required by [CONTACT_149198].  
All CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_12555]’s monit or or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on -site and compare them to the data collected on the CRF.  All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_806765].

SAMPLE SIZE  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The sections of the Statistical Considerations describe the statistical methods to be used to 
analyze the efficacy and safety.  These methods may be revised and updated due  to rea sons such 
as regulatory requirements or need for further clarifications.  The final analysis will be 
documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that must be finalized before database 
lock.  The SAP will include details on how variables w ill be derived, how missing data will be 
handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to be used 
for safety and efficacy analyses.  The final clinical study report will discuss deviations from the 
SAP, if any.  
13.2. Sampl e Size Justification  
Given the uncertainty in estimating a sample size for TKA surgery, the results from the Phase 2 
bunionectomy study and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32734] (cohorts #1 through #3) topline data from the current 
study will be used to determine active treatme nt doses and sample size for Stage [ADDRESS_1113696] has completed

for the subsequent protocol amendment plan wherein several CA -008 dose groups are planned 
compared to placebo in a prospective , randomized , parallel design for Stage 2 of the study.  
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are planned for this study :  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any part of a dose of study 
treatment.   
• The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study treatment and 
complete  all PK assessments.  
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) popul ation will include all subjects as randomized to study 
treatment.   
Membership in analysis populations will be determined before unblinding.   
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation (early termination or ET) after 
randomization but prior to receiving study treatment will be replaced.   
Subjects who elect to ET after receiving study treatment will not be replaced, however those who 
ET during the inpatient phase of the study, will be asked to continue with assessments through

No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis.  Means 
and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the precision of the data.  
Standard deviations will be presented with two m ore decimal places than the precision of the 
data.  Percentages will be presented with one decimal place.  A percentage of 0% or 100% will 
be reported as 0% or 100%, respectively.  Minimums and maximums will be presented with the 
same precision as the orig inal data.  
All analyses will be performed using the SAS System® version 9.3 or higher. The domain 
(Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets 
will be taken as input to the SAS programs that generate the report -ready tables, figures and 
listings. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be provided to the sponsor along 
with display deliveries. The specifications for the domain data sets and analysis data sets will be 
provided in a separate document.  
The following conventions will be used throughout the study analysis:  
• Time T0 is the time of completion of study treatment administration.  
• Day of surgery is defined as D0  
• Assessment visit times are defined by [CONTACT_5586] T0 /D0. 
• Baseline value is defined as the last v alid measurement prior to beginning study treatment 
administration.  
• Change from baseline is defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
• Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours for AEs lasting l ess than 24 hours.  Duration in hours will be calculated as the stop 
date/time of the event minus the start date/time.  Duration in days will be calculated by [CONTACT_149201] +[ADDRESS_1113698] in the

Version: 19 February  2019        Page 87 of 124 database, whichever is later.  Missing dates will be imputed as described in the Study’s 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
• The number of days in the study is computed as: [Date of study completion or withdrawal 
minus the date of study drug administration (Day 1)] + 1.  
• If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the 
last value will be used unless it is noted that the measurement was in error for that v alue. 
Values that compromise interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were 
obtained post -dose will not be summarized as pre -dose values).  
13.5.6.  Analysis of Efficacy Measures  
All efficacy endpoints (e.g., NRS scores), will be summarized ove r time by [CONTACT_149202].  
AUC calculations will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule  
AUC  =     ∑ (𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+1
2)𝑥
𝑖=0 ∗ (𝑇𝑖+1− 𝑇𝑖) 
Where:  NRS i = NRS at time i, and (T i+1 – Ti) is the Time difference in minutes between time i 
and time i+1.  A similar calculation and handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS 
scores with position changes.  
Missing NRS will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP.   
The AUC analy ses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each dose cohort and placebo as well as active vs. placebo mean  difference s, standard errors, 
confidence intervals and comparison p -values  as appropriate . Comparisons of individu al dose 
cohorts for dose response may also be presented for certain secondary AUC endpoints.  
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each treatment group mean differences standard errors, confidence interv als and comparison p -
values as appropriate.   
Mean NRS scores over time (in -clinic and diary) will be graphed over time by  [CONTACT_1570] .  
NRS over time by [CONTACT_521756].  The individual 
NRS and the computed AUC variables will be listed for all individual subjects.   
In this study, subjects are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia.  It is expected 
subjects randomized to placebo arm will take rescue medication more often.  During both 
inpatient and outpatient portions of the studies, the subjects will be instructed to record NRS  
immediately prior to taking rescue medication.  
For subjects who take rescue, the pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled 
assessments for 4 hours.  Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not

Version: [ADDRESS_1113699].  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation f or 
rescue medication may also  be performed.    
Additional  sensitivity analysis with different missing value imputation methods for subjects who 
drop out of the study may also be performed.    
All imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
13.5.7.  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data .  These efforts will include the following:  
• Subjects are required to consent continuous data collection even after subjects 
discontinue the study medication;  
• Continue data collection after subjects taking rescue medication;  
• Establish robust efficacy data collection procedures.  
With the procedures above, it is expected that the missing would be minimal.  Missing at random 
is expected to be a reasonable assumption and the primary analyses are expected to be sufficient 
for this dose escalation study. Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed to support robust 
conclusions, if warranted and details are presented in a detailed SAP prior to database lock.  
For su bjects who take rescue  medication a windowed last pain score carried forward (wLOCF) 
will be used.  The pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled  assessments for [ADDRESS_1113700] omorphone is 
used, and 4 hours  when PO oxycodone is used . Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not  be imputed, and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing values.  For 
subjects who drop out  of the study prior to Day 15, scheduled assessments  will first be imputed 
using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF).  As sensitivity analyses, the AUC will 
also be calculated where assessments after drop out will be imputed using LOCF, using the last 
scheduled non missing pain score prior to drop out, and the median scores for the remainder of 
the group continuing in the study, without imputation using actual data . 
For secondary continuous efficacy endpoints, similar methods as the primary analysis will be 
used.  For catego rical endpoints, when assessments are imputed for data after a subject 
discontinues from the study, a WOCF method will be used.  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue medication may also be pe rformed.  Additional sensitivity analysis with different missing

imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
13.5.8.  Analysis of Safety  
Safety ana lyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.2).  
Safety will be assessed through treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs); hematologic, biochemical, 
and urinal ysis laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements ; ECGs; physical exam, surgical 
site and neurosensory assessments .  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) reporting system. Treatment -emergent AEs are 
defined as any of the following:  
▪ Non-serious AEs with onset on the date  of treatment with the study drug through Day [ADDRESS_1113701];  
▪ Serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment with the study drug through [ADDRESS_1113702];  
▪ AEs that start be fore the start of treatment but increase in severity or relationship at the time 
of or following the start of treatment through Day [ADDRESS_1113703]. 
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be displayed for each  treatment group 
by [CONTACT_9315]. Additionally, TEAEs will be tabulated for each treatment group by 
[CONTACT_373436]. A listing of SAEs will be provided if applicable.  
13.5.9.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
For continuous l aboratory parameters, descriptive statistics will be presented for the value at 
each assessment time  and for the changes from baseline by [CONTACT_1570].  
Additionally, clinical laboratory parameters will be categorized as low, normal, or high 
according t o laboratory range specifications and the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category will be presented in shift tables.  
Laboratory values that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with corresponding normal r anges.

Neurosensory testing should be performed in an area approximately [ADDRESS_1113714] the investigator or designee in performing neurosensory 
testing.  
• Monof ilament (von Frey) Testing:  For this examination, the filament should initially be 
prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger). 
The filament is then applied perpendicularly at the location to be assessed and br iefly, 
(<1 second) with even pressure.  When the filament bends, the force of [ADDRESS_1113715], whose eyes are closed, is asked to respond yes if he / she feels 
the filament.  Eight correct responses out of 10 applications is conside red normal: one to 
seven correct responses indicate reduced sensation and no correct responses translates 
into absent sensation.

Background information  
What is the KOOS?  
The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient -reported outcome measurement 
instrument, developed to assess the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_715340]. The 
KOOS evaluates both short -term and long -term consequences of knee injury and also consequences of 
primary osteoarthritis (OA). It holds 42 items in five separately scored subscales:  KOOS Pain , KOOS 
Symptoms , Function in daily living ( KOOS ADL ), Function in Sport and Recreation ( KOOS Sport/Rec ), 
and knee -related Q uality of Life ( KOOS QOL ) (Roos and Lohmander 2003 ). 
In which populations can the KOOS be used?  
KOOS has been used in patients 13 -79 years of age.  
KOOS is intended to be used for knee i njury that can result in posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA); i.e. knee 
ligament injury (ACL, posterior cruciate ligament [PCL], medial collateral ligament [MCL]), meniscal tears, 
knee cartilage lesions, knee OA, and osteochondritis dissecans, etc.  
KOOS is m eant to be used over short and long time intervals; to assess changes from week to week 
induced by [CONTACT_3148] (examples include: ligament reconstruction (ACL, PCL, MCL), meniscectomy, 
microfracture, osteochondral autografts, tibial osteotomy, total knee rep lacement (TKR), exercise (land -
based, aquatic -based), intra -articular sodium hyaluronate injection, pharmacologic therapy, and 
glucosamine supplementation) or over years due to the primary injury, post traumatic OA or primary OA 
(Roos and Lohmander 2003 ).  
How was the KOOS developed?  
KOOS was developed by [CONTACT_806768] -authors in the 1990s as an instrument to assess the patient’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_715340]. Items were selected based on: (1) the Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), version 3.0; (2) a literat ure review; (3) an expert 
panel (patients referred to physical therapy for knee injuries, orthopedic surgeons, and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_806750]); and, (4) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_806751] (one for symptoms of ACL injury, one 
for symptoms o f OA) in individuals with posttraumatic OA.  
What are the KOOS subscales and what areas of health do they measure?  
The KOOS collects data on five knee -specific patient -centered outcomes: (1)  KOOS Pain ; (2) KOOS 
Symptoms : Other symptoms such as swelling, res tricted range of motion and mechanical symptoms; 
(3) KOOS ADL : Disability on the level of daily activities; (4)  KOOS Sport/Rec : Disability on a level 
physically more demanding than activities of daily living; (5)  KOOS QOL : Quality of life, mental and socia l 
aspects such as awareness and lifestyle changes.   
In what settings is the KOOS responsive to change?  
KOOS’ responsiveness has been reported following surgical procedures including ACL reconstruction, 
meniscectomy, cartilage repair procedures, tibial oste otomy, total knee replacement as well as physical 
therapy, nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions. Following orthopedic surgery, including total knee 
replacement, KOOS QOL is usually as responsive, or more responsive, than KOOS Pain and KOOS ADL 
(Collins and Roos 2012 ). 
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-203               Confidential  
Version: 19 February  2019        Page 118 of 124 What is the Minimal Detectable Change of the KOOS in different settings?  
The minimal detectable change (MDC) is dependent on the test -retest reliability of an instrument.  The more 
reliable a measure is, the smaller the difference that can be detected longitudinally. The test -retest reliability 
is, in turn, dependent on factors such as patient characteristics and time between assessments.  
In studies of patients with knee in jury, the MDC ranges for KOOS Pain were 6 -6.1, for KOOS Symptoms: 5 -
8.5, for KOOS ADL: 7 -8, for KOOS Sport/Rec: 5.8 -12, and for KOOS QOL: 7 -7.2 (Collins, Misra et al. 
2011 ). 
In one study incl uding patients with knee OA, the MDCs for KOOS Pain were 13.4, for KOOS Symptoms: 
15.5, for KOOS ADL: 15.4, for KOOS Sport/Rec: 19.6, and for KOOS QOL: 21.1 ( Collins, Misra et al. 2011 ). 
What  is the Minimal Clinically Important Change in the KOOS in different settings  
The minimal clinically important change (MIC) can be defined as the smallest change score needed for the 
effect to be considered clinically relevant (de Vet, Ostelo et al. 2007).  MIC can be calculated in many 
different ways using anchor -based and distribution -based methods. Recent publications highlight that there 
is probably no such thing as one MIC for a specific patient -reported outcome measure, such as the KOOS. 
Instead MIC se ems to be dependent on context factors including patient group, intervention, time to follow -
up, etc. Therefore, it is more probable that in the future, a range of MICs will be established for an 
instrument. Research is ongoing to establish the MIC for the  KOOS in many different contexts. Until then, a 
MIC of 8 -10 is considered appropriate for the KOOS ( Roos and Lohmander 2003 ). For performing a sample 
size calculation, usually an SD of [ADDRESS_1113718] greater within -
group variation than younger or healthier groups.  
What is the Patient Accepta ble Symptom State of the KOOS in different settings?  
The Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) can be defined as the value beyond which the patients can 
consider them well. The PASS is an absolute value (not a change value) and can be used as a patient 
centered and clinically relevant treatment target (the proportion of patients reaching a satisfactory state) 
(Tubach, Ravaud et al. 2005 ). Similar to the MIC, research is ongoing within this ar ea to establish PASS for 
KOOS when used in different contexts.  
KOOS administration  
Who answers the questionnaire?  
The KOOS is self -administered and completed by [CONTACT_102]. No interview or phone formats are available.   
How long does it take to complete th e KOOS?  
The KOOS questionnaire takes about 10 minutes to fill out.   
How is the KOOS administered?  
The KOOS is self -explanatory and can be administered in the waiting room prior to a clinical visit or used in 
a postal mail survey. KOOS has not been validated for interview administration ( Collins, Misra et al. 2011 ).  
KOOS Scores  
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-203               Confidential  
Version: 19 February  2019        Page 119 of 124 How is the KOOS scored?  
The five patient -relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: KOOS Pain (9 items); KOOS 
Symptoms (7 items); KOOS ADL (17 items); KOOS Sport/Rec (5 items); KOOS QOL (4 items). A Likert 
scale is used and all items have five possible answer options score d from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme 
Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are 
transformed to a 0 –100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee 
problems as is com mon in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 
100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. An aggregate total score is not calculated 
since it is regarded desirable to analyze and interpret the five dimen sions separately. Please find more 
extensive instructions on score calculations in the scoring section of the  KOOS User’s Guide . 
For statistical purposes, when used as the primary outcome in an RCT,  a single score can be constructed. 
In this case, the five individual subscale scores should be secondary outcomes. Please see reference 
(Roos, Engelhart et al. 2011 ) for more information on  this procedure.  
How are the KOOS scores interpreted?  
The score is a percentage score from [ADDRESS_1113719] possible result.   
How should the patient be instructed on scoring activities he/she is not able to perform?  
It is important  to determine whether or not each subscale is relevant at the time point chosen, considering 
the specific study population. For example, difficulty with Sport/Rec function may not be relevant to assess 
[ADDRESS_1113720] -operatively.  
The following guideline for study staff is available:  
KOOS Pain and KOOS ADL subscales: If a subject avoids an activity (e.g., twisting/pi[INVESTIGATOR_806752]) due to doctor's orders or because the subject has chosen to avoid the activity, the subject 
should be instructe d to choose “(4) Extreme” for those items.  
KOOS Sport/Rec subscale: The same as above. Also, if a subject does not normally engage in an activity 
(e.g., running or jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), the subject should be instructed to leave the item blank.  
How do I handle missing items?  
Missing data: If a mark is placed outside a box, the closest box is chosen. If two boxes are marked, that 
which indicates the more severe problem is chosen.  
As long as at least 50% of the subscale items are answered for each subscale, a mean score c an be 
calculated. If more than 50% of the subscale items are omitted, the response is considered invalid and no 
subscale score should be calculated. For KOOS Pain, this means that [ADDRESS_1113721] be answered; for 
KOOS Symptoms, 4 items; for KOOS ADL, 9 items;  for KOOS Sport/Rec, 3 items; and for KOOS QOL, 2 
items in order to calculate a subscale score. Subscale scores are independent and can be reported for any 
number of the individual subscales, i.e. if a particular subscale is not considered valid (for examp le, KOOS 
Sport/Rec 2 weeks after total knee replacement), the results from the other subscales can be reported at 
this time -point.   
NB: The excel Scoring sheet available for download does not automatically take the number of missing 
items into account.   
Can a total score be calculated?  
An aggregate total score is not calculated since it is regarded desirable to analyze and interpret the five 
dimensions separately. For statistical purposes, when used as the primary outcome in an RCT, a single 
score can be co nstructed. In this case, the five individual subscale scores should be secondary outcomes. 
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-203               Confidential  
Version: 19 February  2019        Page 120 of 124 For more information on this procedure, see reference ( Roos, Engelhart et al. 2011 ) or the FAQs sec tion 
on statistics .  
How do I present my data?  
The results of the five subscales can be plotted as an outcome profile, preferably in a graph with scores 
from 0 -100 on the y -axis and the five subscales on the x -axis (an example is presented in the  KOOS User’s 
Guide , under the heading of KOOS Profile). The order of the subscales from left to right should be: KOOS 
Pain, KOOS Symptoms,  KOOS ADL, KOOS Sport/Rec and KOOS QOL. This way profiles can be 
compared visually across studies. Changing this order makes visual comparison more difficult.   
How do I use KOOS as the primary outcome in an RCT?  
There are two ways to apply the KOOS as the primary outcome in an RCT. Either way, the primary 
endpoint should be specified  a priori . You can either (1) choose the single subscale you consider is the 
most likely to measure the change from the intervention of interest, or you can (2) create a composi te score, 
referred to as KOOS 4 or KOOS 5, depending on the number of subscales included in this composite 
score.  Please note that this is very different from calculating a total score!  Calculating an average score 
from subscale scores ensures similar weight  from all subscales in the composite score. Calculating a total 
score is never recommended. In either case, all KOOS subscales should be included as secondary 
endpoints to enable clinical interpretation of the results.  
As examples, since exercise is aimed at improving physical function, it may be appropriate to apply the 
KOOS ADL subscale as the primary endpoint in an older group of OA patients, and the KOOS Sport/Rec 
subscale as the primary endpoint in a younger group of knee -injured patients in a trial of  an exercise 
intervention. However, in pharmacological trials, the subscale KOOS Pain may be more appropriate as the 
primary endpoint since pharmacological agents often are supposed to relieve pain. When two different 
interventions are included (for exampl e a surgical and a non -surgical) or when the intervention is supposed 
to affect more than one subscale to a similar degree, a composite score may be most appropriate as the 
primary outcome. Below, an example is given where KOOS 4 was applied. You can also r ead more about 
“Single Subscale versus Overall score” and “Multiplicity” in the review by [CONTACT_806769] ( Roos, Engelhart et al. 
2011 ).

different administrations of the KOOS (e.g. pre -treatment to post -treatment), KOOS 
Profiles can be plotted. The example from Nilsdotter et al. [17] shows KOOS profiles 
prior to and at 3 time points following total knee replacem ent (TKR).

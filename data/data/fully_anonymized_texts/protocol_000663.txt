Weight Loss Intervention for Mothers with Young Children 
 
I. Objectives   
 
1. Assess intervention fidelity (dose, delivery, receipt) and acceptability by [CONTACT_36801]  
2. Investigate potential intervention impact on the primary (body weight) and secondary outcomes (pants size)  
3. Explore potential intervention impact on lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity)  
4. Explore potential intervention impact on motivation (autonomous motivation, self -efficacy, social support), 
emotion (emotion control, stress), and cognition (impulsivity). 
5. Assess cost of different recruitment approaches  
 II. Background and Rationale  
Low-Income Overweight or Obese Mothers of Young Children: Our Priority Population.  In the 
U.S., nearly 50% of low -income women aged 20- 40 years are at high risk for type 2 diabetes,  because they 
live in poverty and are overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25.0 kg/m
2).1-[ADDRESS_1270754] over twice the risk (68- 75%) for significant weight retention ( ≥ 10 lbs) compared to 
higher -income women ( 32%).5 Significant postpartum weight retention is a strong predictor for lifelong obesity6 
and adverse maternal and birth outcomes, such as gestational diabetes and macrosomia7-13 during subsequent 
pregnancies. Weight gain of ≥ [ADDRESS_1270755] shown that healthy lifestyle behaviors (healthy eating, PA) promote 
postpartum weight loss, including for low -income, overweight or obese women.[ADDRESS_1270756] on the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]19 and 
pregnancy -related maternal outcomes, because 40- 50% of obese women gain ≥  2 BMI units between 
pregnancies.20 Also, p rior studies paid little or no attention to mechanisms  of motivation (autonomous 
motivation , self -efficacy, social support), emotion (emotion control, stress), and cognition (executive function),  
all of which play important roles in healthy lifestyle behaviors and resulting positive health outcomes .21-[ADDRESS_1270757] 
scientifically rigorous, novel intervention programs, like the one that we proposed, for achieving weight loss in the priority population that could also potentially address feasibility limitations of prior work .  
 Scientific Premise . Previous research strength. Lifestyle interventions can promote weight loss. 
Previous research limitations . (1) The proposed priority population has been significantly underrepresented 
in prior lifestyle weight loss intervention studies . (2) Prior lifestyle interventions in overweight or obese mothers 
have suffered from threats to internal validity and have not specifically addressed motivation, emotion, and 
cognition (especially executive function), all of which are critical for promoting and maintaining healthy lifestyle 
behaviors and health outcomes. (3) There has been little evidence that any of the potentially efficacious 
strategies researched previously were even possible under real -world co nditions.  The proposed small pi[INVESTIGATOR_905289]. The ultimate goal of the 
proposed study is to create a more feasible and scalable intervention that can be easily implemented and sustained in real -world settings . We propose to assess intervention fidelity and acceptability; we also 
investigate the potential utility of a web -based intervention in which participants identify their motivation for 
making positive behavior change, weekly goals, and means of attaining those goals, supplemented by [CONTACT_905319] . Moreover, we will assess  cost of different recruitment approaches . Significance. The 
  
[ADDRESS_1270758] to jointly apply future time 
perspective  and Self-Determination  Theory concepts  (motivation [autonomous motivation, self -efficacy, social 
support ], emotion (emotion control, stress), and cognition ( executive function).  Conceptual Framework 
(Figure 1). We use Future Time Perspective T heory (anticipation of future goals or personal experience across 
the past, present, and future32) as a guiding conceptual framework. Future time perspective  drives motivation 
and behavior in everyday life.33 Future Time Perspective T heory  concepts include motivation,34 emotion,33 and 
cognition.35 Implementation of future time perspective has focused on epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681].35 We also apply 
key concepts from Self-Determination Theory : Autonomous motivation , competence ( self-efficacy) , and 
relatedness  (social support ), all of which foster motivation and activity engagement.[ADDRESS_1270759] effectively promoted and maintained healthy eating,22,37 physical activity ,38 
weight loss,23,39- 41 goal progress,42 and intervention adherence.39 Our preliminary work with the proposed 
priority population supports the study conceptual framework. A lifestyle intervention including stress 
management can effectively reduce stress43 and fat intake.44 Stress was positively associated with fat intake.45 
Self-efficacy and social support  buffer stress46 and dietary intake47,48 Autonomous motivation and self-efficacy 
mediated the association between a lifestyle intervention and fat intake.49 Self-efficacy  mediated the 
association between a lifestyle intervention and stress.47 Using an ActiGraph accelerometer (ActiGraph) to 
measure physical activity  in the proposed population,50 we found that 33.3% met physical actviity  
recommendations (≥ 150 min/week moderate physical activity ), 23.9% had some but were below the 
recommendations, and 42.8% had no physical activity . The proposed Goal -oriented EFT (GoEFT)  
intervention has two unique components that differentiate it from our own and other previous research: weekly 
self-directed and interactive web site ( web) and individual  counseling via Zoom. The vivid imagination 
(visualization, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681]) of goal -relevant future events in the individual’s life51 is specifically 
designed to improve motivation ( autonomous motivation, self -efficacy, social support ), emotion ( emotion 
control , stress), and cognition ( executive function ), all of which promote success in achieving goals for healthy 
lifestyle behaviors. Key lifestyle behaviors include dietary intake (fewer calories, less fat and sugary drinks, and 
more fruit and vegetables) and physical activity  (increase light -to-moderate physical activity ). The proposed 
light-to-moderate physical activity  is a realistic goal for the priority population and is consistent with public 
health recommendations that even modest increases in daily physical activity can yield measurable health 
benefits.52-56 The primary outcome is weight loss (body weight ) and the secondary outcome is waist 
circumference  -- stronger predictors of obesity -related chronic conditions than BMI.57-62

 Connecting Epi[INVESTIGATOR_905291]. Goal-oriented epi[INVESTIGATOR_10683]29 is a promising approach to improve motivation, emotion, and cognition (the proposed 
mechanisms connecting the intervention to the targeted lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes). 
Neuroimaging63-[ADDRESS_1270760] shown that epi[INVESTIGATOR_905292], decision- making, and memory. Influences on motivation: autonomous motivation, 
self-efficacy, and social support . Autonomous motivation -- will to engage in a behavior because of personal 
value, interest, or choice -- is important for achieving one’s goals.36 Self-efficacy refers to  beliefs that one can 
successfully undertake an action.70 Social support  means receipt of  various types of support, such as help from 
friends, family members, or others.71 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_905293]/or value of a goal.72 Influences on 
emotion: emotion control  and stress. Emotion control, one’s ability to manage emotional reactions using 
appropriate strategies, is associated with ability to cope with stress.73 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_905294],67,74- 76 because it activates brain regions associated with emotion regulation.67-69 Influences on 
cognition (executive function) . Executive function enables individuals to coordinate thoughts, actions, and 
emotions77 to achieve healthy lifestyle behaviors30,78 and positive health outcomes.30,77 Executive function 
includes inhibitory control (important for EC and resisting temptation to overeat and over -react77), memory, 
reasoning, problem -solving, and planning.[ADDRESS_1270761] the proposed mechanisms.  
 
Connecting Proposed Mechanisms to Each Other and to Lifestyle Behaviors and Health 
Outcomes. Motivation and emotion are inter -related components of self -regulation that enable individuals to 
adhere to a healthy lifestyle and achieve positive health outcomes.90 Motivation . Increased autonomous 
motivation, self -efficacy, and social support  are strongly associated with reducing stress in overweight or obese 
wome n46,47,91 and with promoting cognitive performance92 (e.g., problem solving93) and a healthy lifestyle.21-
25,47,48,94 Also, autonomous motivation predicts successful goal pursuit32,95 and promotes  weight 
management.24,40,96,97 Emotion influences cognition.98 Stress negatively affects diet (increased intake of high-
fat, sugary, energy -dense foods, leading to weight gain27) and physical activity .26 Higher levels of stress are 
associated with lower levels of inhibitory control27 and interfere with cognitive performance,99 but reducing 
stress improves e xecutive function.100 Cognition (executive function) . Low levels of inhibitory control have 
been associated with increased energy intake in overweight or obese women,[ADDRESS_1270762] to apply epi[INVESTIGATOR_905295]- person

 form of epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681]: epi[INVESTIGATOR_905299] (mental representation of the future).67 The proposed 
intervention includes epi[INVESTIGATOR_905299], prediction (benefits for achieving goals), intention (identifying when 
and where the activity will take place), and planning (generating specific steps rather than general plans for 
achieving the goal done by [CONTACT_275166]), all of which come together to support prospective cognition.[ADDRESS_1270764] to ask participants to vividly imagine their personal plans followed by 
[CONTACT_905320] . This approach supports the sense of volition and choice and 
fulfilling the psychological needs of the participants, which in turn promotes quality of intervention engagement 
and outcomes .110 Finally, the study would innovate in use of participant -generated short reminders to promote 
cohort retention and intervention dosage.111

esearch Design  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_905300]  (1) assess intervention fidelity (dose, delivery, 
receipt) and acceptability by [CONTACT_36801], (2) investigate potential intervention impact on the primary 
(body weight) and secondary outcomes ( waist circumference ), (3) explore potential intervention impact on 
lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity),  (4) explore potential intervention impact on motivation 
(autonomous motivation, self -efficacy, social support), emotion (emotion control, stress), and cognition 
(impulsivity), and (5) assess cost of different recruitment approaches . We will enroll 30 overweight or obese 
women with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds . All measures will be assessed at baseline (T1) and 
immediately after the three- week intervention  (T2).

Sample size/power. We did not perform a formal sample size calculation but based on our available 
funding and resources. Because of budget constraint, we think a sample size of 30 women is appropriate for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], which will provide preliminary data for us to apply future NIH R01.  
 
C. Measurement/ Instrumentation  
All participants will be assessed at baseline (T1) and immediately after the three- week intervention 
(T2). Survey data will be collected online using password- protected security -ensured Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap), a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases . 
Participants will receive up to $10 for completing T1 data collection and $[ADDRESS_1270765] participants to verify or clarify survey data, e.g., body weight is entered as 90 (most unlikely because 
we will enroll overweight or obese women) instead of 190. 
 
Feasibility.  W e will use our tracking records to assess recruitment and retention.  To assess intervention 
implementation,  we will extract data from our study web site that will track and capture details about all 
activities (e.g., amount of and type of activities completed and percent  of participants used type in box). We will 
record the attendance of individual coaching session. P articipants will report their motivation and barriers 
preventing them from engaging in the intervention activities and evaluate the usefulness of with each epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]

 future thinking intervention component.  We will also use semi- structure interview questions (up to 20 
minutes/an individual interview via zoom) to ask participants to evaluate the intervention. We will use website 
tracking data, individual coaching session, and results of zoom  interview to revise the intervention contents for 
a future large scale intervention study  (R01) .  
 
Primary outcome : body weight.  We will collect self -reported body weight.  
 
Secondary outcome: waist circumference. We will c ollect self -reported pants size, which is a good indicator of 
waist circumference.

 egardless methods of recruitment. We will obtain verbal 
consent prior to screening and obtaining demographic information.  Collecting demographic data will help us revise or plan for recruitment strategies for a future R01. If eligible, participants will provide up to three working  
telephone numbers (at least one capable of receiving text messages), email address, and physical address as 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. We will ask if we can leave a message via phone (Yes/No).   Next, the Research S taff will 
schedule a zoom meeting (individual information session, described below) within the five business days with the qualified participants  (we will allow extension if participants indicate the time line does not work for them) . 
Then, the trained research staff will send the full consent form to the participants for review (via email) prior to 
the first scheduled zoom meeting. Participants will be informed the zoom meeting will be either audio or video 
recorded per their preferences.  
 
First zoom meeting (information session lead by [CONTACT_3647]) .
  Participants will use their  
personal devise, for example, computer or smartphone  to join the zoom meeting, which will take up to [ADDRESS_1270769] questions and answer questions 
accordingly. Next, they will review key summary of incentive and intervention requirements (using Zoom 
“share” ) with the participants and answer questions that they  may have.  Also,  research staff  will ask the 
potential participants to think through their current and anticipated responsibilities and life situations before 
providing electronic signature (via REDCap)  for participation. After that, the research staff  will obtain  consent 
(participants providing electronic signature [CONTACT_328621]) followed by [CONTACT_905326]. Then, participants will be asked to self -generate reminders to complete data

name, and birthday and own device (e.g., smart phone) to log into the intervention website and complete 
activities, while the research staff  still on Zoom to answer women’s questions if they have.  After completion of 
the Part I intervention activities, the research staff will schedule an individual coaching session via zoom with 
the trained interventionist within the next two days. Participants will be informed that each coaching session will 
be recorded (either audio or video per their  preferences). The recording will be transcribed and be analyzed to 
help us revise the individual coaching sessions for future studies. We will send a zoom link to participants to join the individual coaching session.

lapses as needed (e.g., partial data collection at T2 ) or extend the time window for data collection. We will 
monitor the retention rate monthly and keep retention logs by [CONTACT_905327].  
 Intervention: A  self-directed, web -based lifestyle behavior intervention (tailored to participants’ needs) . 
Intervention mode.  All intervention participants will receive the weekly web- based intervention for three 
weeks.  The intervention includes three topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] : stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity  
(Figure 2).  Intervention (long- term) goals . Participants are strongly encouraged to (1) daily manage stress 
and emotional reactions using positive strategies, (2) daily eat a diet low in fat and consume less sugary drinks, (3) daily eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables, and (4) walk at a brisk pace for [ADDRESS_1270772] days a 
week.

  Intervention development based on preliminary work. Informal interviews with stakeholders. We 
informally met with several clinicians who provided prenatal care to the target audience to inform our mode of intervention delivery. They suggested a self -directed, web- based  intervention because of its easy 
implementation and future scalability to overcome clinicians’ time constraints to providing additional information 
on stress management, healthy eating and physical activity  to help women manage their weight. Study one.  
We conducted seven focus group discussions with overweight or obese pregnant women (N = 96) to identify their critical needs in stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. Women reported, for example, 
poor relationships with significant others, feeling emotional, eating foods for comfort, and lack of motivation to be physically active.
123 Results of this study were used to develop the pre- written short -term goals for the 
participants (Figure 2) because most women had challenges in goal setting.  Study two . Below, we present 
lessons learned from our prior NIH- NIDDK R18 intervention study of overweight or obese women of child-
bearing age124 to develop the two parts of the GOEFT intervention (Figure 3). Part I. Motivation. Lesson 
learned: Personal values and interest (autonomous motivation) motivated women to make positive lifestyle 
  
9 
 behavior changes. Many women had low commitment and confidence ( self-efficacy ) to implement plans/steps 
to achieve personal values and make positive changes. Emotion and cognition. Lesson learned: Realizing the 
importance (i.e., the potential benefits) of accomplishing personal goals and responding to open- ended 
questions (e.g., WHAT and WHY) helped women aware of current life situations/challenges and motived them 
to make positive changes. Yet, most women faced challenges in setting goals and identifying specific steps to 
accomplish the goals. Also, many challenges (e.g., lack of willpower, time, or energy) prevented them from implementing their plans. Including explicit planning and (HOW) material for how to overcome challenges 
should buttress the effectiveness of the current intervention. Part II: Evaluation of goal progress with feedback . 
Lesson learned: women were often unaware what strategies helped them accomplish their goals. They often 
gave up when unaware of the progress toward their goals or the benefits received from making positive 
changes. Based on the conceptual framework (Figure 1) and results of the preliminary work, Drs. Chang ( an 
expert in healthy lifestyle behavior interventions including stress management) and Wegener (Co- I, an expert 
in psychological emotion and cognition research) worked with five peers of the target audience to develop the 
proposed self -directed, web- based goal -
oriented epi[INVESTIGATOR_905302] (Figure 3) . After developi[INVESTIGATOR_905303], we used feedback from several additional peers of the target audience to review and finalize the 
intervention.

implementation (Figure 3).  Research 
staff will provide the intervention web link  
(via text, email)  and instructions on 
completing the weekly intervention activities online. Intervention participants  
will use their smart phone, first and last 
name, and birthday to log into the website 
to complete the Part I intervention 
activities for week one. Week one Part I 
activity will be completed during the 
second zoom meeting to increase participants interest in participation. Also, 
research staff will answer any questions 
that participants may have. The day of the 
week that the participants complete the 
Part I i ntervention activities will count as 
their weekly day one. All participants will 
be given the study office number to call for 
questions and technical problems. 
Participants will use their own device to complete Part II intervention activities for week one and the additional two weeks of the intervention at convenient times and locations. We will send the web link to participants 
weekly via email and text with an “intervention adherence” text message reminder (generated by [CONTACT_3038]) to log in and complete the intervention activities.  
 
Part I (weekly days 1 -4, 30- 35 min/week) : Motivation, emotion and cognition. Motivation . Participants will 
first be asked to visualize, then use a dropdown menu to select their responses (or type in a box) for the following: their personal values and ways to help them commit to and increase confidence in achieving their 
personal values. Emotion and cognition.  First, participants will select a subtopic from the week’s designated 
topic (Figure 2) followed by [CONTACT_20683] a pre -written short -term goal (or typi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a box) under the chosen 
subtopic that meets their need for that week’s focus .Then, they will visualize and describe WHAT the week’s 
goal is, WHY it is important, WHEN, WHERE, and with WHOM it will take place, and HOW it can be Figure 3.  A three-week self-directed, web-based intervention

 accomplished, all of which enhance prospective memory, thus enabling individuals to carry out the plan to 
reach the goal.125 Related to HOW, they will be asked to view an example with three specific detailed steps to 
achieve their chosen goal. Step I.  Use open- ended questions to ask themselves, thus to raise awareness of 
their current life situations/challenges (e.g., How often do I eat junk foods?). Step II . Take specific steps to 
overcome the challenges to achieve the chosen goal  (e.g., pay attention to foods I eat and how much I eat). 
Step III . Record ways to reward themselves without using foods  (e.g., smile and tell myself,  “Wow, I am proud 
of myself of eating less junk food and being mindful what I eat, each time I follow through my plans”). After that, 
participants will visualize and describe their three steps (by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_007]) to accomplish the chosen goal. Next, they 
will repeat the same process for a second short -term goal for the week. Motivation . they will visualize and use 
the dropdown menus to select (or type in a box) (1) their three most important challenges (e.g., I don’t have the willpower) in implementing their steps to accomplish each of chosen goal for the week, (2) three potential 
solutions to overcome each chosen challenge and (3) benefits of overcoming the challenges. Phase I 
concludes with a summary of the participant’s motivation, emotion and cognition.  Participants will be 
encouraged to accomplish their chosen goal  within the next few days and mentally rehearse their “identified 
steps” two times daily because rehearsal increases effectiveness of goal -oriented epi[INVESTIGATOR_905304].

 Part II (weekly days 5- 7, 5 min/week): Evaluation of goal progress with feedback . After 
implementing steps to achieve both chosen goals, they will log into the intervention website and use the 
dropdown menus to evaluate their progress on accomplishing their short -term goals, identify tips that proved 
helpful, recognize short - and long- term benefits of accomplishing the chosen goals, and rate progress on the 
four long- term intervention goals and three chosen personal values. They will receive feedback to their 
response for each evaluation component (e.g., short- term goal). Part II concludes with a summary of goal 
progress with feedback.   
  
Individual coaching  session via Z oom (15 min/call, 10 calls) . Participants will receive a call within 1 -
2 days after they complete the Part I intervention activities. All coaching session will be either video or audio 
recorded (per participants’ preference) with participants’ permission. Participants will be informed that the recording will be transcribed and be used to refine the individual coaching session for future studies. During 
each call, the research will listen empathetically and use open -ended questions asking participants to visualize 
and describe how the week’s goals fit with their personal values, thereby  [CONTACT_905331]

36 Next, participants will be asked to visualize and describe how they will accomplish 
the goal(s) – what specific steps they will take. Then, the research staff will assess the specificity of the steps 
and reinforce or help modify the plans (emotion and cognition). Finally, participants will be asked to visualize 
and describe barriers to implement plans and strategies to overcome barriers. The research staff will assist 
with problem solving as needed ( self-efficacy ). We will keep IPC attendance records. Fidelity.  [CONTACT_11515] and 
each research will listen to a random 25% of the audio recordings monthly and use the fidelity checklist to assess protocol adherence, strengths, and reasons for deviations.  
 
Intervention adherence. Each week, participants will receive up to three prescheduled text reminders 
via their smart phone to engage in the week’s intervention activities (until they complete). If women have not 
completed all activities after seven days, the research staff  will call and ask them to complete the activities that 
they have missed and ask reasons for nonadherence. When a woman expresses interest in quitting some aspects of the intervention activities, we will assess barriers to adherence, brainstorm strategies to overcome 
barriers, and offer options to reduce intervention adherence burden. We will keep intervention adherence log.  
 
F. Internal Validity  
 
Feasibility of recruitment, retention, intervention adherence and acceptability (Aim 1) . We already plan 
to track recruitment and retention activities. Intervention adherence. The web will track and capture details 
about all activities (e.g., number of logins and amount of and type of contents used). We will also ask intervention participants about motivation and barriers preventing them from using the web. Acceptability . We 
will assess acceptability by [CONTACT_905332] s to evaluate the usefulness of  with each intervention component,

tatistical analysis  
 
 Statistical analysis . We will use descriptive statistics to examine variable distributions, check for outliers, and 
summarize sample characteristics. Aim 1.  We will (1) conduct content analysis to analyze recruitment, 
enrollment, retention and intervention adherence logs to identify successful strategies used, (2) review quality of steps generated to achieve goals (using a scoring system), and (3) perform descriptive statistics.  We will 
also perform content analysis (for semi -structure interview questions).  Aims 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_1270773] appropriate 
multiple imputation if missing at random is indicated. The mixed -effects modeling allows for missing at random. 
If missing not at random exists, pattern mixture modeling will be used. Sensitivity analysis will evaluate the 
robustness of study findings without multiple imputation vs. those with imputation or from pattern -mixture 
modeling.

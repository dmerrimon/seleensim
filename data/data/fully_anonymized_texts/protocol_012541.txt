2.Background or Introduction:  State the background of the study, including a critical 
evaluation of existing knowledge and the information gaps that this research 
proposes to fill. Describe previous work that provides a basis for the proposed 
research and that supports the expectations of obtaining useful information without 
undue risk to human participants. Please include relevant citations.   
The National Cancer Institute report that African Americans (AAs) have higher death rates when  
compared to Whites for many types of cancers, such as prostate cancer and breast cancer [4].  
The target geographical area of this proposed study is designated as Service Planning Area 6 
(SPA 6) in Los Angeles County, including cities of Watts, Compton, and areas of South Los 
Angeles. The SPA 6 area is primarily  populated by [CONTACT_398440], with 27% 
identifying as AA[5]. The death rate per 100,[ADDRESS_501996], cervical,

and colorectal cancer is 30.7, 22.8, 5.8, 16.0, respectively. [5] Culturally and spi[INVESTIGATOR_398425]. Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survivorship continue to persist, 
which can be attributed to factors such as lack of medical insurance, barriers of detection and 
screening, more advanced stage of cancer and comorbidities at diagnosis among minorities, 
and unequal access to cancer treatment [6].
In the African American church, clergy wives and widows (CWWs) are faith-based stakeholders 
that can facilitate educational sessions for African Americans on cancer survivorship and 
caregiving [7].  Faith leaders are commonly utilized to lead interventions and work with research  
partners to improve the health of populations.  However, wives and widows of faith leaders 
commonly perform many roles in faith-based institutions, such as the leader of the women’s 
ministry group.  Even though their role may not be very visible compared to their spouses, they 
hold a dynamic role in the African American church. Many CWWs perform activities and foster 
mentorship with congregation members using spi[INVESTIGATOR_398426], especially congregation members.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_398427] a 
higher divine being and the individual and expressing positive attitudes and behaviors with 
others[8].  This group of spi[INVESTIGATOR_398428].  Fear of being diagnosed with 
cancer and cancer fatalism is more prevalent among minority groups as compared to Whites [9], 
which may decrease with the therapeutic group of CWWs. Minority populations also have fewer 
discussions of health promotion and behaviors with their healthcare providers [10], which may be 
assisted with the prompting and education with CWWs.  Additionally, CWWs can be beneficial 
in improving cancer outcomes among their faith-based institution and improving cancer 
screening rates. Even though they are understudied, CWWs may be aware of current cancer 
survivorship and caregiving burdens among their faith-based congregation and attempted to 
provide a degree of patient navigation and advocacy.  More importantly, these CWWs may 
understand the complexity of the cancer survivor and/or caregivers, and other related factors, 
such as culture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_398429].  Throughout this program, CWWs will gain 
support from their cohort of peers and facilitators.  
The proposed project is significant for the training of CWWs as leaders of cancer and caregiver 
related issues among African American populations in their faith-based institutions. A 
community-based partnership consisting of CWWs will provide a structured learning program to 
enhance their knowledge of cancer survivorship and caregiving and their issues, with special 
consideration of culture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824] [11].  The long term outcome for this program is to 
contribute to the reduction of system-level and provider barriers by [CONTACT_398441] [12].  
Preliminary Studies
Our research team has been working with both minority cancer survivors and caregivers.  The 
core investigator ([CONTACT_398461]) is currently conducting a pre-post intervention study on providing 
leadership education to nursing students in the areas of cancer survivorship and caregiving and 
assessing their need for essential services and education and providing support and resources. 
In addition, another recent study focused on the need of an oncology patient navigation training 
course for all healthcare-focused students that would involve aspects of management and care. 
Focus group findings revealed that specialized training and education for health care focused 
students on cancer survivorship and caregiving would equip them with skills and knowledge to

not only understand their experience but aid in improving health care outcomes as future 
healthcare providers. 
3.Objective(s): The objective of this study is to 
The long-term goal of this proposed study is to develop a leadership training program for CWWs  
with emphasis on cancer survivorship and caregiving. The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_398430], with specific emphasis of cultural and spi[INVESTIGATOR_398431].  
4.Purpose of the study:  What are the specific scientific aims of this study?  
We will test the feasibility of the proposed program implementation by [CONTACT_398442]:
1) To increase cancer survivorship and caregiving leadership education and activities  for AA 
CWWs by [CONTACT_398443]
2) Develop skills and knowledge  to perform an in-depth culturally sensitive need 
assessment and   intervention map tailored for aging African American cancer survivors and  
caregivers, and
3) Enhance awareness of cancer-related health issues  and its relationship to key 
determinants among aging cancer survivors and caregivers
III.Research Design and Methodology
5.Study Design: What type of study is this? ( e.g. Retrospective, prospective, 
longitudinal) Describe the research procedures that will be followed.  Please indicate 
those that are experimental and those that may be considered to be standard 
treatment. Describe all activities involving human participants (what types of 
participants will the study involve? –be specific: gender, race, age…) and explain the 
frequency and duration of each activity. Specify recruitment techniques.  What 
variables will be taken into consideration? And include an exact number of 
participants (e.g. 100 instead of 100-135).  
This is a prospective study. The project has [ADDRESS_501997] of focus groups of both URM cancer survivors and caregivers 
(Aim 1). 
Phase II analyzes the focus group sessions to develop a need assessment for URM 
cancer survivors and caregivers and the content and organizational structure for the 
CSC for CWWs training education program for clergy wives and widows ( Aim 2). 
Phase III implements the year-long CSC for CWWs training program for clergy wives 
and widows at CDU that focuses on various areas of the cancer survivorship 
experience, including the delivery of cultural competency and care and providing 
hope and comfort ( Aim 3). 
Phase IV focuses on the evaluation of performance data, strategies, and discussion of 
barriers and successes.  
Focus Groups:  We will have 20 participants (cancer survivors and caregivers).

7.Exclusion criteria: Who will be excluded?  
Participants who do not identify as a clergy wife or widow and African American/Black  
will be excluded from the CSC for CWWs study. Individuals who are not cancer-
survivors or caregivers and younger than [ADDRESS_501999] access to the internet on a computer desktop, laptop, tablet, or cell phone will 
be excluded.
8.Procedures: What cases will be identified and by [CONTACT_398445]? ( i.e. reviewing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_398432], focus groups, etc).  How long would the study take if retrospective  
or prospective?  How the study will be conducted after approval is obtained from the 
IRB.  
Focus Group  :   For the focus group sessions, qualified participants who are cancer survivors 
and caregivers. Using a purposive sampling approach, all researcher team members will utilize 
their contacts to recruit participants for all aspects of the study, through email invitations to 
participate. We will distribute flyers and emails throughout the CDU physical and digital 
environment, local community organizations, and senior centers. The research staff will follow-
up with interested individuals by [CONTACT_398446] a given 
 
IRBNet #: 1530494-3 Approved by: [CONTACT_139977]: October 24, 2021 to  
Page 5 of 11
date and time.  The participants will provide written consent at the time of the focus group. We 
are targeting to recruit and retain 10 cancer survivors and 10 cancer caregivers. 
CSC for CWWs program : We will distribute flyers and emails throughout the CDU physical and  
digital environment, in addition to the Cynthia Perry Ray Foundation.  The research staff will 
also conduct brief presentations at various meetings for the Cynthia Perry Ray Foundation 
about the study and provide a contact [CONTACT_398447]. We will 
obtain consent prior to the start of the CSC for CWWs program. We are targeting to recruit and 
retain 50 participants.
Conferences Led by [CONTACT_398444] : Flyers and emails will also be distributed throughout the CDU 
physical and digital environment, Cynthia Perry Ray Foundation , and local faith-based 
organizations and churches. We are hopi[INVESTIGATOR_398433] [ADDRESS_502000] information on when the conferences will be held. 
Study Procedures
Phase I: After recruitment of cancer survivors and caregivers, we will plan the dates and times 
of the two focus group sessions with scheduling preferences of the participants. The goal is to 
have all focus group sessions held on a digital platform ( Zoom), which will be password 
protected. Each focus group session is expected to last one hour. Prior to focus group session, 
we will obtain written consent and participants will complete a demographic questionnaire on 
Survey Monkey. The focus group sessions will inquire about cancer and caregiving related 
knowledge, resources and perceived support issues among cancer survivors and caregivers.  
Each participant will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_502001] for their time and participation. 
Phase II:  To meet Aim 1 of creating an educational program aimed towards mentorships, the 
PIs will analyze the data from the focus group and create the focused curriculum and content 
area for the CSC for CWWs program (Month 4). The investigators will convene weekly (via in-
person or online) to discuss themes and codes of the focus group sessions to inform the CSC 
for CWWs program development, including embedding culture and community considerations 
for each topic area and content outlines. The American Society of Clinical Oncology have 
developed a Core Curriculum for Cancer Survivorship Education (ASCO), with consideration of 
survivorship care recommendations from the Institute of Medicine [17]. The ASCO was cultivated  
by [CONTACT_398448]-based recommendations for oncology care and 
management. Informed by [CONTACT_398449], we will create the CSC for CWWs program topic 
curriculum. Each bi-monthly session of the CSC for CWWs program is expected to last two 
hours and will be delivered in a lecture format over the 6-month program. In addition, the 
themes and codes of the focus group sessions will assist the investigators in the creation of a 
specialized survivorship and caregiving care plan that involves cultural and spi[INVESTIGATOR_398434].
Phase III: Starting in Month 5, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I will begin to recruit CWWs. To meet Aim 2, 
CWWs will complete the CSC for CWWs program during Months 9-[ADDRESS_502002]- questionnaires ( Cancer Survivorship and Survivorship Self-Efficacy Surveys) that 
assess their self-efficacy of both cancer survivorship and cancer caregiving.  Each meeting 
session with CWWs will be monthly and lasts for 2-[ADDRESS_502003] provide written 
consent to participate in the CSC for CWWs program and for collection of data.  They will 
complete a demographic questionnaire and a self-efficacy survey prior and after completion of 
 
IRBNet #: 1530494-3 Approved by: [CONTACT_139977]: October 24, 2021 to  
Page 6 of 11
the CSC for CWWs program.  To meet Aim 3, CWWs will be placed in groups of 10 to 
collectively create and present four online conferences focused on cancer survivorship and/or 
caregiving for community faith-based institutions and parishioners as a culminating activity. 
The four planned conferences will be tailored around African American survivors and caregivers  
and will focus on: 1) caregiving for cancer survivors, 2) cancer social support needs and mental 
wellness, 3) cancer stigma and cancer survivorship care toolkit development, and 4) Cancer 
awareness, risk factors, and screening. The purpose of the conferences is to provide further 
information on cancer survivorship and caregiving to the community.   Attendees will be asked 
following the conferences to participate in the post-conference survey. Attendees will provide 
informed consent and complete survey questions following the online conference through 
SurveyMonkey. They will receive a $[ADDRESS_502004] a CDU online conference (Month 
15) in which the participants will present their experience and conferences presentations to the 
university audience and community members.  After fulfilling all requirements of the program, 
they will be compensated with $[ADDRESS_502005] and certificate for their time and 
participation. Scheduling of the CSC for CWWs monthly sessions will be accordance with the 
preference of the program participants. In addition, a focus group will be scheduled in Month 15 
for the CWWs participants to discuss program outcomes and share experiences of community-
led conferences, in addition to perspectives of future directions for community-led research in 
cancer survivorship and caregiving. CWWs can receive a $[ADDRESS_502006] for participation in 
this focus group.
Phase IV:   The investigators will then convene throughout months 15-16 to evaluate 
performance data, review strategies, discuss barriers and success, and update materials and 
resources for future CSCLENS program cycles. 
IV.Risk/Benefit Assessment
9.Benefits to participants:  What is the risk benefit ratio of this research, compared with 
available alternatives? Describe the potential benefits the participants may receive 
as a result of their participation in the research .  The potential benefits of the 
research must justify the risks to human participants. The risk benefit ratio of the 
research must be at least as favorable for the participants as that presented by 
[CONTACT_398450]. When comparing the risk/benefit ratio of 
research with that of available alternatives, the alternative of doing nothing should 
be included in the analysis.  
The benefit of this program to the participants is that they will gain knowledge of cancer 
survivorship and caregiving program.  
10.Benefits to society:  What benefits to society and the community may be expected?  
This study will help the society by [CONTACT_398451].  These individuals will support the acquisition of knowledge to 
care for cancer survivors and their caregivers.
 
IRBNet #: 1530494-3 Approved by: [CONTACT_139977]: October 24, 2021 to  
Page 7 of 11
11.Risk to participants: Describe any potential risks or likely adverse effects of the 
drugs, biologics, devices or procedures participants may encounter in the study. 
State the potential risks – physical, psychological, social, legal or other – connected 
with the proposed procedures and assess their likelihood and seriousness.  And state 
the breach of confidentiality, distress due to questioning, etc.  
There is no obvious risk for the participant.  However, some participants may experience  
sadness over the pain experienced by [CONTACT_398452].  If 
that happens, the research team, which has an experienced mental health nurse will 
provide initial screening and counseling.  We will also refer the participant to consult with  
his/her physician for more in-depth care as necessary.
The research team will be contact[CONTACT_398453] 
a copy of their signed consent form.  This may include sensitive information (i.e. 
name) and identification that they are participating in a study about cancer. We will 
do our best to ensure that this information is confidential, and data is secured, but 
there is always risk for data security.
12.Confidentiality:  
a.How will the data be collected and recorded? How will the data be coded to 
protect personal privacy?  
All focus group interviews will be audio-recorded.  All interviews will be transcribed verbatim and  
coded from data codebook developed from the data through an iterative process with all the PIs.
Data Collection
Focus Groups: An experienced facilitator will conduct three focus group sessions with URM 
cancer survivors, caregivers and clergy wives and widows. We will use a semi-structured 
interview guide to assess: 1) their biopsychosocial and spi[INVESTIGATOR_398435], 2) perceived 
barriers for optimal quality of life and health, and 3) their ability to obtain external support and 
resources, 4) perceived challenges in their care based on their age and minority status, and 5) 
Experiences and impact of participation in the study. The interview guide is provided. The focus 
group interviews will be audio recorded.
Focus Group Demographic Questionnaire  :    This will include mostly demographic questions 
which center on the age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and family income of the participant. 
The participant must also identify if they are a cancer survivor or cancer caregiver or both.  If a 
cancer survivor, the participant will be asked about the cancer diagnosis and staging, length of 
disease, time since remission or last treatment, comorbidities and chronic health conditions, and  
types of cancer treatment received (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, other (specify). If a 
caregiver, they will provide length of caregiving and caregiver training, involvement in nursing or  
medical care of CR, performance of nursing/medical care activities relationship to care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  
diagnosis of care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], health status and chronic conditions hours spent with care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_398436]. 
CSC for CWWs Demographic Questionnaire : Demographic information about each 
CSCLENS program participant will be collected prior to the CSC for CWWs program. Data will 
include the participant’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, enrolled nursing program, years of 
experience in healthcare industry, and cancer survivor and/or caregiver status.

Cancer Survivorship and Cancer Caregiving Self-Efficacy Survey : Each CSC for CWWs 
program participant will complete the Cancer Survivorship Self-efficacy and Cancer Caregiving 
Self-Efficacy survey prior to the beginning of the CSC for CWWs program (T0) and at the 
completion of the CSC for CWWs program (T1). The instrument is a brief, Likert scale with 
values ranging from 0-4 for each of the nine questions related to cancer survivors and 
caregivers’ health needs, psychosocial support, and nursing care plan education, with a total 
score of 36 (Appendix B & C). Final scores will be computed for each participant by [CONTACT_398454].
Nursing Cancer Survivorship Care Knowledge Survey : This survey, adapted from Lester, 
Wessels, & Jung (2012) focuses on knowledge about cancer survivorship concepts, cancer 
treatment and side effects, survivorship issues, and comfort care40.  All CSC for CWWs 
participants will complete the survey prior to the beginning of the CSC for CWWs program (T0) 
and at the completion of the CSC for CWWs program (T1). This measure is a Likert scale with 
values ranging from 0-4 for each of the 35 questions ( Appendix D)
CWW-Led Conference Surveys:
: We will utilize the following surveys:
Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire, which is a 18-item questionnaire to investigate the 
impact of caregiving and related stress.[ADDRESS_502007] all current 
and former caregivers.
-Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DASS-21)28, which is a validated combination of three self-
report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.
-Cancer Stigma Scale (CASS) which assesses six subdomains (Severity,  Personal 
Responsibility, Awkwardness, Avoidance, Policy Opposition,  and Financial Discrimination)29,30. 
This 25-item questionnaire has Likert-style responses ranging from Definitely Not to Agree 
Strongly to Not Sure (1-7). 
- awareness, risk factors and screening which was adapted from the 2017 Cancer Awareness 
Measurement, [LOCATION_006] (CAM) survey 24-27. This 27-item questionnaire will assess these outcomes 
of this survey, which mainly consist of Likert style and categorical questions.

To facilitate data analysis, the data will be entered into the qualitative data software, NVivo or 
Atlas.ti. Data coding will begin with the reading of the transcripts by [CONTACT_398456]. Data analysis will continue with a three-level coding process: 1) open coding 
to identify patterns in the transcripts, 2) focused coding to explore clustered concepts, and 3) 
identification of major themes.  A coding manual will be created in an iterative process and 
independently coded by [CONTACT_398457]-rater reliability.  All transcripts will initially 
be coded by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I.  The themes that are developed will be used to inform the CSC for  
CWWs curriculum and content outline and care plan assessment.
For all quantitative data analyses, sample demographic characteristics for the CSC for CWWs 
program and workshops will be calculated. Descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, central 
tendencies, and variabilities) will be completed for the all surveys and summarized using 
means, medians and other quantiles, standard deviations, interquartile range, minimum and 
maximum, as well as graphically (e.g., boxplots).  Data will be examined for outliers and tested

Our team recognizes that there are multiple topi[INVESTIGATOR_398437].  Yet, due to the limit of covering certain topi[INVESTIGATOR_398438], possible areas for content may be not be covered.  The qualitative component of our 
study (Phase I) will assist us in our CSC for CWWs program planning by [CONTACT_398458]. In addition, we 
know there may be technical issues, which is why we will ensure participants have Zoom 
installed on their laptop or have the capability to join by [CONTACT_648].

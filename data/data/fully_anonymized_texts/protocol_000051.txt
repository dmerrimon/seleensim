Title of Study:   
Evaluatio n of the Effect of Ixekizumab on the Pharmacokinetics of Cytochrome P 450 Substrates in Patients with 
Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Rationale:  
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease in w hich elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines are 
observed.  Elevated proinflammatory cytokines can lead to disease -drug interactions by [CONTACT_57969] P450 (CYP) enzymes, thereby [CONTACT_223955].  Thus, treatment of psoriasis with biological products that reduce inflammation could the oretically reduce 
elevations in cytokines and in turn affect CYP activity.  It is currently unknown if treatment with a biologic agent 
affecting the interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_269413] has the potential to influence CYP activity as has been seen with anti- IL-6 
or anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor agents.
In vitro assays demonstrated that IL -17 inhibition by [CONTACT_223956]; however, while the use of in vitro assays to predict risk of clinical drug -drug interactions (DDI ) is well 
established for small molecule chemical entities, the utility of in vitro assays to predict clinical DDI with biologic 
agents has been inconsistent and thus not yet routinely accepted by [CONTACT_223957].  This study therefore seeks to evaluate the effect of single and 
multiple doses of ixekizumab on the single–dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, 
and CYP1A2 substrates midazolam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, and caffeine, respectively ,in patients 
with moderate -
to-severe psoriasis.  
Objective(s)/Endpoints:  
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
To assess the effects of single and mul tiple doses of 
ixekizumab on the PK of a drug cocktail of CYP 
substrates in patients with moderate -to-severe 
psoriasis.Ratio of geometric least squares means between each 
CYP substrate administered alone and in combination 
with ixekizumab for maximum observed drug 
concentration (C max) and area under the con centration 
versus time curve from zero to infinity (AUC[0-∞]) of 
parent drug .
Secondary
To evaluate the tolerability of ixekizumab in patients 
with moderate -to-severe psoriasis.Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs).  
I1F-MC-RHBU (a)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 9
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)Summary of Study Design:   
This is a 2 -period, fixed -sequence, open -label, multi -center, Phase 1 study to assess the effects of single and multiple 
doses of ixekizumab on the PK of a drug cocktail of CYP substrates (midazolam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, 
omeprazole, and caffeine) in patients with moderate -to-severe psoriasis .  
Patients will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1of Period 1 and receive the drug cocktail on 
the mo rning of Day 1.  Patients will reside at the CRU until Day 2and may  be di scharged from the CRU following 
collection of the 24 hour PK samples, at the discretion of the investigator.  Patients will return to the CRU as 
outpatients for collection of PK samples and safety assessments, as applicable, on Day 3(48hours post -drug 
cocktail dose), Day 4(72hours post -drug cocktail dose), and Day 5([ADDRESS_269414] -drug cocktail dose).
Patients will attend the CRU as outpatients on Day 1 of Period 2 (3 to 7 days after D ay 5 of Period 1) and receive a 
160-mg dose of ixekizumab (administer ed as two 80 - mg subcutaneous [SC] injections) .
Patients will be admitted to the CRU on Day 7 (±2 days) of Period 2 and receive the drug cocktail on the following 
morning (Day  8; Week 1) .  Patients will reside at the CRU until Day 9 and may be discharged from the CRU 
following collection of the 24 hour PK samples, at the discretion of the investigator.  Patients will return to the CRU 
as outpatients for collection of PK samples and safety assessments, as applicable, on Day 10 ([ADDRESS_269415] -drug 
cocktail dose), Day 11 ([ADDRESS_269416] -drug cocktail dose), and Day 12 ([ADDRESS_269417] -
drug cocktail dose).
Patients will receive single 80 -mg doses of ixekizumab on Day 15 (Week 2), Day 29 (Week 4), Day 43 (Week 6), 
Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 71 (Week 10) of Period 2 .  Patients will be admitted to the CRU on Day 84 (±2 days) 
and receive 80 mg ixekizumab and the drug cocktail on the following morning (Day 85; Week 12).  Patients will 
reside at the CRU until Day 86 and may  be discharged from the CRU following collection of the 24 hour PK 
samples, at the discretion of the investigator.  Patients will return to the CRU as outpatients for collection of 
additional drug cocktail PK samples and safety assessments, as applicable, on Day 87 ([ADDRESS_269418] -drug cocktail 
dose), Da y 88 ([ADDRESS_269419] -drugcocktail dose), and Day 89 ([ADDRESS_269420] -drug cocktail dose).  Patients will 
attend a follow -up visit on Day  113 (±4 days; Week 16).  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_57973] ( AEs), clinical la boratory parameters, 
vital signs, physical examination, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self Report (16 items)
(QIDS -SR16), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) and Lilly  Self-Harm Supplement responses, and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) .  
Treatment Arms and Duration:   
In Period 1, patients will receive a single oral dose of drug cocktail (with single oral doses of 1 mg midazolam, 
10mg warfarin [+ 10 mg vitamin K], 30 mg dextromethorphan, 20 mg omeprazole, and 100 mg caffeine) on Day [ADDRESS_269421] -drug cocktail dose (Day 5).
In Period 2, patients will receive a 160 -
mg SCdose of ixekizumab (administered as 2 x 80 -mg SC injections) on 
Day 1, followed by 80 -mg SC doses ever y 2 weeks from Day 15 ( Week 2) through Day 85(Week 12).  On Day [ADDRESS_269422] -
drug cocktail dose ( Days12 and 89).  
Patients will attend a follow -up visit at Week 16 .
I1F-MC-RHBU (a)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 10
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)Number of Patients:  
Approximately 30patients willbe enrolled with the assumption that 21 patients complete the study .  
Statistical Analysis:
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for midazolam and 1- hydroxymidazolam , S-warfarin, dextromethorphan and 
dextro rphan, omeprazole and [ADDRESS_269423] treatments and will be analyzed separately .Data for each drug will also be analyzed separately after single or 
multiple doses of ixekizumab.   For the primary analysis, log -transformed C maxand AUC(0 -∞) estimates will be 
evaluated in a linear mixed -effects analysis of varian ce model with a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect 
for patient.  The treatment differences will be back-transformed to present ratios of geometric least squares means 
and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) .  
Safety parameters tha t will be assessed include clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and C -SSRS scores.  
Theparameters will be listed, and summarized using standard descriptive statistics.

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)3.Introduction
3.1. Study Rationale
Psori asis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease in which elevated levels of proinflammatory  
cytokines are observed.  Elevated proinflammatory cytokines can lead to disease -drug 
interact ions by [CONTACT_57976] n and activit y of som e cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, 
thereby [CONTACT_223958] (Wang et al. 2014).  Thus, 
treatm ent of psoriasis wit h biological products that reduce inflammat ion could theoreti cally
reduce el evations in cytokines and in turn affect CYP activit y.  It is current ly unknown if 
treatm ent wi th a biologic agent affect ing the interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_269425]  has the potenti al to 
influe nce CYP activit y as has been seen with anti -IL-6 or anti -Tum or Necrosis Factor agents.
In vitro assays demonstrated that IL -17 inhibit ion by [CONTACT_223959]; however, while the use of in vitro assays to predic t risk of clinical 
drug-drug interactions (DDI) is well established for small molecule chemical ent ities, the utilit y 
of in vitro assays to predict clinical DDI with bio logic agents has been inconsistent, and thus not 
yet routinely accepted by [CONTACT_223960] o f clinical studies for bio logic agents 
that may  affect cy tokines . This study  therefore seeks to evaluate the effect of single and mult iple 
doses of ixekizumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, 
and CYP1 A2 substrates midazo lam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, and caffeine, 
respectively ,in pat ients with moderate -to-severe psoriasis.  
3.2. Background
Ixekizumab (LY2439821) is an immunoglobulin subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal ant ibody  that 
binds wit h affin ity (<3 pM) and specificit y to IL-17A, a proinflammatory  cytokine.  El evated 
levels o f IL-17A have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variet y of autoimmune diseases, 
including psoriasis.  
Ixekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with mode rate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who 
are candidates for systemic therapy  or phototherapy  and is administered by  [CONTACT_6567] (SC) 
inject ion.  The recommended dose is 160 mg (two [ADDRESS_269426] ions) at Week 0, fo llowed by 
80mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80 mg every 4 weeks thereafter .  
In psoriasis pat ients, the mean (geometric coefficient of variat ion [CV% ]) half -life was 13 days 
(40%) as determined fro m a popul ation PKanalysis.  Following a single SCdose of 160 mg in 
subjects wi th plaque psori asis, ixekizumab reached peak mean concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 
4 day s postdose.   
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
As of the cut- off date for the current invest igator’s brochure (IB), more than 4950 patients 
(4209 psoriasis pat ients, 532 rheumatoid arthrit is patients, and 209 psoriat ic arthritis patients) 
have received at least 1 dose of ixekizumab.  
There were 11 deaths among all ixekizumab -treated pati ents (8 am ong psori asis pat ients), wi th 
none of these considered to be rel ated to ixekizumab treatment.  In an integrated analysis of data 
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 20
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)from all psori asis studi es, a total  of 411 ixekizumab -treated pati ents (9.8%) reported at least 
1serious adverse event (SAE).  The individual SAE preferred terms with an incidence ≥0.2% 
included:  cellulit is (0.4%), fall (0.3%), my ocardial  infarct ion (0.3%), osteoarthrit is (0.3%), acute 
myocardial  infarct ion (0.2%), chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease (0.2%), nephrolit hiasis 
(0.2%), suicide attempt (0.2%), prostate cancer (0.2%), and coronary  artery  disease (0.2%).
The percentage of psoriasis pat ients reporting at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) was greater for each ixekizumab treatment group than for that of the placebo group; 
46.8% of pl acebo -treated patients repo rted ≥1 TEAE, compared to 58.6% of patients treated with 
80mg ixekizumab eit her once every [ADDRESS_269427] TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y.  Overall, severe TEAEs were similar across the 
ixekizumab and placebo -treated group.  
More informat ion about the known and exp ected benefits, ri sks, SAEs, and reasonably  
anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ixekizumab are to be found in the IB and the Package Insert .  
Inform ation about the known and expected benefit s, risks, SAEs, and reasonably anticipated AEs 
for each of the coc ktail drugs are to be found in each drug’s respective Package Insert.

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)5.Study  Design
5.1. Overall Design
This is a 2- period, fixed -sequence, open -label, multi -center, Phase 1 study  to assess the effects of 
single and multiple doses of ixekizumab on the PK of a drug cocktail o f CYP substrates 
(midazolam, warfarin, dextrom ethorphan, om eprazol e, and caffeine) inpatients wi th 
moderate -to-severe psoriasis .  
Patients will  be admi tted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day  -1of Period 1 and receive 
the drug cocktail, wit h single oral doses of 1 mg midazo lam, 10 m g warfarin (+ 10 mg 
vitamin K), [ADDRESS_269428] igator.  Patients 
will ret urn to the CRU as outpatients for collection of PK samples and safe ty assessments, as 
applicable, on Day  
3(48hours post -drug cocktail dose), Day  4(72hours post -drug cocktail 
dose), and Day 5([ADDRESS_269429] -drug cocktail dose).
Patients will  attend the CRU as outpatients on Day 1 of Period 2 (3 to 7 day s after Day  5 of 
Period1) and receive a 160 -mg dose of ixekizumab (administered as two [ADDRESS_269430] ions). 
Patients will  be admi tted to the CRU on Day  7(±2 day s)of Period 2 and receive the drug 
cocktail on the following morning (Day 8; Week 1) .  Patients will reside at the CRU until Day [ADDRESS_269431] igator.  Patients will r eturn to the CRU as outpatients for collection of PK 
samples and safe ty assessments, as applicable, on Day  10(48hours post -drug cocktail dose), 
Day 11(72hours post -drug cocktail dose), and Day 12([ADDRESS_269432] -drug cocktail dose).
Patients will receiv e single 80 -mg doses of ixekizumab on Day  15 (Week 2), Day 29 (Week 4), 
Day 43 (Week 6), Day  57 (Week 8) , and Day  71 (Week 10) of Period 2.  Patients will be 
admitted to the CRU on Day  84(±2 days) and receive 80mg ixekizumab and the drug cocktail 
on the following morning (Day 
85;Week 12).  Patients will reside at the CRU until Day 86and 
may be discharged from the CRU fo llowing collecti on of  the [ADDRESS_269433] igator.  Patients will return to the CRU as outpatients for collection of 
additional drug cocktail PK samples and safet y assessments, as applicable, on Day  
87([ADDRESS_269434]-drug cocktail dose), Day 88(72hours post -drug cocktail dose), and Day 89([ADDRESS_269435]-drug cocktail dose).  
Blood sampl ingfor assessment of inflammatory  biom arkers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL -19,and Tumor 
Necrosis Factor ) and ixekizumab PK and immunogenicit y will be conducted at prespecified 
visits.Concentrations of IL-
17A will not be m easured asit com plexes wi th ixekizumab , and
therefore correlates with the PKof ixekizumab.   Interl eukin -17A drives production of IL -19 in 
keratinocy tes of  psori atic skin. C-reactive protein will also be used as an inflammatory  
biomarker andis co llected as part of the clinical laboratory testing. Efficacy will be evaluated 
using static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) , Psoriasis Area Severi ty Index (PASI) , and 
percentage of body  surface area (BSA) assessments at prespecified visits .

Approximately [ADDRESS_269436] scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f 
Activities(Secti on 2) f or the last patient.
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This is an open -label study .  Blinding is not necessary  because the primary  endpoint is PK and 
thus not vulnerable to patient or invest igator bias.  The fixed
-sequence design is used due to the 
long half -life o f ixekizumab.  
This study  will be conducted in patients with moderate -to-severe plaque psori asis as this is the 
patient popul ation for who m ixekizumab treatment is indicated; conduct ing the study in this 
popul ation allows the assessment of the effect of ixekizumab on CYP enzymes expressed at 
clinically relevant levels.
Regulatory  agencies recommend conduct ing a clinical drug interac tion study  using a drug 
cocktail approach when interactions wit h multiple CYPs are investigated ( European Medicines 
Agency [ EMA ]Guideline 2012; Food and Drug Administration [FDA] 2012, PMDA Draft 
Guideline 2013).  Drugs used in such a cocktail should be s elect ive for the specific CYP 
enzymes, should not interact with each other, and ult imately should be safe when administered.  
One such drug cocktail is a modified 5+1 Cooperstown cocktail which includes midazo lam 
(CYP3A), warfarin (CYP2C9), dextromethorpha n (CYP2D6), omeprazo le (CYP2C19), caffeine 
(CYP1A2), and vitamin K (to counter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin), and has been 
administered in previous studies (Goh et al 2010; Ma et al 2006).  The drug cocktail will be 
administered prior to init iation of ixekizumab dosing and again on Day 8 (Week 1) of Period 2, 
to assess the effect of a single dose of ixekizumab , and on Day 85(Week 12) of Peri od2, when
steady -state concentrations of ixekizumab shoul d be achieved .  
The total required blood vo lume 
of 650 mL is considered acceptable given th at blood sam ples are taken during the course of the 
study  which has a minimum durat ion of approximately 17 weeks .  
5.5. Justification for Dose
Drug cocktail containing 1 mg midazolam, 10 mg warfarin (+ 10 mg vitamin K), [ADDRESS_269437] been used concomitant ly 
in 
previous clinical studies .  
The 1 m g oral  dose of midazol am used f or this study  is lower than the 5 m g oral  dose that has 
been used in some published cocktail studies .  Use of 1 mg benefit s pati ent safet y since this dose 
does not result in conscious sedat ionyet still provides sufficient exposure to midazo lam to assess 
midazo lam PK.

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.Study  Assessments and Procedures
Secti on [ADDRESS_269478] document their review of ea ch laboratory  safety  report.
9.1. Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy will be evaluated using sPGA, PASI, and percentage of BSA assessments (see 
Secti on9.6)according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2) .  
9.2. Adverse Events
Invest igators are responsibl e for monitoring the safety  of patients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for th e appropri ate medical care of pat ients during the study
.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational 
product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before 
completing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with 
appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained.  The frequency o f follow-up 
evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator.
After the ICF is signed, study  site personnel will record, via eCRF, the occurrence and nature of 
each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically signif icant si gns and symptoms of the 
disease under treatment in the study .  Addi tionally , site personnel will record any  change in the 
condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  
The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y 
of being related to study  treatm ent, or a study  procedure, taking into account the disease, 
concomitant treatment, or pathologies.  
A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the 
invest igational product or study  procedure and the AE.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 43
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an A E, study  site personnel  
must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.
9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
events considered significant by  [CONTACT_223969] m edical events that may not result in dea th, be life threatening, or require 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_223953], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcom es listed in this defi nition.  Exam ples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias 
or convulsio ns that do not result in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly, or its designee, of any  SAE wi thin [ADDRESS_269479] 
discontinued fro m and/or com pleted the study  (the patient summary eCRF has been completed).  
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has 
been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  possibly  related to the 
study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly .  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to investigat ional product) does not meet the definit ion 
of an AE.  However, to fulfill regulatory  requi rements any pregnancy  should be reported 
following the SAE p rocess to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies a s related to investigational product or procedure.  
[LOCATION_002] [ADDRESS_269480] ive 2001/20/EC and the 
associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory  requirements in parti cipat ing countries 
requi re the reportin g of S[LOCATION_003]Rs .  Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated 
detailed guidances.
9.2.2. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products used in clinical trials in order to 
ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product 
improvements.
Patients shoul d be instructed to con tact the invest igator as soon as possible if he or she ha s a 
complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed.
9.3. Treatment of Overdose
For the purposes of this study , an overdose of ixekizumab is any  dose above that assi gned.  
Doses of up to [ADDRESS_269481] ivities (Section 2).  
9.4.2. Vital Signs
For each patient, vital sign measurements (standing and supi[INVESTIGATOR_132173], and body 
temperature) shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Activit ies (Secti on
 2).
Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured standing and after at least [ADDRESS_269482] igator.
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 45
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.4.3. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, ECGs should be co llected according to the Sche dule of Activit ies (Secti on 2).  
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the 
patient receives the first dose of the invest igational product, should be reported to Lilly, or its 
designee, as an AE via eCRF.  
For each patient, a single 12-lead di gital ECG will  be collected according to the Schedule of 
Activities (Section
 2).  Electrocardi ograms m ust be recorded before collecting any  blood f or 
safet y or PK tests.   
Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044]  [ADDRESS_269483] ion as possible, and ideally while 
the pati ent is still present, to determine whether the patient meets entry  criteria at the rel evant
visit(s) and for immediate patient management, should any  clinically rel evant findings be 
ident ified.  
If a clinically significant finding is ident ified (including, but not limited to, changes in QT/QT 
corrected for heart rate interval from baseline) aft er enrollment, the invest igator will determine if 
the pati ent can continue in the study .  The invest igator, or qualified designee, is responsible for 
determining if any change in pat ient management is needed, and must document his/her review 
of the ECG pri nted at the time of co llection.  Any  new clinically  relevant finding shoul d be 
reported as an AE.
9.4.4. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self Report 
(16-Items)
The QIDS -SR16 is a self -administered, 16 -item instrum ent intended to assess the existence and 
severit y of symptom s of depressio n as listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s 
Diagnostic and Stati stical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4thEdition (DSM -IV) (APA 1994).  
Apatient is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way  they  have felt for the past 
7days.  There i s a 4-point scale for each item ranging fro m 0 to 3.  The 16 items corresponding 
to 9 depression domains are summed to give a single score ranging fro m 0 to 27, with higher 
scores denoting greater symptom severit y.  The domains assessed by [CONTACT_223970]:  
(1)sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self-criticism, (4) suicidal ideat ion, (5) interest, 
(6)energy/fatigue, (7) sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late inso mnia or hypersomnia), 
(8)decrease/increase i n appeti te/weight, and (9) psycho motor agi tation/retardati on.  Addi tional 
inform ation and the QIDS -SR16 questions can be found at the Universit y of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_223954]/QIDS i nternet page (http://www.ids -qids.org).
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 46
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.4.5. Columbia -Suicide Severity Scale
Any occurrence of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors will be assessed as indicated in the 
Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on 2) using the C -SSRS . The C -SSRS is ascale that capt ures the 
occurrence, severit y, and f requency  of suicidal ideati on and/or behavior during the assessment 
period.  The scal e includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to 
determine if suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred.  T he C-SSRS is administered by [CONTACT_223971] 1 y ear of  patient care/clinical 
experience . The tool  was developed by  [CONTACT_223972] (NIMH) tri al 
group (TASA) for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm 
of Suicide Assessment ( C CASA )categori zation of  suicidal  events.  
The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS.  If a 
suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS ,but was not captured during the 
nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form.  If an event is serious or leads to 
discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should 
be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed.
Terms captured by  [CONTACT_179708] C -SSRS can be mapped to C CASA (Posner et al . 2007) to 
facilitate future pooling of data .  
The first time the scale is administered in this study , the C-SSRS “Baseline ” versi on will be used, 
and the findings will constitute the baseline assessment. The C -SSRS “Since Last Visit ” scale 
will be used for all subsequent assessments. If a suicide -related thought or behavior is ident ified 
at any  time during the study , a thorough evaluation will be performed by a study  physician, and 
appropriate medical care will be provided. It is recommended that a patient be assessed by a 
psychiatrist or appropriately  trained professio nal to assist in deciding whether the patientshould 
be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent (Secti on
 8.1).  A patientdoes not necessarily have to be 
discontinued if they have self -injuri ous behav ior that woul d be classified as non -suicidal 
self-injuri ous behavior.   Of course, if this situat ion arises, it is recommended that the patient be 
referred to a psy chiatri st or appropri ately trained professio nal.
The Lilly Self -Harm  Supplement shoul d be com pleted every  time the C -SSRS is administered.
If, based on administration of the C -SSRS, i t is determined that suicide -related behaviors have 
occurred, then the Lilly Self -Harm  Follow-Up form will be used to collect additional informat ion 
to allow for a m ore com plete assessment of these behaviors.
9.4.6. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CP or CRP/clinical research scient ist will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of 
the study .
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by [CONTACT_17069].  The Lilly CP or 
research physician will consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical research scient ist when appropriate, and periodically 
review:

AEs 
If a study  patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3×ULN, ALP ≥2×ULN , or el evated TBL
≥2×ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be init iated by  [CONTACT_3170].  Details for 
hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  test
abnorm alities.  To ensure patient safety  and com pliance wi th regul atory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly designated CRP regarding collect ion of specific 
recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests (Appendix 4 ).
9.4.7. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Assessments
Data on suspected inflammatory  bowel  disease, as ident ified by [CONTACT_223973]’s disease, will be co llected and the events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_223974] (CEC) made up of gastro enterologists with expertise in 
inflammatory  bowel  disease. The role of the CEC is to adjudicate defined clinical events, in a 
blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner throughout the course of a study .  The importance of 
the CEC is to ensure that all events that have been reported are evaluated uniformly by a single 
group.
9.4.8. Immunogenicity Assessments
Blood sam ples f or immunogenicit y testing will  be collected todetermin eantibody  producti on 
against ixekizumab.  Addit ional samples may  be collected if there is a possibilit y that an AE is 
immuno logically mediated.  
Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a va lidated assay  designed to detect anti drug ant ibodies in 
the presence o f ixekizumab.  Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their 
abilit y to neutralize the activit y of ixekizumab.  Immunogenicit y samples may also be analyzed 
for ixeki zumab serum concentration to facilitate in the interpretation o f the immunogenicit y data.
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_269484] ivities (Sec tion 2), separate venous blood 
samples of approximately 2 mL each will be collected to determine the plasma concentrations of 
midazo lamand i ts metabolite 1-hydroxymidazo lam, S-warfarin, dextromethorphan and i ts 
metabo lite dextrorphan, omeprazo leand i ts metaboli te 5-hydroxy omeprazo le, and caffeine and 
its metabo lite paraxanthine .  Sam ples of approximately 3 mL will be collected to determine the 
serum concentrati ons of ixekizumab.  Instructions for the collection and handling of blood 
samples will be provided by  [CONTACT_456] .  The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each 
sampling will be recorded.
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 48
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.5.1. Bioanalysis
Samples will  be analyzed at a l aboratory  designated by  [CONTACT_456].  Pl asma concentrati ons of 
each analyte in the drug cocktail will be assayed using a validated method.  Serum 
concentrations of ixekizumab will be measured using a validated enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay method.  
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure drug concentrations will be retained for a maximum 
of [ADDRESS_269485] pati ent visi t for the study .  
9.6. Pharmacodynamics
The PASI, sPGA , and percent BSA are considered pharmacodynamic measures of disease 
activi tyin this study .
The PASI is themostcommonly used primary endpoin tand measure of psoriasis severi tyin 
clinical trials (EMA 2004; Menter et al. 2008).  The PASI combines assessments of the extent of 
BSA involvement in4anatomica lregions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severi tyof 
desquama tion, erythema ,and plaque indura tion/ infiltration (thickness) in ea chregion, yielding 
an overall score of 0 for no psoriasis to 72 for severe disease (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978).  
Thestatic Physician Glo bal Assessment (sPGA) is the physician’s glo bal assessment of the 
patient’s psori asis (Ps) l esions evaluated at a given time po int (European Medicines Agency 
[EMA] 2004 [WWW]).  Plaques are assessed for indurat ion, ery thema, and scalin g, and an 
overall rat ing of psoriasis severit y is given using the anchors of clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), 
moderate (3), severe (4), or very  severe (5).
Percent BSA will be evaluated as the percent invo lvement of ps oriasis on each pat ient’s BSA on 
a continuous scale fro m 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), where 1% 
corresponds to the size of the patient’s hand (including the palm, fingers, and thumb) (National 
Psori asis Foundat ion 2009 ).
Data will be co llected at the times shown in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2).
9.7. Genetics
A blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as speci fied in the Schedule o f 
Activities, where local regulations allow.  
Samples will  notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either 
now or in the future.  Samples will be used to investigate variable response to ixekizumab an d to 
investigate genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in psoriasis.  Assessment of variable response 
may include evaluation o f AEs or differences in efficacy.  
All samples will be coded with the patient number.  These samples and any data generated can
be linked back to the patient only by [CONTACT_154722].  
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_269486] patient visit, or for a shorter 
period if local  regulat ions and/or ERBs/institutional review boards impose shorter time limits, 
for the study  at a facilit y selected by [CONTACT_223975].  Thi s retenti on peri od enables use of 
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 49
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)new techno logies, response to regulatory  quest ions, and invest igation of variable response that 
may not be observed until later in the develop ment of ixekizumab.  
Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the [ADDRESS_269487] ivities (Secti on 2) where l ocal regulat ions allow.
Samples will  be used for measurement of the inflammatory  biomarkers, IL -1β, IL -6, IL-19,and 
Tumor Necrosi s Factor .  C-reactive protein is collected as part of the clinical laboratory testing 
panel and may  also be used as an exploratory  biomarker.   Samples may also b e used for research 
on the drug target, disease process, variable response to ixekizumab, pathways associated with 
psori asis, m echanism  of action of  ixekizumab, and/or research method, or for validat ing 
diagnosti c tool s or assay (s) rel ated to psori asis.  A ll samples will be coded with the patient 
number.  These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by [CONTACT_223976].  
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_269488] patient visit, or for a shorter 
period if local  regulat ions and/or ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by  [CONTACT_57990].

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)10. Statistical Considerations and Data A nalysis
10.1. Sample Size Determin ation
Approxi mately 30patients will be enrolled with the assumption that [ADDRESS_269489] variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 16.1% and 
26.4%, respectively  (derived from  a previ ous study).  B ased on this assumpt ion, 21 patients will 
provi de a preci sion of 0.1 and 0.17 on a log-scale forAUC and C max, respectively.  This woul d 
resul t in a 90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of the rati o of the geom etric means 
for AUC and Cmaxis no larger than 9. 8% and 15.3%, respectively.  .  
Warfarin
For S -warfarin AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 7% and 8%, 
respectively  (Steinijans et al .1995).  Based on these estimates, 21 patients will provide a 
preci sion of 0.045 and 0.049 on a log-scale forAUC and C max, respectively.  This woul d resul t 
in a90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of the rati o of the geom etric means for
AUC and C maxis no larger than 4.4 % and 4.8 %, respect ively.   
Dextromethorph an
For dextrom ethorphan AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 
33.5% and 32.1%, respectively (derived fro m a previous study ).  Based on these est imates, 
21patients will provide a precisi on of 0.206 and 0.197 on a log-scale forAUC and C max, 
respectively .  
This would result in a 90% probability  that the half -width of the 90% CI of the 
ratio of the geom etric means forAUC and C maxis no larger than 18.6% and 17.9%, respectively.   
Omeprazole
For om eprazo le AUC and C max, the intra subject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 21.8% and 
29.8%, respectively  (Public Assessment Report 1 Omeprazole “Copyfarm” Omeprazole).  Based 
on these assumptions, 21 patients will provide a precisi on of 0.135 and 0.184 on a log-scale for
AUC and C max, respectively.  This would result in a 90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 
90% CI of the rati o of the geom etric means forAUC and C maxis no larger than 12.6% and 
16.8%, respectively.   
Caffeine
For caffeine AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y(CV) was est imated to be 21.0% 
(Blanchard and Sawers 1983) and 23.4% (Turpault et al. 2009), respectively.  Based on these 
estimates, 21 patients will provide a precisi on of 0.13 and 0.148 on a log-scale forAUC and 
Cmax, respectively.  This would result in a90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of 
the rati o of the geom etric means is no larger than 12.
2% and 13. 8%, respectively.

distribut ion may be reported.  
Exploratory  analyses of the metabo lite to parent rati os m ay be conducted.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Statistical Inference
Pharmacokinet ic parameter estimates of cocktail drugs will be evaluated to delineate the effects 
of drug interaction.  Midazo lam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, omeprazo le, and caffeine 
administered in the absence of ixekizumab will represent the reference treatments and will be 
analyzed separately .  Each drug administe red wi th ixekizumab will represent the test treatments
and will be analyzed separately .Data for each drug will also be analyzed separately after single 
or multiple doses of ixekizumab .  For the primary  analysis, l og-transform ed C maxand AUC(0 -∞) 
estimate s will be evaluated in a linear mixed -effects analysis of variance model wit h a fixed 
effect for treatment and a random effect for patient.  The treatment differences will be 
back-transformed to present ratios of geometric least squares means and the corre sponding 90% 
CIs. 
The AUC (0-tlast)will be analyzed using the same method described above.
The t maxwill be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Estimates of the median difference 
based on the observed medians, 90% CI, and p

Summary
Evaluation of the Effect of Ixekizumab on the 
Pharmacokinetics of Cytochrome P450 Substrates in 
Patients with Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Overview
Protocol  I1F-MC-RHBU, Evaluat ion of the Effect of Ixekizumab on the Pharmacokinetics of 
Cytochrom e P450 Substrates in Patients with Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis ,has been 
amended.  The new protocol is indicated by  [CONTACT_58000] (a ) and will be used to conduct the 
study  in place of any preceding versio n of the protocol.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows:
In Section 1, text in the “Treat ment Arm s and Durati on” sect ion a ty pographic error was 
correct to remove a minus sign and to indicate dose of drug cocktail occurs on Day 1.
In Section 1, confidence interval related text in the “Statist ical Analysis” sect ion was 
deleted based upon regulatory  feedback.
In Section 2, the Schedule o f Activities for Peri od 2 was updated to rem ove the ± 2d text 
from the D8, D9, D10, D11, and D12 columns; this change makes the schedule of 
activit ies consistent with footnote g.
In Section 6. 1,inclusio n criterion [ADDRESS_269497] dose of ixekizumab received in the study and a 
typographic error was corrected .
In Section 9.6, text describing how lesio ns are categori zed by [CONTACT_223980].
In Section 10.1, a typographical error was corrected and text related to the confidence 
intervals was updated based upon regulatory  feedback.  
In Section [IP_ADDRESS], text related to the confidence intervals for Cmaxand AUC(0 -∞)was 
deleted based upon regulatory  feedback .
In Section 10.3.3, text was deleted in order to be consistent with the SAP.

9.6.  Pharmacodynamics 
The stati c Physician Glo bal Assessment (sPGA ) is the physician’s glo bal assessment of the 
patient’s psori asis (Ps) l esions evaluated at a given time po int (European Medicines Agency 
[EMA] 2004 [WWW]).  Plaques are assessed for indurat ion, ery thema, and scaling, and an 
overall rat ing of psoriasis sev erity is given using the anchors of   The sPGA is a physician’s 
assessment of the patient’s psoriasis lesio ns overall at a given time point.  The sPGA is 
recommended as an endpo int for assessing efficacy  in the treatm ent of  psori asis (EMA 2004).  
Overall le sions are graded for indurat ion, ery thema, and scaling; and the sum of the 3 scores is 
divided by 3 to obtain a final sPGA score (range 0 to 5).  For the analysis of responder rates, the 
sPGA scores are rounded to the nearest whole number, and the patient’ s psori asis is assessed as
clear(0), minimal (1), mild (2), m oderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5).  
10.1.  Sample Size Determination
Approxi mam tely30patients will be enrolled with the assumption that 21 com plete the study .  
For each of the fo llowing drugs, a l ack of  drug to drug interaction will be declared if the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the least squares means for both area under the 
concentration versus t ime curve (AUC) and maximum observed drug concentration (C max) of 
parent drug are contained wit hin the limit s 0.[ADDRESS_269501] variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 16.1% and 
26.4%, respectively  (derived from  a previ ous study).  Based on this assumpt ion, 21 patients will 
provi de a preci sion of 0.1 and 0.17 on a l og-scale for AUC and C max, respectively.  This would 
resul t in a 90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of the ratio of the geometric means 
for AUC and C maxis no larger than 9.8% and 15.3%, respectively .    98% chance of declaring 
lack of drug interaction assuming a ratio equal to 1.05.  
Warfarin
I1F-MC-RHBU (a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 73
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)For S -warfarin AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 7% and 8%, 
respectively  (Steinijans et al .1995).  Based on these estimates, 21 patients will provide a 
preci sion of 0.045 and 0.049 on a l og-scale for AUC and C max, respectively.  This would result 
in a 90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of the ratio of the geometric means for 
AUC and C maxis no larger than 4.4% an d 4.8%, respect ively. greater than 99% chance of 
declaring lack of drug interaction assuming a ratio equal to 1.05.  
Dextromethorphan
For dextrom ethorphan AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 
33.5% and 32.1%, respectively (de rived from  a previ ous study ).  Based on these est imates, 
21patients will provide a precisi on of 0.206 and 0.197 on a l og-scale for AUC and C max, 
respectively .  This woul d resul t in a 90% probability  that the half -width of the 90% CI of the 
ratio of the ge ometric means for AUC and C maxis no larger than 18.6% and 17.9%, 
respectively ..90% chance o f declaring lack of drug interaction assuming a ratio equal to 1.05.  
Omeprazole
For om eprazo le AUC and C max, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to b e 21.8% and 
29.8%, respectively  (Public Assessment Report 1 Omeprazole “Copyfarm” Omeprazole).  Based 
on these assumptions, 21 patients will provide a precisi on of 0.135 and 0.184 on a log -scale for 
AUC and C max, respectively.  This would result in a 90% p robabilit y that the half -width of the 
90% CI of the ratio of the geometric means for AUC and C maxis no larger than 12.6% and 
16.8%, respectively .a 95% chance of declaring lack of interaction assuming a ratio equal to 
1.05.  
Caffeine
For caffeine AUC and Cmax, the intrasubject variabilit y (CV) was est imated to be 21.0% 
(Blanchard and Sawers 1983) and 23.4% (Turpault et al. 2009), respectively.  Based on these 
estimates, 21 patients will provide a precisi on of 0.13 and 0.148 on a log- scale for AUC and 
Cmax, respectively.  This would result in a 90% probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% CI of 
the rati o of the geom etric means is no l arger than 12.2% and 13.8%, respectively .greater than 
99% chance of declaring lack of drug interaction assuming a ratio eq ual to 1.05 .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Statistical Inference
For each drug administered with ixekizumab, if the CIs for both C maxand AUC(0 -∞) of parent 
drug are contained within the 0.7 and 1.43 limits, a no drug -drug interaction will be declared for 
that drug and ixekizumab .
10.3.3 .  Exploratory A nalyses
A repeated -measure mixed model will be used to summarize the changes over time in 
exploratory  biomarkers after ixekizumab dosing in Period 2.  The model may  include baseline,

 2 INTRODUCTION : BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE   
2.1 Background Information 
Chronic emotional distress can lead to detrimental biological outcomes, 
presumably via alterations in the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_335979] (HPA axis), a sympathetic bias of the autonomic nervous system, and inflammatory 
dysregulation.
1  At the cellular level, impairment of the telomere/telomerase 
system may be a result of this dysregulation,  given the descriptions of shorter 
telomeres (a marker of cellular aging), as well as increased markers of inflammation, in subjects with depression, anxiety and PTSD, compared to aged 
matched healthy populations .
2-[ADDRESS_414946] not been well studied. In this study we aim to use an auricular CES 
intervention to improve emotional well-being by [CONTACT_335997] - 
specifically, telomere length and telome rase activity.   
This feasibility study was initially developed to study Veterans specifically, 
however, due to difficulty with recruitment in the Veteran population  the study 
inclusion criteria were adjusted to include non-Veteran eligible male subjects and 
appropriate modifications were made in the  regulatory documents. 
2.2 Rationale 
Auricular CES, anxiety and depression 
Auricular CES benefits centrally mediated symptoms such as anxie ty, 
depression, insomnia and pain; however, the mechanism by [CONTACT_335998]. Similar to auricular electro -acupuncture, auricular 
CES is believed to act on subcortical brain structures, including the thalamus and limbic regions. This concept is supported by [CONTACT_335999].
6-[ADDRESS_414947] treatment subjects had pain reductions as well as decreased blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) response in the basal ganglia and 
parahippocampal gyrus compared to subject  treated with a sham device.
[ADDRESS_414948] 50% in 67% of patients 
with generalized anxiety disorder using auricular CES in an open label study for [ADDRESS_414949] sizes (d=.8 and d=.94).
[ADDRESS_414950] symptoms that lead to impaired emotional wellbeing in Veterans, we chose in this proposal to evaluate a composite measure of emotional distress 
(a combined anxiety and depression  score) as the primary outcome. Beyond 
depression and anxiety, CES has been associated with reductions in  insomnia 
and pain, both of which are also significant problems in Veterans, likely 
contributing to reduced emotional well -being.
14, 20- 22 Data collected during 
program evaluation at a GLA affiliated (Veterans Integrat ed Service Network 22) 
VA Medical Center, use of CES in Veterans with comorbid PTSD, anxiety and 
depressive symptoms showed improvements in the Beck Depression  Inventory, 
Beck Anxiety Index, and Insomnia Severity Index after a 1 week open label trial 
of 40 -60 minutes of auricular CES per day (personal communication, Meredith 
Avedon, PsyD). While the published literature is still immature, we anticipate that CES may be a particularly useful treatment in the Veteran and non -Veteran 
populations given that it may target multiple symptoms causing emotional distress. 
Cellular aging, anxiety, and depression  
Telomeres are repeating DNA -protein complexes that cap the ends of 
chromosomes, protecting the DNA from damage during replication. The terminal 
end of the telomere shortens with successive replication as the cell ages. This 
aging can be accelerated in settings of stress, including symptoms of emotional distress such as anxiety and de pression.
[ADDRESS_414951] 
been associated with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and unhealthy lifestyles, all common conditions in OIF/OEF Veterans.
2-5 Little is known about telomere length 
and telomerase activity in Veterans specifically, though PTSD in Veterans has been associated with telomere shortening.
5 The mechanism through which 
affective symptoms and emotional stress lead to peripheral changes in the telomere/telomerase system has not been completely elucidated but is likely t he 
result of a dysregulated hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_335979], impaired anti -
inflammatory pathways, and a sympathetic shift of the autonomic nervous 
system, all leading to greater cellular stress. It is unclear whether reductions in telomere length creat e a permanent "biological scar" during periods of systemic 
stress or whether compensatory increases in telomerase can lengthen the telomeres, as there is contradictory evidence for bot h situations in human 
studies.
[ADDRESS_414952] protected computer databases and/or locked cabinets. An 
informed consent document was approved by [CONTACT_336000] a recruitment waiver was obtained f rom the IRB at the 
Greater Los Angeles VA. All subjects will read and document unders tanding 
of the consent form prior to enrolling in the study . 
2.3.2  Potential Benefits 
This study may improve emotional well-being for individual subjects with 
proper and consecutive use of the CES device but any beneficial effects are 
not certain to occur. It is  hoped that the research will also benefit V eterans 
and individuals suffering with anxiety and/or  depression by [CONTACT_336001]. Societal benefits of this 
study include the potential addition of a non -invasive, non-medication 
treatment options for patients with anxiety and/or depression.  Cellular 
marker identification and an improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind CES therapi[INVESTIGATOR_335980].

 3 OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Study Objectives 
We anticipate significant improvements in emotional well -being a ssociated with 
eight -weeks of daily CES treatment. Scores on the individual and combined 
anxiety and depression subscales of the HADS will decrease. Improvements in 
other aspects of mental health (measured with the MHC -SF) are expected as a 
secondary effect of the improved negative affect measured in the HADS.  An increase in telomerase is expected at [ADDRESS_414953] improved 
emotional wellbeing with CES treatment. 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
3.2.1  Behavioral Measures 
1. PRIMARY OUTCOME:  The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] 
(HADS) will be used to measure emotional distress/well -being. The 
score for each of the two components will be summed to yield a composite score. The severity of emotional distress will be defined as normal range (0-7), mild (8-10), moderate (11-14) or severe (15-20).
[ADDRESS_414954] intervention score will be assessed.  
2. EXPLORATORY OUTCOME: The Mental Health Continuum Short 
Form (MHC-SF), which measures psychological and social well -being, 
will be used to assess improvements in two forms of human flourishing 
or happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], hedonic ( self-gratification) and Eudaimonic (having a 
noble purpose) well-being.27  
3. EXPLORATORY OUTCOME: PROMIS-SF measures will be collected 
to assess ancillary symptoms in the domains of: fatigue, sleep 
disturbance, sleep related impairment, and pain interference.  
4. EXPLORATORY OUTCOME: The PCL-M is a frequently used instrument to screen for PTSD in the military population, correlates well 
with a clinical interview and has been shown to be responsive to 
symptom change.

 3.2.2  Biological Measures 
The primary biological outcome will be telomerase activity determine using 
the telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), per formed as previously 
described with minor modification.28,[ADDRESS_414955]  
generated (TPG) per 10,000 PBMC is performed using ImageQuant software, which takes the fluorescence intensity within a specified 
parameter and yields a numerical value representing TPG per 10,000 cells. 
Telomere length will be determined using real time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qPCR) methodology as described previously with minor modifications.
30,31 Peripheral blood mononu clear cells (PBMC) are isolated 
and genomic DNA extracted. Using the standard curve method, cycle threshold (CT) values are plotted on a standard curve of hum an genomic 
DNA to estimate an ng/microliter concentration value. Telomere length values are expressed as the ratio of the estimated concentration generated 
by [CONTACT_336002] (T) divided by [CONTACT_336003] (S) copy 
gene = (T/S).  
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_414956] withdrawal (see 5.6.1 ). 
4.2 Study Population 
Approximately 55 male subjects will be screened in an effort to obtain 22 
subjects in each treatment group after rando mization.  Due to the difficulty with 
recruitment of eligible Veterans in this feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the study period was 
extended  and non -Veterans meeting the other inclusion criteria were rec ruited. 
The study enrollment was limited to 24 completed subjects based on insufficient 
resources to complete the study beyond the extended recruitment period .  
4.3 Study Timeframe 
The study timeframe consists of a screening period of 1-2 weeks (commencing 
between Week -2 to Week -1 and ending on Week 1; see 7.1 and 7.2) followed 
by [CONTACT_1629] 8-week treatment period (Week 1-Week 8). A flowchart showing the study 
schedule is provided in Error! Reference source not found.. 
The expected duration of subject participation is about 8 -10 weeks.. 
4.4 Randomization and Blinding 
This is a randomized, double-blinded, sham controlled study. The active and 
sham devices are identical in appearance and will only differ by [CONTACT_8486] a 
unique serial number. In the sham devices, the electrodes attached to the 
device will be inactive.  The subjects will be instructed that the device is set to a 
low level so that the current is not detectable but still effective. The current will 
not be detectable in both active and sham devices in order for adequate 
blinding to occur.  
To ensure that the allocation of subjects to treatment is properly concealed, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_335981].  The 
sponsor will provide the code to determine which devices are active and which 
are sham. Code will be in a sealed envelope that will not be opened until the 
end of data collection.

account for any changes in our analysis. We assume such changes in therapy 
will be uncommon but if they occur they will be equally balanced between the 
randomized groups.  
While participating in this research study, subjects are not allowed to take part 
in any other research project. Simultaneous medications or treatments may 
invalidate the results of this research, as well as that of the other studies.  
Changes in concomitant medication and any adverse events (see 9.1.1 ) are 
assessed at each visit, documented in subject’s file,  and reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335985].

 7 STUDY SCHEDULE 
7.1 Prescreening 
Potential subjects who respond to the study advertisement will under go a brief 
(5 to 10 minute) phone screening by [CONTACT_336008] 1. The prescreening will require potential s ubjects to 
respond verbally to approximately 10 yes/no medical history questions in order 
to determine whether a screening visit should be scheduled.  
Subjects who seem eligible and available for the duration of the study w ill be 
scheduled for a screening v isit at OCNS. 
7.2 Enrollment/Baseline Screening (Visit 1) This visit will occur at the Oppenheimer Family Center for Neurobiology of 
Stress. It will take about 3 hours to complete the screening and device training 
process. The  research team will verify OEF/OIF Veteran status (i.e. DD 214) 
before study enrollment  if the subject identifies as a Veteran. The potential 
subjects will first review and sign ICF and HIPAA Authorization with eit her the 
RN, FNP, or MD. All are certified to obtain informed consent (nursin g or 
physician license). Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_336018], as possibly 
eligible after the clinic visit and the study questionnaires have been completed 
and scored. Medical history will be reviewed and a physical will be performed 
as well. The assessment questionnaires include : 
• A standardized psychiatric evaluation (MINI)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)  
• Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) 
• Patient Reported Outcomes Measur ement Information System 
(PROMIS-29) 
• Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (PANAS -SF) 
• Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD -RISC)

 • Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Self Report Screener 
- Recent 
We will use the HADS to assess symptom severity defined as normal range (0 -
7), mild (8-10), moderate (11-14) or severe (15-20). Subjects with impaired 
emotional wellbeing as  defined as a minimum combined HADS score of 14 will 
be included. Subjects who score >15 will be excluded in the study and will be 
given referrals to their personal provider or community mental h ealth resources. 
(See “Reporting Suicidal Ideation” Section 5.4) 
Subjects who express interest in participating and meet the inclusion criteria will be trained to use the CES device. They will be instructed that the device is set 
to a low level that should not be detectable . Subjects will have their first 1 hour 
treatment at OCNS  (commencing Week 1 of the study). Subjects who tolerate 
the device treatment will then have blood drawn for baseline biological 
measures. They will be informed that this is a randomized controlled trial and  
they may or may not have an active device kit. Subjects will be sent home with a device, instructions for daily treatment, and a patient diary to track usage  and 
side effects if applicable.

 8 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 
8.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations 
Electronic assessment questionnaire data will be collected from subjects during 
the visits at UCLA OCNS using SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com) and 
unique subject identifiers . Survey Monkey states they utilize some of the most 
advanced technology for Internet security commercially available today. Unique usernames and passwords are required and must be entered each time a user 
logs on. When a user accesses secured areas of our site, Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) technology protects user information using both server 
authentication and data encryption, ensuring that user data is safe,  secure, and 
available only to authorized persons. Servers are kept in a locked cage. Digital surveillance equipment monitors the data center. A firewal l restricts access to 
all ports except 80 (http) and 443 (https). Intrusion detection systems and other systems detect and prevent interference or access from outside intruders. 
QualysGuard network security audits are performed weekly. McAfee SECURE 
scans performed daily. 
The subjects will complete the aforementioned study questionnaires above (see 
“Study Schedule” Section 7) and the assessments will be scored per published 
guidelines . 
All paper source data collected at UCLA  will only contain unique subject ID 
numbers. Research staff will know matching of ID with subject for data 
collection purposes but this will not be written on documents in the field.  The 
documents will be coded before being stored in subject’s file. Files will be secured in a locked cabinet in a locked room.  
8.2 Laboratory Procedures/Evaluations 
8.2.1  Sample Draws  
Sample blood draws will be done by [CONTACT_336009]. 8 mL BD Vacutainer
® CPT™ Cell Preparation Tubes with 
Sodium Citrate will be used to store the blood draws. [ADDRESS_414972] Los Angeles, CA [ZIP_CODE]  and transferred immediately to the

NOTE : Since this BD Vacutainer® CPT™ Tube contains chemical 
additives, it is important to prevent possible backflow from the 
tube with its attendant possibility of adv erse reactions to the 
patient. To guard against backflow, the following precautions should be taken when drawing blood into the tube:  
• Keep patient’s arm in the downward position during the collection procedure 
• Hold the tube with the stopper uppermost  
• Make sure the tube contents do not touch the stopper or the end of the needle during collection procedure

o Place transport container containing rack with CPT and 
requisition form on black crate just inside door 
If no lab staff is present in room 3160 where samples are dropped off, please check in room 3152 (opposite Deb Garet’s office) to let someone 
know samples have arrived. 
(If delayed after 4 p.m. and IBC Lab is closed, lavender top tubes may 
be held in refrigerator overnight and delivered to IBC Lab the next day; 
CPTs should be discarded) 
Blood delivered to IBC Lab will be processed and stored for  CPTs = 
PBMC (pellets for future Telomere and Telomerase) 
8.2.4  Sample Processing Directions 
Upon receipt of CPT tubes upright in rack at RT : 
1. Within two hours of blood draw, begin isolation of PBMC utilizing CPT to 
PBMC protocol—be sure to re-mix CPT tube by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_414976] number of PBMC’s on requisi tion. 
3. Proceed according to the following algorithm : 
a. 2x10
6 cells for pellet in PBS for DNA extraction. 
b. 1x106 cells for telomerase extraction in CHAPS buffer . 
4. Freeze PBMC for DNA pellet(s) at -80 °C to store for future extraction. 
5. Perform telomerase extraction on fresh cells per IBC protocol. 
 
 
 
 
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_414977] without asking about the 
occurrence of specific symptoms; at each visit, they will be asked standard 
questions to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being.  
All SAEs will be reported to regulatory authorities and the si te IRB within 
required time frames.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_414978]’s 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the 
subject’s participation in the research. Subjects will be instructed to co ntact 
the Investigator at any time after randomization if any symptoms develop.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any event that results in death, is immediat ely life-
threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition . 
9.[ADDRESS_414979]’s file regardless of perceived causality. AEs will be assessed from the first device treatment (screening visit ) to the  last 
device treatment. AE form will be collected during each study visit at OCNS. 
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_414980], will be considered 
and investigated.  
To assess relationship of an event t o study intervention, the following 
guidelines are presented in Table 1 .  
Table 1   Assessment of Causality/Relatedness of AEs and SAEs 
Categories Definition  
Definitely related  This relationship suggests that a definite c ausal 
relationship exists between the devic e treatment and the 
AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent 
medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event.  
Probably related  This relationship  suggests that a reasonable temporal 
sequence of the event with device treatment exists and, 
based upon the known side effects  of device treatment, 
known or previously reported adverse reactions to device 
treatment , or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical 
experience, the association of the event with the study 
device  seems likely. 
Possibly related  This relationship suggests that device treatment may 
have caused or contributed to the AE (i.e., the event 
follows a reasonable temporal sequence from t he time of 
device  treatment  and/or follows a known response pattern 
to the study treatment  but could also have been produced 
by [CONTACT_1604]).  
Not related  This relationship suggests that there is no association 
between the study device  and the reported e vent.

 9.3.2  Expectedness of SAEs 
The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_335987].  An adverse event will b e considered unexpected 
if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the 
risk information previously described for the intervention.   
9.3.3  Severity of Event 
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE 
reported during the study. The assessment will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment. The severity o f each AE should be 
assigned to one of the categories shown in Table 2 . 
Table 2   Common Adverse Event Grading Scale 
Grade  Definition  
Mild Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate  Discomfort enough to caus e interference with usual activities 
Severe  Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform usual activities 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. 
Severity is a category used for rating the intensity of an event (such as 
mild, moderate, or severe), and both AE(s) and SAE(s) can be assessed 
as mild, moderate, or severe. An event is defined as serious when it meets 
one of the predefined outcomes described in  9.1.2 . 
9.4 Reporting Procedures 
AE’s that meet the criteria for reporting per the UCLA IRB guidelines are 
reported to the IRB within 10 working days of awareness where the UCLA IRB 
is the responsible IRB, and is determined by [CONTACT_209264] [INVESTIGATOR_335988]:  
• Unexpected, and related or possibly related to the research activity, and 
serious (i.e. placing subjects art greater risk of  harm than previously known) 
or 
• Expected and related to but indicating a higher severity or frequency of 
occurrence (i.e. a trend) than was known or described in the current approved ICF and therefore anew identified risk.  
SAEs or deaths that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the UCLA IRB in accordance with their 
requirements which is within 3 work ing days of awareness.

 11 ETHICS /PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
11.[ADDRESS_414984].  
The informed consent and study documents will be in English l anguage only 
therefore only persons fluent in reading English will be eligible to enroll into the 
study. The consent is written to ensure comprehension at a 6th -8th grade level. 
No vulnerable persons, as defined by [CONTACT_336011] (OPRS/IRB), will be targeted. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_335989] (co-
investigator, RN s, research assistant) will be responsible for inviting subjects to 
participate. The study will be explained in detail and they will be allowed as much time as needed to read, comprehend and ask any pertaining questions. 
After the subject has read the consent form at the UCLA OCNS private clinic 
exam room area, the investigator will review the study and answer any 
questions or concerns regarding participation. Subjects will  be asked to 
summarize the information provided to ensure comprehension. It will be explained that they are allowed to withdraw consent at any time without 
retribution. The consent process will be documented in the research record.   
11.[ADDRESS_414985]’s names and study information will be kept on a password protected 
database, and will be linked only with a unique [ADDRESS_414986] the confidentiality of the subjects who 
donate samples. The procedures by [CONTACT_336012]. The process by [CONTACT_336013]’s 
identity will be protected (process of coding and de -identifying samples) 
including the location where the information that links a sample to the identity of the donor is kept and who has access to this information.  
Although the samples containing genetic material will be coded and no subject identifiers will be attached to the samples, the codes will be maintained by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_335990]. This will 
allow protecting the identity of the donor from anybody who ha s access to the 
storage, but is not working on the study. The Samples will be coded but not anonymous. Therefore t he policy will read:  
Policy: Samples will be coded to protect the identity of the donor from anybody 
who is not a part of the research team. T he link will be maintained between 
subject identifiers and stored samples in the PI ’s records. Samples will be 
stored in a manner that optimizes the viability of the specimen and the utility of 
the cells for research. All equipment used in preparation or s torage of human 
specimens shall be subject to routine maintenance to ensure optimal preservation of specimens.  
Process: The participant will specify within the consent form whether they would like to the samples stored for future research.   On receipt of a sample the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335991] a code to the sample and record the code and the date of collection on the tube containing genetic material and in the specimen logbook. This will be the only link between the samples and the subjects 
accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335992]. The sample will 
then be processed in accordance with the rese arch needs of the study. The 
samples will not be shared.  
Sharing: The participant sample will not be shared with other researchers 
outside the research team. Since the sample will only be shared within the 
research team, the only set process for sharing (within the team) will be a 
written request to the PI.  Only after approval by [CONTACT_978], will the samples be 
release to the co-investigators. Only the subjects ID will accompany the sample.  
Processing of sample upon leaving UCLA: In the event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335993] s 
UCLA, then the samples will be destroyed.     
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_414987] be reviewed by [CONTACT_093].   
12.2 Data Collection 
Paper source documents with data collected at UCLA will be coded and kept in 
locked cabinets. A coding key and any collected identifiers (e.g., phone, 
address) will be kept in a separate locked cabinet by [CONTACT_978]. All data will be 
coded upon storing and before da ta analysis. 
Electronic data collected at UCLA will be done using SurveyMonkey and will be coded. All data will be stripped of personal identifiers and stored in an 
encrypted Microsoft Access database. All data in the computer database will be password protected. Only authorized research personnel will have access to 
the password protected computer database.  
12.[ADDRESS_414988]’s 
name [CONTACT_336016].  Retention of blood specimens 
after the end of the study for use in future research must be granted permission 
from the subject on the ICF. Subjects will give permission on the ICF if they 
agree to keep their  name [CONTACT_336017].

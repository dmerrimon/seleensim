 Protocol  synopsis   
 
Title of study: A Prospective, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_490340] -Release in  HLA Sensitized Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_490341]:  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of tacrolimus extended -release 
in HLA s ensitized (HS, defined as panel reactive antibody ≥ 30%), kidney transplant 
recip ients after desensitization with intravenou s immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab 
+/- plasma exchange (PLEX) per the standard of care  with alemtuzumab induction.    
Objectives:  
The primary objective is to determine th e safety of tacrolimus extended -release in the 
HS patient population as measured by [CONTACT_490355] (SAEs) and 
treatment failure.  Treatment failure is defined as a composite of biopsy proven acute 
rejection ( BPAR), graft failure, or death. BPAR is defined as ≥ Banff 1A using the Banff 
2007 criteria.    
Secondary objectives are to observe the following:  
1. Change in donor specific antibodies (DSA) as defined by [CONTACT_490356] [1,2]  
2. Tolerability as defined by [CONTACT_490357] :  
The study popu lation will consist of HS patients ( p a t i e n t s  w h o  h a v e  
r e c e i v e d  d e s e n s i t i z a t i o n )  with end- stage kidney disease undergoing kidney 
transplantation.  The study will begin at the time of transplantation while subjects are 
inpatients.  They will be followed post- transplantation as outpatients.   
 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: 
  
Key inclusi on criteria are as follows:  
1.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a deceased or living dono r kidney allograft  
2.  Patients must have undergone desensitization with IVIG and rituximab with or 
without plasma exchange prior to transplant or be administered IVIG and rituximab 
peri-operatively (within seven days of transplant)  post-transplant   
3.  Age [ADDRESS_630444] an acceptable crossmatch (as defined as T -or B- FCMX 
≤ 225 MCS) from non -HLA identical donor. Negative crossmatch is Tpronase FCMX <70; 
T- FCMX <50 and Bpronase FCMX <130 ; B-FCMX <100.  
 
Key exclusion criteria are as follows: 
 
1. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a dual simultaneous kidney/liver, kid ney/heart, kidney/lung, or 
kidney /pancreas transplant 
 
2. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study  drug or to drugs of similar 
chemical cl asses 
 
3. Patients being treated with drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of 
cytochrome P450 3A4 
 
4. Patients with a clinically significant systemic infection within [ADDRESS_630445] 
absorption of drug , such as severe diarrhea, active peptic ulcer disease, or 
uncontrolled  diabetes mellitus, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], might 
significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or excretion of 
study medication. 
 
6. Women of childbearing potential who are either pregnant, lactating, planning to 
become pregnant during this trial, or with a positive serum or urine  pregnancy 
test. Women of childbearing potential must  be willing to agree to contraceptive 
practices.

 Study design:  
This is a single center, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. It will be an open label, single-arm, non-controlled 
design.  All HS patients age [ADDRESS_630446]-transplant.   All subjects will require informed 
consent.  At the time of screening, subjects will receive a physical exam and undergo 
lab testing as detailed below in the evaluation schedule.  Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H, 
Lemtrada) will be administered to all subjects for induction immunosuppression 
immediately post-transplant. Maintenance immunosuppression will consist of 
tacrolimus extended -release , mycophenolate mofetil,  and prednisone.    Patients will 
receive antimicrobial prophylaxis as per Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC)  protocol 
(valganciclovir x 6 months, TMP/SMX x 12months, and fluconazole x 1 month). Lab 
tests and physical exams for safety will take place according  to the evaluation 
schedule below.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_490359] s e rio u s  adverse 
events as described below.  Tacrolimus extended -release tro ugh level, complete 
metabolic panel, complete blood count with differential, donor specific antibodies, and 
urinalysis with culture will be assessed according  to the evaluation schedule below.  
Subjects will complete the study at one year post-transplant.  Consent may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_56627].  The investigator may also withdraw 
the study participant at any time if there are any safety concerns.  
 
Efficacy assessments: 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_490342] . 
 
Data analysis: 
 
All outcomes will be reported as frequencies.   Safety will be assessed  by [CONTACT_490360].  The frequency 
of BPAR, graft loss, and death will also be assessed at one year post transplant.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_630447] the allograft at 
risk[1,2].   
 
Approximately 30% of the patients currently awaiting a kidney transplant are broadly 
HLA-sensitized .  These preformed HLA -antibodies create a difficult to match phenotype 
that results in a longer wait time  for a kidney transplant and higher rates of rejection 
10 
 after kidney transplant.  Broadly HLA -sensitized patients are often excluded from 
clinical tria ls due to their extended length of  time on dialysis (associated with increased 
post-transplant morbidity) and increased rates of rejection.  
 
Tacrolimus twice daily is very effective in preventing allograft rejection and is 
administered as first line therap y as part of multidrug immunosuppression regimen.  
Tacrolimus twice daily has a narrow therapeutic index and frequent drug monitoring is 
necessary to maximize efficacy and prevent adverse effects.  There is high intra -
individual variability that can place the allograft at risk of deterioration due to rejection or 
toxicity [3].   
 
Tacrolimus extended -release  (Astagraf XL, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL) is 
a once daily formulation of tacrolimus.  It is currently approved for the prophylaxis of 
organ rejection in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Short and long -term data support the 
efficacy and safety of the once daily formulation[4, 5].  However, patients with a panel 
reactive antibody > 30% were excluded from the studies.  It has therefore, not been 
studied in this patient population.  
 
2          Purpose and rationale  
 
The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_490343] -release in a population of HS renal transplant patients.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_490344]  +/- PLEX  per the 
standard of care at CSMC .  All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_490345].  
Tacrolimus extended -release  has not been studied in this patient population  to date .

[ADDRESS_630453] gets transplanted, t he investigational drug will either  be given same day as 
transplant (Day 0) OR at the next scheduled dosi ng after transplantation at 8am .  It will 
be taken by [CONTACT_490364]  5mg orally or 0.07mg /kg (rounded to the 
nearest 1mg) daily.  A therapeutic drug level wi ll be checked after two doses of the 
investigational drug and then daily  as per SOC .  Tacrolimus trough levels will be 
adjusted to achieve a goal of 7 to 9 ng/ml  for the first six months and goal of 5 -8ng/ml 
thereafter  (see Table 1) . 
 
The investigator  and co -investigators  are responsible for instructing the patients 
regarding the exact dose and dosing schedule to be followed.  Instructions for taking 
[ADDRESS_630454] meal or 1 hour before their next meal  preferably on an 
empty stomach and to swallow capsules whole (no crushing or chewing or dividing 
capsules).  
 
Study Drugs  
Patients will take tacrolimus extended -release daily on a consist ent schedule with 
regard to time of day and relation to meals. No grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be 
taken throughout the study.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_630455] tacrolimus level should be drawn after two doses are administered . Tacrolimus 
extended -release dose adjustments should be made  based on results of the trough 
levels from the local laboratory. Follow -up tacrolimus trough levels should be rechecked 
after any dose adjustment s are made to ens ure that the recommended troughs are 
achieved.  
 
6.1.6   Treatment of Acute Rejection  
Rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_490347].   Solumedrol or anti - 
thymocyte globulin will be administered for cell -mediated rejection.   IVIG with or 
withou t rituximab may be administered for antibody mediated rejection. Plasma 
exchange +/- eculizumab may be used for severe antibody mediated rejection.  
 
6.1.7 Treatment of patients unable to tolerate oral medication   
 
The study drug may be temporarily interrupted if a patient develops a short -term 
intolerance of oral medication after the initial dose of study medication.  Alternatively, 
administration of tacrolimus twice daily suspension  via nasogastric (NG) tube or if more 
serious cyclosporine  or tacrolimus  IV (per SOC)  may be used . IV cyclosporine will be 
preferred due to difficulty checking IV tacrolimus levels (since it is a continuous 
infusion).   Patients should be returned to tacrolimus extended -release  oral medica tion 
as soon as possible.    
 
7          Visit schedule and assessm ents  
Table 7-1 lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “x” or “SOC” 
(for standard of care) the visits when they are performed. Patients should 
be encouraged to attend all visits on the designated day. However, visit 
windows will be allowed of ± 1day for Day 2, ± 2 days for Day 4, ± 3 days for 
15 
 Day 7, Day 14, ± 7 days for Day 30, Month 2 and ± 14 days for Month 6, 9,

8.1        Adverse events 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, 
or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not 
considered to be related to study drug. Study drug includes the investigational drug 
under evaluation. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are 
only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal 
laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, are considered clinically  significant, or require therapy. The 
occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when 
they are volunteered by [CONTACT_121966], laboratory test, or other assessments. 
 
8.2        Serious  adverse event reporting  
An SAE is defined as an event which: 
• is fatal or life-threatening 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319925] 24 hours  unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263281]: 
1.  routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition 
2.  elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing  condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
3.  treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
4.  social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s 
18 
 general condition is medically si gnificant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes 
the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
 
 
All SAEs that are serious and reasonably  or probab ly related to tacrolimus 
extended -release  will be reported to FDA and Astellas Pharma using MedWatch 
3500A form (Appendix B). 
 
Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications, or progression  of the initial SAE must be reported 
as follow-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], regardless of when the event occurs. An SAE 
that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be 
reported separately as a new event. 
 
All SAEs will be reported to Astellas. Their contact [CONTACT_17682]:  
 
Email:  Safety -[EMAIL_1577] .  
Fax: [PHONE_10193]  
 
Protocol exempted events: Unusu ally severe rejection epi [INVESTIGATOR_490348]. They should not be 
reported simply because they result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490349].  Acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_490350]. However, acute rejections should be reported as SAEs if they are unusual 
in appearance, clinic al course and/or are graft threatening. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_630460] be reported 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy should be followed 
up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, 
or maternal and/or newborn complications. 
 
[ADDRESS_630461] access to the 
database.  All source documents will be kept in a secure, locked cabinet.  All data will 
be reviewed for accuracy.  Designated res earch staff will be trained in the use of the 
electronic database. 
 
If pat ients live far from CSMC  and are unable to come to their designated study visits 
within study windows, the study team will try to obtain study labs from the patient’s 
local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic.  The res ults will be forwarded to CSMC  for analysis.  
 
[ADDRESS_630462] one member not part of the investigational group. 
The DSMB will review safety data quarterly and formulate a letter with 
recommendations for continuation. 
 
10        Data analysis 
A designated statistici an will perform the statistical analysis. 
 
10.1      Populat ions for analysis 
All patients enrolled in the study will be included in the analysis. 
 
10.2      Patient  demograph ics/other  baseline  charact eristics 
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_19462], mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Discrete  variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_22977]. 
 
10.3 Treat ments (study drug,  other  concomitant therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], compliance) 
The average daily dose  of  tacrolimus extended -release   will  be summarized within 
defined time windows.  These summaries will apply the following rule:  On calculating 
dosage averages over a time period, zero doses will be used for periods of temporary 
interruption of study medication regardless  of whether this was due to safety reasons, 
non-compliance or other reasons.  The reasons for tacrolimus extended -release  dose 
adjustments will be assessed at these time points.   Other immunosuppressive 
medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_490365].  All non-immunosuppressive 
medications or non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_490351]. 
 
10.4      Analysis of the primary objective(s) 
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_630463] transplant.  Treatment failure 
is defined as a composite of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft failure, or 
death. BPAR is defined as ≥ Banff 1A using the Banff [ADDRESS_630464].  
 
10.4.2     Safety 
Safety variables to be assessed include discontinuation from study, discontinuation 
from treatment, renal function, SAEs,  notable events, and laboratory tests.  The 
number of serious adverse events will be reported as an observation since  this is a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Safety data will be reviewed quarterly  by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_490352]-PIs. 
 
10.5        Sample  size calculation 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_490353].  Twenty 
20 
 patients will be enrolled. 
 
 
11        Ethical c onsiderations 
 
11.1      Regulat ory and ethical compliance 
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in 
accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, 
with applicable local regulations (including E uropean Directive 2001 /20/EC, US Code 
of  Federal  Regulations  Title  21,  and  Japanese  Ministry  of  Health,  Labor,  and 
Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
11.2      Informed  consent procedu res 
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, 
where required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC/RE B-approved informed consent, or, if 
incapable of doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable 
representative of the patient. In cases where the patient’s representative gives 
consent, the patient should be informed about the study to the extent possible  given 
his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate 
assent by [CONTACT_90218] a 
separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any 
study-specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The 
process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source 
documents.  
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study medication 
may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study 
and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the 
contraception requirement for the duration of the study and 8 weeks after study drug 
discontinuation. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study. 
 
 
11.3      Respo nsibilit ies of the  investiga tor and IRB/I EC/REB  
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and 
approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review B oard/Independent Ethics 
Com mittee/Research Ethics Board (IRB/ IEC/REB) before study start. A signed and 
dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC/REB  must  be given to Astellas before study initiation. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_630465] be approved by [CONTACT_77818],  Health Authorities where required, 
and the IRB/IEC/REB. Only amen dments that are required for patient safety may be 
implemented prior to IRB/IEC/REB  approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval 
of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immed iate 
action required for the safety of any patient included in this study, even if this action 
represents a deviation from the protocol.

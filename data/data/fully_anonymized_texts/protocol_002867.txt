SECTION  II: RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.
The acetylcholinergic (ACh) system is critically involved in learning, memory, arousal and 
attention, functions that are substantially impaired in many neuropsychiatric conditions.  For 
example, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with decreased cholinergic function, whereas 
recent evidence suggests increased and decreased cholinergic function in major depression and 
schizophrenia, respectively.  Cholinergic function is also fundamentally impaired in nicotine 
addiction. In vivo molecular imaging studies of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors have provided 
substantial contributions to our understanding of these disorders, but these contributions were 
limited by [CONTACT_96101] a method suitable to measure fluctuations in synaptic ACh level.
We recently developed and tested an innovative molecular imaging method in humans to detect 
changes in brain synaptic ACh levels, using single photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT), the beta2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (β 2-nAChR) radioligand [123I]5-IA-[ZIP_CODE] 
(5-IA) and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, physostigmine, challenge. Results suggest 
elevated ACh levels induced by [CONTACT_96102] a reduction in the availability of nicotinic 
receptors for the binding of the radioligand. If validated, this paradigm might provide a very 
useful method to interrogate presynaptic cholinergic function in health and disease. To date, 
receptor imaging of the ACh system at Yale has been limited to 5-IA and SPECT. SPECT is 
known to have poorer resolution and less reliable quantification compared to positron emission 
tomography (PET). Furthermore, the slow kinetic of this radiotracer requires lengthy imaging 
sessions, which is not well tolerated in impaired populations.  [18F]NCFHEB (NCFHEB) has 
been recently introduced as a superior β 2-nicotinic PET imaging agent (1, 2). This proposal 
outlines a series of studies aiming at testing the suitability of PET and NCFHEB to examine 
genetic polymorphisms that modulate nAChR availability and to detect changes in ACh synaptic 
levels, as well as to determine the effect of nicotine on nAChR availability.
This innovative paradigm will lay the groundwork for future studies that can directly interrogate 
ACh function in the living human brain. This is critical to the advancement of our understanding 
of ACh involvement in psychiatric and medical disorders.  
Additionally, a substantial literature body demonstrates that nAChRs and the cholinergic system 
dynamically control the mesolimbic DA system by [CONTACT_14377], inhibiting, and filtering striatal 
DA release.  We have preliminary data suggesting tobacco smokers at [ADDRESS_106220] blunted DA release compared to nonsmokers. We propose in Aim 7 to determine 1) 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 5 of 68whether there is reduced DA release in smokers at 2 weeks of withdrawal vs. nonsmokers, 2) if 
the magnitude of DA release is correlated with alterations in ACh levels measured in Aim 4 and 
3) if alterations in DA and ACh predict relapse vulnerability.
Aim 1:  To determine the test-retest reproducibility of NCFHEB binding parameters in 10 
nonsmoking subjects. β 2-nAChRs will be quantified twice in nonsmoking subjects. Based on 
preclinical evidence, we hypothesize within 20% difference of binding parameters between test 
and retest scans. 
CLOSED Aim 2: To determine if  2-nAChR availability is genetically predisposed in never 
smokers and smokers We propose to determine if the ANKK1 genotype 
(rs4938015/hCV38879) or CHRNA4 genotype determines 2-nAChR availability in adult never 
smokers. Specifically, 10 never smokers and 10 smokers at one week of abstinence will be 
imaged using NCFHEB PET and blood samples for DNA extraction will be collected from all 
subjects.
Hypothesis: Homozygotes (TT) will have higher 2-nAChR availability compared to age-, and 
sex matched heterozygotes that carry the C allele in the ANKK1 gene (rs4938015/ hCV38879). 
CLOSED Aim 3: To determine if the adaptive increase in  2-nAChR availability and 
change in  2-nAChR availability over the first month of abstinence in smokers is 
genetically predisposed. We will determine if ANKK1 or CHRNA4 genotypes are associated 
with changes in 2-nAChR availability in smokers over time recruited in aim 2. The same 
smokers from Aim 2 will be supported to maintain abstinence for 4-8 weeks. Smokers that 
successfully abstain for 4-8 weeks (~ 50%; e.g. 5 smokers) will be imaged a second time using 
NCFHEB and PET. The % change in 2-nAChR availability will be determined as the difference 
in NCFHEB binding [(V T/fp @7days of abstinence –V T/fp 4 wks abstinence)/V T/fp @7 days 
abstinence]. Blood samples for DNA extraction will be collected from all subjects. 
Hypothesis: Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that smokers that carry the A allele 
for hCV16178933/rs2273504 or the G allele for hCV15953820/rs2236196 genotype will have 
higher 2-nAChR availability at 7-9 days of abstinence compared to never smokers matched for 
age and sex and genotype. Whereas smoker homozygotes (GG and AA respectively for 
hCV16178933/rs2273504 or for hCV15953820/rs2236196) will demonstrate similar 2-nAChR 
availability compared to never smokers.  We also hypothesize that CC homozygotes for the 
CHRNA4 rs2273502 will show a pronounced decrease in 2-nAChR availability while carriers 
of the T allele show no change in 2-nAChR availability will demonstrate the greatest change or 
normalization over 6 weeks of abstinence.
Aim 4: To measure the sensitivity of NCFHEB binding to changes in endogenous ACh 
levels in smoking and nonsmoking subjects . After baseline quantification of 2-nAChR 
availability, physostigmine will be administered as previously described (HIC#09100005837) 
and subjects will be scanned again with NCFHEB. We hypothesize there will be greater increase 
in ACh level (or greater reduction in radio tracer binding) in smoking as compared to 
nonsmoking subjects.  These results will be correlated with changes in mood and cognition 
associated with physostigmine administration. Up to [ADDRESS_106221]-physostigmine scans with NCFHEB 4-8 weeks later.  This will allow us to determine 
whether ACh function changes over the course of abstinence.

ACh levels in smoking and nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia. After baseline 
quantification of 2-nAChR availability, at 1 week of smoking abstinence, physostigmine will be 
administered as previously described (HIC#09100005837) and subjects will be scanned again 
with NCFHEB. We hypothesize there will be greater increase in ACh level (or greater reduction 
in radio tracer binding) in smoking as compared to nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia, but 
the extent of this change will be different than in controls.  These results will be correlated with 
changes in mood, negative and positive symptoms, and cognition associated with physostigmine 
administration. Up to 10 smoking and 10 nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia will 
participate.   
Aim 6: To determine the efficacy of a bolus to infusion scan versus a bolus scan of 
NCFHEB with physostigmine challenge.  We will invite back never smokers and smokers who 
completed bolus scans in Aim [ADDRESS_106222] will participate in up to 2 [11C]PHNO PET scans (ideally, the two 
PET scans will be carried out in the same day). Up to three hours before the second PET scan, 
amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, PO) will be administered. In smokers, the scan will occur at 10-30 
days of smoking abstinence. We hypothesize that at 10-30 days of withdrawal amphetamine-
induced DA release will be blunted compared to healthy nonsmokers. 
CLOSED Aim 8. To determine the degree of occupancy of the β 2*-nAChRs  by [CONTACT_96103] e-cig compared to a tobacco cigarette using [18F]NCFHEB PET 
neuroimaging. Given recent evidence that experienced e-cig users can achieve similar 
plasma nicotine levels compared to tobacco smoking 6, 7 , we hypothesize there will not be a 
significant difference in β 2*-nAChR occupancy by [CONTACT_96104] e-cig as compared 
to a regular cigarette.  We will also examine arterial plasma nicotine levels and compare to 
nicotine occupancy of the nAChRs between groups. 
                                                           
2.   Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project.   
      Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data. 
The cholinergic system, and the beta2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β 2-nAChRs) 
specifically, have been implicated in many neuropsychiatric conditions, such as addiction, 
depression, schizophrenia and AD.(3-6) This involvement has been supported by [CONTACT_96105] β 2-nAChR, including studies performed by [CONTACT_96106].(7-13) The 
β2-nAChRs are the most abundant nAChRs in the brain.  Until very recently, β 2-nAChR SPECT 
and PET radiotracers available for human use displayed slow kinetics, requiring prolonged 
scanning sessions(14, 15), and practically eliminated our ability to study severely impaired 
patients.(16, 17)  The recently introduced radiolabeled antagonist (-)-2-(6-(18)F-fluoro-2,3'-
bipyridin-5'-yl)-7-methyl-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ([18F]NCFHEB or NCFHEB) has been

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page [ADDRESS_106223] high binding potential at the β 2-nAChRs and rapid kinetics (1) and is thus a very 
promising new radioligand.  The reproducibility of NCFHEB V T measurement in humans and the 
sensitivity of NCFHEB V T to changes in extracellular Ach concentrations have not yet been 
reported.  Here, we propose to test the reproducibility of NCFHEB in vivo binding in humans 
and to examine its vulnerability to changes in synaptic ACh. These critical studies will answer a 
fundamental question regarding use of NCFHEB and PET in the study of cholinergic systems 
and will have broad implications to the future studies of severe neuropsychiatric conditions 
(nicotine addiction, mood disorder, schizophrenia, AD), with high relevance to individual and 
public health.  If validated, such an imaging tool would have enormous potential to facilitate the 
development of innovative medicines aimed at modulating the cholinergic system.
Furthermore, since  nicotine binds with high affinity to the 2-nAChRs and there is a high 
prevalence of smoking in the US, we will examine this system and its response to increases in 
endogenous ACh in healthy smokers and the associated cognitive and genetic factors. 
Evidence for Genetic Inheritance of Tobacco Smoking  A family history of tobacco smoking 
is a powerful predictor of smoking risk. Children of ever- or current- smokers are more likely to 
smoke, compared to children of never smokers (18-22). Smokers with a family smoking history 
are more likely to be persistent smokers than those with no history (23-26). Regular stable 
smoking in adolescence is related to having a current parent smoker relative to a former or never 
smoker parent (27). Failure to quit smoking is linked to having parents that smoked daily (19, 28, 
29). Parental smoking is related to a greater likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_96053], 
higher numbers of cigarettes smoked per day, higher anxiety levels and a trend towards 
depression (24, 30). While all smokers experience anxiety in response to stressor, only family 
history positive smokers experience heightened craving for cigarettes (31). These data suggest 
that there is a biological difference between family history positive smokers and family history 
negative smokers that is likely transmitted between generations through shared genetics.
There is strong evidence to support genetic transmission of smoking between family members. 
Ever-smoking segregates in families following expectations consistent with a dominant 
Mendelian genetic factor with a frequency of 0.02. Studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins 
reared together and apart suggest that there is 50-72% inheritance rate (26, 32-44). The 
concordance rate amongst monozygotic twins is higher than dizygotic twins, regardless of 
whether they were raised together or separately [reviewed by (45)]. Genetics contributes to the 
initiation of smoking behavior (25, 26, 34, 43) with heritability estimates of 0.11 and 0.78 
whereas shared and unique environmental effects range between 0.00 and 0.59 and 0.07 and 0.36 
respectively [reviewed by (46, 47)]. Persistence of smoking is also determined by [CONTACT_96107] 0.04 and 0.86 [reviewed by (46, 47)].  An analysis of 17,500 
monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs from 14 studies, estimated that genetics accounted for 
56%, whereas shared and unique environmental factors accounted for 24 and 20% of the liability 
for smoking initiation, and genetics accounted for 67%, whereas shared and unique 
environmental factors accounted for 2 and 31% of the liability for smoking persistence. 
Smoking behavior has been linked to chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18 and 21 (48-
51). A recent genome-wide association study of nicotine dependent individuals showed that 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) nominate candidate genes coding for cell adhesion, 
enzymes, transcriptional regulators, neurotransmitters, and receptors and the regulation of DNA, 
RNA, and proteins are associated with successful abstinence from smoking (52). In marker based 
genetic studies, associations between smoking behavior and several candidate genes have been

Obtained from Feng et al., Am J Hum Genet 75:112-121, 2004association test suggested that these 6 SNPs meet criteria for a haplotype block that is 
significantly associated with nicotine dependence and age-adjusted FTND (Fagerstrom Test for 
Nicotine Dependence Score). Thus, persons with the GCTATA haplotype of the CHRNA4 gene 
are protected  from developi[INVESTIGATOR_96053].
An ethnic and gender-specific association of the CHRNA4 gene with nicotine dependence (89) 
such that in European Americans (EA) rs2273504 and rs [ADDRESS_106231] 
for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), whereas, SNPs rs3787137 and rs2236196 were associated 
with smoking quantity, FTND score and heaviness of smoking index (only rs2236196).  
Hutchison and colleagues have recently evaluated the CHRNA4 SNPs rs612249 and rs609387 
located in the 5’ promoter UTR region and also the 3’UTR SNP rs2236196 and the relationship 
to CHRNA4 mRNA, epi[INVESTIGATOR_96054] (90), and nicotine sensitivity in 
living humans (91). In brief, these studies demonstrated that individuals with the AG (vs AA) 
genotype to RS2236196 demonstrated higher epi[INVESTIGATOR_96055] [which agrees with our 
preliminary data [see section C.7] and greater sensitivity to the physiological and cognitive 
effects of smoking suggesting that CHRNA4 genotypes influence the etiology of nicotine 
dependence. And, individuals with GG RS612249 SNP reported greater subjective physiological 
effects after smoking three cigarettes and greater baseline CO. Recent studies have suggested an 
association between CHRNA4 rs 1044396 and nicotine-mediated attentional network function in 
the anterior cingulate cortex and parietal cortex (92) and CHRNA4 rs3746372  has been linked 
to the number of cigarettes smoked in schizophrenic smokers (93).
While there is some debate on how SNPs in the human genome translate to the rodent genome, it 
is interesting to note that a naturally occurring SNP (1587A to G) results in an alanine to 
threonine variation at the amino acid position 529 on the nascent [ADDRESS_106232] 1/3 of the 
cytoplasmic loop between the TM3 and TM4.  This SNP alters nAChR function including 
increased vulnerability to nicotine-induced seizures; ethanol withdrawal seizures; the effects of 
alcohol and nicotine on locomotor activity and is associated with lower nicotine consumption 
and preference (94). There were no differences in cytisine binding between variants, however 
cytisine is nonselective and labels multiple nAChRs, compared to 5-IA, which labels only 2- 
nAChRs. This variant also leads to a difference in the ratio of high and low affinity nAChR such 
that SS (AA or A carriers) mice have a greater fractions of desensitized 4- nAChR compared to 
the LS (GG) mice. Importantly, this variant is common in European Americans and uncommon 
in Asians and Africans (94-97).
 CHRNB2. The 2 subunit is encoded by [CONTACT_96108]2 [MIM 118507] [NCBI locus ID 1141] 
gene and has been mapped to chromosome 1q21.3 (98). The CHRNB2 gene has 6 exons with a

Nicotinic receptors and schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is associated with very high rates of tobacco addiction (80%) relative to 
the general population (20%) and other psychiatric disorders (129, 130). Compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_96056], individuals with schizophrenia are reported to extract higher amounts of nicotine per 
cigarette and higher rates of smoking-related cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease and 
associated mortality (131, 132). The high rate of tobacco smoking may reflect an attempt to 
“self-medicate” the negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and antipsychotic-related side-
effects associated with schizophrenia (133-135).  Therefore, understanding the basis for high 
rates smoking in this population, a modifiable risk factor, might lead to increased life expectancy 
and quality of life, and may also provide the basis for developi[INVESTIGATOR_96057]. 
Nicotine, the primary  addictive and reinforcing constituent in cigarettes, has high affinity 
for the beta2-subunit containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β 2*-nAChRs). Evidence from 
postmortem (82), preclinical (10), and clinical (8, 9) studies demonstrates that chronic 
administration of nicotine and tobacco smoking increases the number of β 2*-nAChRs in most 
brain regions (9, 136), which is commonly referred to as “upregulation”. However, post- mortem 
study suggests that smokers with schizophrenia fail to upregulate to the same extent as 
comparison smokers. A study that controlled for smoking status in postmortem samples of 
smokers and nonsmokers with and without schizophrenia shows that nonsmokers with and 
without schizophrenia have similar binding of [3H]-nicotine (symbolizing similar availability of 
β2*-nAChRs), but smokers with schizophrenia have lower [3H]-nicotine binding than smokers 
without schizophrenia. This suggests that smokers with schizophrenia do not upregulate nAChRs 
to the same extent as smokers without schizophrenia (137). We confirmed in vivo  the 
postmortem findings of Breese et al. that smokers with schizophrenia had lower β 2*-nAChR 
availability relative to smokers without schizophrenia (138).  Furthermore, we showed that β 2*-
nAChR availability in individuals with schizophrenia correlated with negative symptoms (138).  
We followed up this evaluation with smokers and nonsmokers with schizophrenia and detected 
that although there is lower β 2*-nAChR availability in schizophrenia, smokers with 
schizophrenia do upregulate as compared to nonsmokers. The study also showed that those 
smokers with schizophrenia who had lower β 2*-nAChR availability, reported more negative 
symptoms and scored lower on tests of executive control. Given these recent developments, and 
the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are developi[INVESTIGATOR_96058], and possibly for treatment of cognitive deficits, it is first imperative to 
understand the cholinergic involvement in schizophrenia. Conducting an acetylcholine challenge 
via administration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is an excellent way to examine whether 
there is cholinergic compromise in schizophrenia beyond lower receptor availability. We will 
correlate these results with measures of schizophrenia symptoms and cognitive performance in 
order to understand whether increasing endogenous acetylcholine may have effects on these 
variables.
Interaction of the Cholinergic and Dopaminergic Systems
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 14 of 68A substantial literature body demonstrates that nAChRs and the cholinergic system dynamically 
control the mesolimbic DA system by [CONTACT_14377], inhibiting, and filtering striatal DA release. 
Nicotine releases DA by [CONTACT_4639] β2*-nAChRs located on the mesolimbic DA neurons in the 
ventral tegmental area, resulting in neuronal firing and DA release in the nucleus accumbens and 
dorsal caudate. β2*-nAChRs are also critical for the reinforcing and motivational effects of 
nicotine, e.g., tying cues to drug consumption. Nicotine also “filters” DA release by [CONTACT_96109]. As reviewed in Exley 
and Cragg (2008), nicotine promotes DA release through both burst and tonic activity. Nicotine 
functions as an agonist and also as an antagonist via its desensitization/blocking actions and both 
may ultimately enhance DA neurotransmission. Thus, β2*-nAChRs are responsible for 
controlling the dynamic range of DA release. A recent preclinical study reported that chronic 
nicotine administration or deletion of the β2*-nAChRs (i.e., β2* knockout) reduced acute DA 
release. This suggests that chronic smokers may have a blunted stimulus-induced DA release 
compared to nonsmokers; however, this has not been examined. Several PET studies have 
demonstrated blunted amphetamine-induced DA release in the ventral striatum in both cocaine 
and alcohol dependent populations at approximately [ADDRESS_106240] 
that individuals with dysfunctional DA transmission are not able to “switch” well from drug-
reinforced behavior to more natural alternative rewards and this is supported by a preclinical 
study in which rats with a lesioned nucleus accumbens displayed an inability to choose greater 
magnitude delayed rewards vs. immediate rewards of lesser value. We have preliminary data 
suggesting tobacco smokers at [ADDRESS_106241] blunted DA release compared to 
nonsmokers. We propose in Aim 7 to determine 1) whether there is reduced DA release in 
smokers at 2 weeks of withdrawal vs. nonsmokers, 2) if the magnitude of DA release is 
correlated with alterations in ACh levels measured in Aim 4 and 3) if alterations in DA and ACh 
predict relapse vulnerability. 
As mentioned, DA regulates the motivational properties of reinforcers including salience of 
stimuli and cue-reactivity. In landmark studies, [CONTACT_96180] illustrated that after learning the 
association between a cue and a reward, the DA neurons respond to the cue that occurs prior to 
the reward in anticipation of a future reward. This highlights the nature of cues because the cues 
themselves become reinforcing. In a smoker, the DA that is initially released as a result of 
smoking takes on the role of determining salience and connecting the smokers’ actions and 
rewarding feelings to environmental cues, e.g., the cigarette, lighter, ashtray, rest area where 
smoking occurs. A pack per day 20-year smoker has had 1,500,000 learning trials (puffs on a 
cigarette) that reinforce cues as stimuli for the physiological and rewarding effects of smoking. 
These associated cues elicit craving, and the magnitude of the reactivity to cues (craving, 
increase in heart rate, brain activation) may predict smoking cessation outcomes. Those who 
experience more craving in response to cues have a harder time quitting smoking. Functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found that during acute abstinence (24 h) there 
are increases in brain activations to smoking-related cues compared to when smoking as usual. 
PET studies have shown smoking-induced DA release that correlates with craving during acute 
withdrawal. While these studies confirm increased craving shortly after the last cigarette that is 
associated with DA release, few studies have systematically examined cue-induced reactivity 
over longer abstinence periods and none have examined the association between DA signaling 
and cue-induced reactivity and the relationship to relapse in human smokers. While many 
withdrawal related behaviors including significant mood impairment may improve over the first 
week of abstinence, cue-induced reactivity is long-lasting and may increase with abstinence. A

reinstatement)
 after extended nicotine self-administration. After self-administration, animals with 
a 7-day vs. 1-day enforced abstinence took longer to extinguish drug-seeking behavior and 
responded at significantly higher levels during the cue-induced reinstatement, and these 
behavioral changes were associated with dopaminergic molecular changes. Incubation of cue-
induced craving has also been shown in human tobacco smokers with different durations of 
abstinence (35 vs. 7 days). Critically, absolute craving levels in smokers do decrease over time, 
but cue-induced craving appears to increase. It is also known that DA D2 receptor drugs block 
cue-induced reinstatement in rodents and D3 receptor-specific drugs are being studied as 
treatments for smoking specifically for their potential to reduce relapse. We will determine 
relationships between drug-induced DA release and cue-reactivity during early phase abstinence 
and whether the magnitude of DA release predicts relapse vulnerability or change in cue 
reactivity. We predict that individuals who exhibit blunted drug-induced DA release will have a 
shorter latency to relapse and that their cue-reactivity will not be significantly reduced over time.

E-cigarettes
Tobacco smoking and secondhand smoke exposure has caused >[ADDRESS_106243] stabilized at ~18% for the general population, 
quit rates continue to be low2, 3. Nicotine is the primary addictive ingredient in tobacco 
smoke and binds with high affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β 2*-nAChRs). 
Inhalation is the quickest way a drug can reach the brain and provide neurological effects; 
thus, when smoked, tobacco delivers nicotine to the pulmonary circulation and reaches the 
arterial circulation and brain within seconds after inhalation, leading to a rapid neurologic 
effect and a high level of addiction12, 13. Nicotine replacement products designed to help 
with smoking abstinence or to be used as replacement of smoked tobacco, have been 
developed in the form of patches, gum, lozenges, nasal spray, and inhaler. However, they 
deliver nicotine more slowly compared to smoked tobacco and may not be as rewarding to 
smokers11. Recently, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) have gained popularity among seasoned 
tobacco smokers as well as tobacco-naïve users4. However, due to quick growth and 
popularity of these products and ever-changing design, it has proved difficult to apply 
regulatory process to e-cigs. The present study aims to add to the small pool of controlled 
studies examining biological and physiological effects of e-cigs.
 E-cigs are battery-operated devices that heat and aerosolize a liquid that typi[INVESTIGATOR_96059]. Although early studies of e-cigs suggested that nicotine delivery was 
ineffective14, 15, later studies found that nicotine can be delivered to the blood in 
significant amounts 6, 7, 16, 17. Further, advances in product technology have led to the 
development of more sophisticated e-cigs (i.e. personal vaporizers) with larger batteries 
and tank systems that are capable of producing larger amounts of aerosol and greater 
nicotine delivery as compared to earlier e-cig products 6, 7. Although there is little 
available data informing the addictive nature of e-cigs, the few available published studies 
suggest that e-cigs have lower addictive potential compared to smoked tobacco16, 18-20. 
Receptor imaging has been successfully utilized to examine mechanisms of tobacco 
addiction through evaluation of β 2*-nAChR availability as a consequence of tobacco smoking21-

typi[INVESTIGATOR_96060], and that lower 
receptor occupancy levels lead to craving. As an example of our work, we compared β 2*-nAChR 
occupancy between the Nicotrol nicotine inhaler and a regular tobacco cigarette using [123I]5-IA 
and SPECT imaging. We determined that using the inhaler leads to an average 55.9 ± 6.4% 
occupancy by [CONTACT_96110] β 2*-nAChRs, which was significantly less compared to the 67.6 ± 
14.1% occupancy after use of a tobacco cigarette11. Further, we detected that arterial plasma 
nicotine concentration was significantly lower after use of the inhaler as compared to a regular 
cigarette. We observed a significant reduction in withdrawal but not craving symptoms 
associated with the use of the inhaler. These findings suggest that the nicotine occupancy after 
use of the inhaler may be at the degree of attenuating nicotine withdrawal; however, greater 
saturation of the receptors may be required to relieve nicotine craving symptoms. These data also 
suggest the nicotine inhaler has lower potential for abuse and addiction compared to a regular 
cigarette.  
In the present study, we will use [18F]NCFHEB, a radioligand that has high affinity for 
the β 2*-nAChRs and has been shown to be sensitive to increases in nicotine25, and PET to 
conduct a critical study of nicotine’s occupancy of the β 2*-nAChRs after use of an e-cig and 
relate to clinical data to better elucidate the molecular actions and addictive potential of e-cigs. 
Furthermore, we propose to conduct a novel examination of nicotine concentration in arterial 
plasma after use of an e-cig and a regular cigarette and relate these findings to the brain and 
clinical data. While the prior findings suggest differences in addictiveness between e-cigs and 
tobacco, the amount of nicotine delivered to the brain from an e-cig is not known and the 
relationship to tobacco smoking craving and withdrawal is not elucidated. Identifying e-cigs’ 
mechanisms of action in the brain, potential addictive nature, and the relationship between 
mechanism and behavior is thus the critical step in evaluating these products for potential 
regulation by [CONTACT_1622].

populations is likely to be sub-optimal due to slow tracer kinetics. For example, 6 hrs are 
required for 5-IA to reach equilibrium in the brain, followed by 2 additional hours of scanning. 
For challenge studies, a 16+ hr scan day is required. Recent advancements have made possible 
the synthesis of NCFHEB for use in PET. NCFHEB activity uptake is similar to β2-nAChRs  
distribution in the brain, with higher uptake in the thalamus (Fig  3) and is superior to the 
previously discussed radioligands - it has similar affinity for the β 2-nAChRs and it displays faster 
kinetics making it possible to conduct a single imaging study in 90mins (139).This radioligand is 
safe for use in humans in vivo  (140), and the Yale PET Center has initiated its production.

Preliminary data
β2-nAChR involvement in mood disorder. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of β 2-
nAChR involvement in MDD in living human depressed and control subjects, as well as in 
postmortem tissue (141). Twenty–three nonsmokers with MDD (8 acutely depressed and 15 
remitted) and [ADDRESS_106247] in the acute MDD group (amygdala, p=0.02, hippocampus 
p=0.01, thalamus p=0.04 and mean cortex p=0.04). The remitted MDD group also showed lower 
receptor availability (p=0.01). However, in post-mortem data where endogenous ACh is not 
present, there appears to be no difference in receptor availability between depressed (n=15) and 
age- and sex-matched control (n=15) subjects. Therefore, it is hypothesized that high ACh levels 
associated with depressed mood competed with 5-IA binding at the β 2-nAChRs, and we thus 
quantified lower β 2-nAChR availability. Further experimentation is required to confirm these 
findings. 
We are presently conducting a similar evaluation of β 2-nAChR involvement in patients with 
bipolar disorder (BD). Fifteen 15 depressed BD nonsmokers (5 unmedicated, 10 medicated (41.6 
± 13.1yrs)) and 15 controls (40.8 ± 13.1yrs) participated in one 5-IA SPECT. We found a 
significant effect of diagnosis (Hotelling's Trace F=4.7, p=0.002) with an average 29% lower β 2-
nAChR availability in BD as compared to control subjects in frontal, parietal, anterior cingulate, 
temporal, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96061], thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. There was a negative 
correlation between symptoms of depression and β 2-nAChR (p=.04) only in unmedicated BD 
individuals. These baseline receptor availability studies provide important information on the 
neurochemistry of mood disorders, but limit our interpretation and future directions.  Fig. 3. Kinetics in of [18F]NCFHEB,

schizophrenia (n=31) and age-, smoking- and sex-matched comparison subjects (n=31) 
participated in one [123I]5-IA-[ZIP_CODE] single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
scan to quantify β 2*-nAChR availability. Psychiatric, cognitive, nicotine craving and mood 
assessments were obtained during active smoking as well as smoking abstinence. There were no 
differences in smoking characteristics between smokers with and without schizophrenia.  
Subjects with schizophrenia had lower β 2*-nAChR availability relative to comparison group, and 
nonsmokers had lower β 2*-nAChR availability relative to smokers. However, there was no 
smoking by [CONTACT_96111]. Relative to nonsmokers with schizophrenia, smokers with 
schizophrenia had higher β 2*-nAChR availability in limited brain regions.  In smokers with 
schizophrenia, higher β 2*-nAChR availability was associated with fewer negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia and better performance on tests of executive control.  Chronic exposure to 
antipsychotic drugs was not associated with changes in β 2*-nAChR availability in schizophrenia. 
Conclusions: Although subjects with schizophrenia have lower β 2*-nAChR availability as 
compared to comparison group, smokers with schizophrenia appear to upregulate in the cortical 
regions. Lower receptor availability in smokers with schizophrenia in the cortical regions is 
associated with a higher number of negative symptoms and worse performance on tests of 
executive function; suggesting smoking subjects with schizophrenia who upregulate to a lesser 
degree may be at risk for poorer outcomes.

conducted an evaluation of β 2-nAChR involvement in early AD and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). They detected a global decrease in β 2-nAChR as a function of group. No region-specific 
differences were detected. Due to poor 
resolution of SPECT, they were 
constrained to evaluation of larger brain 
regions and were not able to attain correct 
information in regions such as the 
hippocampus. The availability of 
NCFHEB would considerably increase our 
ability to measure regional change and to 
correlate with the clinical state.  
Furthermore, the availability of a method 
to quantify the acute response to AChE 
administration would provide a more

compared to the static measurement of

ACh changes in the brain in humans. 
Competition between neurotransmitter and 
radioligands has provided a very useful 
method to assess synaptic changes in 
dopamine, but such an approach has not 
been applied to ACh. We examined 
whether 5-IA SPECT is sensitive to 
increases in extracellular levels of ACh in 
human subjects, when induced by [CONTACT_96112]. Such 
sensitivity has been previously 
demonstrated in non-human primates by 
[CONTACT_96113], who detected a 
significant displacement of 5-IA in the 
thalamus after a physostigmine 
challenge(142). In our study, six healthy 
subjects participated in one 5-IA SPECT 
study.  We used a bolus plus constant 
infusion method to establish and maintain a 
state of binding equilibrium at the level of 
the receptors. After three 30-min baseline 
scans at 6h (early interval), physostigmine 
(1.5mg) was administered IV over 60 min, 
and nine additional 30-min scans were 
collected during the next 6h (late interval).  
We observed a significant reduction in BP F 
(=B max/KD; specific binding) after 
physostigmine (25 ± 15% reduction in 
cortical regions, 15 ± 11% thalamus, 16 ± 14% in striatum, and 35 ± 34% in cerebellum; p<.05; 
Figures 4 and 5). It has been previously established that, in the absence of challenge, no 
significant change in 5-IA BP F is observed during these time intervals (143).  These data

volunteers. The first three scans were obtained starting at [ADDRESS_106249] 
beginning of tracer infusion, when a state of equilibrium is achieved, and 
provided the baseline binding potential.  Following completion of the 
baseline scans, the AChE inhibitor physostigmine was administered i.v. 
(1.5 mg over 1 h, arrow). At the end of the physostigmine infusion, 
scanning was resumed up to 14 h.  BP F values measured after the 
physostigmine infusion were significantly reduced compared to the 
baseline values. As physostigmine has negligible affinity for β 2-nAChRs, 
the decrease in β 2-nAChR availability might be due to physostigmine 
induced elevation in ACh in the vicinity of β 2-nAChR receptors and 
binding competition or allosteric modulation reducing the binding 
availability of the receptors for the radiotracer.

physostigmine-induced increases in ACh compete with 5-IA for binding to β 2-nAChRs. 
Several limitations of these studies should be acknowledged. 1) While bolus plus constant 
infusion studies have demonstrated no systematic changes in V T between the early and late 
intervals in the absence of pharmacological challenges, suboptimal equilibrium conditions have 
been observed with this slow radiotracer during long scans, which is a source of noise in the 
evaluation of the physostigmine effect (143); 2) The limited resolution of SPECT and the low 
count rate toward the end of the infusion is a source of noise.  Both of these limitations will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_96114] (better resolution, more accurate quantification), by [CONTACT_2329] a fast 
radiotracer NCFHEB, and a single bolus injection; 3) The physostigmine effect on 5-IA V T 
might be due to factors other than increase in synaptic ACh.  Although physostigmine has no 
appreciable affinity for β 2-nAChRs(144) (making a direct displacement by [CONTACT_96115]), we cannot rule out that a brain-penetrant metabolite of physostigmine might directly 
interact with this receptor, or that some other nonspecific factors might be at play. Thus, it is 
imperative to verify that the effect can also be observed with an AChE inhibitor not chemically 
related to physostigmine.  
It should be clarified that other validations studies will be required before proposing that this 
paradigm provides a measure of changes in synaptic ACh. Studies in nonhuman primates will be 
needed to assess the correlation between changes in extracellular ACh measured with 
microdialysis and decrease in NCFHEB BP.  Our collaborators Drs. Laruelle(145) and 
Carson(146) have demonstrated that in nonhuman primates the magnitude of changes in 
extracellular DA measured with microdialysis following an amphetamine challenge are 
correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in striatal DA D [ADDRESS_106250], respectively.  These experiments provided a critical validation of the molecular 
imaging measurement of DA tone (147).  In the current study, we propose to replicate and extend 
the human 5-IA SPECT physostigmine data with NCFHEB PET.  In future extensions of this 
work, we will propose combined PET/microdialysis studies in nonhuman primates.

While nicotine results in 200% increases in dopamine release as measured with microdialysis, 
amphetamine results in up to 1000% increases in dopamine release.  Therefore, there is a much 
larger signal to detect, which has been reliably measured in many PET studies.  In the current 
study, we will use amphetamine-induced DA release to measure DA neurotransmission.

3.1  Overall plan:
Aim 1:  To evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of NCFHEB binding paramenters in 10 
healthy subjects. 
CLOSED Aim 2: To determine if  2-nAChR availability is genetically predisposed in 10 
never smokers and 10 smokers at one week of abstinence with NCFHEB.
CLOSED Aim 3: To determine if the adaptive increase in  2-nAChR availability and 
change in  2-nAChR availability over the first month of abstinence in smokers is 
genetically predisposed (the same 10 smokers from Aim 2) with NCFHEB. 
Aim 4: To measure the sensitivity of NCFHEB binding to changes in endogenous ACh 
levels in up to 50 smoking and 50 nonsmoking subjects. 
CLOSED Aim 5: To measure the sensitivity of NCFHEB binding to changes in endogenous 
ACh levels in up to 10 smoking and 10 nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia . 
Aim 6: To determine the efficacy of a bolus to infusion scan versus a bolus scan of 
NCFHEB with physostigmine challenge.
CLOSED Aim 7:  To determine amphetamine-induced DA release in tobacco smokers 
during acute withdrawal and in nonsmokers with [11C] PHNO.

3.4 Assessments:
All participants will be screened initially using a telephone screen that will include questions to 
evaluate medical history, personal and familial psychiatric and smoking history.  
3.4a. General Intake Assessments 
1. Demographic  Questionnaire This questionnaire will obtain: (1) basic demographic 
information including age, gender, marital status, employment status, occupation, (2) 
alcohol/drug history, (3) family history of alcohol/drug use, depression, anxiety, and smoking 
history.
2. Medical  History This questionnaire will obtain a basic medical history (personal and 
family) including past or current conditions such as neurological, endocrine, cardiovascular, 
renal, liver, and thyroid pathology. Current body weight and current medications will also be 
assessed. 
3. Medical  Assessments will include a physical exam by a state licensed physician 
(overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Matuskey), a complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
fasting blood sugar, electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests  (including T 3, T4, 
T3RU, estimated free T4), thyroid stimulating hormone levels, urine toxicology, EKG, and 
urinalysis. Female subjects will have serum pregnancy tests. All EKGs are read by a state 
licensed cardiologist and all abnormal MRIs will be reviewed by a state licensed 
neuroradiologist.
4. Illicit  Drug/Pregnancy Screen A urine sample will be collected to determine current illicit 
drug use (for all potential subjects). In addition, urine samples will be collected for the intake

urine pregnancy test will not be required prior to the MRI if the serum pregnancy test was done 
within 1 week prior to the MR imaging session.
5. Structured  Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders  The psychotic screening and 
depression sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) 
will be used to determine whether subjects meet exclusion criteria for diagnosis of psychotic 
disorders and major depression (148).
3.4b.  Mood Measures 
We may of mood and anxiety at intake and also on the PET scan day including the following.
1. Center  for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D)  The CES-D (149) is a 20-
item self-report instrument, which has been extensively used in both clinical and nonclinical 
populations to measure the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms over the past week. 
The CES-D, which has been used to document the severity of depressive symptoms in adults 
(150) and has been shown to be a sensitive measure of negative affect in smokers (151), will be 
used in the proposed studies to exclude for presence of major depression, and to measure level of 
mild depressive symptoms commonly noted in tobacco smokers.
2. Anxiety:  The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (152) is a 40-item, self-report measure, 
comprised of two  subscales. The State-Anxiety scale is 20 items and assesses transitory states 
characterized by [CONTACT_96117], apprehension, and heightened autonomic reactivity. The 
Trait-Anxiety scale is 20 items and assesses stable individual differences in anxiety proneness.
3. Impulsivity : Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS; (153)) is a 30 item self-report instrument 
designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. 
 
3.4c. Smoking Measures
We may obtain smoking measures at intake and also on the PET scan day, which may include 
the following. 
1.Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).(154) This will be used to measure the 
severity of nicotine dependence.  It is a 6-item scale with an internal consistency of .[ADDRESS_106257].(155) This measures the severity of eight withdrawal 
symptoms on 5-point Likert scales.  
4. Tiffany Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU).(156) The QSU-brief is a 10-item 
questionnaire that evaluates the structure and function of smoking urges.  Subjects indicate on a 
likert-type scale how strongly they agree or disagree with each statement with a score of 1 
(strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree).  This characterizes ‘urges to smoke’ into a negative 
affect related to relief of withdrawal symptoms and positive affect related to expectancy of 
reinforcement.  
5.  GLMS – set of questionnaires in which subjects rate sensations related to smoking such as 
craving on a scale from “no sensation” to “strongest imaginable.”
6.  LHS – set of questionnaires in which subjects rate hedonic reaction to sensations from 
smoking on a scale from “most disliked sensation imaginable” to “most liked sensation 
imaginable.”

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 25 of 683.4d Cognitive Measures
We may obtain these measures at baseline and up to two times on the PET days.
1. Cogstate Battery (30 minutes) – This computerized test battery will assess memory and 
cognition.  The tasks may include:
a. International Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96063] – a computerized task to assess verbal learning and memory.
b.  Groton Maze Learning Task – a computerized task to assess executive function and spatial 
problem solving.
c.  Detection Task – a computerized task to assess psychomotor function and speed of 
processing.
d.  Identification Task – a computerized task to assess visual attention and vigilance.
e.  One Card Learning Task – a computerized task to assess visual learning and memory.
f.  One Back Task – a computerized task to assess attention and working memory
2.Probabilistic  Reward Task: The PRT has been successfully used to assess reward 
responsiveness (166-168). In each trial, subjects choose which of two difficult-to-differentiate 
stimuli was presented. Stimuli consist of simple cartoon faces (diameter: 25 mm; eyes: 7 mm) 
presented in the center of the monitor. At the beginning of the trial, the face has no mouth. 
After a given delay, either a straight mouth of 11.5 mm (“short mouth”) or 13 mm (“long 
mouth”) is presented for [ADDRESS_106258] 
identification of one stimulus (“rich stimulus”) is rewarded three times more frequently 
(“Correct! You won 20 cents”) than the other (“lean”) stimulus. In healthy controls, this 
reinforcement schedule leads to a response bias (i.e., a preference for the more frequently 
rewarded stimulus). The degree of response bias toward the more frequently reinforced 
alternative will be used for operationalizing sensitivity to reward.
3.Conditioned Hallucinations  Task: participants’ thresholds for detection (75% likelihood of 
detection) of a tone embedded in white noise will be determined using the maximum-
likelihood-based QUEST62 method, with detection and non-detection signaled by [CONTACT_96118]-
press.  Target auditory stimuli will be of the following easily-discernible63 frequencies: 500, 
1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 Hz. All target auditory stimuli will be paired with a unique visual 
pattern (colors: white, blue, orange, red, green, matched for luminance and contrast) present 
for the duration of the auditory stimulus presentation.  All auditory and visual stimuli will be 
randomized across participants and across assessments.  Given participant responses, 
individualized psychometric functions will be estimated, corresponding to likelihood of 
detection as a function of target stimulus intensity, and from this, estimations of the intensities 
at which individuals will report detection of the target stimulus at rates of 50% and 25% will 
be determined. Over twelve blocks, participants will be presented first with stimuli played at 
their detection threshold, and then increasingly with sub-threshold and absent stimuli. This is 
meant to foster implicit learning and subsequent testing of the association between light and 
tone.  Participants will respond by [CONTACT_96118]-press, and during the train/test period will hold down 
response buttons to indicate degree of confidence in their answer, guided by [CONTACT_63689]-screen 
visual-analog scale.  Conditioned Hallucination trials will be taken to be those during which 
participants report the presence of the target tone despi[INVESTIGATOR_96064].

Subjects may be asked to participate in the Cold Pressor Task.  The cold pressor task (CPT) 
is a stress task used to measure pain sensitivity and pain tolerance.  This task will be used to 
determine alterations in pain thresholds as a result of nicotine use.  Participants will immerse 
their hand (up to the wrist) for up to 3 minutes in the experimental (ice-cold temperature 0-
4°C)) and control (room temperature (20°C)) conditions.  Physiological measure (heart rate, 
blood pressure and subject responses (stress, mood) will be collected 5 minutes before, 1 
minute into, and immediately after the CPT.

on the lower resolution PET images.  The T1 weighted images will be acquired on a 3 Tesla 
Siemens Scanner.  There will also be an additional resting state scan with subjects in the scanner, 
eyes open, fixating on a cross.  Smokers who participate in Aims 4 and 7 may return for a second 
MRI with resting state at 4-8 weeks of smoking abstinence.
Physostigmine challenge (same paradigm as HIC# 09100005837) 
Physostigmine will be administered as follows.  Glycopyrrolate, a cholinergic antagonist that 
does not have central side-effects, will be administered prior to physostigmine challenge to block 
physostigmine peripheral side-effects (e.g. nausea). Subjects will receive 200 mcg /ml x [ADDRESS_106260] administration.  The same dose of physostigmine will be 
administered as in the preliminary data: 1.5 mg/hr for 1 hr. Vital signs, including systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be monitored before physostigmine 
and then at 10, 20, 30, 60 min after the beginning of the infusion and then hourly until the end of 
the study day. Subjects will be questioned before, during, and after physostigmine challenge 
about potential adverse reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_96065] (nausea, upset stomach, etc., as in 
Risks section). [If there is a significant and persistent drop in subjects’ heart rate (>15% for at 
least 1 min), the IV physostigmine infusion will be stopped but the subject will continue to be 
monitored and will be discharged at the discretion of the study doctor. In emergency situation, 
PET center protocol will be followed accordingly (on file with HIC). 
Amphetamine challenge
Dextroamphetamine sulfate is the dextro isomer of the compound d,l-amphetamine sulfate, a
sympathomimetic amine of the amphetamine group. It is an FDA approved drug available for the
treatment of narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (maximum approved total
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 27 of 68daily dose of 5-60 mg). After the first [11C]PHNO scan, dextro-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, PO) 
will be given in increments of 5 or 10 mg, as it is available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, and will 
be rounded down to approximate 0.5 mg/kg total dose without exceeding it. Total dextro-
amphetamine dose will not exceed [ADDRESS_106261] amphetamine identical to the methods outlined 
previously. The timing of the second [11C]PHNO administration and subsequent PET scanning 
(i.e., 2.5-3 hours) corresponds to the time of maximum plasma concentration of amphetamine as 
stated in the respective FDA-approved product labeling. EKG and frequent BP monitoring will 
occur throughout the study and until the vital signs are within normal limits. Supplemental 
oxygen will be provided via nasal cannula if necessary.  If the systolic BP reaches or exceeds 
200 mmHg for more than 5 minutes, the study doctor will take the appropriate clinical measures 
in order to lower the BP, which may include phentolamine administration (5 mg IV over 10 min) 
or other appropriate measures.
Following the post-amphetamine PET scan, subjects will be assessed (EKG and vital signs) by 
[CONTACT_96119].  Subjects will be discharged when vital signs are within normal limits 
and when behavioral changes (if any) are found to be not clinically significant by [CONTACT_96120]. If subjects experience any adverse events, they will be 
treated until they become asymptomatic, prior to discharge.
Behavioral response to amphetamine will be measured by [CONTACT_6270]-ratings with a simplified version 
of the Amphetamine Interview Rating Scale (van Kammen and Murphy, 1975).  Four items will 
be investigated: euphoria ("feel good"), alertness ("feel energetic"), restlessness ("feel like 
moving") and anxiety ("feel anxious").  Self ratings will be obtained by [CONTACT_96121] d-amphetamine administration: -5 minutes, 0, and hourly 
thereafter until end of the second scan. 
Cigarette challenges (same procedures as in protocol HIC [PHONE_2230])
Subjects will participate in one or more PET scans during which they will participate in 4 
possible smoking challenges: Smoking an e-cig with no nicotine, an e-cig with a low dose of 
nicotine (6mg/mL-10mg/mL), an e-cig with a high dose of nicotine (24 mg/mL-36mg/mL), or 
smoking a regular cigarette. Subjects will participate in a different challenge for each of their 
PET scans.  For the e-cig challenges, subjects will not be aware of the amount of nicotine in the 
e-cig. Subjects will abstain from smoking for ~[ADDRESS_106262] 1 week. They will then need to abstain 
from smoking for ~[ADDRESS_106263] employed this procedure previously for protocol HIC [PHONE_2230]. 
Use of e-cig:  Based on the findings of a recent study that showed use of e-cigs led to similar 
plasma nicotine levels as tobacco smoking within 5 minutes of use7, we plan to use an e-Go type 
e-cig battery (3.3 V, 1000 mAh) with 1.5 ohm dual-coil 510-style cartomizer and a 70/30 
propylene glycol vegetable glycerin e-liquid with nicotine concentrations of approximately 
0mg/mL, 6mg/mL-10mg/mL, and 24mg/mL-36mg/mL. Subjects will be instructed to puff on the 
e-cig once every 30 seconds in a manner as they normally would puff on a cigarette for 10 puffs 
total. A mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_96066].
Use of regular  cigarette: To standardize research methodology, Camels brand cigarettes will be 
used for all subjects. This brand is not prevalent with the smokers who participate in our studies 
and
 any subject who has used this brand prior will be excluded. Subjects will be instructed to

Technologies, [LOCATION_003]), which provides measures of depth of puff inhalation and volume. 
Blood Samples: On PET scan days, blood samples will be collected prior to radiotracer 
administration and at multiple time points after e-cig and tobacco cigarette use to determine 
nicotine concentrations in the blood, which will be assayed using reversed-phase HPLC 49. 
PET
PET scans may be performed on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT, 2-3 mm 
resolution) or another similar camera.  Venous catheters will be used for i.v. administration of 
the radiotracers, venous blood sampling of AChE activity, for the administration of 
glycopyrrolate and physostigmine, and for venous blood sampling of physostigmine and 
amphetamine PKs.  A radial artery catheter will be inserted by [CONTACT_96122]. At the beginning of 
scan, the subject’s head will be immobilized and a transmission scan will be obtained for 
attenuation correction. PET scans will be acquired using bolus or bolus to infusion 
administration of up to 8 mCi of [18F]NCFHEB or up to 10 mCi of [11C]PHNO and subjects will 
be scanned for up to [ADDRESS_106264] 
motion is corrected automatically on an event-by-event basis with the Vicra motion tracking 
system.  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) are collected prior to and during each 
PET scan. Urine pregnancy test will be again administered on the PET scan day prior to the 
initiation of any imaging procedures. Smoking abstinence, when appropriate, will also be 
confirmed for smoking subjects prior to PET scanning. 
PET scanning will then proceed as following for each aim: 
Aim 1. Subjects will be asked to come to the PET center on two separate days to participate in 
one NCFHEB PET scan each time to assess test retest reproducibility of binding parameters 
measured with the radiotracer. 
CLOSED Aim 2.  Subjects will participate in one NCFHEB PET scan day.  
CLOSED Aim 3. Subjects from Aim [ADDRESS_106265] is not able to tolerate a longer scan day. Therefore, some subjects 
may complete the study over two separate days (preferably within [ADDRESS_106266]’s schedule). 
CLOSED Aim 5.  Baseline NCFHEB PET imaging will be conducted followed by 
[CONTACT_96123]. Preferably, this will be done on the same day. However, at 
times when there is not enough radiotracer or when a subject is not able to tolerate a longer scan 
day. Therefore, some subjects may complete the study over two separate days (preferably within 
[ADDRESS_106267]’s schedule).

physostigmine administration.  Up to 8mCi of NCFHEB will be administered as a bolus plus 
constant infusion for the duration of the scan (up to 4 hours).  Once equilibrium is reached 
(approximately two hours into the scan) glycopyrrolate and physostigmine will be administered 
and subjects will be scanned for approximately two more hours. A transmission scan will be 
acquired.
CLOSED Aim 7. Subjects from Aim 4 will be asked to come back for two [11C]PHNO scans 
with amphetamine administration.  Up to [ADDRESS_106268] 
scan, subjects will take amphetamine (0.5mg/kg) by [CONTACT_1966], and will be imaged again with 
PHNO.  If technical difficulties arise the second PET scan will be scheduled as soon as possible 
(within 5 weeks). In that case, subjects may be asked to re-take amphetamine on the day of the 
rescheduled PHNO scan, approximately [ADDRESS_106269] home.
CLOSED Aim 8. Subjects who previously participated in Aim 4 or 6, or new subjects may 
complete this portion of the protocol as long as their yearly radiation dose allows. For Aim 8, 
subjects will participate in one or more PET scans during which they will participate in 4 
possible smoking challenges: Smoking an e-cig with no nicotine, an e-cig with a low dose of 
nicotine (6mg/mL-10mg/mL), an e-cig with a high dose of nicotine (24 mg/mL-36mg/mL, or 
smoking a regular cigarette. Subjects will participate in a different challenge for each of their 
PET scans.. For each scan, up to 8mCi of NCFHEB will be administered as a bolus plus constant 
infusion for the duration of the scan (up to 4 hours).  Once equilibrium is reached (approximately 
two hours into the scan), subjects will use a cigarette or e-cigarette (order will be predetermined 
ahead of time and subjects will be told what they will be using for each scan.  However, if 
subjects are using the e-cig they will not be told which nicotine concentration they will receive). 
A transmission scan will be acquired.
Control subjects may participate in more than [ADDRESS_106270] in the following brain regions:

3.8a Contingency Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation (healthy controls)
We plan to image smokers whom have been abstinent from smoking for approximately 1 week 
(with and without schizophrenia), 2 weeks (controls only) and 6 weeks (controls only). 
Contingency management techniques have been successfully used to reduce CO levels in non-
treatment seeking smokers by a number of investigators (158-160). 
Subjects will set a quit date and prior to the quit date they meet with the research staff who will 
provide them with brief advice on quitting smoking based on AHCPR guidelines (The Smoking 
Cessation and Clinical Practice Guideline Panel and Staff, 1996). They will be advised about the 
risks and benefits of quitting smoking and told that they will be monitored daily to ensure 
abstinence.  Subjects will be informed of payment schedules (see below) for CO levels indicating 
abstinence and also given information on how quit rates in the first week of smoking cessation 
predicted sustained abstinence.  We use CO levels < [ADDRESS_106276] week of abstinence we will obtain CO levels from subjects up to twice daily. In 
addition, we will obtain urine samples once daily to measure cotinine levels (a nicotine metabolite). 
For each contingency management appointment, subjects will get $10 if their CO levels are less 
than 11ppm and urine cotinine levels are less than 100 ng/ml.  
3.8b Contingency Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation (subjects with schizophrenia)
Because it is more difficult for smokers with schizophrenia to quit smoking, they may choose to 
participate in this part of the study as an inpatient at CNRU. This was previously done in our 
HIC27532. T herefore ,
 smokers with s chizophre nia c onsenting to the study will be a dmitted to 
the CNRU, for approximately [ADDRESS_106277]’s non-re search clinician.  Pa tients will not be  responsible f or pa ying the

3.9.b SNP Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_96073] (model 7900 detection device) will be 
used for SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This instrument uses probes with two dyes on opposite ends of a target 
sequence oligonucleotide to recognize SNP polymorphisms. One dye is a reporter dye, the other 
a quencher. When the probe is intact, the quencher suppresses fluorescence from the reporter; 
when the quencher and reporter are separated, the reporter emits a fluorescence signal. When the 
probe hybridizes exactly to its complement, the 5’ exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase 
cleaves the probe and allows the signal to be detected. The Taqman system uses two probes to 
detect a SNP, one complementary to each allele. An advantage of the Taqman system is that ABI 
offers detection reagents for many polymorphic systems pre-synthesized and tested, “on 
demand.” Detection reagents for other variants are ordered “on demand” through a user-friendly 
WWW interface.
3.9.c Quality Assurance for Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_96074] 96-well DNA set, we include two blank lanes 
as contamination controls and a CEPH control of known genotype. In addition, at least 8% of 
genotypes will be repeated and if any discrepancies are noted, the entire cohort will be

1. Risks Associated with Radiation 
The Yale University Radioactive Drug Research Committee (YURDRC)  will review the use of 
radiation in this research study, and no subjects will be enrolled until RDRC approval is 
obtained. This research study involves exposure to radiation from [18F]NCFHEB  and 
[11C]PHNO PET scanning. This radiation exposure is not necessary for medical care and is for 
research purposes only. 
For each individual [18F]NCFHEB PET scan, subjects will receive up to ≤ 8 mCi of 
[18F]NCFHEB, plus transmission scans. This is equal to an effective dose equivalent of 0.635 
rem per injection. For each individual [11C]PHNO PET scan, subjects will receive up to ≤ 10 
mCi of [11C]PHNO, plus transmission scans. This is equal to an effective dose equivalent of 0.[ADDRESS_106285] will receive in this study is 
from up to 4 injections of ≤  8 mCi each of [18F]NCFHEB, up to 2 injections of ≤ 10mCi each of 
[11C]PHNO, plus transmission scans. This includes the fact that some subjects may have to come 
back on a separate day for baseline and physostigmine scans. Four [18F]NCFHEB injections and 
two [11C]PHNO injections is the maximum each subject may receive from participation in this 
study.
Although each organ will receive a different dose, the maximum amount of radiation exposure 
subjects will receive per year from this study is equal to an effective dose equivalent of 3.08 rem 
for a total of up to 32 mCi of [18F] NCFHEB in 4 injections of  ≤ 8mCi each and 20 mCi of [11C] 
PHNO in 2 injections of ≤ 10mCi each. This calculated value is used to relate the dose received 
by [CONTACT_96129] a single value.
The amount of radiation subjects will receive in this study is below the dose guidelines established 
by [CONTACT_96130]. This guideline sets an effective dose limit of [ADDRESS_106286] pacemakers, metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], aneurysm clips, or other 
contraindications for MR.
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to 
take pi[INVESTIGATOR_57180].  The [LOCATION_002] Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, 
and we carefully observe those guidelines. 
 
Subjects will be watched closely throughout the MR study.  Some people may feel 
uncomfortable or anxious.  If this happens, the subject may ask to stop the study at any time and 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page [ADDRESS_106287]’s scan, a radiologist or another physician 
will be asked to review the relevant images.  Based on his or her recommendation (if any), the 
primary investigator or consulting physician will contact [CONTACT_423], inform them of the finding, 
and recommend that they seek medical advice as a precautionary measure.  The decision for 
additional examination or treatment would lie solely with the subject and their physician.  The 
investigators, the consulting physician, the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale 
University are not responsible for any examination or treatment that a subject receives based on 
these findings.  The images collected in this study are not a clinical MR exam and for that 
reason, they will not be made available for diagnostic purposes.
3. Blood Drawing and IV line Insertion
Drawing blood and inserting an intravenous line (IV) into an arm vein are safe and standard 
medical procedures. Sometimes a bruise will occur at the puncture site and rarely a blood clot or 
infection will occur in the vein. Certain individuals may feel light-headed during venipuncture. 
The volume of blood collected during this study, may include screening laboratories, MRI and 
PET scans, will be approximately [ADDRESS_106288] any serious 
negative effects on a study participant. 
4.  Arterial Catheter
On the NCFHEB PET scan days a radial arterial catheter will be inserted. Arterial sampling may 
be associated with mild-to-moderate pain, hematoma, inflammation, or bruising at the puncture 
site. If this occurs, these signs and symptoms will dissipate over time, usually 24 to 72 hours 
after the event. In rare instances blocking of the artery, poor healing, or infection at the catheter 
insertion site may occur. Certain individuals may feel light-headed during arterial catheter 
placement.

known.
 Variation in some genes is known to be directly related to risk for certain illnesses and 
drug dependence, or may in the future be shown to be related to illness. Since the results of these 
genetic tests may allow prediction of risk of illness in some cases, we will keep the results 
confidential (only scientists working on this research project will know the results). We will not 
make any of our laboratory results available to the subject, nor will we add them to their medical 
record. (If the participant wants to know their risk for genetic diseases, we will refer them to a 
genetic counselor.) The DNA samples will not have the subject’s name [CONTACT_96179].
7.  IV Physostigmine
IV physostigmine is a cholinergic agent. The dose proposed in this protocol is less than that used 
for treatment. 
Side-effects from physostigmine include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, dizziness, 
headache,
 stomach pain, sweating and dyspepsia, pain, itching, burning, or swelling, or a lump 
under the skin where the shot is given. Rarely, more serious side-effects may include allergic 
reaction such as itching or hives, swelling in the face or hands, swelling or tingling in the mouth 
or throat, chest tightness, trouble breathing; increased watering in the mouth, severe nausea, or 
vomiting; increase in volume or frequency of urination, or severe diarrhea; seizures; slow 
heartbeat, dizziness, or fainting. In order to reduce these effects, we will administer 
glycopyrrolate, prior to physostigmine administration and control food intake. Furthermore, 
physostigmine will be administered in the presence of a doctor who will monitor side-effects, 
including reduced heart rate, and will be available throughout the study. In the case of serious 
side-effects, the study may be terminated and appropriate measures, which may include call to 
911, will be taken.
8. Administration of physostigmine and glycopyrrolate to subjects with schizophrenia
There are few studies with Physostigmine in schizophrenia patients (161, 162). It has been used 
primarily as a probe of cholinergic function to study schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia and 
mania. Overall, it appears that physostigmine either improves or has no effects on symptoms in 
schizophrenia. In a more recent study with the related acetylcholine esterase inhibitor 
Rivastigmine, there appeared to be no benefit or worsening of either cognitive deficits or 
symptoms in schizophrenia patients (163, 164). In contrast to the studies with physostigmine and 
Rivastigmine, Rowntree et al. (165) observed that  Diisopropylfluorophosphonate, a centrally 
active cholinesterase inhibitor, produced worsened symptoms among a 30% of schizophrenia 
patients studies. The increase in symptoms in contrast to a lowering of symptoms has been 
interpreted as a rebound phenomenon.  In summary, the evidence available suggests that 
physostigmine will either have no effects or may improve symptoms in schizophrenia patients.  
If schizophrenia patients do experience any worsening of symptoms we will manage those 
symptoms as we usually do: with a range of supportive and pharmacological measures.
Since patients with schizophrenia may already be on an anticholinergics e.g., benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_96078], for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced motor side effects making them more 
sensitive to the peripheral anticholinergic effects of glycopyrrolate, we will withhold standing

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page [ADDRESS_106290] day in those patients who are taking 
anticholinergics.  Withholding standing anticholinergics for 24 hours is likely to be well-
tolerated.
9.  Risks of oral d-amphetamine 
Risks of amphetamine administration include both medical and psychiatric risks.
The frequent somatic  side effects of d-amphetamine administration are cardiovascular 
(hypertension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia, bradycardia, orthostasis). General effects such as 
sweating, feeling warm or cold, nausea, diarrhea, muscle and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], have been 
reported frequently. Behavioral effects in this dose range are increased level of alertness, 
talkativeness, restlessness, agitation, mood changes (usually euphoria) and anxiety. In our 
experience, these effects are generally transient and well tolerated. This dose of amphetamine 
has not been reported to induce psychotic symptoms in non-schizophrenic subjects. Infrequently 
blurred vision, headaches and chest tightness, and changes in EKG have been reported. There is 
a rare risk of permanent neurological damage and death as a result of cardiac arrest or stroke.
Psychiatric or behavioral side effects:  General behavioral effects of amphetamine in this dose 
range are increased level of alertness, talkativeness, restlessness, agitation, mood changes 
(usually euphoria) and anxiety.  In our experience, these effects are generally transient and well 
tolerated.  This dose of amphetamine has not been reported to induce psychotic symptoms in non 
schizophrenic subjects and we confirm this observation. 
10.  Risks of E-Cigarette  Use
The physiologic effects of e-cigarette use have been evaluated in human subjects in 9 studies.  
The following physiologic effects were associated with acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosols: 
-Mouth and throat irritation and dry cough at initial use (which decreased in severity with 
continued use), 
-No change in the following biomarkers: complete blood count (CBC), lung function, cardiac 
function, inflammatory markers, carbon monoxide (CO) level, plasma nicotine level, and heart 
rate
-Reduced fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_96079] e-cigarettes, these products 
appear to be less harmful than tobacco cigarettes. They will be administered to tobacco smokers 
only, who are already dependent on tobacco cigarettes.  
10. Risk  from Cognitive Testing
The risk from Cognitive Testing is very minimal, there is a small risk for subjects who have a 
history of seizures due to flashing lights in the Conditioned Hallucination Task, however a 
history of seizures is an exclusion criteria. 
11. Minimizing  Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be  
    minimized. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 40 of 681.  The dose of radiation will be submitted for approval to the Yale University Radioactive 
Drug Research Committee (YURDRC) .  All scans will be done in the presence of medical 
supervision and trained staff in an institution specifically designed to support imaging studies. In 
the event of serious medical complications, the PET scan facilities have immediate access to or 
consultation with specialized medical units at the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Preparation of 
radiopharmaceuticals and performance of PET scans will be by [CONTACT_57223], physicians, and 
technologists of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine. 
These professionals are qualified by [CONTACT_96131]. Subjects will be asked about their previous radiation exposure and those 
who have had research exposure within the past year will be excluded if their cumulative annual 
exposure (including the present study) exceeds FDA limits.   The information on the previous 
radiation exposure of study subjects will be notified to the study doctor. 
No PET studies will be performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women, as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_96132]. If subjects are breastfeeding they will not be able to participate in this research 
study. 
2.  The risks of bruising, clotting, and infection will be minimized by [CONTACT_96133]. To avoid injury due to 
fainting, the venous catheters will be inserted when the subjects are recumbent. The blood draws 
during PET scanning sessions will be obtained from the already inserted catheter, to minimize 
discomfort.
3.  Risks of radial artery cannulation are minimized by [CONTACT_96134]. Pain is minimized by [CONTACT_96135]. Bleeding is prevented by [CONTACT_96136] a minimum of [ADDRESS_106291] the magnet.  For additional security, subjects will 
be taken through a ferromagnetic metal detector immediately before going to the scan room.
Effective screening to exclude subjects who would be placed at a greater risk. This includes 
medical history, physical examination, and screening studies (blood, urine and ECG) performed 
before starting studies.  A state-licensed physician or an Advanced Practice Registered Nurses

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 41 of 68(APRN’s) will conduct all medical screenings.
In case of an adverse event, the PI, under the advice of the study collaborators Drs. Matuskey 
and Carson, will evaluate the adverse event and determine whether the adverse event affects the 
Risk/ Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (at Risks to Subjects) 
or consent form (at Risks and Inconveniences) are required.
5.  For risks associated with oral d-amphetamine administration
Medical side effects:  Subjects will be screened for absence of significant medical history and 
current medical conditions with a complete medical history, physical examination, routine blood 
tests, urine toxicology and EKG. Inclusion in the study will be limited to individuals who are 
between the ages of 18-55. Patients will be excluded if they have any h/o severe medical or 
neurological illness, any clinically significant brain abnormality, insulin dependent diabetes, a 
history of cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. Patients will be excluded if they have recently 
donated blood.  Administration of oral d-amphetamine will take place at the PET center by a 
research nurse, with a physician on site.  The research nurse will report vital signs to the physician 
prior to administering the amphetamine.
 If several of the subject’s blood pressure readings are recorded at >100 or <60 for diastolic BP 
or >160 or <[ADDRESS_106292], they will be evaluated by [CONTACT_96137].  The study may 
be cancelled at the discretion of the MD after evaluation.  Any automated blood pressure results 
that are abnormal will be repeated manually. The manual reading will be the official reading. 
Constant EKG and frequent BP monitoring will occur until the vital signs are within normal 
limits. If the systolic BP reaches or exceeds 200 mmHg for more than 5 minutes, an infusion of 
phentolamine (5 mg IV, over 10 min) or other appropriate measures may be initiated to control 
the blood pressure response.  The study physician will be notified if those parameters are reached 
and he/she will supervise the treatment.  
In case of chest pain, chest tightness or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia, the 
experiment may be cancelled and an EKG will be obtained to rule out angina (ST segment 
elevation or depression as compared to the baseline EKG). Appropriate treatment will be 
initiated.
Upon discharge, patients will be given the phone numbers of the study physicians and will not be 
allowed to drive home.  They will either arrange a ride or a taxi.

Data Safety Monitoring Plan:
1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol 
compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be 
conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is 
sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether 
the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. 
Either the principal investigator, the IRB or Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the 
authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following 
reasons: 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 42 of 681. We  do not view the risks associated with the __ radiotracers [18F]NCFHEB and 
[11C]PHNO_ as minimal.
2. We  do not view the risks associated with the combined use of ________and_________ as 
minimal.
3. Given  the now established safety and validity of the current _________ in our prior work, 
we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4. Given  our experience with the combined co-administration_________, we do not view 
the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-
hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring 
the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_96080], Ph.D. according to the 
following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse  event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate  adverse event
3. Severe  
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96081] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it:
1. is  life-threatening OR
2. results  in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57186]
3. results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity OR
4. results  in a congenital anomaly or birth defect OR
5. results  in death OR

An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the HIIRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting serious AND unanticipated AND related adverse events, anticipated 
adverse events occurring at a greater frequency than expected, and other unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others to the IRB
The investigator will report the following types of adverse events to the IRB: a) serious AND 
unanticipated AND possibly, probably or definitely related events; b) anticipated adverse events 
occurring with a greater frequency than expected; and c) other unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others.
These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be 
reported to the IRB within 48 hours of it becoming known to the investigator, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website.
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study 
sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory
agencies will be notified:
□ All  Co-Investigators listed on the protocol.
□ Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
□ National  Institutes of Health
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_96080], Ph.D. will conduct a review of all adverse events 
upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_96082].

include relevant data on animal models. 
[18F]NCFHEB  has been administered I.V. to human subjects previously by [CONTACT_96139], Ph. D., at the Department of Radiopharmacy, Institute of Interdisciplinary Isotope 
Research, Leipzig, [LOCATION_013]. 
Whole body dosimetry of [18F]-(-)-NCFHEB was performed in volunteers.  The subjects were 
sequentially imaged up to 7h post i.v. injection of 353.7±10.2 MBq of[18F]- (-)-NCFHEB on a 
SIEMENS Biograph16 PET/CT-system with 9 bed positions (BP) per frame,1.5-6min/BP, CT-
attenuation correction and iterative reconstruction. All relevant organs were defined by [CONTACT_96140]. Exponential curves were fitted to the time-activity-data. The ODs were calculated 
using the adult male model with OLINDA. The ED was calculated using tissue weighing factors 
as published in the ICRP 103/2007. The highest OD was received by [CONTACT_96141]

of [11C]PHNO binding was demonstrated in preclinical studies that included ex vivo and in vivo 
studies in rodents and cats. Ex vivo biodistribution studies in rat brain demonstrated that 
[11C]PHNO crossed the blood-brain barrier readily and had an appropriate regional brain

showed that [11C]PHNO is a D 2/D3 agonist, but D 3 preferring, and it displayed unusually high 
binding in globus pallidus (GP), which is not observed with [11C]raclopride (a D 2-like antagonist 
with the highest binding in dorsal striatum).  Most recently, studies showed that 95% of 
[11C]PHNO binding in substantia nigra (SN) is due to the binding to D3, not to D2. Furthermore, 
[11C]PHNO showed marked and appropriate sensitivity to both increases and decreases in levels 
of endogenous dopamine.  
PET Imaging with [11C]PHNO  in Monkeys at Yale University PET Center 
We have successfully prepared [ 11C]PHNO  with high radiochemical purity and high specific 
activity at the Yale University PET Center radiochemistry laboratory.  One test scan and two 
control-preblock studies were performed in three different rhesus monkeys using [11C]PHNO 
(Table 1). For the control-preblock studies, injections of [11C]PHNO were delivered as a 2-
minute bolus followed by 118 minutes of constant infusion. In the preblock studies, 2 mg/kg of 
SB-277011, a DA D [ADDRESS_106299]-injection and 
BPND was calculated by [CONTACT_96142] 60 to 90 
minutes (Table 1). These results indicate that [11C]PHNO is a DA D 3 receptor-preferring 
radiotracer. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96083], and no noticeable effects were observed on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_96084],

2.2.Dosimetry Studies of [11C]PHNO in Monkeys at Yale PET Center
Radiation dosimetry for [11C]PHNO  has been estimated (using the standard MIRD absorption 
fractions program MIRDOSE 3.1) based on PET scans with a tracer dose of [11C]PHNO on four 
Rhesus monkeys (2 females and 2 males) to obtain organ concentration and residence time. The 
percentage of the injected dose per cm3 was calculated from ROIs drawn on the PET images, and 
average organ weights for female and male Rhesus monkeys were used to derive the amount of 
activity per organ as a function of time.  The scans were carried out to 120 minutes and the 
residence times calculated from a trapezoidal approximation of the integral.
Based on these numbers we estimated that the maximum allowable injection dose for 
[11C]PHNO
 is 55 mCi per single injection. We tabulated the dosimetry below (all entries refer to 
scan data from monkeys).

2.3. Clinical Characterization and Safety profile of [ 11C]PHNO
[11C]PHNO  has been used in several PET centers.  It was initially developed at the PET Center, 
University of Toronto, and the safety of its use in humans has been demonstrated. 
It states that oral or intravenous administration of therapeutic doses of PHNO (0.2 up to 60 mg) 
produces side effects commonly seen with other dopamine agonists.  In addition to orthostasis, 
the most frequently reported side effects were dystonia and nausea. Drop-outs in these studies 
were most commonly due to somnolence or orthostatic reactions.  None of the studies reported 
significant drug- related hematological, biochemical, or electrocardiographic changes.  In the 
first 18 healthy subjects studied with tracer doses  of [11C]PHNO, there were no changes in vital 
signs, EKG, or biochemical markers. 
The most common adverse event reported has been self-limiting transient nausea shortly after 
injection (well before the peak brain uptake). To date, they have carried out 331 PET scans with

at the Toronto CAMH PET Centre. Of those, 12% experienced nausea, 1% emesis and 3% 
reported other effects such as dizziness, headache or a warm sensation.  The occurrence of these 
side effects had no relation with the injected mass (2.3 ± 0.4 μg/kg; range 1.0–5.6  μg/kg), 
subject's sex, body mass or age. 
 
No serious adverse effects are expected from tracer doses of [11C]PHNO, with a recommended 
maximum mass less 0.5 nmoles/kg body weight, which is one thousand fold less than the 
pharmacological dose used during the therapeutic trials of PHNO. 
[11C]PHNO  has been used in humans at the Yale University PET center in several studies 
including HIC [PHONE_2231].
Previous studies involving IV physostigmine in humans 
At least [ADDRESS_106303] been conducted in 
human subjects without adverse side effects from the low dose of IV physostigmine 
administration. 
1. Koeppe  et al (1999) conducted a PET brain imaging study in 23 healthy volunteers 
to evaluate a new radiotracer. A subgroup of these individuals received 
physostigmine at a dose of 1.5mg/hr for one hour. They were pre-treated with 
glycopyrrolate. No unexpected adverse effects were reported. One subject was 
reported to feel nauseated but was able to complete the study.
2. Esterlis  et al (2013) conducted a SPECT imaging study in 7 healthy volunteers to 
evaluate whether [123I]5IA radioligand is susceptible to increases in endogenous 
ACh. Subjects underwent the same physostigmine paradigm as described in #[ADDRESS_106304] vomited as consequence of 
physostigmine administration. No serious or unexpected side effects were noted.
d-Amphetamine:
Amphetamine is administered to measure changes in [11C]PHNO binding due to dopamine release. 
This dose was chosen because it is expected to produce a quantifiable displacement of the 
radiotracer. The risks are outlined in Section VI.  Oral and IV d-amphetamine administration to 
healthy humans and individuals with psychiatric disorders has been safely used in many PET 
imaging studies. We will use the oral route due to the greater safety and ease of administration.

relationship
 with any potential subject? 
 Yes, all subjects
 Yes, some of the subjects
 No
If yes, describe the nature of this relationship.
9.Request for waiver of HIPAA authorization: (When requesting a waiver of HIPAA 
Authorization
 for either the entire study, or for recruitment purposes only.  Note: if you are 
collecting PHI as part of a phone or email screen, you must request a HIPAA waiver for 
recruitment purposes.)
Choose one: For entire study: ______ For recruitment purposes only: ___X___
i. Describe  why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for 
use/disclosure of this data;
ii. If  requesting a waiver of signed authorization, describe why it would be 
impracticable to obtain the subject’s signed authorization for use/disclosure of this

By [CONTACT_25253], the investigator assures that the protected 
health information for which a Waiver of Authorization has been requested will not 
be reused or disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed in this 
application, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of this research 
study, or as specifically approved for use in another study by [CONTACT_2717].
Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of the Yale 
HIPAA-Covered entity must be accounted for in the “accounting for disclosures log”, by [CONTACT_55470], purpose, date, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be 
forwarded to the Deputy HIPAA Privacy Officer.
 
10.Required  HIPAA Authorization: If the research involves the creation, use or disclosure of

12.Process  of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent    
    will be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to 
   ensure subjects’ independent decision-making. 
The consent process is a multistep process, whereby [CONTACT_96147]. The number of 
sessions over which this information will be provided will depend on how well the subject 
understands and retains the information. The process begins with the subject initiating contact 
[CONTACT_96148]. The research staff will provide a brief description of the study following which the 
subject is screened by a member of the research team. Thereafter, potentially eligible candidates 
are scheduled for a face-to-face interview. The study procedures will be described as a research 
tool with potential to enhance our knowledge about the brain. Subjects will also be informed of 
all potential risks of participation. Subjects will be required to read the informed consent form 
and the investigator will additionally describes the risks and discomforts. 
To ensure that the study subject understands the study, the subject will be asked questions 
about the study procedures and the risks associated with participation. If any concern arises that 
the study subject did not fully understand the study, the principal investigator (PI) may decide 
that the subject is not suitable for participation. This process generally takes about one hour. If 
the subject is still interested after all questions have been answered, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96086], will ask the subject to sign the informed consent form. Any subject who appears 
incapable of providing informed consent will be excluded. Subjects will be informed that they 
can decline to participate in the study without penalty and given the opportunity to withdraw 
from the study prior to analysis of their data. Following the resolution of any questions, the 
subjects will be asked to sign the consent form if he/she agrees to participate.
 The decision not to participate will not affect an individual’s eligibility to participate in future 
studies, to receive treatment at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or to receive treatment on a private 
basis from a referring clinician.  A copy of the signed consent form will be provided to all 
participating subjects.  For subjects who are not eligible, all PHI will be destroyed.
13.Evaluation  of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent:  Indicate how the 
personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent 
to the research being proposed. 
In cases in which capacity is in doubt, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96087]’s understanding of the study 
and the subject’s capacity to decide to participate.
14.   Documentation of Consent/Assent: Specify the documents that will be used during the 
   consent/assent process. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_25156], in the 
   same format that they will be given to subjects.

Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No
         If no, see http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html
 
All staff  members that come into contact [CONTACT_96152].
Identifiable paper  information is kept in locked file drawers and password protected computer 
files.  Results are published as group data without the use of characteristics that would identify 
individual subjects.  We quote information only by [CONTACT_29181], scientific 
reports, or publications, in order to maintain anonymity.
Identifiable research  data, including recruitment and screening information and code keys, are 
stored on a secure database located on the internal PET Center Network.  The PET network is 
protected by a Cisco PIX firewall operated by [CONTACT_57249].  All research data are backed up nightly to a 
Dell PV-136T library wit [ADDRESS_106310] to gain access to the database.  
Authorized users employ their netid and authentication is performed using Yale’s central 
authentication server.  Users always access research data through the random identifier only. Direct 
identifiers belonging to subjects who withdraw from the study, will be stripped from the key.
e. What  will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy 
the identifiable data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If 
no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured.
The data  will be stored in locked filing cabinets and on the password-protected secure database on 
the internal Yale University PET Center Network for at least [ADDRESS_106311] access to the protected health information (such as the research sponsor, the  
investigator, the research staff, all research monitors, FDA, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), SSC, etc.)? (please distinguish between PHI and de-
identified data) 
The investigator  and research staff (e.g., PET center nuclear technologists, recruiters) will have 
access to the PHI only on as needed to know basis.  The FDA may also have access to the PHI.

No.
SECTION  VI: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the 
research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Note: Payment of subjects is not 
considered a benefit in this context of the risk-benefit assessment.) 
There are no direct benefits to the nonsmoking subjects for participating in this study.  Smoking 
subjects receive smoking cessation support to abstain from tobacco smoking. This research will 
benefit scientific knowledge by [CONTACT_96153].  This may have clinical application in the future.
         SECTION  VII: R ESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC C ONSIDERATIONS
       1.   Alternatives: What alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the
              research?
The alternative to participation in this research protocol is to not participate.  Subjects will be 
informed
 that they are free to choose not to participate and, if they do agree to become a subject, 
they will be free to withdraw from the study at any time during its course.  They will also be 
informed that if they choose not to participate or if they withdraw, it will not adversely affect 
their relationship with their doctors or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (see attached Consent Form).
       2.   Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will
             be made to subjects and the conditions for receiving this compensation. 
The subjects will be compensated for their time commitment and inconveniences necessary for 
completing the study. Subjects will have no financial responsibilities for any portion of the study. 
For all Aims compensation may be $550 for each NCFHEB PET scan, $350 for each PHNO 
PET scan, $50 for each arterial line placement and $50 for each MRI scan and $[ADDRESS_106313] Task may also be 
compensated for the amount that they “win” during the task, up to $60.  Subjects may also 
receive an extra $10 for each Cold Pressor Task that they participate in.  Subjects who complete 
the Conditioned Hallucinations Task (Hearing Task in the Consent) will receive $75. Subjects 
will be paid either by [CONTACT_9434], and are advised to allow 4-[ADDRESS_106314] 
be submitted. If participation in the PET Scan has already begun, then compensation will be 
based on involvement in the study, and will be up to the discretion of the PI.
Smokers will also receive $[ADDRESS_106315] or check or cash.  Smokers will receive an additional $100 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/10/2021Page 60 of 68bonus for completing the study.  Aim 6 subjects will receive an additional $100 on PET day 
because of the longer scan day they will encounter as a result of the bolus to infusion scan.
Subjects with schizophrenia: Because smoking subjects with schizophrenia will be asked to 
participate in the smoking cessation part of the study as inpatient, a different payment schedule 
was devised (as in HIC [ZIP_CODE]). Subjects will be paid $[ADDRESS_106316] day of smoking cessation, $50 
for second, $[ADDRESS_106317], etc (increments of $25 for each successful day, for up to $525). Thus, 
smokers with schizophrenia may earn up to $1325 for smoking cessation, PET and MRI scans. 
Nonsmokers with schizophrenia may earn up to $800. 
Cancellations:  If a PET scan should get cancelled for a reason outside of the subject's control 
(i.e. radiotracer synthesis failure) the subject will be paid $[ADDRESS_106318]'s length of participation on that scan day prior to the cancellation, and will 
be up to the discretion of the PI.
       3.   Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs
             associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study
             that will be provided at no cost to subjects.   
There will be no costs to subjects related to participation in this research intervention.
  
4.   In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal 
      risk.
a.     Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
b.     Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
c.     Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
d.     Who will pay for this treatment? 
e.     How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
Medical treatment will be offered to the subjects for any physical injuries that they receive as a 
result of participating in this research.  However, the subject or his/her insurance company is 
responsible for the cost.  Federal regulations require that subjects be told that if they are 
physically injured, no additional financial compensation is available.

SECTION  II: RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.
Tobacco smoking is one of the only leading causes of death that is 100% preventable. While 
most smokers express a desire to quit smoking, only ~6% achieve abstinence in a given year and 
the majority relapse in the first 2 weeks. This highlights the acute withdrawal period as the 
critical window in maintaining abstinence. Nicotine is the primary addictive chemical in tobacco 
smoke and exerts its initial reinforcing effects through the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) 
system(1). Specifically, nicotine binds to beta2 subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (beta2*-nAChRs) located throughout the brain and this leads to widespread changes in 
neurotransmitter levels including dopamine (DA), and upregulation, i.e., increase in number, of 
beta2*-nAChRs. beta2*-nAChRs are also responsible for controlling the dynamic range of DA 
release, with chronic nicotine administration or deletion of the beta2*-nAChRs resulting in 
reduced DA release(2). This suggests that chronic smokers may have blunted DA release 
compared to nonsmokers and that changes in DA may be tied to other neurochemical alterations 
in the brains of smokers. However, the basic dopaminergic mechanisms involved in withdrawal 
and relapse in tobacco smokers remain unknown.
We have a radiotracer at the Yale PET center that will allow us to measure dopaminergic 
neurotransmission in the brains of smokers. The radiotracer is called [11C]PHNO and it has 
advantages over other dopamine D2 receptor ligands because it is an agonist and measures the 
high affinity, functionally active D2 receptors and not the low affinity D2 receptors. This has 
been recently shown to produce an increased sensitivity over other PET ligands to measure 
changes in synaptic dopamine levels and thus provides a novel paradigm to investigate drug-
induced dopamine release, such as amphetamine-induced dopamine release. We have 
preliminary data suggesting tobacco smokers at approximately [ADDRESS_106326] 
blunted DA release compared to nonsmokers. The overall goal of the study is to measure 
amphetamine-induced DA release during early and prolonged withdrawal in smokers (vs. 
nonsmokers) and to examine relationships to relapse and other clinical correlates of tobacco 
smoking.

to participate in one set of scans. We hypothesize that smokers at 1-[ADDRESS_106329] amphetamine-induced DA release that is blunted compared to healthy nonsmokers. We also 
hypothesize that the smokers who are scanned again at 2-8 weeks withdrawal will exhibit some 
‘normalization’ of the dopamine system and will have a larger amphetamine-induced DA release 
compared to their first scan. We hypothesize that smokers with amphetamine-induced DA 
release similar to nonsmokers, or that increases over time, will have better abstinence outcomes. 
                                                           
2.   Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project.   
      Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data. 
Tobacco Smoking: There are enormous costs to society and to individuals from tobacco 
smoking addiction and related disease, e.g., ~80% of smokers will die from a smoking related 
disease. Smokers are clearly aware of the negative consequences; but 20% of the adult American 
population continues to smoke. Most smokers want to quit smoking and make yearly quit 
attempts, but only 6% are successful in a given year and the vast majority cannot quit for more 
than 2 weeks, even with all of the currently available treatments . We do not know how to help 
smokers remain abstinent. The behavioral manifestations of withdrawal symptoms are clear – 
cognitive dysfunction, intense craving, irritability, anxiety, and bad mood – but because tobacco 
smoking is also a brain-based addiction, it is imperative that we uncover the molecular 
mechanisms that drive these symptoms during acute and prolonged withdrawal. Understanding 
the time course of the molecular changes that occur over withdrawal and determining 
relationships between neurochemistry, clinical symptoms, and their predictive relationship to 
relapse will achieve several goals: 1) provide to the public a greater understanding of the 
neurobiological basis of tobacco smoking withdrawal, e.g., it is not just a “bad habit”; 2) provide 
the public and clinicians neurochemical data on how long the brain needs to recover from the 
addiction; 3) inform the field about directions we should take in terms of targeting new drug 
development and in creating more easily obtained biomarkers or “proxies” of dysfunctional 
neurotransmission over the first few months of withdrawal, to personalize treatment selection 
consistent with a smoker’s individual neurochemistry.
How does the dopaminergic system regulate tobacco smoking and withdrawal?  A 
substantial literature demonstrates that nAChRs and the cholinergic system dynamically control 
the mesolimbic DA system by [CONTACT_14377], inhibiting and filtering striatal DA release(3, 4). 
Nicotine releases DA by [CONTACT_4639] β 2*-nAChRs located on the mesolimbic DA neurons in the 
ventral tegmental area, resulting in neuronal firing and DA release in the nucleus accumbens and 
dorsal caudate (5). β 2*-nAChRs are also critical for the reinforcing(6) and motivational effects of 
nicotine, e.g., tying cues to drug consumption(7). Nicotine also “filters” DA release by 
[CONTACT_96166]. As 
reviewed in Exley and Cragg (2008)(3), nicotine promotes DA release through both burst and 
tonic activity. Nicotine functions as an agonist and also as an antagonist via its 
desensitization/blocking actions and both may ultimately enhance DA neurotransmission. Thus, 
β2*-nAChRs are responsible for controlling the dynamic range of DA release. A recent 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page 6 of 38preclinical study reported that chronic nicotine administration or deletion of the β 2*-nAChRs 
(i.e., β 2* knockout) reduced acute DA release(2). This suggests that chronic smokers may have a 
blunted stimulus-induced DA release compared to nonsmokers; however, this has not been 
examined. Several PET studies have demonstrated blunted amphetamine-induced DA release in 
the ventral striatum in both cocaine and alcohol dependent populations at approximately 2 weeks 
of withdrawal vs. controls(8-10). In the cocaine-dependent subjects, those with a more blunted 
drug-induced DA release responded less well to a behavioral treatment that incorporated positive 
reinforcement(10). Their findings suggest that individuals with dysfunctional DA transmission 
are not able to “switch” well from drug-reinforced behavior to more natural alternative 
rewards(8, 10), and this is supported by a preclinical study in which rats with a lesioned nucleus 
accumbens displayed an inability to choose greater magnitude delayed rewards vs. immediate 
rewards of lesser value(11). We have preliminary data suggesting tobacco smokers at 
approximately [ADDRESS_106330] blunted DA release compared to nonsmokers. 
 
Imaging amphetamine-induced DA release in smokers vs. nonsmokers measured with 
[11C]PHNO and PET. Amphetamine administration results in a reliable and robust increase in 
extracellular DA and has been widely used in brain imaging studies as a marker of DA function 
in psychiatric and healthy populations(8, 9, 12-16). We have chosen oral amphetamine based on 
its robust and reliable DA signal and because it is routinely used in PET studies(17-23) and by 
[CONTACT_96167]. The amphetamine robustly increases synaptic levels 
of DA. The increased DA competes with the radiotracer to bind at the DA receptor, thus an 
increase in DA results in a decrease in radiotracer binding compared to baseline. This allows 
calculation of the “occupancy” of the receptors by [CONTACT_96168] a change in binding potential (BP), and 
is an indirect measure of DA release based on the “occupancy model”(13). We have obtained 
preliminary data that demonstrates blunted DA release in smokers at 2-3 weeks of abstinence vs. 
controls and is similar to what has previously been found in cocaine- and alcohol- dependent 
individuals(8, 9). While the previous studies(8, 9) used [11C]raclopride which measures striatal 
D2/3 receptor binding, we propose to use [11C]PHNO which measures striatal and extrastriatal 
(substantia nigra and globus pallidum) D2/3 binding(24). Importantly, blunted DA release in 
cocaine-dependent individuals was associated with the choice to self-administer cocaine over 
money(8) and with treatment failure(10). In the current study, we will determine whether 
smokers have blunted DA release compared to nonsmokers and if the degree of DA release in 
smokers is associated with time to relapse.

3.4 Assessments:
All participants will be screened initially using a telephone screen that will include questions to 
evaluate medical history, personal and familial psychiatric and smoking history.  
3.4a. General Intake Assessments 
1. Demographic  Questionnaire This questionnaire will obtain: (1) basic demographic 
information including age, gender, marital status, employment status, occupation, (2) 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page 9 of 38alcohol/drug history, (3) family history of alcohol/drug use, depression, anxiety, and smoking 
history.
2. Medical  History This questionnaire will obtain a basic medical history (personal and 
family) including past or current conditions such as neurological, endocrine, cardiovascular, 
renal, liver, and thyroid pathology. Current body weight and current medications will also be 
assessed. 
3. Medical  Assessments will include a physical exam by a state licensed physician 
(overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Matuskey), a complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
fasting blood sugar, electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests (including T 3, T4, 
T3RU, estimated free T4), thyroid stimulating hormone levels, urine toxicology, EKG, and 
urinalysis. Female subjects will have serum pregnancy tests. All EKGs are read by a state 
licensed cardiologist and all abnormal MRIs will be reviewed by a state licensed 
neuroradiologist.
4. Illicit  Drug/Pregnancy Screen A urine sample will be collected to determine current illicit 
drug use (for all potential subjects), positive results other than THC may be cause for exclusion 
from the study, however positive results will not be kept on file due to the sensitive nature of this 
information. In addition, urine samples will be collected for the intake visit and on each MR and 
PET scan day to confirm that the subject is not pregnant.  Note: the urine pregnancy test will not 
be required prior to the MRI if the serum pregnancy test was done within 1 week prior to the MR 
imaging session.
5. Structured  Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders  The psychotic screening and 
depression sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) 
will be used to determine whether subjects meet exclusion criteria for diagnosis of psychotic 
disorders and major depression (25).
3.4b.  Mood Measures 
We may of mood and anxiety at intake and also on the PET scan day including the following.
1. Center  for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES-D)  The CES-D (26) is a 20-
item self-report instrument, which has been extensively used in both clinical and nonclinical 
populations to measure the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms over the past week. 
The CES-D, which has been used to document the severity of depressive symptoms in adults 
(27) and has been shown to be a sensitive measure of negative affect in smokers (28), will be 
used in the proposed studies to exclude for presence of major depression, and to measure level of 
mild depressive symptoms commonly noted in tobacco smokers.
2. Anxiety:  The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (29) is a 40-item, self-report measure, 
comprised of two  subscales. The State-Anxiety scale is 20 items and assesses transitory states 
characterized by [CONTACT_96117], apprehension, and heightened autonomic reactivity. The 
Trait-Anxiety scale is 20 items and assesses stable individual differences in anxiety proneness.
3. Impulsivity : Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS; (30)) is a 30 item self-report instrument 
designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. 
 
3.4c. Smoking Measures
We will obtain smoking measures at intake and also on the PET scan day, which may include the 
following. 
1.Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).(31) This will be used to measure the 
severity of nicotine dependence.  It is a 6-item scale with an internal consistency of .61 and its 
total score is closely related to biochemical measures of intensity of smoking.  
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page [ADDRESS_106338].(32) This measures the severity of eight withdrawal symptoms 
on 5-point Likert scales.  
4. Tiffany Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU).(33) The QSU-brief is a 10-item 
questionnaire that evaluates the structure and function of smoking urges.  Subjects indicate on a 
likert-type scale how strongly they agree or disagree with each statement with a score of 1 
(strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree).  This characterizes ‘urges to smoke’ into a negative 
affect related to relief of withdrawal symptoms and positive affect related to expectancy of 
reinforcement.   
3.4d Cognitive Measures
We will obtain these measures at baseline and up to two times on the PET days.
1. Cogstate Battery: This computerized test battery will assess memory and cognition.  The 
tasks may include:
a. International Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96063] – a computerized task to assess verbal learning and memory.
b.  Groton Maze Learning Task – a computerized task to assess executive function and spatial 
problem solving.
c.  Detection Task – a computerized task to assess psychomotor function and speed of 
processing.
d.  Identification Task – a computerized task to assess visual attention and vigilance.
e.  One Card Learning Task – a computerized task to assess visual learning and memory.
f.  One Back Task – a computerized task to assess attention and working memory
2. Probabilistic Reward Task: The PRT has been successfully used to assess reward 
responsiveness (166-168). In each trial, subjects choose which of two difficult-to-differentiate 
stimuli was presented. Stimuli consist of simple cartoon faces (diameter: 25 mm; eyes: 7 mm) 
presented in the center of the monitor. At the beginning of the trial, the face has no mouth. After 
a given delay, either a straight mouth of 11.5 mm (“short mouth”) or 13 mm (“long mouth”) is 
presented for [ADDRESS_106339] identification of one 
stimulus (“rich stimulus”) is rewarded three times more frequently (“Correct! You won 20 
cents”) than the other (“lean”) stimulus. In healthy controls, this reinforcement schedule leads to 
a response bias (i.e., a preference for the more frequently rewarded stimulus). The degree of 
response bias toward the more frequently reinforced alternative will be used for operationalizing 
sensitivity to reward.
3. Cold Pressor Task: Subjects may be asked to participate in the Cold Pressor Task.  The cold 
pressor task (CPT) is a stress task used to measure pain sensitivity and pain tolerance.  This task 
will be used to determine alterations in pain thresholds as a result of nicotine use.  Participants 
will immerse their hand (up to the wrist) for up to 3 minutes in the experimental (ice-cold 
temperature 0-4°C)) and control (room temperature (20°C)) conditions.  Physiological measure 
(heart rate, blood pressure and subject responses (stress, mood) will be collected 5 minutes 
before, 1 minute into, and immediately after the CPT.

Amphetamine challenge
Dextroamphetamine sulfate is the dextro isomer of the compound d,l-amphetamine sulfate, a
sympathomimetic amine of the amphetamine group. It is an FDA approved drug available for the
treatment of narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (maximum approved total
daily dose of 5-60 mg). After the first [11C]PHNO scan, dextro-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, PO) 
will be given in increments of 5 or 10 mg, as it is available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, and will 
be rounded down to approximate 0.5 mg/kg total dose without exceeding it. Total dextro-
amphetamine dose will not exceed [ADDRESS_106342] amphetamine identical to the methods outlined 
previously. The timing of the second [11C]PHNO administration and subsequent PET scanning 
(i.e., 2.5-3 hours) corresponds to the time of maximum plasma concentration of amphetamine as 
stated in the respective FDA-approved product labeling. EKG and frequent BP monitoring will 
occur throughout the study and until the vital signs are within normal limits. Supplemental 
oxygen will be provided via nasal cannula if necessary.  If the systolic BP reaches or exceeds 
200 mmHg for more than 5 minutes, the study doctor will take the appropriate clinical measures 
in order to lower the BP, which may include phentolamine administration (5 mg IV over 10 min) 
or other appropriate measures.
Following the post-amphetamine PET scan, subjects will be assessed (EKG and vital signs) by 
[CONTACT_96119].  Subjects will be discharged when vital signs are within normal limits 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page 12 of 38and when behavioral changes (if any) are found to be not clinically significant by [CONTACT_96120]. If subjects experience any adverse events, they will be 
treated until they become asymptomatic, prior to discharge.
Behavioral response to amphetamine will be measured by [CONTACT_6270]-ratings with a simplified version 
of the Amphetamine Interview Rating Scale (van Kammen and Murphy, 1975).  Four items will 
be investigated: euphoria ("feel good"), alertness ("feel energetic"), restlessness ("feel like 
moving") and anxiety ("feel anxious").  Self-ratings will be obtained by [CONTACT_96121] d-amphetamine administration: -5 minutes, 0, and hourly 
thereafter until end of the second scan. 
PET
PET scans may be performed on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT, 2-3 mm 
resolution) or another similar camera.  Venous catheters will be used for i.v. administration of 
the radiotracers, venous blood sampling of activity, and for venous blood sampling of 
amphetamine plasma levels and hormone levels. At the beginning of scan, the subject’s head will 
be immobilized and a transmission scan will be obtained for attenuation correction. PET scans 
will be acquired using bolus or bolus to infusion administration of up to 10 mCi of [11C]PHNO 
and subjects will be scanned for up to [ADDRESS_106343] motion is corrected automatically on an event-by-event basis with 
the Vicra motion tracking system.  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) are 
collected prior to and during each PET scan. Urine pregnancy test will be again administered on 
the PET scan day prior to the initiation of any imaging procedures. Smoking abstinence, when 
appropriate, will also be confirmed for smoking subjects prior to PET scanning. 
PET scanning will then proceed as following for each aim: 
Aim 1. Smoking subjects will be asked to come in for two [11C]PHNO scans with amphetamine 
administration. The first scan will be during the first 2 weeks of withdrawal with the option to 
come back again at 2-8 weeks of withdrawal. Nonsmoking subjects will be asked to come in for 
one set of two [11C]PHNO scans with amphetamine administration. Up to [ADDRESS_106344] scan, subjects will take amphetamine (0.5mg/kg) by 
[CONTACT_1966], and then will be imaged again with PHNO.  If technical difficulties arise, the second PET 
scan of the set may have to be re-scheduled and will be scheduled as soon as possible.  In that 
case, subjects may be asked to re-take amphetamine on the day of the rescheduled PHNO scan, 
approximately [ADDRESS_106345] injection, subjects may repeat each scan set up to a 
total of 8 PHNO scans for smokers and 4 PHNO scans for nonsmokers.  
3.6 Image analysis.
The primary outcome measure is the binding potential (BP ND), which in turn is proportional to 
the available receptor concentration (B avail), given that there is no change in affinity (K D) and that 
nondisplaceable (nonspecific and free) uptake does not differ between subjects and studies.  We 
will examine the regions-of-interest listed below with the cerebellum used as a reference region 
because it is devoid of D 2/3 receptors.
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page 13 of 38We obtain an MRI (as previously described) to use as a guide to place our regions of interest.  
This is because we can define anatomical regions of interest on the MRI, which provides 
structural information and then we can apply these regions of interest to the PET scans.  The PET 
scans alone are not sufficient to identify brain regions. The PET image sets are aligned and 
resliced to yield images in the same planes and spatial system as the MRI images using AAL 
template. Primary ROIs will be caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, globus pallidus, and 
substantia nigra. Cerebellum will be the reference region. 
3.[ADDRESS_106346] statistics. Transformations or nonparametric 
analyses will be performed as necessary. All tests will be two-sided and considered statistically 
significant at alpha = 0.05. Post-hoc comparisons will be conducted as necessary with 
significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons basing the adjustment on the number of 
conceptually related statistical tests within each hypothesis. All statistical analyses will be 
conducted using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Aim 1. To determine if amphetamine-induced DA release is blunted during abstinence in 
tobacco smokers compared to nonsmokers. Hypothesis 1. We hypothesize that amphetamine-
induced striatal DA release will be blunted in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Power 
Calculations for Hypothesis 1: Our preliminary data revealed blunted amphetamine-induced DA 
release (d=0.91) in the ventral striatum among smokers (-21%±12.0) compared to nonsmokers (-
29%±6.3). Assuming a two-sided t-test with α=0.05,  40 nonsmokers and 50 smokers assessed 
after 14-21 days of abstinence will provide 80% statistical power to detect effect sizes as small as 
d=0.63, which compares favorably with the effects observed above. 
Regional [11C]PHNO uptake for each subject will be quantified as BP ND described above for 
each ROI and will represent the primary outcome measure for the proposed experiments.  
Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to evaluate the change between scans (deltaBP) for 
brain measures for the scans.  Delta BP will be computed as [(BP baseline -BP condition )/BP baseline  X 
100]. Analysis will be conducted using SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC). N=[ADDRESS_106347] differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Potential associations, e.g., 
relationship between magnitude of dopamine release and time to relapse, will be examined using 
correlation analysis with Type I error corrected for multiple comparisons. Exploratory analyses 
of the other cognitive and behavioral measures and their relationship to relapse will also be 
performed. 
3.8 Contingency Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation (for healthy smokers)

research staff who will provide them with brief advice on quitting smoking based on AHCPR 
guidelines (The Smoking Cessation and Clinical Practice Guideline Panel and Staff, 1996). They 
will be advised about the risks and benefits of quitting smoking and told that they will be monitored 
daily to ensure abstinence.  Subjects will be informed of payment schedules (see below) for CO 
levels indicating abstinence and also given information on how quit rates in the first week of 
smoking cessation predicted sustained abstinence.  We use CO levels < [ADDRESS_106349] week of abstinence we will obtain CO levels during contingency 
management meetings from subjects up to twice daily. In addition, we will obtain urine samples 
once daily to measure cotinine levels (a nicotine metabolite). These meeting will occur either in the 
research office, the Yale PET center, or in a midway point if subjects travel a far distance. 
For each contingency management appointment, subjects will get $10 if their CO levels are less 
than 11ppm and urine cotinine levels are less than 100 ng/ml.

1. Risks Associated with Radiation 
The Yale New Haven  Radiation Safety Committee and the FDA will review the use of radiation 
in this research study as the radiotracer [11C]PHNO PET will be under IND # 134138, This 
research study involves exposure to radiation from [11C]PHNO PET scanning. This radiation 
exposure is not necessary for medical care and is for research purposes only. 
For each individual [11C]PHNO PET scan, subjects will receive up to ≤ 10 mCi of [11C]PHNO, 
plus transmission scans. This is equal to an effective dose equivalent of 0.[ADDRESS_106350] will receive in this study is 
from up to 8 injections of ≤  10mCi each of [11C]PHNO, plus transmission scans. The intended 
amount is from up to 4 injections of ≤ 10mCi each of [11C]PHNO for smokers and up to 2 
injections of  ≤ 10mCi each of [11C]PHNO in nonsmokers, however in case of scan failures post 
injection we have included up to 8 injections if scan sets need to be repeated within the study 
time frame (i.e. 1-2 wks withdrawal and 2-8 wks withdrawal). Nonsmokers maximum number of 
injections including re-scans would be [ADDRESS_106351] to repeat the whole set due to timing related data. 
Although each organ will receive a different dose, the maximum intended amount of radiation 
exposure
 subjects will receive per year from this study is equal to an effective dose equivalent of 
0.858400001 rem for a total of up to 40 mCi of [11C] PHNO in 4 injections of ≤ 10mCi each for 
smokers and 0.4292 rem for a total of up to 20 mCi  [11C] PHNO in 2 injections of ≤ 10mCi each 
for non smoker. This calculated value is used to relate the dose received by [CONTACT_96129] a 
single value.
However, if scans should need to be repeated the maximum dose for smokers would be equal to 
an effective dose of 1.[ADDRESS_106352] every intention to limiting radiation exposure 
to subjects and avoiding re-scans if possible.

contraindications for MR.
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to 
take pi[INVESTIGATOR_57180].  The [LOCATION_002] Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, 
and we carefully observe those guidelines. 
 
Subjects will be watched closely throughout the MR study.  Some people may feel 
uncomfortable or anxious.  If this happens, the subject may ask to stop the study at any time and 
we will take them out of the MR scanner.  On rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy, get 
an upset stomach, have a metallic taste or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches.  These 
sensations usually go away quickly but we will ask subjects to tell the research staff if they have 
them.  
There are some risks with an MR study for certain people.  If subjects have a pacemaker or some 
metal
 objects inside their body, they may not be in this study because the strong magnets in the 
MR scanner might harm them.  Another risk is the possibility of metal objects being pulled into 
the magnet and hitting a subject.  To reduce this risk we require that all people involved with the 
study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets.  We also ask 
all people involved with the study to walk through a detector designed to detect metal objects.  It 
is important to know that no metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time.  Also, once 
subjects are in the magnet, the door to the room will be closed so that no one from outside 
accidentally goes near the magnet.
We want subjects to read and answer very carefully the questions on the MR Safety 
Questionnaire related to their personal safety. We will be sure that subjects have read the MR 
Safety Questionnaire and tell us any information they think might be important.  
This MR study is for research purposes only and is not in any way a clinical examination.  The 
scans performed in this study are not designed to find abnormalities.  The primary investigator, 
the lab, the MR technologist, and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center are not qualified to 
interpret the MR scans and are not responsible for providing a diagnostic evaluation of the 
images.  If a worrisome finding is seen on a subject’s scan, a radiologist or another physician 
will be asked to review the relevant images.  Based on his or her recommendation (if any), the 
primary investigator or consulting physician will contact [CONTACT_423], inform them of the finding, 
and recommend that they seek medical advice as a precautionary measure.  The decision for 
additional examination or treatment would lie solely with the subject and their physician.  The 
investigators, the consulting physician, the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale 
University are not responsible for any examination or treatment that a subject receives based on

reason, they will not be made available for diagnostic purposes.
3. Blood Drawing and IV line Insertion
Drawing blood and inserting an intravenous line (IV) into an arm vein are safe and standard 
medical procedures. Sometimes a bruise will occur at the puncture site and rarely a blood clot or 
infection will occur in the vein. Certain individuals may feel light-headed during venipuncture. 
The volume of blood collected during this study, may include screening laboratories, MRI and 
PET scans, will be approximately [ADDRESS_106354] any serious 
negative effects on a study participant. 
4.  Nicotine Withdrawal
Smokers that quit smoking may experience symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as craving 
cigarettes,
 mild anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy, and 
excessive hunger. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_96097]. 
5.  Risks of oral d-amphetamine 
Risks of amphetamine administration include both medical and psychiatric risks.
The frequent somatic  side effects of d-amphetamine administration are cardiovascular 
(hypertension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia, bradycardia, orthostasis). General effects such as 
sweating, feeling warm or cold, nausea, diarrhea, muscle and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], have been 
reported frequently. Behavioral effects in this dose range are increased level of alertness, 
talkativeness, restlessness, agitation, mood changes (usually euphoria) and anxiety. In our 
experience, these effects are generally transient and well tolerated. This dose of amphetamine 
has not been reported to induce psychotic symptoms in non-schizophrenic subjects. Infrequently 
blurred vision, headaches and chest tightness, and changes in EKG have been reported. There is 
a rare risk of permanent neurological damage and death as a result of cardiac arrest or stroke.
Psychiatric or behavioral side effects:  General behavioral effects of amphetamine in this dose 
range are increased level of alertness, talkativeness, restlessness, agitation, mood changes 
(usually euphoria) and anxiety.  In our experience, these effects are generally transient and well 
tolerated.  This dose of amphetamine has not been reported to induce psychotic symptoms in non 
schizophrenic subjects and we confirm this observation. 
10. Minimizing  Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be  
    minimized. 
1.  The dose of radiation will be submitted for approval to the Yale New Haven Hopsital 
Radiation Safety Committee. All scans will be done in the presence of medical supervision and 
trained staff in an institution specifically designed to support imaging studies. In the event of 
serious medical complications, the PET scan facilities have immediate access to or consultation 
with specialized medical units at the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Preparation of 
radiopharmaceuticals and performance of PET scans will be by [CONTACT_57223], physicians, and 
technologists of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine.

exposure (including the present study) exceeds FDA limits.   The information on the previous 
radiation exposure of study subjects will be notified to the study doctor. 
No PET studies will be performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women, as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_96132]. If subjects are breastfeeding they will not be able to participate in this research 
study. 
2. Minimizing risks with MRI: All subjects will be screened for any metallic objects other MR 
contraindications that they may be holding or have implanted in their bodies using a 
questionnaire and all potential subjects with contraindications for MR will be excluded. This 
questionnaire will be repeated immediately before each measurement to insure that no metallic 
materials are brought into close proximity of the magnet, where they might be pulled toward the 
magnet.  For additional security, subjects will be taken through a ferromagnetic metal detector 
immediately before going to the scan room.
3. Minimizing risks with blood draws: The risks of bruising, clotting, and infection will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_96170]. To avoid injury due to fainting, the venous catheters will be inserted when the 
subjects are recumbent.  The blood draws during PET scanning sessions will be obtained from the 
already inserted catheter, to minimize discomfort.
4. Minimizing risks with nicotine withdrawal: Subjects will meet with research staff and be 
counseled prior to the quit attempt to provide them with skills to help ease the withdrawal 
symptoms. 
5. Minimizing risks with oral d-amphetamine administration: Medical side effects: Subjects 
will be carefully screened for absence of significant medical history and current medical 
conditions with a complete medical history, physical examination, routine blood tests, urine 
toxicology and EKG. Inclusion in the study will be limited to individuals who are between the 
ages of 18-55. Patients will be excluded if they have any h/o severe medical or neurological 
illness, any clinically significant brain abnormality, insulin dependent diabetes, a history of 
cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. Administration of oral d-amphetamine will take place at 
the PET center by a research nurse, with a physician on site.  The research nurse will report vital 
signs to the physician prior to administering the amphetamine.
 If several of the subject’s blood pressure readings are recorded at >100 or <60 for diastolic BP 
or >160 or <[ADDRESS_106356], they will be evaluated by [CONTACT_96137].  The study may 
be cancelled at the discretion of the MD after evaluation.  Any automated blood pressure results 
that are abnormal will be repeated manually. The manual reading will be the official reading. 
Constant EKG and frequent BP monitoring will occur until the vital signs are within normal 
limits. If the systolic BP reaches or exceeds 200 mmHg for more than 5 minutes, an infusion of 
phentolamine (5 mg IV, over 10 min) or other appropriate measures may be initiated to control 
the blood pressure response.  The study physician will be notified if those parameters are reached 
and he/she will supervise the treatment.  
In case of chest pain, chest tightness or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia, the 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/19/2020Page 20 of 38experiment may be cancelled and an EKG will be obtained to rule out angina (ST segment 
elevation or depression as compared to the baseline EKG). Appropriate treatment will be 
initiated.
Upon discharge, patients will be given the phone numbers of the study physicians and will not be 
allowed to drive home.  They will either arrange a ride or a taxi.

Data Safety Monitoring Plan:
1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol 
compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be 
conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when re-approval of the protocol is 
sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether 
the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. 
Either the principal investigator, the IRB or Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the 
authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following 
reasons: 
1. We  do not view the risks associated with the radiotracer [11C]PHNO as minimal.
2. We  do not view the risks associated with the combined use of ________and_________ as 
minimal.
3. Given  the now established safety and validity of the current _________ in our prior work, 
we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4. Given  our experience with the combined co-administration_________, we do not view 
the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-
hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring 
the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_96080], Ph.D. according to the 
following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse  event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).

4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate  adverse event
3. Severe  
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96081] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it:
1. is  life-threatening OR
2. results  in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57186]
3. results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity OR
4. results  in a congenital anomaly or birth defect OR
5. results  in death OR
6. based  upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
this definition, OR
7. adversely  affects the risk/benefit ratio of the study
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the HIIRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting serious AND unanticipated AND related adverse events, anticipated 
adverse events occurring at a greater frequency than expected, and other unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others to the IRB
The investigator will report the following types of adverse events to the IRB: a) serious AND 
unanticipated AND possibly, probably or definitely related events; b) anticipated adverse events 
occurring with a greater frequency than expected; and c) other unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others.
These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be 
reported to the IRB within 48 hours of it becoming known to the investigator, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website.
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study 
sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.

□ National  Institutes of Health
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_96080], Ph.D. will conduct a review of all adverse events 
upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_96082].
11. Statistical  Considerations: Describe the targeted number of subjects and the statistical 
     analyses that support the study design. 
Demographics between smokers and nonsmokers will be compared using t  tests or Chi-Square 
tests, as appropriate. Scores on psychological tests such as depressive symptoms at baseline will 
be compared between groups and may be used as covariates in subsequent analyses. All 
outcomes will be summarized descriptively and assessed for normality prior to analysis using 
normal probability plots and Kolmogorov test statistics. Transformations or nonparametric 
analyses will be performed as necessary. All tests will be two-sided and considered statistically 
significant at alpha = 0.05. Post-hoc comparisons will be conducted as necessary with 
significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons basing the adjustment on the number of 
conceptually related statistical tests within each hypothesis. All statistical analyses will be 
conducted using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Aim 1. To determine if amphetamine-induced DA release is blunted during abstinence in 
tobacco smokers compared to nonsmokers. Hypothesis 1. We hypothesize that amphetamine-
induced striatal DA release will be blunted in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Power 
Calculations for Hypothesis 1: Our preliminary data revealed blunted amphetamine-induced DA 
release (d=0.91) in the ventral striatum among smokers (-21%±12.0) compared to nonsmokers (-
29%±6.3). Assuming a two-sided t-test with α=0.05,  40 nonsmokers and 50 smokers assessed 
after 14-21 days of abstinence will provide 80% statistical power to detect effect sizes as small as 
d=0.63, which compares favorably with the effects observed above. 
Regional [11C]PHNO uptake for each subject will be quantified as BP ND described above for 
each ROI and will represent the primary outcome measure for the proposed experiments.  
Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to evaluate the change between scans (deltaBP) for 
brain measures for the scans.  Delta BP will be computed as [(BP baseline -BP condition )/BP baseline  X 
100]. Analysis will be conducted using SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC). N=[ADDRESS_106357] differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Potential associations, e.g., 
relationship between magnitude of dopamine release and time to relapse, will be examined using 
correlation analysis with Type I error corrected for multiple comparisons. Exploratory analyses 
of the other cognitive and behavioral measures and their relationship to relapse will also be 
performed.

The use of [11C]PHNO in PET imaging in human was first reported in 2006 (37). No relevant 
abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG were reported at any time in the study. There 
also were no relevant findings in physical or neurological exams or in routine blood and urine 
analyses during the study. However nausea was reported approximately 2–3 min after tracer 
injection, which subsided rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] 2–[ADDRESS_106358] was attributed to the transient high 
[11C]PHNO concentration resulting from the bolus injection may have been responsible for the 
reported transient self-limiting nausea (37).
[11C]PHNO  has been used extensively used in many clinical trials. A survey of the 
ClinicalTrials.gov website shows 12 completed trials, 5 recruiting trials, and 1 active clinical 
trial with [11C]PHNO investigating a variety of behaviors and disorders: alcohol drinking, 
addictive behavior, behavioral symptoms, cocaine-related disorders, compulsive behavior, 
depression, depressive disorder, drinking behavior, impulsive behavior, mental disorders, mood 
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia studies, 
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, psychological stress, substance-related 
disorders, and tobacco use disorder. 
[11C]PHNO  has been used in humans at the Yale University PET center in several studies 
including HIC [PHONE_2231]. To date, more than 250 human [11C]PHNO scans have been 
conducted at Yale PET Center. All injected doses were limited to ≤ 0.03 µg/kg. These studies 
included smokers, cocaine users, pathological gamblers, schizophrenia subjects, and healthy 
controls. Adverse events were observed in studies which involved administration of 
amphetamine in addition to [11C]PHNO. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_57190] a morning [11C]PHNO 
administration, followed by [CONTACT_57235], followed by a second PHNO injection, starting [ADDRESS_106359]-amphetamine. Because nausea is attributed to the transient high [11C]PHNO 
concentration 2–3 min after the bolus injection of the tracer (37), the Yale PET Center 
administers [11C]PHNO as a bolus over a period of 5 minutes, i.e., at a PHNO dose rate of 7 
ng/min for the average [ADDRESS_106360]. Administration of [11C]PHNO dose at this rate is about [ADDRESS_106361] rate reported in the clinical study involving i.v. administration of 
PHNO (38).
Proposed single study dose limit
[11C]PHNO  will be administered intravenously.
The proposed radioactivity dose of 10 mCi per single administration is below the 21 CFR 361.1 
estimated dose limit of 75.5 mCi for a 70 kg Hermaphrodite Male (77.7 mCi for female). The 
estimated dose limit calculations are based upon the liver as the critical organ; 5 rem per single 
study limit: 0.0662 rem per mCi to the combined male and female livers. 
The maximum allowable dose for a single injection is 3000 mR to the whole body, active blood-
forming organs, lens of the eye and gonads. The dose to any other organ cannot exceed 5000 
mR.
The maximum allowable dose for one year is 5000 mR to the whole body, active blood-forming 
organs, lens of the eye and gonads. The dose to any other organ cannot exceed [ZIP_CODE] mR.
For comparison, the average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem 
(or 300 mrem) per year from natural background sources, such as from the sun, outer space, and 
from radioactive materials that are found naturally in the earth’s air and soil. The dose that a 
subject will receive from participation in this research study would be less than that obtained in 
one year from natural sources.

d-Amphetamine:
Amphetamine is administered to measure changes in [11C]PHNO binding due to dopamine release. 
This dose was chosen because it is expected to produce a quantifiable displacement of the 
radiotracer. The risks are outlined in Section VI.  Oral and IV d-amphetamine administration to 
healthy humans and individuals with psychiatric disorders has been safely used in many PET 
imaging studies. We will use the oral route due to the greater safety and ease of administration.

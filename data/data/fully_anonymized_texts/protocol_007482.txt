 [ADDRESS_1207095] Details 
 
1.1 Title 
Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (RELY  trial) 
 
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with dabigatran versus warfarin use.  
 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication 
The primary outcome of the study was stroke and systemic embolism.   
 
1.3.1 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
Assuming a 2-year recruitment period and at least 1 year of follow-up and a primary event rate of 1.6% per year, it was 
determined that at least 15,[ADDRESS_1207096] 
approximately 84% power to conclude noninferiority of dabigatran over warfarin at alpha of 0.025 (1-sided) level.  
 1.4 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding 
Major bleeding; RR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.81-1.07) 
 
1.5 Trial estimate 
 RR = 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.82) comparing 150mg dabigatran vs warfarin (Connolly et al., 2009)  
2. Person responsible for implementation of replication in Aetion 
Hemin Lee, MD, MPH and Ajinkya Pawar, PhD implemented the study design in the Aetion Evidence Platform. They are not 
responsible for the validity of the design and analytic choices. All implementation steps are recorded and the implementation history is 
archived in the platform.

3 5. Cohort Identification
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing 
dabigatran (150mg) to warfarin users. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 
days before initiation of dabigatran or warfarin (index date). We will restrict the analyses to patients with a diagnosis of AF with 
risk factors for stroke or systemic embolism in the 12 months prior to drug initiation. 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
 New users (defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified. 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates 
Market availability of dabigatran in the U.S. for non-valvular atrial fibrillation started on October 19, 2010 
•For Medicare: October 19, 2010 – December 31, 2017 (end of available data)
•For Marketscan: October 19, 2010 – December 31, 2018 (end of available data)
•For Optum: October 19, 2010 – December 31, 2019 (end of available data)
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. Variables   
6.1 Exposure-related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of dabigatran. Initiation will be defined by [CONTACT_865361] a comparator in the prior 6 months before treatment initiation (washout period). 
 
Comparator agents- 
• Initiators of dabigatran (150mg) will be compared to initiators of- 
o Warfarin 
 
6.2 Covariates: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to and including index date 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 6  
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between 
treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
  
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
 6.3.[ADDRESS_1207097]: (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
 
• Primary Outcome: Stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic) and systemic embolism  
• Secondary outcomes: Individual components 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8369] (principal diagnosis position) 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8370] (principal diagnosis position) 
 Control outcomes of interest (control outcomes only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further interpreted) :  
1. Major bleeding 
 
 
6.3.2 Study follow-up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
 
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of api[INVESTIGATOR_61325]: 
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database, 
• End of the study period, 
• Measured death event occurs, 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
7 •Nursing home admission
oNursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typi[INVESTIGATOR_61326] a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for
cohorts for the same reason.
•The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_8372] (dabigatran and
comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., [ADDRESS_1207098] prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses).
•The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any other
NOAC (e.g. switching from dabigatran or warfarin to api[INVESTIGATOR_8373] a censoring event);
oA dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion
oAn added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion
•Dispensing of a fibrinolytic agent
For the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation will
be replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 365 days.

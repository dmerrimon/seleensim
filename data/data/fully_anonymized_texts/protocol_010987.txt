will be safe and demonstrate clinical activity in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
OBJECTIVES
Primary Objectives
1. For Phase 1b: To assess the safety and tolerability, describe any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined doses (in the absence of 
exceeding the MTD) for MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
2. For Phase 2: To determine objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months 
(PFS-6) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.[ADDRESS_776375] a positive interferon-gamma (IFN- γ) gene expression signature [CONTACT_589518]- and

STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical 
activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who meet the followingcriteria:  
Second-line (Phase 1b):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
Second-line (Phase 2 Arms A, B, and C):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within [ADDRESS_776378]-line (Phase 2 Arm D):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens (one standard 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or 
recurrent disease)
• Subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum or 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting. 
Second- and Third-line (Phase 2 Arm E; as of Amendment 6):
•  
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months of therapy, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens (one standard 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease), and
• Third-line subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months 
will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting.
Up to approximately 135 subjects for Phase 1b/2 will be enrolled at approximately 40 study centers globally.
Phase 1b
The dose and schedule of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for Phase 1b of the current study is
based on emerging safety, clinical, and PK/pharmacodynamic data from the ongoing Study D4190C00006, which is evaluating the combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is anticipated that a dose determined as safe in NSCLC will also be safe in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

. Subjects will be monitored for 
DLT prior to initiation of enrollment in Phase 2. If unacceptable toxicity is encountered or ≥3 out of 9 of 
subjects experience a DLT during this safety run-in, a lower dose level may be evaluated prior to initiation of Phase 2. 
A total of 6 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b and treated with the dose and schedule described above; there 
were no DLTs in these [ADDRESS_776379] protocol-defined dose (in the absence of exceeding the MTD) has been defined in 
Phase 1b, enrollment in Phase 2 will begin. In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 treatment arms, as listed below. Second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be 
randomized in a 2:2:[ADDRESS_776380]-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature [CONTACT_589521] E.
• Arm A: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-line subjects with metastatic or 
recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
• Arm B: MEDI4736 monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma 
• Arm C: Tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma
• Arm D: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
• Arm E (as of Amendment 6): MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second- and third-line 
subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression 
signature 
[CONTACT_589522] 2, subjects will be monitored continuously for safety according to the same criteria employed 
during Phase 1b. If during the treatment period, ≥33% of subjects experience safety events meeting DLT 
criteria, even if outside of the DLT evaluation period, enrollment may be paused and study data will be 
reviewed to determine whether additional monitoring or alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be 
evaluated prior to further enrollment. In addition, after the first [ADDRESS_776381] been dosed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for a minimum of 6 weeks (in both second- and third-line settings), safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_456].
All subjects will be evaluated for clinical activity, on a regular basis as specified in the protocol, and their 
disease status primarily analyzed according to RECIST v1.1. Clinical decision making in subjects undergoing 
treatment will be based on RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_776382] that continued treatment may not be beneficial to a given arm.
 
Pre-specified interim analyses performed on Arms A and B showed that the 
criteria for expansion were met; however, enrollment into Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s 
discretion. Based on evolving science suggesting that the IFN- γ gene expression signature [CONTACT_589523] (Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013; Peng et al, 2015) as well as data from the initial portion of the study, it was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in bothsecond- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive IFN-γ gene expression signature. The discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to safety concerns.
Arm D has completed.
Dose-Expansion in a Biomarker Selected Population
As of Amendment 6, a new arm (Arm E) of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab has been added to 
evaluate efficacy and safety in subjects with second- and third-line gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with a positive tumor IFN- γ gene expression signature. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the predictive 
nature of a Type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) gene signature [CONTACT_589524] D4190C00021

All 
subjects will be followed for survival until the end of study ([ADDRESS_776383]). Evaluation of a possible correlation between 
clinical activity of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in combination and IFN- γ gene expression as well as other 
potential biomarkers (eg, tumoral and stromal PD-L1 expression) will be ongoing throughout the study.

Subjects will be treated in either Phase 1b or Phase 2 of the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who are treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy (Arm B) or tremelimumab monotherapy (Arm C) may 
crossover to be treated with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab upon  confirmed progressive disease (PD) under restricted circumstances (as outlined in the protocol). Subjects who are treated with the combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab may continue their study treatment or have reinduction of the study treatment upon a confirmed PD under restricted circumstances (as outlined in the protocol). Subjects in 
both Phase 1b and Phase [ADDRESS_776385] was given upon initial study entry. Dose delays and discontinuations to manage clinically significant treatment-related toxicity will be allowed.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size and Power Calculations
Up to approximately 135 subjects for Phase 1b/2 will be enrolled in this study.
Phase 1b
The sample size for Phase 1b is not based on formal statistical power considerations. The number of subjects 
in this phase of the study is based on a safety run-in schema investigating the safety and tolerability of a dose and schedule selected for dose expansion in Study D4190C00006. 
Phase 2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776386]. Response-related endpoints and corresponding time-to-event endpoints for primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints programmatically-derived from the investigator’s assessments or BICR, as 
well as OS will be analyzed. More details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.
OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST v1.1. DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of OR to the first documented disease progression 
according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_776387]. For subjects who are alive and progression-free at the time of data cut-off (DCO) for analysis, PFS will be censored at the last 
tumor assessment date. The PFS-[ADDRESS_776388] v1.1. The ORR is defined 
as the proportion of subjects with OR. The 2-sided 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ORR will be 
estimated using the exact binomial distribution. Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated for PFS and used to

9 of 180 Template 16.2estimate the PFS-6 along with its 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include DC, DoR, PFS, , OS, and 1-year survival for Phase 2, and OR, DC
and PFS-6 for Phase 1b. The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with DC. The 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs of DCR will be provided using an exact probability method. DCR at 16 and at 24 weeks will be estimated along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median 
DoR/PFS/OS and landmark PFS/OS rate along with their CIs.
Only subjects whose archival tumor tissue sample showed a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature [CONTACT_589525] E. This will allow identification of a unique population of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects who may benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and will allow correlations between IFN- γ gene expression and clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab to be explored.
During the course of the study, subjects’ tumor samples (archival and/or from fresh biopsies) will be analyzed 
for PD-L1 expression (ie, tumoral vs stromal) that may predict increased frequency of response or longer disease stabilization. The analyses will be performed to see whether there is association between PD-L1 expression levels at baseline and clinical activity. If such association exists, secondary analyses for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted in “biomarker positive” and “biomarker negative” 
subpopulations determined by [CONTACT_18681]-off point of PD-L1 expression. The impact of baseline prognostic 
factors will be explored as appropriate when treatment arms in the subpopulations are compared.
Safety
The safety analysis will be based on the As-treated Population, and will include AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations from both Phase 1b and Phase 2. In Phase 1b, the number of DLTs that are identified in the DLT Evaluable Population (defined as subjects 
enrolled in Phase 1b who receive the protocol-assigned treatment and complete safety follow-up through the 
DLT evaluation period or experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period) will be summarized or listed. For both Phase 1b and Phase 2, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_589498] (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 grade, system organ class, and preferred term, with a breakdown by [CONTACT_2939]/dose cohort. Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs 
considered related to investigational product will be summarized. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, if applicable. Frequencies of worst observed grade will be presented for each laboratory parameter as well as the rates of subjects with Grade 3-[ADDRESS_776389]-baseline grade, will be provided for clinical laboratory tests.

MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776401] decade ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 ). Failure of immune 
surveillance of pre-neoplastic lesions and micro-metastases is a key step in cancer 
development. Chronically immunosuppressed individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals 
are likely to be minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune 
surveillance. Recent data suggests that this may be an oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of immunosuppressive cytokines ( Shields et al, 2010 ). As such, the local 
tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic environment where most tumors grow and 
metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity.
The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be 
manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor. Immune response 
may be augmented by [CONTACT_27635], indirectly stimulating effectors by 
[CONTACT_27636], or by [CONTACT_27637], cells, or messages ( Monti et al, 2005 ).
1.1.2 Immune-checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types 
of cancers ( Gooden et al, 2011 ). Most tumors show infiltration by [CONTACT_27638], but tumors modulate 
the local microenvironment through expression of inhibitory molecules. Engagement of TIL 
cell-surface receptors with these inhibitory ligands leads to a dysfunctional immune response, 
causes T-cell exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch et al, 2012 ; 
Crespo et al 2013 ). Novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory 
receptors have shown significant clinical activity across a number of tumor types 
(Wolchok et al, 2009 ; Hodi et al, 2010 ; Robert et al, 2011 ; Brahmer et al, 2010 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ). Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen  4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), 
and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown clinical activity not only in conventionally immune-responsive tumors such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but 
also in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ; Gordon et al, 2013 ), prostate cancer ( Harzstark and Small, 2010 ;

and other solid tumors ( Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Gordon et al, 2013 ).
1.2 MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab Background
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are briefly described below. Refer to the current 
Investigator’s Brochures for details.
1.2.1 MEDI4736 Background
MEDI4736 is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb)
directed against human PD-L1. MEDI4736 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and 
has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and cluster of 
differentiation (CD)80. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of MEDI4736 contains a 
triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; Oganesyan et al, 2008 ).
1.2.2 Tremelimumab Background
Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a human IgG2 mAb being investigated as a cancer 
immunotherapeutic agent. Tremelimumab is expressed in NS0 (murine myeloma) cells and has an overall molecular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_776402] of CTLA-4, and therefore enhances T-cell activation. Tremelimumab 
shows minimal specific binding to Fc receptors, does not induce natural killer (NK) ADCC activity, and does not deliver inhibitory signals following plate-bound aggregation.

1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Unmet Need in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103281], the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer remains poor (Kang et al, 2012 ). At present, regimens that combine a platinum and fluorouracil agent 
either alone or in combination with a third drug such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_589485]-line metastatic setting, resulting in a median OS of 
approximately 10 months ( Cunningham et al, 2008 ). In the second-line setting, ramucirumab 
(a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ADDRESS_776403]) was recently approved by [CONTACT_33104] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and has demonstrated modest activity in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who progressed after first-
line platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy ( Fuchs et al, 2014 ). Median OS 
was 5.[ADDRESS_776404]-line platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy were randomized to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab or paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al, 2014 ). Median OS was 9.63 months and 
7.36 months, respectively. AEs that occurred in ≥20% of subjects (n = 327) treated with 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel were fatigue (56.9%), neutropenia (54.4%), neuropathy (45.9%), anorexia (40.1%), abdominal pain (36.1%), leukopenia (33.9%), diarrhea (32.4%),

An unmet medical need remains for new second- and third-line treatment options that are 
safe and effective in subjects with advanced gastric cancer. Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_589486] a more favorable safety profile and early signs of clinical activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rationale for MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab Combination Therapy
The rationale for evaluating MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in advanced 
gastric cancer is supported by [CONTACT_589499].
Mouse models of transplantable solid tumors show superior antitumor activity of 
combination therapy as compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways are non-redundant, suggesting that targeting both may have additive 
or synergistic activity. The combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade in melanoma has 
been shown to result in higher ORRs and 1-year survival than either agent alone (Wolchok et al, 2013 ).

MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
32 of 180 Template 16.2Profile of Adverse Events with Immunotherapy
MEDI4736 monotherapy, tremelimumab monotherapy, and MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab are currently being evaluated in other studies (see Section 1.4). Overall, the
AE profile is manageable and supports continued clinical development. 
Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as diarrhea and colitis have been reported with 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. With the approval of 2 immune checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma 
(ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [ Hodi et al, 2010 ] and pembrolizumab [ Hamid et al, 2013 ]), there is greater 
recognition of irAEs and management algorithms, including early, aggressive use of steroids, 
and continued improvement in outcome.
Preliminary Efficacy of Immunotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as MEDI4736 and tremelimumab have provided early 
evidence of clinical activity in advanced gastric cancer. Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 includes a cohort that is evaluating MEDI4736 monotherapy in subjects with gastroesophageal cancer ( Segal et al, 2014 ). As of 07May2015, out of 40 evaluable subjects 
with gastroesophageal cancer, there are 2 responses (1 CR and 1 PR). The DCR-24w was
15%. A Phase 2 study of tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line gastroesophageal subjects  demonstrated clinical activity (4 SD, 1 PR; Ralph et al, 2010 ).
Rationale for Patient Selection Based on Tumoral IFN- γ Gene Expression
Signature
[CONTACT_589526]-response to MEDI4736 and tremelimumab. Clinical 
trials and preclinical studies have demonstrated the predictive nature of an elevated Type 1 
helper T-cell (Th1) gene signature [CONTACT_589527] ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ). IFN-γ is one 
of the hallmark cytokines, both initiating and propagating the Th1 response. Its expression is 
closely tied to other proteins and cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Based on 
internal investigations, an IFN- γ gene expression panel was identified consisting of 4 genes 
that will be utilized to try and identify a unique population of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinomasubjects who may benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and spare those 
who may experience toxicity.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
33 of 180 Template 16.2Benefit-risk Evaluation
The emerging data described above demonstrate encouraging clinical activity with 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. These data combined with 
nonclinical data suggesting improved anticancer activity with the MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination, as compared to either agent alone, make a compelling case for evaluation of this combination in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. 
Possible risks are associated with agents such as MEDI4736 and tremelimumab that activate 
the immune system. The occurrence of irAEs, which is either overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_589487], is possible. Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, or the combination thereof, and may 
include immune-mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicity), 
neurotoxicity, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ; Wolchok et al, 2013 ). Several strategies have been incorporated in the 
study protocol to mitigate these risks (Section 3.1.5 ).
Summary and Conclusion
The preliminary clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy or 
combination therapy may provide alternative options for subjects with metastatic gastric cancer. Many of the AEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are potentially 
reversible and can be managed (eg, IV steroids for diarrhea [ Weber et al, 2012 ]). 
 
 
In conclusion, immune checkpoint inhibitors may offer patients with advanced gastric cancer 
in the second-line and third-line setting potential clinical benefit. In addition, further PD-L1 expression (tumoral vs stromal) may identify a subset of patients who could benefit. Early 
evaluation of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination therapy appears to offer a balance 
between safety and clinical activity.
1.6 Research Hypothesis
MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy will be safe and demonstrate clinical activity in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

40 of 180 Template 16.2In Phase 2 of the study, PD-L1 expression will be monitored throughout the study so as to 
potentially balance enrollment based on PD-L1 status (as specified in the Laboratory Manual; 
see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Subjects who are treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy (Arm B) or tremelimumab 
monotherapy (Arm C) may crossover to be treated with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab upon a confirmed progressive disease (PD) under restricted circumstances 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Subjects in both Phase 1b and Phase [ADDRESS_776410] was given upon initial study entry (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Dose delays and 
discontinuations to manage clinically significant treatment-related toxicity will be allowed.
All subjects will be evaluated for clinical activity, on a regular basis as specified in the

Clinical decision making in subjects undergoing treatment will be based on RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_776411] been enrolled in Phase 2 in 
Arms A  B  C (  and D . Pre-specified interim analyses performed on Arms A and B showed that the criteria for expansion were met; however,
enrollment into Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s discretion. Based on evolving 
science suggesting that the IFN- γ gene expression signature [CONTACT_589530] ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ) as well as data from the initial 
portion of the study, it was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab in both second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature. The 
discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to safety concerns. Arm D has completed.
Dose-Expansion in a Biomarker Selected Population
As of Amendment 6, a new arm (Arm E) of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab 
has been added to evaluate efficacy and safety in subjects with second- and third-line gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with a positive tumor IFN- γ gene expression signature. Numerous 
clinical trials have demonstrated the predictive nature of a Th1 gene signature [CONTACT_589531] D4190C00021

All subjects will be followed for survival until the end of 
study ([ADDRESS_776412]). Evaluation of a possible correlation between clinical activity of 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in combination and IFN- γ gene expression as well as other 
potential biomarkers (eg, tumoral and stromal PD-L1 expression) will be ongoing throughout the study.
The endpoints to be measured in this study are described in Section 2.2.

44 of 180 Template [IP_ADDRESS].4 Criteria for Treatment Beyond Progression, Crossover, and Retreatment in 
the Follow-up Period
Treatment Beyond Progression
For subjects in all arms and treatment periods, if PD (based on RECIST v1.1) occurs before 
completion of the treatment period, the subject may continue to be treated with the regimen 
they initially received after study enrollment (unless they have crossed over to the combination regimen at which time the subject would continue the combination regimen) until one of the following criteria is met:
1. Confirmed PD: The assessment of PD by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 (baseline PD assessment) will be 
confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later. If any subsequent tumor assessment time point shows ≥ 20% increase 
in the overall tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), the subject would be deemed as having confirmed PD. 
a. Note: Subjects in Arm B (MEDI4736 monotherapy) and Arm C (tremelimumab 
monotherapy) of Phase 2 who experience a confirmed PD (as defined above) will have the option (on a case-by-case basis) to crossover to treatment with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab (using the Phase 2 schedule) for [ADDRESS_776413] discontinuation criteria (with the exception of criterion number 10 in Section 4.1.6 ) are not met. If 
crossover is not chosen by [CONTACT_093], then the study treatment must be discontinued.
b. Note: Subjects with confirmed PD during 12 months of treatment with MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab (Phase 1b, and Arms A and D, and E of Phase 2) may not crossover to either MEDI4736 monotherapy or tremelimumab monotherapy at any time. Subjects enrolled in Phase 1b, and Arms A, D, and E of Phase 2 who exhibit confirmed PD after completing the planned 4 doses of combination treatment, but prior to completing the 12-month dosing period (ie, while receiving MEDI4736 monotherapy) may be eligible for reinduction (on a case-by-case basis) with combination therapy and continued treatment for an additional 12 months (or until the subject meets any of the discontinuation criteria listed below). The subject would be readministered investigational products according to the same treatment guidelines followed during their initial treatment. Subjects who are enrolled in Phase 1b and Arms A, D, and E of Phase 2 and who exhibit disease progression prior to completing the planned 4 doses of combination treatment may be eligible for continued treatment through the end of the planned 12-month treatment period (or until the subject meets any of the discontinuation criteria listed below), but will not be eligible for reinduction.
2. Meets any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6 ).
3. Clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant PD such as the benefit-risk 
ratio of continuing therapy is no longer justified.

to baseline.
5. Rapid PD or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (eg, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention, and/or continuation of study therapy would prevent institution of such intervention.
Retreatment for Subjects Who Enter Follow-up
Subjects enrolled in both Phase 1b and Phase 2 who achieve and maintain DC (ie, CR, PR, or 
SD) through the end of the initial 12-month treatment period will enter a follow-up period. 
Only those subjects who progress during the initial [ADDRESS_776414] has PD while off therapy ( Wolchok et al, 2013 ; Hamid et al, 2013 ), the 
protocol will allow retreatment during the follow-up period with the same regimen that the 
subjects received when initially enrolled in the study if all the following criteria are met:
1. Has not received other anticancer treatments for their disease.
2. Does not meet any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6 ).
3. Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease 
progression.
4. No decline in ECOG performance status compared to baseline.5. Absence of rapid PD or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (eg, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710]) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
6. All AEs while receiving initial therapy must have resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_776415] experienced a ≥ Grade 3 AE or neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while 
receiving initial therapy. Note: Subjects with an endocrine AE of any grade are permitted to be retreated if they are stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.
7. Must not have used additional immunosuppression other than corticosteroids for the 
management of an AE, must not have experienced recurrence of an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses > 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.
Subjects will be made aware of the potential benefits and risks of continuing the study 
regimens in the setting of PD by [CONTACT_428918].
3.1.3 Phase 1b ……….
The Phase 1b portion of the study has been described in Section 3.1.1 .
A total of 6 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b; this portion of the study is now complete.

according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03.
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT 
evaluation period. Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to 
another etiology is excluded from this definition. The following will be DLTs:
•Any Grade 4 irAE
•Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis
•Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration
•Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days of the 
initiation of maximal supportive care
•Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_178507] ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days
•Liver transaminase elevation > 8 × ULN or total bilirubin > 5 × ULN
•Any ≥ Grade 3 non-irAE, except for the exclusions listed below
The definition excludes the following conditions: 
•Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days
•Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is 
managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement 
therapy and the subject is asymptomatic
•Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (eg, inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc)

•Isolated Grade 3 elevations in amylase and/or lipase that are not associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms or radiographic features suggestive of pancreatitis 
•Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days
Immune-related AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the 
absence of a clear alternative etiology. In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, 
repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.
While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation specified above, an 
AE not listed above may be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the sponsor and 
investigators, based on the emerging safety profile.
[IP_ADDRESS] Maximum Tolerated Dose
The MTD is defined as the highest dose within a cohort where no more than 1 of 6 subjects(or less than one-third of subjects if the cohort is larger than 6 subjects) experiences a DLT. This will be determined during Phase 1b based on the assessment of DLT during the DLT 
evaluation period, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

49 of 180 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 ……….
At the time of this amendment, a total of  subjects have been enrolled in Phase 2 in 
Arms A  B  C  and D  Pre-specified interim analyses 
performed on Arms A and B showed that the criteria for expansion were met; however,
enrollment to Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s discretion. It was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab only in second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive 
IFN-γ gene expression signature. The discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to 
safety concerns. Arm D has completed.
As described in Section 3.1.1 , Phase 2 will include the following 5 treatment arms:
•Arm A: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-line subjects with 
metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
•Arm B: MEDI4736 monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
•Arm C: Tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma )
•Arm D: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
•Arm E (as of Amendment 6): MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a 
positive IFN- γ gene expression signature 
[CONTACT_589522] 2, subjects will be monitored continuously for safety according to the same 
criteria employed during Phase 1b. If during the treatment period, ≥ 33% of subjects 
experience safety events meeting DLT criteria, even if outside of the DLT evaluation period 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), enrollment may be paused and study data will be reviewed to determine 
whether additional monitoring or alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be evaluated prior to further enrollment. In addition, after the first [ADDRESS_776420] been dosed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for a minimum of 6 weeks (in both 
second- and third-line settings), safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_456].
3.1.[ADDRESS_776421] of 
this study. Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
nivolumab, and BMS-936559 and may include immune-mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021

50 of 180 Template 16.2hepatitis, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al, 2010; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Topalian et al 2012; 
Wolchok et al, 2013 ). Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs. In the 
absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune-related etiology should be 
considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy. In addition to the dose modifications shown in Appendix 5 , it is recommended that 
management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ( Weber J et al, 2012 ). 
If the investigator has any question in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator 
should immediately contact [CONTACT_7195]. Dose modifications may be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to MEDI4736 or tremelimumab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are deemed asymptomatic, require no intervention, and are 
documented in the medical records. Laboratory abnormalities that are felt to meet these 
criteria must be discussed and agreed on by [CONTACT_589501]. Dose reductions of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are not permitted.
Dose interruptions of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab may be required in the event of 
treatment-related toxicity. General guidelines regarding dose modifications are provided in
Appendix 5 . In addition, management guidelines for AESIs are detailed in Section 5.3. All 
toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03. In case of doubt the investigator should consult with the medical monitor.

for recurrent or metastatic disease, represents a high unmet medical need. This tumor indication, described below, presents an opportunity for novel treatment approaches that may lead to improved clinical outcomes.
In 2014, it is estimated that 22,220 and 18,170 people will be newly diagnosed with gastric 
cancer and esophageal cancer, respectively, whereas 26,440 individuals will die due to upper GI tumors ( Siegel et al, 2014 ). Gastroesophageal cancer remains endemic in many parts of 
the world, with an estimated new cancer incidence of 1,471,000 people or 11.6% of the 
global cancer burden and an annual death rate of 1,144,000 people or 15.1% of cancer-related deaths worldwide ( Ferlay et al, 2010 ). Globally, gastric cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer-related mortality ( Luis et al, 2013 ). 
Current therapeutic strategies for advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are limited, and 
survival rarely exceeds 1 year despi[INVESTIGATOR_589488]. A number of different drugs (eg, alkylating agents, platinum compounds, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], and taxanes) are available for the treatment of gastroesophageal cancer, but no means of selecting 
therapy based on the tumor biology is currently available. At present, the combination of a

setting ( Cunningham et al, 2008 ). Standard first-line options include docetaxel, cisplatin, and 
5-FU; epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], cisplatin, and capecitabine/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], oxaliplatin, and capecitabine; or 
folinic acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin.

5.2 months in the ramucirumab group versus 3.8 months in the placebo group (HR 0.776, 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.603-0.998; p = 0.047). In the RAINBOW study, more than 
[ADDRESS_776425]-line platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy were randomized to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab or paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al, 2014 ).
Median OS was 9.63 months and 7.36 months, respectively (HR 0.807; 95% CI, 0.678-0.962; 
p = 0.017), and median PFS was 4.40 and 2.86 months, respectively (HR 0.635; 95% CI, 0.536-0.752; p < 0.0001). Median time to progression was 5.5 months with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus 3.0 months with paclitaxel alone (p < 0.0001), and ORR was 28% 
versus 16%, respectively (p = 0.0001). Based on these results, the combination of 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel is expected to become the standard of care in the second-line setting for metastatic upper GI tumors.
Additional FDA-approved second-line agents include docetaxel and irinotecan. In the

Kang and colleagues evaluated chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m2every 3 weeks or 
irinotecan 150 mg/m2Q2W) plus BSC versus BSC alone in subjects with advanced gastric 
cancer who received 1 or 2 prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy regimens ( Kang et al, 2012 ). The median OS was 5.3 months with chemotherapy plus BSC 
(n = 133) versus 3.8 months with BSC alone (n = 69; HR 0.657; 95% CI, 0.485-0.891; 
p = 0.007). There was no median OS difference between docetaxel and irinotecan (5.2 versus

54 of 180 Template 16.2They reported significant upregulation of PD-L1 in advanced gastric cancer patients 
compared with healthy people (p = 0.006; Zheng et al, 2014 ). The expression of PD-L1 was 
significantly correlated with differentiation (p = 0.026) and lymph node metastasis 
(p = 0.041). Wu and colleagues examined PD-L1 expression in cases of human gastric carcinoma (n = 102), adenoma (n = 10), and normal tissues (n = 10; Wu et al, 2006 ). 
Programmed cell death ligand 1 was not detected in normal gastric tissues, and very weak 
immunodetection in gastric adenomas, but PD-L1 was detected in 42.2% of gastric 
carcinoma tissues. There was no correlation between PD-L1 immunolocalization and patient age, sex, tumor location, or the degree of tumor differentiation in gastric carcinomas. However, PD-L1 immunodetection was significantly correlated with tumor size, invasion, 
lymph node metastasis, and survival time. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PD-L1 
immunodetection could be used as an independent factor to evaluate the prognosis of gastric carcinoma. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_776428] safety parameters (AEs, SAEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, and 
physical examinations) will be employed to assess the safety profile of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy.
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessments
OR and DC as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) per blinded central review, 
are standard measures of clinical activity. OS is considered the “gold standard” for 
quantifying clinical benefit, with PFS being an acceptable surrogate. In the Phase [ADDRESS_776429] demonstrated the predictive nature of an elevated 
Th1 gene signature [CONTACT_589532] ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ). IFN-γ is one of the hallmark cytokines, 
both initiating and propagating the Th1 response. Its expression is closely tied to other 
proteins and cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Based on internal investigations, an IFN-γ gene expression panel was identified consisting of 4 genes that will be utilized to 
try and identify a unique population of gastr ic or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects who may 
benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and to identify correlations between IFN- γ gene expression and clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with

cohorts; retrospective testing will be performed as necessary.
PD-L1 Expression
In Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, as of 21Aug2014, the DCR at 12 weeks (DCR-12w) was 
33% (115/352 subjects) and ORR was 10% (36/352 subjects) in subjects (across 8 tumor types) treated with MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W ( Segal et al, 2014 ). Greater DCR-12w (47% 
vs 28%) and ORR (22% vs 5%) were observed in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative 
subjects, based on a proprietary IHC assay which detects PD-L1 staining on tumor cells.
Of the [ADDRESS_776430] been dosed in 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, 28 were evaluable for efficacy analysis ( Segal et al, 2014 ). 
In these subjects, DCR-12w was 25% (7/28 subjects).

defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must have received and have progressed, or are refractory 
to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen formetastatic or recurrent disease, or 
Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum-
or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within [ADDRESS_776434] progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens 
(one standard platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease).
e. Subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting.
6. Screening for IFN- γexpression prior to Arm E enrollment:
a. Subjects who are being considered for enrollment on Arm E may undergo 
pre-screening for IFN- γ gene expression either at the time of disease progression or 
after having completed a minimum of [ADDRESS_776435] consent to provide archival tumor tissue for IFN- γ
testing. Only subjects with a positive IFN- γgene expression signature (as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be eligible for enrollment to Arm E. IFN- γtesting must be 
completed to determine enrollment eligibility prior to initiation of therapy. If eligible, subjects must consent to initial and subsequent tumor biopsy samples, if possible.
7. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1. 
a. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well 
defined, measurable and there is objective evidence of interval increase in size.
8. Subjects must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy and must consent to and 
provide both pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies for Phase 2 (optional for Phase 1b). Fresh tumor biopsies should be preferentially obtained from tumor tissues that are safely accessible as determined by [CONTACT_497118]-significant risk procedures (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be 
lesions used as RECIST target lesions. Sites are encouraged to confirm adequacy of tumor biopsy material at the time of the procedure. 
9. Subjects must consent to provide archival tumor tissue (initial and subsequent tumor 
biopsy samples, if possible) for correlative biomarker studies (for both Phase 1b and 2), if available. Availability of tissue for transfer to sponsor should be confirmed prior to initiation of study therapy.
10. Adequate organ and marrow function, as defined below. Criteria “a,” “b,” and “c” cannot 
be met with ongoing or recent blood transfusions (within [ADDRESS_776436] dose) or require growth factor support (within [ADDRESS_776437] dose)

(> 3 × ULN)
e. ALT and AST ≤ 3×  U L N
f. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/minute as determined by [CONTACT_3158]-Gault 
(using actual body weight) or 24-hour urine creatinine clearance
11. Female patients of child-bearing potential: Female subjects of childbearing potential who 
are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use at least one highly
effective method of contraception ( Table 4.1.2-1 ) from the time of screening, and must 
agree to continue using such precautions for [ADDRESS_776438] dose of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy or [ADDRESS_776439] use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female subjects should refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.
a. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile

4.1.[ADDRESS_776452] Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identification (SID) number will be 
assigned by a central system (eg, an interactive response system [IXRS]), and the pre-screening/screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
65 of 180 Template 16.2(inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The SID number will be used to identify the subject during the 
pre-screening/screening process and throughout study participation. 
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not 
receive investigational products. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Subjects who are 
screening failures should be withdrawn from the study.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are free to withdraw their consent to participate in the study (investigational product 
and assessments) at any time without prejudice to further treatment. Subjects who withdraw 
consent will be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If the subject is
willing, the subject will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_093]. AEs will be followed up. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take place.
4.1.[ADDRESS_776453](s) if any of the 
following occur in the subject in question:
1. Withdrawal of consent from further participation in the study
2. Lost to follow-up3. An AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12440], contraindicates further 
dosing
4. Subject experienced an AE that meets the criteria for a DLT during the DLT evaluation 
period (for Phase 1b and Phase 2; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definition of DLT)
5. Subject experienced an AE that meets the criteria for a DLT, except its occurrence is 
outside the DLT evaluation period (for Phase 1b and Phase 2; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
definition of DLT)
6. Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_776454](s) might constitute a safety risk
8. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant9. Subject noncompliance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], warrants 
withdrawal (eg, refusal to adhere to scheduled visits)

Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product(s) 
regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent from further treatment, due to an AE, other), 
will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment and will be followed for 
protocol-specified assessments including follow-up of any AEs unless consent is withdrawn specifically from further study participation; the subject is lost to follow-up; the subject starts alternative anticancer treatment; or the subject is enrolled in another clinical study. All 
subjects will be followed for survival until the end of the study. Subjects who decline to 
return to the site for evaluations should be contact[CONTACT_12090] [ADDRESS_776455]’s consent to the use of data does not have a specific expi[INVESTIGATOR_69089], but the subject may withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_95129]. If 
consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be given to and used 
by [CONTACT_95130].
Samples Obtained for Genetic Research or Future Research
Samples obtained for genetic research or future research will be labeled with a sample 
identification number linked to the SID number but will not be labeled with personal 
identifiers such as the subject’s name. If the subject withdraws consent for participating in the genetic research or future research, the sponsor will locate the subject’s sample and destroy it. The coding of samples and results is to ensure that these research results are kept 
confidential by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_95068]’s identity and these results separate.

this additional research may not start immediately and may start at any time during the 
storage period. The subject’s sample(s) including any specimens of extracted DNA will be 
stored by [CONTACT_316760] a secure central laboratory. The subject’s samples will not be kept for more than [ADDRESS_776457] chooses not to allow his/her study samples to be 
used for genetic research or future research, the samples will be destroyed by [CONTACT_589502].
If consent is withdrawn after a sample has been taken but before the subject’s sample is sent 
to the sponsor for genetic research or future research, the investigator will arrange to have it 
destroyed. If consent is withdrawn after the subject’s sample(s) have been sent to the sponsor 
for genetic research or future research, the sponsor and the investigator will ensure that these sample(s) are destroyed unless the sample identification number has been removed and the subject can no longer be linked to any sample(s). However, if the subject’s samples have 
already been used for research, the sponsor is not required to destroy results of this research. 
In this case only the remaining sample(s) will be destroyed.

80 of 180 Template 16.24.3 Description of Study Procedures
4.3.1 Efficacy ……….
Tumor assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) and will be 
performed according to the schedule presented in Section 4.2. All subjects will be followed 
for survival according to the schedule in Table 4.2.3-1 through the end of the study (defined 
as [ADDRESS_776479]). 
Sites will be required to store electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_589489], and the sponsor will arrange for 
centralized storage of all imaging data. All imaging assessments, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to the sponsor or designee for storage. 
The centralized storage of imaging data will occur for independent centralized third-party 
blinded review of disease assessments. At the discretion of the sponsor, an independent central review of all scans used in the assessment of tumors by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_776480] v1.1 per protocol.
Tumor assessments should include the following evaluations: physical examination and CT 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (pelvic scan is 
optional unless known pelvic disease is present at baseline). CT or MRI scans of the head 
and neck will be performed on all subjects at screening; follow-up head and neck scans are optional unless disease is found on the screening examination or clinically indicated. MRIscan of the brain will be performed on all subjects at screening. If the subject has CNS 
metastases, a brain MRI is also required at each post baseline assessment. If a subject 
becomes neurologically symptomatic during treatment outside of the setting where the subject has known CNS metastases, a brain MRI is required.
The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast. If CT with contrast is 
contraindicated, CT without contrast is preferred over MRI. The same method is preferred 
for all subsequent tumor assessments.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
81 of 180 Template 16.2Tumor Evaluations
Physical examination
•Lesions detected by [CONTACT_497150], eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes. Documentation by [CONTACT_95103].
CT scan with contrast of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis
•CT scans should be performed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness of [ADDRESS_776481] should be performed using a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.
•Pelvis scan is optional unless known pelvic disease is preset at baseline.
MRI scans
•MRI of the head and neck, abdomen and pelvis (pelvic scan is optional unless known 
pelvic disease is present at baseline) is acceptable for measurement of lesions provided 
that the same anatomical plane is used for serial assessments. If possible, the same imaging device should be used for serial evaluations. In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably performed in the axial (transverse) plane on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. However, there are no specific sequence recommendations.
Measurability of Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions will be categorized as follows:
•Measurable Lesions - Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
◦[ADDRESS_776482] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm)
◦10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial)
◦Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_776483] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm)
•Nonmeasurable Lesions - Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions 
(or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm in short axis). Lesions considered truly 
nonmeasurable include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, and inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
82 of 180 Template 16.2•Target Lesions - All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
•Non-target Lesions - It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item on the electronic case report form (electronic case report 
form [eCRF]; eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Response by [CONTACT_589503] v1.1.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
•CR - Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target 
or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if 
there are target nodes). 
•PR - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
•PD - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). 
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions may be considered progression.)
•SD - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
•CR - Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. 
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm in short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD - Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
•PD - Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions will be defined as the overall 
level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. In the absence of measurable disease, change in nonmeasurable disease comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large,” an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776484] been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions may not 
represent true disease progression. In the absence of rapid clinical deterioration, subjects may continue to receive study treatment until confirmed PD (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Evaluation of Overall Response
Confirmation of CR, PR, as well as PD is required by a repeat, consecutive assessment no 
less than [ADDRESS_776485] documentation. If the next protocol scheduled scan is due within 2 weeks after the confirmatory scan was obtained, the protocol-scheduled scan does not need to be done. Treatment of subjects in Phase 1b and Phase 2 will continue 
between the initial assessment of PD and confirmation for PD (which is not required by 
[CONTACT_393] v1.1; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). These subjects may continue to receive MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab beyond confirmed PD in accordance with Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_776486] criteria may discourage 
the early discontinuation of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab and provide a more complete evaluation of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab antitumor activity than would be seen with conventional response criteria.
Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 provides overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses 
in target and non-target lesions with or without the appearance of new lesions.

4.3.2 Tumor Biopsies
[IP_ADDRESS] Fresh Tumor Biopsies (Phase 2 Only)
Fresh tumor biopsies should be preferentially obtained from tumor tissues that are safely 
accessible as determined by [CONTACT_589504], which include, but are not limited to, biopsies of the brain, lung, 
mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach 
or bowel wall [refer to the definition of a significant risk device under §812.3(m) in the 
Investigational Device Exemptions regulation (21 CFR 812)]. 
At baseline, fresh tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to administration of the first dose of 
investigational product(s) for all subjects. 
In addition, fresh tumor biopsies will be obtained on Week 5 Day 1 (± 7 days) and upon 
confirmed PD if clinically feasible (ie, repeat biopsy does not pose unacceptable medical risk to a subject as determined by [CONTACT_093]). Additional biopsies may also be performed if 
clinically indicated (eg, for mixed responses). For subjects requiring serial image-guided core 
needle tumor biopsy, those biopsies will be performed according to institutional practice.

given a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of 
pre-existing conditions during the study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring 
when the grade returns to the prestudy grade or below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms
ECGs (12-lead) will be recorded on study days as noted in Section 4.2. At Week [ADDRESS_776492]-end of infusion of tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736. All other ECGs will be performed once per visit, (prior to investigational 
product(s) administration if during the treatment period) and as clinically indicated. In case 
of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including an ECG that demonstrates a QT corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) value > 500 milliseconds, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm prolongation.
The same recorder will be used for each subject at each time point, if possible. Date and time 
settings should be checked at the start of each study day and aligned with an official timekeeper for all machines used in the study.
Skin preparations should be thorough and electrode positions should be according to standard 
12-lead ECG placement.
In this study lead V2 will be analyzed and reported as primary. Lead V5 will be analyzed, for 
all visits, as backup for the individual where analysis in lead V2 is not deemed possible for 
pre-dose or significant parts of whole visits or whole visits.
The following variables will be reported: heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and QT intervals from the 
primary lead of the digital 12-lead ECG.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure [BP], pulse rate [or pulse oximetry at screening], and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured on study days noted in Section 4.2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Dose Administration
Subjects will be monitored prior to, during, and after infusion of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab. Vital signs (temperature, BP, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured on MEDI4736/tremelimumab treatment days within 30 minutes prior to the start of 
MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab administration, every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during 
MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab administration, at the end of MEDI4736 and/ortremelimumab infusion (± 5 minutes), and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of MEDI4736. For subjects receiving combination therapy, vital signs will be 
measured within 30 minutes prior to start of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 infusion, every 
15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during tremelimumab and MEDI4736 infusion, at EOI of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (± 5 minutes), and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post EOI of MEDI4736 infusion. Pulse oximetry is a required vital sign at screening for baseline 
comparison. Pulse oximetry is optional on future visits, and should be obtained per clinical 
investigator if there is clinical concern for respi[INVESTIGATOR_191272], including but not limited to immune-related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (ILD), as detailed in Appendix 5 . For 
Dose 1, an additional 2-hour (± 15 minutes) observation period will be required after the 60 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
98 of 180 Template 16.2minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of MEDI4736 vital sign assessment. The 
additional 2-hour observation period will not be required for subsequent doses unless
clinically indicated (eg, the subject experiences an infusion reaction).
In the event of ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab may be decreased by 50% or temporarily interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the 
infusion. In subjects experiencing ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions 
may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.
Primary prophylaxis against infusion-related reacti ons is not permitted during this study in 
order to avoid obscuring a potential safety signal and to enable a future assessment regarding 
whether premedications should be required for all subjects in future studies. However, at the 
discretion of the investigator, secondary prophylaxis (ie, prevention of infusion-related reaction following initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) is appropriate and will be permitted. Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional 
standard may be administered per institutional standard at the discretion of the investigator. If 
the infusion-related reaction is Grade [ADDRESS_776501] experiences a related toxicity, the management guidelines 
provided in Section 3.1.5 should be followed.

4.6.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups
In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 treatment arms. Second-line subjects with 
metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 
Arm A (MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab), Arm B (M EDI4736 monot herapy), 
or Arm C (tremelimumab monotherapy). In parallel, third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in Arm D (MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab). Upon closure of Arms A, B, and C and completion of 
Arm D, second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature [CONTACT_589521] E

5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) E6(R1) defines an AE as:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. The term disease progression should not be reported as an AE or 
SAE, however, individual events and/or laboratory abnormalities associated with disease progression (see definition of disease progression below) that fulfill the AE or SAE definition should be reported. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that 
requires medical intervention by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_589510]. If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood 
cell increased). 
AEs may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product) 
or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776515]. 
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
Adverse Events Associated with Disease Progression
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of a new metastasis or progression of existing metastasis related to the primary cancer under study should not be considered an AE. 
New Cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the investigational product and have been identified after the subject’s inclusion in the study.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE that:
•Results in death
•Is immediately life-threatening
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
•Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
113 of 180 Template 16.2convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
5.[ADDRESS_776516].
AESIs for MEDI4736 include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy.These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with MEDI4736 monotherapy and combination therapy. An irAE is defined as anAE that is associated with drug exposure 
and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear 
alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate,should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule outneoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE. If the 
investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigator should 
promptly contact [CONTACT_38234].
AESIs observed with MEDI4736 include:
∀Diarrhea / colitis
•Pneumonitis / ILD
•ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity
•Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (eg, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis) 
•Endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis , hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_62475], 
diabetes insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562], hyper- and hypothyroidism and Type I diabetes mellitus)
•Rash / dermatitis
•Nephritis / blood creatinine increases
•Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase , increased serum 
amylase) 
•Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune-mediated aetiology 
include, but are not limited to, myocarditis, pericarditis, and uveitis 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
114 of 180 Template 16.2•In addition, infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a 
different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs. 
Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the MEDI4736 Investigator’s Brochure. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in guidelines for their evaluation and 
treatment are described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines (see Appendix 5 ). These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_589511]/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/study 
regimen by [CONTACT_9673].
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion-related reactions have been reported with 
anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al, 2012 ). As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be 
caused by [CONTACT_62535], including acute anaphylactic (IgE-mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the mAb, and serum sickness. Acute allergic reactions may 
occur, may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic reactions may include 
hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness.
5.[ADDRESS_776517], possible etiologies, and whether the event meets 
criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to MedImmune Patient Safety. See Section 5.2for the definition of SAEs and Appendix 7 for guidelines for 
assessment of severity and relationship. If an AE evolves into a condition that meets the 
regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the SAE Report Form.
Infusion of biological products is commonly associated with infusion-related reactions. 
Anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions have some common manifestations and may be 
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion-related reactions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic mAbs delivered through IV 
infusion. These reactions are less common following subsequent exposures. Unlike infusion-
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776518] commonly accompanied by [CONTACT_589512]/or mucosal 
reactions. The investigator is advised to carefully examine symptoms of adverse reactions 
observed during or shortly after exposure to MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, and consider the 
above mentioned facts prior to making a final diagnosis. Reactions occurring at the time of or 
shortly after subsequent infusions of investigational product are to be judged by [CONTACT_589513]/her own discretion. For the investigator’s convenience and in order to 
facilitate consistency in judgments a copy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) guidance for 
anaphylaxis diagnosis is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_776519]’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_24549], but without further recording in the eCRF. MedImmune retains the right to request 
additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if 
judged necessary. After [ADDRESS_776520]-related SAEs will continue to be followed for safety.
5.4.3 Deaths ……….
All deaths that occur during the study, including the protocol-defined follow-up period must 
be reported as follows:
•Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported at the next visit 
and documented in the eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
116 of 180 Template 16.2•Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to disease progression, the AE causing the 
death must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment 
regarding the co-involvement of disease progression, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.
•Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem 
may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the 
post-mortem results should be forwarded to MedImmune Patient Safety or designee within the usual timeframes.
5.[ADDRESS_776521] information: 
 
The sponsor is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety reports to 
applicable regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and participating investigators, in 
accordance with ICH guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements. The sponsor may be 
required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being 
notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit additional 
information requested by [CONTACT_95110].
Investigators should provide all available information at the time of SAE Report Form 
completion. Investigators should not wait to collect additional information to fully document 
the event before notifying MedImmune Patient Safety of an SAE. When additional 
information becomes available, investigators should submit a follow-up SAE Report Form 
(separate from the initial report form) with the new information. Any follow-up information 
to an SAE also needs to be provided to MedImmune Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
learning of the new information.

117 of 180 Template 16.25.6 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.6.1 Overdose ……….
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochures, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
Any overdose of a study subject with the investigational product, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to 
MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification Form (see Section 5.5for 
contact [CONTACT_3031]). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded on the 
AE eCRF (see Section 5.4). Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the 
consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is 
serious and must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.4and Section 5.5). MedImmune does 
not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. The investigator will use clinical
judgment to treat any overdose.
5.6.2 Hepatic Function Abnormality
Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s law (ie, any increase in ALT or 
AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 
2 × ULN) is considered an AESI. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single 
blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow-up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_497140]/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly 
supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended 
gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product. Guidelines for management of 
subjects with hepatic function abnormality are outlined in Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_776522], with or without associated clinical 
manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event to MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification Form 
(see Section 5.5for contact [CONTACT_3031]), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the 
abnormality (eg, cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational 
product has been confirmed.
If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is 
unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will 
be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776523] be 
initiated by [CONTACT_38238].
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_404497]. If the etiology of the event remains unconfirmed and/or is considered related to investigational product (see Appendix 7 ), a prompt cumulative review 
of safety data and the circumstances of the event in question will be conducted and assessed 
by [CONTACT_589514] (SMC; or equivalent) to determine whether continued dosing of current study subjects and/or study entry should be interrupted, whether the protocol will be modified, or whether the study will be discontinued 
permanently. Review and approval by [CONTACT_4484] (or equivalent) is required for resumption of 
subject dosing or study entry in the event that the study is interrupted. Where applicable, regulatory authorities IRBs/IECs will be notified of any actions taken with the study.
5.6.3 Pregnancy ……….
Pregnancy in a female subject who has received investigational product is required to be 
reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to MedImmune Patient Safety using the 
Safety Fax Notification Form (see Section 5.5for contact [CONTACT_3031]).
Subjects who become pregnant during the study period must not receive additional doses of 
investigational product but will not be withdrawn from the study. The pregnancy will be

The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_144109]/the center should comply with all the terms, conditions, 
and obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study. In the event of 
any inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, 
the terms of Clinical Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subjects and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall prevail.
Agreements between MedImmune and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_169937]-related procedures can take place, or subjects are enrolled.
6.2.[ADDRESS_776526] was 
followed through the end of the study (defined below), regardless of the number of doses of investigational product that was received. 
The end of the study (“study completion”) is [ADDRESS_776527]’s 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment [ADDRESS_776528]’s health is deemed to be at risk. In this situation, when a 
subject presents to a medical facility where the treating physician or health care provider 
requires access to a physician who has knowledge of the investigational product and the clinical study protocol and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_125234], the treating physician or health care provider can contact a medical monitor through this system, which is managed by 
a third party vendor.
[ADDRESS_776529] their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
7.[ADDRESS_776530] Data Protection
The informed consent form (ICF) will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and 
privacy legislation.
MedImmune will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance 
company, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, 
unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371] .
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked 
to the identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject. For example, in the 
case of a medical emergency, a MedImmune medical monitor or an investigator might know 
a subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review
An IRB/IEC should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the ICFand any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the subjects. The 
investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable IRB/IEC, and to 
the study site staff.

122 of 180 Template 16.2The opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC should be given in writing. The investigator should submit the 
written approval to MedImmune before enrollment of any subject into the study. 
The IRB/IEC should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.
MedImmune should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to meet local 
requirements.
If required by [CONTACT_427], the protocol should be re-approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC annually.
Before enrollment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF, is approved by [CONTACT_76466] a notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.
MedImmune will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory 
authorities.
MedImmune will provide regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, and principal investigators with 
safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, where relevant.
Each principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_24511]/IEC with reports of any 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product. MedImmune will provide this information to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153215]/she can meet these reporting requirements.

7.5 Changes to the Protocol and Informed Consent Form
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the coordinating 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_475078].
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study protocol.
The amendment is to be approved by [CONTACT_56335]/IEC and if applicable, also the 
national regulatory authority approval, before implementation. Local requirements are to be followed for revised protocols.
MedImmune will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to 
each principal investigator(s). For distribution to IRB/IEC, see Section 7.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a site’s ICF, MedImmune and the site’s 
IRB/IEC are to approve the revised ICF before the revised form is used. 
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by [CONTACT_9906]/IEC.
7.6 Audits and Inspections
Authorized representatives of MedImmune, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC may perform audits or inspections at the center, including source data verification. The purpose of

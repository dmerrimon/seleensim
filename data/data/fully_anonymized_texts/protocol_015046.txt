4 Protocol synopsis  
4.1 Brief summary   
The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a smart phone application (app) -based 
intervention to reduce risks from wildfire smoke among young adults with asthma. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_820371], both based on the EPA’s Smoke Sense phone app compared to a control group. We will recruit 60 young adults aged 18- 26 with asthma and randomize them to 1 of 3 
groups for a 3 -month study period during wildfire season. The long- term goal is to minimize 
asthma exacerbations from exposure to wildfire smoke.  Our aims are to:  
1. Est ablish the feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, retention rates), acceptability (intervention 
engagement, fidelity, usability, research attitude), and barriers and facilitators of adopting the technology of the Smoke Sense interventions and use of portable devices in young adults with asthma.  
2. Explore the preliminary impact of the Smoke Sense interventions on lung function and asthma 
control . These primary outcomes will be assessed using objective measures (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) and 
validated, self -report tools. Secondary outcomes will be anxiety, exposure reduction behaviors 
(e.g. stayed indoors, wore a mask), and symptom mitigating behaviors (use of medication, unscheduled health care appointments), measured via self -report and a Global Positioning 
System device . Outcome by [CONTACT_820384]. Preliminary evidence of treatment effect 
and its variance will be examined for a future clinical trial. 
3. Explore potential mediators (medication adherence, self -management skills, stress) and 
moderators (asthma severity/control) of the interventions to asthma outcomes.  
4.2 Study design  
4.2.a. Narrative study description (of the protocol)  
We propose an [ADDRESS_1137034] size of the Smoke Sense interventions on primary (lung function, asthma control, asthma quality of life) and secondary outcomes of interest (anxiety, exposure reduction behaviors, and symptom mitigating behaviors), as compared to a control group, among young adults with asthma. Measures will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_1137035] of 60 young adults, 18 -26, with diagnosed asthma (of 
any type). Study activities will take place during wildfire season, July -October. To be included in 
the study, participants will need to have been diagnosed by a health care provider as having asthma, own a smart phone (Android or iOS platforms), speak and read English, and reside in Spokane County, WA. People can not be in the study of they are a Smoke Sense app user, have had surgery within 3 weeks of enrollment, or a cardio- vascular condition, both of which are 
contraindications for spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]
56.  
The choice of sample size (n=60 participants) was based on achieving Aim 1, focusing on assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the Smoke Sense interventions. Feasibility.   
We expect that the true consent rate of eligible young adults is 75%.
67, [ADDRESS_1137036] this, we will 
recruit up to 86 eligible individuals. There is an 89% probability that 60 or more of these individu als will consent to participate if the true consent rate is 75% (based on the cumulative 
binomial probability). We expect that the true rate of completion of the week -8 assessment is 
80%.
[ADDRESS_1137037], there is an 87% probability that we will observe at least [ADDRESS_1137038] that the true rate of 
completion of the week -8 assessment is 75%.[ADDRESS_1137039], there is an 85% probability that 
we will observe at least 42 out of 60 participants completing the week -8 assessment.  
Acceptability.  We hypothesize that the true intervention adherence (adoption) rate for the two 
intervention groups is 70% and 85%, Smoke Sense and Smoke Sense Plus, respectively.  If this 
is correct, there is an 87% probability that we will observe that at least 12 out of 20 participants will adhere to Smoke Sense.  There is a 93% probability that we will observe at least 15 out of 20 participants will adhere to or Smoke Sense Plus.  
Young adults will be recruited from Washington State University -Spokane, and the Community 
Colleges of Spokane. (See LOS). Recruitment messages will be posted to social media sites and sent via the respective student affairs offices and health clinics to student list servs. A phone screening will determine study eligibility. If eligible, we will invite participants to the clinical laboratory at WSU Spokane for study visit 1 (Timepoint 1). Research personnel will consent the participant.  
Eligible young adults will be randomized with equal probability to [ADDRESS_1137040]. Odom -Maryon 
using a randomization software. Random group assignment and a corresponding unique study identification (ID)  number will be placed in sealed envelopes that are numbered sequentially from 1-60.  After the consent is signed, research personnel will open the envelope to reveal the 
participant’s group assignment. Research personnel will record the participant’s name, study ID and group assignment in a password protected spreadsheet stored on a  secure server at WSU .
 
As part of the training, participants will download the appropriate app to their mobile phones.  A set-up macro will ask the participant to enter their study ID which can be associated with all 
study data captured by [CONTACT_9426].    
A phone screening will determine study eligibility.  If eligible, we will invite participants to the 
clinical laboratory at WSU Spokane for visit 1 (T1). A research assistant (RA) will consent and randomize the participant  but the investigative team will be blinded to group assignment. 
Participants will fill out a series of questionnaires  via a link sent to their phone. The RA will 
weigh and measure the participant. The RA will train the participant on the use of a portable digital spi[INVESTIGATOR_820372] a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_820373]’s smartphone. The participant will download spi[INVESTIGATOR_820374], sex, height and weight. Participants will be asked to practice exhaling into the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. This air turns a motor while the device registers the speed, adapts it and transfers the measurement the participants’ smartphone application. When a participant initiates exhalation, a chronometer changes from red to green after [ADDRESS_1137041] definitive r esults. No calibration is required. Participants will also receive a GPS device 
and will be instructed on its continuous use during waking hours. Participants will be told that they will be sent an email with a link to a suite of Qualtrics’ surveys, which they will be asked to complete via their phone at T2, T3 and T4.
 Participants  in both intervention groups will be 
instructed on how to download and use the Smoke Sense app. Participants will be asked to return to the clinical lab so research personnel can download their GPS data at T2, T3 and T4. At T4 they will return their spi[INVESTIGATOR_820375], and complete the System Usability Scale
60 
and the Research Attitudes Questionnaire.61 They can earn $150, in $50 increments, per visit, 
T2-T4.  
This study proposes 2 intervention groups: Smoke Sense and Smoke Sense Plus. Smoke Sense Plus offers potentially value- added preventive activities to Smoke Sense. We 
hypothesize that with these additional activities, users will take actions to reduce their exposure 
before  experiencing symptoms and reduce the severity of outcomes . 
Upon downloading,  the Smoke Sense mobile app prompts users to set up a Profile , which 
includes a zip code, demographic information (sex, age, race, education level), baseline health 
information (pre- existing conditions, physical activity level, time spent outdoors), and beliefs 
about smoke and air pollution (e.g.  Does smoke impact health?) . In the Symptoms & Smoke 
Observations  tab, participants report their weekly observations of smok e, health symptoms, and 
exposure reduction behaviors. Four symptom categories  are reported, eyes and ears, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, and/or other , as well a s the severity of adverse health effects (i.e. 
symptom duration, whether medication was used, and  whether an unplanned trip to a health 
care provider occurred). In the Fire & Smoke Near Me tab, participants can look at  current AQ 
data measured at monitoring sites and future forecasts. The AQ [ADDRESS_1137042] answers. Badges  are awarded 
for accomplishments to promote desired behaviors: completing a user profile, launching the app 
weekly to check local AQ, reporting smoke and symptom observations, expanding AQ 
knowledge with AQ lessons , and exploring the map. Finally, participants can engage with other 
users  by [CONTACT_820385].  
Participants randomized to Smoke Sense Plus will be asked to  engage in the Smoke Sense 
app, as well as additional , evidence- based activities , including:18, 19 1) Receive weekly , push 
notifications that remind them to, for example, review their asthma action plan, take their daily controller medication,  refill any e xpi[INVESTIGATOR_820376], and identify places to go with filtered indoor 
air (e.g. library), 2) Monitor lung function daily using a portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_96676] , and 3)  Subscribe to a 
social network to share spi[INVESTIGATOR_44049], and exposure reduction strategies . Both interv entions 
will be delivered  via participants’ smart phones.  
The control group will receive incentives for study participation but  will not be introduced to the 
Smoke Sense  app.   
4.2.b Purpose: PREVENTION  
4.2.c  Intervention Type: behavioral  
IVN Name: [CONTACT_820395]:  Smoke Sense  is a smartphone  application (app). Smoke Sense participants  will be 
asked to establish a profile which includes demographi cs, baseline health information and 
current beliefs about smoke and air pollution. In the Symptom s & Smoke Observations tab, 
participants are asked to report their weekly observations of smoke, health symptoms, and 
exposure reduction behaviors. In the Fire & Smoke Near Me tab, participants review the most 
recent AQ data measured at an AQ monitoring si tes. Participants are asked to complete the AQ 
[ADDRESS_1137043] answers. Badges are 
awarded for accomplishments within the app to promote certain desired behaviors: completing a 
user profile, launching the app weekly to check local AQ, reporting smoke and symptom 
observations, expanding AQ knowledge with AQ lessons, and exploring the map. Finally, participants can engage with other users by [CONTACT_820386].  
Intervention Type: behavioral  
IVN name: [CONTACT_820396]: Participants randomized to the Smoke Sense Plus intervention will be asked to do 
everything that the Smoke Sense intervention group does  on a weekly basis, as well as the 
following additional activities: 1)  Receive weekly push notifications that remind them to, for 
example, review their asthma action plan, refill any expi[INVESTIGATOR_820376], take their daily controller medication, identify a clean air space in their home and community, 2) Monitor their lung function weekly via mobile spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and 3) Subscribe to a social network to share 
strategies to minimize exposure.

4.2.e. IVN study model: Parallel  
4.2.f. Masking: Investigator  
4.2.g: Randomized 
4.3 Outcome measures  
Primary: Lung function  
Repeated assessment throughout the [ADDRESS_1137044] obstruction by 
[CONTACT_93764] a machine and measuring forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_12194] (FEV1), forced vital capacity 
(FVC), and their ratio (FEV1/FVC). A low FEV1 , <60% predicted,  is a potentially modifiable 
independent risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations . Portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_75029] , that are used by 
[CONTACT_820387] , have been validated against conventional 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_820377].50 
Primary: Asthma Control Test  
Repeated assessment throughout the [ADDRESS_1137045] (ACT)[ADDRESS_1137046] of asthma on daily functioning, and an 
overall self -assessment of asthma control  via self -report . It has 5 items, uses a 4 week recall on 
symptoms and daily functioning and has a response scale that ranges from 5 (poor control) to 25 (complete control). ACT score >19 indicates well- controlled (versus 19 or < poorly controlled) 
asthma.  The Minimally Important Difference (MID) is 3 points between two groups or for 
changes over time.
60 
4.4 Statistical Design and Power  
Data management.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_820378] (via Qualtrics) data will be captured through 
apps installed on the participants’ smartphone. GPS data will be downloaded at T2, T3 and T4 
from the device. GPS data will be uploaded to the Urbanova cloud where it will be proces sed, 
cleansed, and de- identified. All other data will be sent directly to Urbanova for processing, de-
identification, and integration.  
Analytic plan. Feasibility, acceptability, and study outcomes (both primary and secondary) will 
be compared among the 3 study groups using descriptive statistics. Categorical and continuous data will be summarized as frequencies (percentages) and means (standard deviations [SDs]), respectively. Graphical displays and confidence intervals (CIs) will also be used to character ize 
group differences. Pursuant to Aim 1,  descriptive statistics will be used to examine recruitment 
and retention rates, and characteristics of participants (Table 2 measures) who dropout early to those who complete the study. The primary outcomes for Aims 2 and 3 include lung function (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio measured by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038]), asthma control (ACT), and asthma 
quality of life (Juniper’s AQLQ score averaging across items by [CONTACT_820388]).  To explore 
the preliminary impact of the Smoke Sense interventions on these primary outcomes (Aim 2),  
changes in means (SDs) across study timepoints will be examined for ceiling and floor effects, 
restrictions in range and achievement of MID for each outcome. Generalized linear mixed 
model s (GLMMs) will be  fit that includ e main effects for study group and time point (1=baseline, 
2=4 weeks, T3=8 weeks) and the interaction. An identity (continuous outcome) or logit (binary 
outcome) link function will be specified using SAS 9.[ADDRESS_1137047] to characterize changes in each of the outcomes across time. The same analytic approaches will be applied to the secondary (self -report) 
outcomes including anxiety, exposure reduction behaviors, and mitigating behaviors.  Objective 
measures of exposure reduction behaviors will be estimated using GPS data. To examine the association between each of the GPS -based behaviors and study group during periods of poor 
AQ, full factorial GLMMs will be fit that include group, day, AQ (1=poor or worse, 0=normal) and specify a random intercept model with an autoregressive covariance structure.    
Analyses will examine if the efficacy of the Smoke Sense interventions on outcomes is mediated 
(adherence to medication therapy, level of self -management skills, and psychological stress ) or 
moderated (asthma severity /control ) (Aim 3 ). For the mediation analyses, PROC CA[LOCATION_003]LMED 
will be used for bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_820379] p- values for the corresponding 
tests. For moderation by [CONTACT_29371]/contr ol, we will run the same set of analyses proposed 
for Aim 2, now including an additional main effect of asthma severity/control and an interaction term of asthma severity/control by [CONTACT_2060]. We will graph the means of each outcome across subgroups to better understand what, if any, interaction is present. For Aims 2 and 3, two-sided statistical tests will be performed (alpha=0.05). The results from all of the statistical 
tests p erformed in Aims 2 and 3 will be interpreted as hypothesis -generating for a future R01 
grant  submission .  
Missing data.  If the assumption of “missing at random” can be safely satisfied, GLMM 
appropriately uses maximum likelihood methods to handle missing data. If this assumption is not satisfied, sensitivity analyses will be performed to examine the impact of different 
assumptions (e.g. missing not at random) on intervention effects.
[ADDRESS_1137048].  Program feasibility51 will be determined by [CONTACT_820389], enrollment, retention in the study (outlined in the Sample Size 
justification, below) are met. Intervention acceptability will be determined by a high level of engagement with, and adherence to, the Smoke Sense and Smoke Sense Plus interventions. Acceptability of the portable devices used in data collection will be measured using the System 
Usability Scale,60 and the Research Attitude Scale.61 
Sample Size Justification.  The choice of sample size (n=60)  was based on achieving Aim [ADDRESS_1137049] that the true consent rate of eligible young adults is 75%.
76, [ADDRESS_1137050] this, 
we will recruit up to 86 eligible individuals. There is an 89% probability that 60 or more of these individuals will consent to participate if the true consent rate is 75% (based on the cumulative binomial probability). We expect that the true rate of completion of the T3 assessment is 80%.
[ADDRESS_1137051], there is an 87% probability that we will observe at least [ADDRESS_1137052] that the true rate of completion of the T4 
assessment is 75%.
[ADDRESS_1137053], there is an 85% probability that we will observe at least 
42 out of 60 participants completing the T4 assessment. Acceptability.  We hypothesize that the 
true intervention adherence rate for the two intervention groups , Smoke Sense and Smoke 
Sense Plus , is 70% and 85%,  respectively.  If this is correct, there is an 87% probability that we 
will observe t hat at least 12 out of 20 participants will adhere to Smoke Sense.  There is a 93% 
probability that we will observe that at least 15 out of 20 participants will adhere to Smoke 
Sense Plus.  
Potential problems and alternative strategies. Age could be broadened if recruitment is a 
challenge. If AQ is uncharacteristically healthy during the study period, we will use WSU -
Extension to recruit in areas with poor AQ. Data collection may influence behavior change. To 
examine this, w e will assess matched outcomes among national Smoke Sense users and our 
control group. While not feasible in this study, we will include a future attention control group. Use of spi[INVESTIGATOR_820380]' effect. However, the 
benefits of measuring lung function objectively outweigh the potential decrease in effect sizes.

What is the purpose of this study ? 
This research study is being done to  examine the impact of wildfire smoke on young adults with 
asthma, and to understand how we can use smart phone applications to help prevent people 
from breathing polluted air. We will monitor your activity, breathing function, and symptoms 
during the study. You are being asked to take part because  you are [ADDRESS_1137056] been 
diagno sed with asthma by a health care provider, own a smart phone (Android or iOS 
platforms), and speak and read English.  You cannot take part in this study if you do not meet 
the previously mentioned criteria or if you already use the  ‘Smoke Sense ’ phone application , 
smoke , have had surgery within [ADDRESS_1137057] negative.  
 
What will I be asked to do if I am in this study?  
If you take part in the stu dy: 
• You will be asked to:  
o Participate in the study for two months.  
o Participate in a virtual study visit to learn about the study . During that visit y ou 
will learn how to use a hand- held digital spi[INVESTIGATOR_820381] (app) to your smart phone . We will also ask you to download a Global 
Positioning System (GPS)  app and fill out a series of questionnaires on your 
phone . 
o Two, four and eight weeks  after your virtual study visit, you will be asked again 
to fill out a series of questionnaires on your phone and use your hand -held 
digital spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]. One example of a question that we will ask you is, “During the past [ADDRESS_1137058] you had shortness of breath?”   
• Taking part in the study will take between 3 and 10 hours of your time, depending on the 
study group you are randomly assigned to.  Random assignment is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin to 
determine what study group you will be assigned to.  
  Page 3 of 5 
o If you are assigned to the ‘Smoke Sense’ intervention group, you will also be 
instructed on how to download and use the Smoke Sense app. You will be asked 
to use the app weekly for two months , which we call the “intervention period.”  
o If you are assign ed to the to ‘Smoke Sense Plus ’ intervention  group , you  will also 
be asked to use the Smoke Sense app weekly  for two months , as well as:  
1) Use your spi[INVESTIGATOR_820382],  
2) Receive weekly  reminders to, for example, review your asthma action 
plan,  and,  
3) Participate in a social network  with other people in your study group  to 
share ways that you stay healthy during wildfire smoke.  
• About  60 people will participate in this study.  
 
Are there any benefits to me if I am in this study?  
There are no direct  benefits to you for taking part in this study . Your participation will help us 
learn how to prevent asthma attacks in other people.   
 
Are there any risks to me if I am in this study?  
The p otential risks of being involved in this study are invasion of privacy and breach of 
confidentiality. Strategies are in place to protect you from these risks.  You will be given a study

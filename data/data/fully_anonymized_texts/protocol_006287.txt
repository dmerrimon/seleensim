Amendment 6 (November 2017)  
Amendment rationale  
The purpose of this amendment is to address comments  
 in response to protocol amendment 5. In addition, the 
blood volume was updated to enable the collection of additional samples for Vit amin D, 
 and PK back -up samples. 
 
Changes to the protocol  
• The blood volume for Parts 1 and 2 were updated to 490 mL and 450 mL, respectively, in 
Section 3.6 Risks and Benefits. This enables sample collection for Vitamin D,  and back up sample collection for PK samples.  
• The inclusion and exclusion criteria in Section 4 were updated to exclude patients  with: 
o significant hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh B and C),  
o serum creatinine above the normal range,  
o history of cirrhosis with  complications  
o limit the population to PBC patients with mild/moderate disease by [CONTACT_497006]/exclusion criteria for ALT/AST, INR, and total bilirubin. 
• Section 7.[ADDRESS_638829] be stopped. 
• Table 8 -1 Part 1 Assessment schedule was updated to remove ‘ -30m’ from the pre -dose 
assessment time for Day 28, which was erroneously left in when protocol amendment 5 was made.  
• Table 15 -1 Liver Triggers and Events: definition and Follow -up Requirements has been 
updated to increase the frequency of repeat tests following re -starting study drug and to 
clarify that if there is an elevation of liver biochemistries after re -starting the study 
treatment should be discontinued and the patient followed-up. 
• Table 15 -2 Renal events: definition and follow up requirements has been updated to 
require discontinuation of study drug if there is a confirmed doubling of serum creatinine or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL  
• Editorial updates and corrections to typographical errors have also been  made.

Amendment 5 (June 2017)  
Amendment rationale  
The purpose of this amendment is primarily to enable higher dose(s) in Parts 1 and 2 of the 
study,  and to update the Part 2 study design to allow 
12 weeks of treatment in patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis ( PBC), to provide longer - 
term safety, tolerability and efficacy data.  
Specific changes to Part 2 include:  
• increase the treatment duration from 4 weeks to 12 weeks,  
• broaden the population to include patients both taking and not taking UDCA 
(ursodeoxycholic acid), to be more representative of the PBC patient population, 
• assess two dose levels (plus placebo), to gain an insight into the dose- effect  relationship, 
• increas e patient numbers and alter randomization ratio to randomize more patients to 
receive active treatment compared to placebo, for collection of more safety data in this 
population, 
• reduce the burden for the patient by [CONTACT_497007].  
Ch
anges also have been made to enable the staggered d atabase lock of the study, so the 
database can be cleaned and locked in stages such as at completion of Part 1, or completion of a set of cohorts in Part 1 as well as the final database lock at the end of the study. Once the database has been locked, the l ocked data may be communicated beyond [COMPANY_001] to groups 
including, but not limited to individuals treating the study’s subjects, Health Authorities and shared on clinical registries, as a means of greater transparency.  
 
Changes to the protocol  
• Title updated with the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of tropi[INVESTIGATOR_421736]. 
• Objectives ( Protocol synopsis  and Section 2  Study objectives) updated to reflect the 
objectives relating to the amen ded Part  2. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 130 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Study Design ( Protocol synopsis and Section 3 Investigational Plan) updated to reflect 
the changes relating to the amended Part 2, including updating the design, the rationale 
for the study design and dose/regimen and associated interim analysis ( Section 3.5 and  
Section 11.8). Section 1.2 Study purpose was also updated accordingly.  
• The amendment includes changes to enable the staggered locking of the database following completion of Part 1, or completion of Cohorts in Part [ADDRESS_638830] been updated as a result of this, including: Section 3.2 Rationale of study design, Section 3.5 Purpose and timing of 
interim analyses/design adaptations, Section 6.4 Treatment blinding, Section 10.2 Data collection, Section 11.8 Interim analysis and Section 11.9 Interim analyses on locked 
data.  
• The total blood volume collected during the study was updated in Section 3.[ADDRESS_638831] 
the recalculated and reduced volume for Part 1 and the new Part 2  volume. 
• Section 4  Population: has been updated to increase the sample size in Part 2, 
mentioning that the final sample size will  be  dependent  on  the  interim  analysis. The same section in the Protocol sy nopsis has also been updated with this information 
and to reflect the changes made to the eligibility criteria (see details below), together with the use of stratification in Part 2. 
• Section 4.1.2 Additional Inclusion Criteria for Part 2: has been updated to reflect that the population for Part 2 will now include patients taking a stable dose of UDCA as well as those who are not taking UDCA.  
• Several updates have been made to Section 4.2 Exclusion criteria to enhance patient 
safety, including to increase the time women of child -bearing potential need to use 
highly effective methods of contraception before and after treatment; to clarify the eligibility of those with previous viral hepatitis; to simplify the exclusion criteria related to hepatic decompensation to focus on cirrhosis with complications; to exclude patients that have laboratory results at screening that, if they occurred post -dose, 
would require them to discontinue study drug, to exclude the use of 
immunosuppressive drugs and FXR agonist obeticholic acid, and to exclude patients with a history of immunodeficiency diseases, including those with a positive HIV test result. Patients who have  previously participated in Part [ADDRESS_638832] received study medication within three months 
of randomization. 
• Section 5.2 Prohibited treatment: was updated with the addition of obeticholic acid, 
immunosuppressive drugs and investigational drugs as a prohibited treatment.  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_638833] dose. The restriction on alcohol intake has been reduced from 12 hours to 8 hours prior to dosing or study visits.  

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 140 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Section 6.1.1 Investigational treatment: An additional dose strength of 0.1 mg has  
been added In Part 1, a manual randomization process is used to provide 
randomization numbers upon confirmation of eligibility at the Baseline visit. In Part 2, 
an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used for management of randomization. Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_638834] these differences.  
• Updates have been made to reflect the doses administered in Cohorts 1- 3 in the  
Protocol synopsis and Section 6.2 Treatment  arms.  
• Treatment interruptions are permitted in Part [ADDRESS_638835], ALT or pruritus (interruption only). Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_638836] this. Table 15 -1 and 
Table 6 -1 provide the details for the follow up actions and when dose interruption or 
dose reductions are ap propriate. 
• Section 6.[ADDRESS_638837] the use of a double dummy design in Part 2 to maintain the blind across the two dose arms of LJN452. 
• The use of paper diaries has been noted as an aide to treatment exposure and compliance in Section 6.6. The diaries will also be used to collect details of any concomitant medication the patient takes in response to an adverse event of itch. It has 
been noted the Investigator should review the use of the diary with the patient.  
• Section 6.[ADDRESS_638838] a suitable supply of anti - 
pruritic therapy available at  home. 
• Section 7.[ADDRESS_638839] been clarified and moved from  
Section 7.1 to Table 15 -1 and Table 15 -2 in Appendix 1 (adapted from previous   
Table 9 -2 and Table 9 -3 in Liver and Renal safety monitoring sections). The r ationale 
for this change is to have all actions required following elevation of liver or renal markers in one place, as opposed to in multiple locations (e.g., stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], dose adjustment criteria and liver/renal safety monitoring) and to move to th e back of the 
protocol for ease of reference by [CONTACT_6624].  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496986] a CTCAE Grade 3 that is suspected to be related or a CTCAE Grade 4 (regardless of the relationship to study drug) have been identified as requirements to withdraw study medication, with the exception of pruritus, liver or renal parameters, which have their own stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496987] 1 and Appendix 2 . 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 150 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Section 7.[ADDRESS_638840] a visit in this timeframe, so will not require a follow up safety  call. 
• Section 7.[ADDRESS_638841] updates made to 
individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. It now specifies that the cohort stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496988] 1 (as dose escalation section of the study),  
Details have been 
added to specify that for Part 2 the DMC will review safety data on a regular  basis.  
• Section 8 has been updated with a Part 2 specific assessment schedule. In Part 1, the 30 min pre -dose window was removed to make scheduling more practical. Medical 
history was added to the table and clarity was added to define which results remained as source data, as these were previously missing in  error.  
• In Protocol Amendment 4, the option for the Investigator to delegate certain visit assessments to be performed at an alternative location was introduced. This has not been used and will not be available for Part 2, so references to this have been removed from Section 8  and throughout the protocol. 
• Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_638842] been updated to add magnesium, phosphate 
and vitamin D as well as to specify all assessments performed as part of the clinical chem istry assessment (including fasting lipid  panel). 
• Details of the pregnancy tests have been outlined in Section 8.4.6 Pregnancy.  
•
 Section 9.1 has been updated to remove collection of ‘outcome’ in the CRF as this is 
not collected in the CRF and clarification has been made as to when follow up of AEs 
continues until (end of study).  
• Section 9.[ADDRESS_638843]  
been streamlined and the information in Table 9- 1, Table 9- 2 and Table 9- 3 moved 
and refined to be presented in Table 15 -1 and Table 15-2 in Appendix 1, so easier to 
find. Table 15 -1 includes study drug discontinuation (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]), liver safety 
monitoring (from Section 9 ) and new down titration options. Table 15 -2 includes  
study drug discontinuation (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]) and renal safety monitoring (from  
Section 9 ). Since urinary protein- creatinine ratio varies by [CONTACT_25890], one criteria 
has changed from ‘Protein- creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥ 150 mg/g or ≥ 15 mg/mmol’ to 
Protein -creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥  ULN’.  
• Section 10.3 Data Monitoring Committee has been updated to define the role the DMC will play in oversight of Part 2 of the study.  
• Data analysis has been updated to reflect the study design changes to Part  2  in  
Section 11 and in the Protocol synopsis . 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 160 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Creation of a table to outline the definitions of CTCAE Grades for Pruritus and the 
required actions, which include an option for study drug interruption of up to a week with CTCAE Grade 3  pruritus. 
• Section 14 References were updated with changes to references made in the text. 
• Editorial updates were made. 
Amendment 4 (July 2016) 
Amendment  rationale  
The purpose of this amendment is to address feedback  
 on Amendment 3. Changes have also been made to the protocol to reduce the 
burden on the patients participating in the study. 
Additional changes have been made including clarification and slight modification of 
eligibility criteria, updated text describing the statistical analysis for clarification, addition of a higher dosage form, and minor editorial updates. 
The study is currently ongoing, with three patients dosed. It is not anticipated that the changes 
in the amendment will influence the study population or results of the study. 
 
Changes to the protocol  
• Section 3.1 ‘Study design’ has been update d to reflect the changes made to the timing of 
assessments on Days 1 and 28, that study medication for the full 28 days will be dispensed on Day 1 and that there is an option for Investigators to delegate responsibility for certain visits to be performed a t an alternative  location. 
• Figure 3 -1 updated to remove day details for screening and baseline visits, as are a 
duplicate of the assessment  schedule.  
• Updates have been made to  
Section 3.4  ‘Rationale for choice of comparator’ to reflect the recent approval of FXR 
agonist obeticholic acid. 
• Inclusion criteria 4 ( Protocol synopsis and Section 4.1) has been updated to increase the 
BMI range from 18 – 35 kg/m
2 to 18 – 40 kg/m2. 
• Additional inclusion criteria for Part 1 ( Section 4.1.1) has been expanded to include 
patients who have been taking UCDA for at least 6 months (with no change in dose for 
≥ 3 months), provided they have reached maximal response to UCDA with a plateau in alkaline phosphatase levels. Whilst the initial requirement for 1 year of treatme nt is based 
on the widely held criteria to define UDCA response, it is clear that those that are non - 
responsive can be identified sooner ( Carbone et al 2013). The minor change to the 
inclusion criteria will ensure that UDCA non-responder population will have early access to LJN452. Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_496989]. 
• Exclusion criteria [ADDRESS_638844] been clarified in Section  4.2. 
• Section 5.2 ‘Prohibited treatment’ has been updated to align with other studies with LJN452. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 170 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Section 5.3 ‘On Day 1, no breakfast will be provided’ has been removed as is an 
unnecessary  restriction.  
• The additional dose form of 0.03 mg has been added in Section 6.1.1 ‘Investigational treatment’. The higher strength dose form will simplify dosing if higher dose levels are reached through planned dose escalation.  
• ‘Liver safety monitoring’ ( Section 9.3) and ‘Renal safety monitoring’ ( Section 9.4) 
sections have been referred to in Section 7.1 ‘Discontinuation of study treatment’.  
• Addition of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496990] 7.1. ‘Discontinuation of study treatment’.  
• Section 7.4 ‘Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]’ has two updates: 
• Clarified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496991].  
• Section 8 ‘Procedures and assessments’ and Table 8 -1 ‘Assessment schedule’ have been 
updated as follows: 
• Visit windows for Screening and Baseline visits have been adjusted to avoid patients having to attend an additional visit to be re- screened to take account of when 
recruitment of patients ‘pauses’ for data review and dose escalation evaluation in - 
between cohorts. All subjects will have their eligibility reconfirmed at the baseline visit which will occur within 14 days prior to  dosing.  
• Moved Day [ADDRESS_638845] dose 
• Make later PK  sample collection timepoints optional on Days 1 and 28 
•  
 Additional 
pregnancy tests have been added to adhere to [COMPANY_001] guidance on monthly pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential that are able to be included in the study if  they are taking highly effective contraception. Pregnancy testing has been 
added at Day 1, Day 28 and Day 56. 
• Provide the option for the Investigator to delegate certain visit assessments to be 
performed at an alternative location, which will have the req uired ethical approvals in 
place and be documented on the delegation of duties log 
• Add ‘Drug dispensing’ activity, to be performed on Day 1 (rather than at each visit)  
•
 Section 9.3 ‘Liver safety monitoring’ has been aligned with individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_282121] 7.1, with guidance added for action in the event of initially elevated baseline values of ALT, AST, ALP or Bilirubin, plus provided more guidance on timeframes required for repeat assessments  

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 180 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
• Table 9 -3 ‘Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Act ions’ has been updated to provide greater 
guidance on repeat test timeframe and requirement to withhold study drug until further 
evaluation if cannot be performed in this time-frame.  
• Updates have been made to provide greater clarity on the planned data ana lysis. 
Changes have been made in the synopsis and in Section 11 ‘Data analysis’.

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638853] of the farnesyl X receptor (FXR) which modulates bile acid 
synthesis and detoxifying metabolism in the liver. Cholestasis is a pathological condition in which bile flow from the liver to the intestine is reduced or blocked. Causes of cholestasis include developmental abnormalities,  trauma,  chemical  or  immunological  damage.  Chronic cholestasis leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and potentially the need for liver transplantation. LJN452 is expected to provide significant ther apeutic benefit in patients with 
cholestatic conditions such as Primary Biliary Cholangitis  (PBC).  
 
1.1 Background 
Cholestasis is a pathological condition in which bile flow from the liver to the gall bladder or intestine is reduced or blocked, leading to accu mulation of potentially toxic biliary 
constituents. PBC is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by [CONTACT_497009], liver transplantation or death. The only approved therapy for PBC is the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), however this is ineffective in approximately 40% patients, which highlights the need for new drugs. 
FXR is a nuclear receptor activated by [CONTACT_5086] ( Chen et al 2004; Makishima et al 1999; 
Parks et al 1999; Wang et al 1999). When activated, FXR initiates a sensitive, negative 
feedback loop affecting various aspects of bile acid metabolism resulting in reduced bile acid 
levels ( Zollner et al 2006). Pharmacological activation of FXR is proposed to be an effective 
treatment for intrahepatic cholestasis by [CONTACT_497010], reducing hepatic bile acid uptake and bile acid synthesis, increasing renal bile acid excretion, decreasing circulating bile acid levels and reducing hepatic fibrosis. The therapeutic potential of FXR agonism has been studied in Phase 2 clinical trials and a reduction in biomarkers of cholestatic disease, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), 
has been demonstra ted (Mason et al 2010a ; Kowdley et al 2011; Hirschfield et al 2015).  
LJN452 is a highly potent, specific and orally available FXR agonist. This is a study to deter mine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics efficacy of LJN452 in patients with PBC.  
 
1.1.1  Relevant data summary  
Detailed background information on the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and 
pharmacokinetics of LJN452 are given in the Investigator’s Brochure. The most relevant data 
for the present study are summarized in the sections below. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preclinical data 
Pharmacology  
In vitro pharmacology studies demonstrate that LJN452 is a potent human FXR agonist with an 
EC50 of 0.2 nM and 0.3 nM in a cell-based FXR reporter gene assay and in a biochemical co-
activator interaction assay, respectively, with >30,000 fold selectivity over other nuclear receptors. 
Furthermore, LJN452 demonstrated no off-target binding/activity (up to 30 µM) in a broad 
specificity -screening panel of receptors, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors or 
enzymes.  

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 260 
Protocol No. CLJN452X2201   
 
FXR agonism has been shown to modify gene expression of a number of enzymes and 
transporters responsible for drug metabolism  and  secretion  ( Calkin and Tontonoz 2012). 
The time course of effects of LJN452 on the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in preclinical 
species is detailed in the Investigator’s Brochure in addition to potential induction of drug meta bolizing enzymes. Drug secretion into bile is typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a safe route of 
clearance. However, biliary delivery of some drugs or their reactive metabolites to the intestinal tract may evoke adverse consequences due to direct toxic actions or indirect disruption  of  intestinal  homeostasis.   For   example,   delivery   of   reactive   metabolites  of diclofenac via MRP2 into bile has been linked  with  NSAID  enteropathy  ( Treinen -
Moslen and Kanz 2006).  
 
In vivo a single oral dose of LJN452 in naïve rats ranging from 0.03- 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 
dose- dependent increase in expression of FXR target genes (liver BSEP and small 
heterodimer partner (SHP), ileum SHP and FGF15). Dosing of  naïve  rats  with  LJN452 (p.o., q.d. for 2 weeks) resulted in modulation of gene expression and clinically relevant pharmacodynamic and bi omarker (FGF15) changes at doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day.

Pharmacokinetics  
LJN452  has  moderate  oral  bioavailability  in  animals  ( ≥10%).  Plasma  terminal  T1/2  
was moderate  to  long.  Clearance  and  volume  distribution  were  low   to   moderate.   
After repeated doses, the exposure was dose proportional with no consistent sex difference. No accumulation was observed in dog, but  mild accumulation noted in rat. LJN452 is highly 
plasma protein bound (>97%).

1.2 Study purpose 
The purpose of Part 1 is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LJN452 
administration for 4 weeks on markers of cholestasis in patients with Primary Biliary 
Cholangi tis (PBC), to enable decisions regarding the further development of LJN452 in the 
indication of PBC. In addition, data obtained in Part 1 will inform dose selection for Part 2. 
The purpose of Part 2 is to further assess the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of LJN452, 
when administered for longer (12 weeks) and in a wider patient population (both those taking and not taking UDCA). This will provide data to support further development of LJN452 in patients with PBC.

If a patient has a medically important AE that is considered related to study drug and which 
has not resolved or stabilized at their scheduled end of study visit (week 17), they will be followed, until resolution or stabilization of the AE. 
The following will be considered as medically important: 
i) An AE with CTCAE Grade  ≥3 
ii) SAE  
iii) hepatic and renal events should be followed up per the guidance in Table 15 -1 and

events will be scheduled at approximately week 21, or sooner based on Investigator’s 
discretion. If events are not resolved or stabilized at this time point, further follow up will be scheduled at  the Investigator’s discretion and unscheduled visits will be used to collect safety 
and/or laboratory data. As soon as the event is resolved and/or stabilized, and as long as there are no additional medically important AEs from the treatment period ongoin g, no further 
follow up is required. 
 
3.2 Rationale of study design 
This randomized, multi -center, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multi -part 
study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of LJN452 (in doses of 0.01 mg and above) relative to placebo in patients with PBC. This will be ass essed by a reduction in 
the cholestatic marker GGT after 4 weeks of double -blind treatment in Part 1 and 12 weeks of 
double- blind treatment in Part 2. 
In Part 1 up to 5 dose levels will be explored to allow characterization of dose exposure response relati onship in PBC patients. Randomization in Part 1 has been chosen on a 2:1 ratio 
in order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_496993]452. Since 2 cohorts are initially anticipated, the chosen ratio will provide a similar number of patients treated at each d ose 
level to compare with  placebo. 
In Part 2 two dose levels of LJN452 will be selected based on the safety, tolerability and efficacy data from Part 1.  
Randomization in Part 2 has been chosen on a 3:3:[ADDRESS_638862] of LJN452 on GGT and itch parameters and to assess the variability for sample size re -estimation, if needed. 
In order to maintain the scientific integrity of the study, the investigator and patient will remain bl inded to their treatment assignment until database lock (either at the end of the study, 
or earlier in the event of a staggered lock of Part 1 or cohorts in Part 1). 
The use of multiple cohorts of ascending dose in Part [ADDRESS_638863] of care UDCA and hence are at increased risk of disease progression to hepatic decompensation, transplantation or death. Data obtained in Part 1 will allow selection of doses to be used in Part 2.

to make up a significant minority population in later phase studies. 
Patients will also be stratified across the treatment groups based on the severity of any 
pruritus. Patients with a PBC -40 score at screening of <7 will be classed as low severity and 
those with a score ≥7 will be classed as high severity.

However, obeticholic acid is not universally utilized for treatment of PBC. Furthermore, PBC 
patients  with severe itch were  excluded  from  Phase  3  POISE  study  ( Nevens et al 2016). 
In order to allow those with severe itch to be enrolled into the study placebo will be used as a comparator.

3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
The first interim analysis will be performed when at least [ADDRESS_638866] the doses for Part 2, which may be initiated prior to 
the completion of Part 1. Part 2 will not be initiated if the estimated change from baseline in GGT at Day 28 is smaller than 20% at the highest dose level of LJN452 in Part 1.

completed their Week 8 visit. The purpose of this interim analysis is to review the sample size 
(calculated based on GGT and ALP changes) to assess if it is also adequate to provide precise enough treatment difference estimates in itch parameters, a key tolerability endpoint. 
This study will utilize a staggered lock of the clinical database, so that the data can be locked 
after completion of Part 1, or a set of Cohorts in Part 1. 
Once a Cohort’s data has been locked, treatment codes for the relevant cohort(s) will be 
released and made available for data analysis.  
The results from the locked Part 1 interim analysis can be communicated beyond [COMPANY_001] to groups including, but not lim ited to individuals treating the study’s subjects, Health 
Authorities and reported on clinical registries.  
Additional interim analyses  may be conducted to support decision 
making concerning the current clinical study, the sponsor’s clinical development projects in general or in case of any safety concerns. No dose escalation is planned in Part 2.

daily for 12 weeks (n=33) 
• LJN452 Placebo daily for 12 weeks (n=22) 
Part 2 dose levels will be selected based on  a  balance of safety, tolerability and efficacy.   
The d ose levels selected in Part 2 will be approved by [CONTACT_30965]  
 
 
6.2.1  Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment 
Part 1  
Within a cohort, once a dose is decided on, study drug dose adjustments are not permitted. 
Interruption to study drug may occur based on the criteria outlined in Table 15-1 (Liver events) 
and Table 6 -1 (Pruritus event definitions and required actions). 
In case of notable adverse event s or safety concerns during dose escalation of the study, the 
following changes to the next planned dose level may be considered: 
• Administration of a dose below the starting  dose 
• Administration of an intermediate dose between the current and preceding  dose 
• Administration of an intermediate dose between the current and next planned dose 
• Repeated administration of the current dose 
• Termination of any further dose escalation  
These changes must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF. 
 
Part 2: Option for dose reduction when ALT or AST > 2 × Baseline value AND  
≤[ADDRESS_638881] elevations meetin g the  definitions  outlined  in 
Table 15 -1, a dose interruption or dose reduction to the next lower dose level, (or to placebo if 
receiving the lowest dose level) is permitted. One dose reduction step is allowed per patient. If, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_256254] a reduced dose, a patient has persistent (i.e. remains > 90% of the original 
elevated level) or new ALT or AST elevation, they must be discontinued from study treatment. Increasing the dose to the original level is not permitted.  
If the patient has symptoms or other LFTs are also elevated please refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_638882], GGT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin and PT/INR.  

[COMPANY_001]

The central laboratory should be used, if this is  not possible, the repeats can be performed at a 
local laboratory to monitor the safety of the patient. If tests are performed at local laboratory, 
results will be captured in source documents only. In all cases, a physical examination should be performed and recorded in source documents. 
Table 15 -1 in Appendix 1  outlines the required testing frequency and resultant actions 
dependent on the outcome of the repeat assessments. 
If the additional laboratory evaluation confirms the increase of ALT and/or AST values, the 
study treatment will be reduced to the next dose level in a blinded manner ( Table 6 -1).       
The procedure for dose reduction is out lined in the Site Operations  Manual.  
If the additional laboratory evaluation does not confirm the significant increase of ALT values, the patient will continue with the assigned/original dose level.  
If the additional laboratory evaluation shows a higher elevation of ALT and/or AST (e.g. > 8× ULN) as compared to the original elevation (e.g. > 5xULN but ≤ 8xULN), the guidance for this higher elevation (e.g. > 8× ULN) should be followed.

Repeat/second dose reductions are not permitted. Returning to the original treatment is not permitted.  
Patients with a persistent or a second cycle of elevated ALT or AST while on the reduced dose will be instructed to return to the clinic for repeat tests  as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_638883] values, the patient will discontinue study treatment. If the repeat tests do not confirm elevation, the patient will continue with the reduced  dose. 
 
6.3 Treatment assignment  
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible subjects (see Site Operations Manual for details).  
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatm ent assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. 
In Part [ADDRESS_638884] will be produced by [CONTACT_90181] a validated system that automates the random assignment of treatment arms to randomization numbers in the specified ratio. The investigator will enter the randomization number on the CRF. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638885] participates in both  parts.  
The randomization scheme for all subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Office. 
 
6.4 Treatment blinding 
This is a double -blind study: subjects, investigator staff (with the exception of unblinded 
pharmacy staff or authorized designee responsible for dispensing study medication), persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain blinded to the identity of study treatments.  
The identity of  the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_376878], labeling, schedule of administration, appearance and odor. In Part 2, the blind for the different dose levels will be maintained through the use of a double -dummy design, 
with additional placebo capsules given in active treatment groups when needed to maintain the blind. 
Randomization data are kept strictly confidential, and are accessible only to authorized 
personnel (unblinded pharmacist or authorized designee), until un- blinding of the trial as 
described in the table in the Blinding levels table in the Site Operations Manual. 
The bioanalyst will request a copy of the randomization to facilitate analysis of the samples . 
The  bioanalyst  will  provide  the  samp le  data  to  the  team  under  blinded  conditions.   
The bioanalyst will keep this information confidential until interim analysis (Part 1 only) or 
final clinical database lock.  
Unblinding will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 6.5), at the time of the interim analysis and upon database lock, either at the conclusion of the study or completion of a Cohort or Part of the study.  
 
Part [ADDRESS_638886] completed  Day 28 of the study.  
The Interim Analysis Team may communicate interim analysis results (e.g., dose escalation decision, evaluation of PoC criteria or information needed for planning/modifying another study) to relevant [COMPANY_001] teams for information, consulting and/or decision purposes. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Version v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638887] of the study (DMC) will be unblinded to the Week 8 results and will advise on whether sample size adjustment is required (see Section  11.8).

In  an  emergency,  the  scratch -off  cover  can  be  removed  to  determine  the  treatment.  
The scratch -off covers are not to be removed for any reason  other  than  an  emergency. 
When the investigator removes the scratch -off cover he/she must note the date, time, and 
reason for removing it and retain this information with the case report form documentation. The unblinded treatment code should not be recorded on the CRF . The investigator must 
also immediately inform the [COMPANY_001] local monitor that the code  has been  broken. 
In Part [ADDRESS_638889], he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the ne cessity to break the treatment 
code for the subject. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the study monitor for the site and the Study Team that the code has been  broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access to the code break cards or IRT in case of emergency. If appropriate, the investigator  will 
inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable.

6.6 Treatment exposure and compliance 
Pharmacokinetic parameters (measures of treatment exposure) will be determined in all 
subjects treated with LJN452, as detailed in Section 8.5. 
To aid compliance, patients will be issued with a paper diary to record the time of dosing 
throughout the study. Information collected will include a confirmation that the patient took their UDCA and the time they took their study drug. In addition, patients will be asked to record details of any medication used in response to any adve rse events of itch.  
The Investigator (or deputy) should review the diary with the patient to make sure they are familiar with the diary and understand what information needs to be completed. 
The data collected will be kept as source documentation.

• An AE with a CTCAE rating of Grade 4 or higher, regardless of attribution to study drug 
• Emergence of the following adverse events: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, recurrent positive fecal occult blood or other GI symptoms that are deemed to be int olerable.  
The appropriate personnel from the study site and [COMPANY_001] will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for any reason.  
If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator must determine the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the Dosage Administration CRF. 
After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data 
should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:  
• new / concomitant treatments  
• adverse events/Serious Adverse Events  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they  do not wish to participate in the 
study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw 
their consent (see Section 7.3). Where possible, they should return for follow up assessments. If they fa il to return for assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, e -mail,

the cohort. 
• The Sponsor unilaterally requests it. 
Safety reviews will be conducted jointly between medically qualified representatives of the Sponsor and Investigator and a joint decision will be made. If a dose level is identified to be intolerable, the preceding dose level will be defined as the maximum tolerated dose. 
The severity of adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_67761] (or his designee) 
based on clinical judgment and captured in the CRF AE page. This  information will be used

8 Procedures and assessments  
Subjects should be seen for all visits on the designated day, with the assessments performed as per schedule, within the allowed “visit/assessment window” specified in the Site Operations Manual.  
Subjects will be seen at the investigational site or at an alternate location to which the Investigator has delegated responsibility. The alternate location will have all required ethical approvals in place, all staff will be appropriately trained in the protocol and assessments to be performed and will be documented on the delegation of duties log. The purpose of this flexibility, where available, is to offer patients the option of having their visits performed at a more convenient location, as it is anticipated patients may live a significant distance from the main Investigational site. Visits where this is an option are outlined in the assessment 
schedule.

Note: The intention was to have study visits during the dosing period 7 days apart, with permitted visit windows as 
outlined in the SOM. However it has been noted that the assessment schedule has the visit 3 labelled as Day 1 rather than Day 0 resulting in 6 days between this and the next visit. Since this error was noted after the study has started and patients dosed, the current visit names will remain unchanged, however sites should aim to schedule

9 Safety  monitoring 
9.1 Adverse  events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject aft er providing written informed consent for participation in 
the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by [CONTACT_144970], laboratory test, or other assessments.  
Abnormal laborator y values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria: 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically  significant,  
• they require therapy.  
Clinically significant abnormal labora tory values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_497000]. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual 
subject and identifying adverse events. Alert ranges for liver related events are included in Section 9.3. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638907] be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF for subjects that pass screening 
and enter into the study. The adverse events should be reported according to the signs, 
symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, and accompanied by [CONTACT_6644]: 
1. The Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) AE grade (version 4). If CTC-AE grading does not 
exist for an adverse event,  use: 
• 1=mild,  
• 2=moderate,  
• 3=severe  
• 4=life  threatening.  
CTC -AE grade 5 (death) is not used, but is collected in other CRFs (e.g., Study 
Completion, Death/Survival). 
2. its relationship to the study treatment (no/yes) 
3. its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved should be reported. 
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) See Section 9.2 for definition of SAE  
5. action taken regarding investigational treatment.  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: 
• no action taken (i.e., further observation only) 
• study treatment dosage adjusted/temporarily  interrupted 
• study treatment permanently discontinued due to this adverse event  
• concomitant medication  given  
• non-drug therapy  given  
• subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]/subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497001], it should be followed until its resolution or until it is  judged to be permanent, throughout the study, and assessment should be made at each visit  (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and whether the AE is ongoing at the end of study visit.  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or Core Data Sheet (for marketed drugs) or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator Notific ations. This information 
will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. 
The investigator should also instruct each subject to report any new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the investigator’s source documents, however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to [COMPANY_001].

9.2 Serious adverse event  reporting 
9.2.1  Definition of  SAE 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the 
following criteria:  
• is fatal or  life-threatening  
• results in persistent or signific ant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in  condition 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event n ot fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition  
• is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical  intervention. 
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.  
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met.  
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76593]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergenc y room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536]. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) are captured on the CRF, SAEs also require individual 
reporting to C hief Medical Office and Patient Safety as per Section 9.2.2. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638908] be 
submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE 
that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow up information ) is collected and record ed 
on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The investigator must assess the relationship to each specific component of study treatment (if study treatment consists of several drugs) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, s igned 
form by [CONTACT_87109] [ADDRESS_638909] continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re -occurrence, complication, or 
progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of 
when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the investigational treatment a Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_187869]. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same investigational treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Une xpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating  countries.

Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638910] safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an 
investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of 
liver events has to be followed. 
The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during 
the course of the study: 
• Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal 
laboratory parameter  
• Liver events, which will require close observation, follow-up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver CRF  pages  
Please refer to Appendix 1 for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events and their required follow up requirements.  
These follow up actions may include:  
• Repeating the LFT* to confirm elevation as defined in Table 15 -1, interruption of dosing 
while result is  pending 
• Dose reduction (Part 2  only)  
• Discontinuation of the investigational drug 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497002] 
• A causality assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, 
co-medications)  
• An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. These 
investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, 
hepatologist’s consultancy, based on investigator’s discretion. 
*These LFT repeats should be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If  this is not 
possible, then the repeats can be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safety of the patient. Repeats laboratory should then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. All follow -up information, and the procedures performed should be recorded as appropriate in 
the CRF, using the Liver Event Checklist as guide, which should be kept as source data.

[COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The study drug must be discontinued, though the subject may stay in the study, if she wishes to do so. All assessments that are considered as a risk during pregnancy must not be performed.  The subject may continue all other protocol assessments.

Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638912] be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. 
 
9.6 Early phase safety  monitoring 
The Investigator will monitor adverse events in an ongoing manner and inform the Sponsor of any clinically relevant observations. Any required safety reviews will be made jointly  between  medically  qualified  personnel  representing  the   Sponsor   and   Investigator.   Such evaluations may occur verbally, but the outcome and key discussion points will be summarized in writing (e -mail) and made available to both Sponsor and all Investigator(s).  
The Sponsor will advise the Investigator(s) at all sites in writing (e -mail) (and by [CONTACT_497019]) of any new, clinically relevant safety information reported from another site during 
the conduct of the study in a timely manner. 
 
10 Data review and database  management  
10.1 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] representative will review the protocol an d CRFs with the investigators and their  staff. 
During the study [COMPANY_001] employs several methods of ensuring protocol and  GCP compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personne l must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical informa tion, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
[CONTACT_423] (a signed copy is given to the subject).  
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification for the pre sence of informed consent, adherence to the eligibility criteria, documentation of 
SAEs, and the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about 
the identity of the subjects will be  disclosed. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638913] an external originating source (either written or electronic) with the CRF not being considered as source.  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.  
CRO working on behalf of [COMPANY_001] review the data entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_109052]. Queries are sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query. Designated investigator site staff is required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form will be faxed to the site. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to the CRO working on behalf of [COMPANY_001] who will make the correction to the database. 
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug

11.1 Analysis  sets  
For all analysis sets, subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment(s) received. 
Subjects with dose reduction due to ALT/AST will be analyzed according to the treatment they received up to the dose reduction in Part 2. 
The safety analysis set  will include all subjects that received any study drug.  
The PK analysis set will include all subjects with at least one available valid (i.e., not flagged 
for exclusion) PK concentration measurement, who received any study drug and experienced no protocol deviations with relevant impact on PK data. 
The PD analy sis set will include all subjects with available PD data and no protocol  
deviations with relevant impact on PD data.  
Details of protocol deviations which warrant exclusion from either the PK or PD analyses data 
sets will be provided in the RAP document Module 3.

11.3 Treatments (study drug, rescue medication, other concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], compliance)  
Data for study drug administration (rescue medication) and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_497003]. 
 
11.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s)  
The pri mary efficacy objective is to evaluate the treatment effect of LJN452 over placebo in 
terms of reduction in cholestasis. The primary efficacy endpoint is the fold change in serum gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) from baseline to Day 28 and Day 85 for Part 1 and Part 2, 
respectively.  
 
11.4.1  Variable(s)  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the fold change in serum gamma- glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
from baseline. The Serum GGT values at all time points will be logarithmically transformed prior to analysis. The rationale for the log transformation is to achieve more approximate normality and to be able to estimate a treatment effect on a ratio scale. Y=log(GGT[PHONE_8263]) will be considered only if there are many observations with GGT result as zero.

Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 73
6 Protocol No. 
  
 
11.4.2  Statisti cal model, hypothesis, and method of  analysis 
Changes from baseline for log transformed serum GGT will be analyzed by [CONTACT_497024] (ANCOVA) with a fixed effect for the treatment, visit, 
treatment*visit interaction, log -transformed baseline as well as log(baseline)*visit interaction. 
The UDCA and pruritus stratification factor will also be included as a fixed effect in the ANCOVA model for Part [ADDRESS_638917]. The model will be fitted using SAS Proc Mixed and the restricted maximum likelihood scoring method (reml). Two -sided 90% confidence intervals 
for the difference between each LJN452 dose and placebo will be evaluated for each visit. This will then be “back -transformed” to the original scale to give a fold change from baseline. 
Dose response may be assessed using appropriate contrasts. The analysis at the [ADDRESS_638918] dose reduction measurements as 
missing will be performed as well.  
 
11.4.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
All missing GGT values will be considered missing at random. No imputation or adjustment to the primary analysis will be  done. 
 
11.4.4  Supportive  analyses 
If it turns out that the primary analysis cannot be fitted because data cannot support  a 
saturated model, a  simpler covariance matrix such as the compound symmetric covariance 
structure may be fitted.  
 
11.5 Analysis of secondary  variables  
11.5.1  Efficacy /  Pharmacodynamics 
The secondary efficacy/PD variables are the PBC -[ADDRESS_638919] for 
change from baseline in total PBC score and itch subdomain score at each visit. A two- sided 
p-value for a  treatment  difference  will  be  reported  with  no  adjustment  for  multiplicity. 
In addition, summary statistics (mean median std min max) will be reported at each applicable time point.  

[COMPANY_001]

As an additional secondary end point, a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used to 
assess the severity of patients itch as well as loss of sleep. The score (distance from left) on 
the VAS will be recorded for both parameters by [CONTACT_497018] a line. The distance marked will be converted to a score between [ADDRESS_638920] for treatment, visit, and treat ment by [CONTACT_497025]. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used 90% two- sided confidence intervals for the difference between each LJN452 dose and 
placebo will be presented. The UDCA and pruritus stratification factor will also be included as a fixed effect in the model for Part [ADDRESS_638921] ALP<1.67xULN with > 15% reduction from baseline and a normal total bilirubin level will be tabulated by [CONTACT_14455], treatment and visit.

11.5.3  Pharmacokinetics  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic parameters  
For standard pharmacokinetic abbreviations and definitions see the list provided at the 
beginning of this protocol. 
All subjects with at least one period of evaluable pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter data will be 
included in the pharmacokinetic data analysis. 
In Part 1, the pharmacokinetic parameters include (but are not limited to) AUC, Cmax, Tmax 
for LJN452.  
Plasma concentrations will be expressed in ng/mL. All concentrations below the limit of quantification or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data listings. Concentrations below the Limit of Quantification will be treated as zero in summary statistics for concentration data only. They will not be considered for calculation of PK parameters (with the exception of the pre-dose samples).  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined using the actual recorded sampling times and non-compartmental method(s) with Phoenix (Version 6.2 or higher). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical methods for pharmacokinetic  analyses 
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters will include mean, SD, and CV, min and max. When a geometric mean will be presented it will be stated as such. Since Tmax is generally evaluated by a nonparametric method, median values and ranges will b e given for 
this parameter.  
At day 1 and Day 28, AUC and Cmax will be summarized for each cohort along with 90% two-sided confidence intervals computed on the log -scale and back -transformed. All subjects 
with available PK parameters and no protocol deviation excluding them from the PK analysis set will be part of this computation.  
If 3 or more cohorts are included in part 1 of the study, then dose -proportionality will be 
explored for PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) by [CONTACT_6486] a power model (PK parameter = α  
dose 
β). A natural logarithmic transformation will be applied for the power model, which 
implies to a general linear model to the log transformed PK parameter with a fixed continuous 
log-dose effect. The model becomes  log  (PK  parameter)  =  log(α)  +  β  log(Dose)  +  ε.  
The estimate of the common slope β, which is the exponent in the power model, and the 90% confidence interval of the exponent will be obtained. Dose proportionality will be considered if 
the 90% confidence interval for β is completely contained within the pre-specified critical region 
(bL, bU).

point. Descriptive summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/sampling time 
point. Additionally summary statistics may also be provided for the LJN452 plasma concentration data with a breakdown by [CONTACT_497026]. 
Summary statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD, CV (arithmetic and 
geometr ic), median, minimum and maximum. An exception to this is Tmax where median, 
minimum and maximum will be presented. Concentrations below LLOQ will be treated as zero in summary statistics and for PK parameter calculations. A geometric mean will not be reported if the dataset includes zero values. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated as 
described in Section 8.[ADDRESS_638924].  
 
11.5.4  Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic interactions  
The relationship between PK and key primary and/or secondary PD parameters will be explored.

11.6 Sample size calculation 
A recently published study of a compound with similar mechanism ( Maso n et al 2010b;  
Hirschfield et al 2015) on a similar population (study of INT -474 in combination with UDCA 
in patients with PBC) suggests that the treatment difference over placebo at Day 28 is 
approximately -50% with a standard deviation ~ 0.28. In Part 1, with 12 patients per cohort 
randomized to LJN452 or placebo with a randomization ratio of 2:1, there is approximately 85% probability that the upper limit of a 90% two- sided confidence interval of treatment 
difference between LJN452 versus placebo will exclude 0, if the underlying treatment difference is about - 50% in terms of percent change from baseline. A total of up to 5 cohorts 
of LJN452 at different dose levels may be studied. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, [ADDRESS_638925] 30 (up to 75) patients.  
Part 2 of the study will be conducted on patients currently taking UDCA and UDCA naïve patients. A published study ( Jones et al 2011) (study of INT -474 as monotherapy in patients 
with PBC) suggests that the effect size of change from baseline in GGT is bigger in naïve patients than in the non- responder population studied in Part 1. So, we can assume a treatment 
effect of at l east 50% as well as a standard deviation of 0.28. Based on power calculation for 
Part 1, enrolling at least [ADDRESS_638926] 95% power that a two -sided si gnificance test 
at nominal level 5% will detect a difference (same analysis as in Part 1). A total of 80 patients are planned to be randomized to LJN452 or placebo with a 3:3:2 ratio (Dose Level 1:Dose Level 2:Placebo). Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 10%, 88 patients will be enrolled in Part  2. 
 
11.7 Power for analysis of key secondary variables 
Data from 30 patients receiving each LJN452 dose and 20 patients receiving placebo in Part 2 will provide 81% power to detect a 15% treatment difference in change from baseline ALP between an LJN452 dose and placebo, based on a 2- sided t -test at the 0.[ADDRESS_638927] deviation of 17.8%, obtained from the interim analysis of the first [ADDRESS_638928] in Parts 1 and 2 of the study.  
Planned interim analyses will be performed in Part 1; a) when at least [ADDRESS_638929] dose assessments; b) when the same time point is reached for at least [ADDRESS_638930] the size of the next cohort. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Amended Protocol Ve rsion v06 (Clean)  Confidential  Page 78
6 Protocol No. 
  
 
In the subsequent interim analyses in Part 1, placebo data from all cohorts will be pooled in 
the ANCOVA model to evaluate the treatment difference between each dose level of LJN452 
versus placebo. The model described in the primary analysis section will be fitted, as it is indeed the same analysis which will be included in the final study  report. 
Unblinded interim analysis results from Part 1 will be reviewed by [CONTACT_497027]. The Interim Analysis Team may communicate interim r esults to relevant [COMPANY_001] teams for information, consulting 
and/or decision purposes. The composition of the interim analysis team will be decided before the FPFV and a roster of membership maintained in the trial master  file. 
The Interim Analysis Team may communicate interim results (e.g., evaluation of PoC criteria or information needed for planning/modifying another study) to relevant [COMPANY_001] teams for information, consulting and/or decision purposes. 
No further disseminatio n of interim results based on un- locked data should occur, in particular 
not with individuals involved in treating the study’s  subjects  or  assessing  clinical  data  
(e.g., ECGs, images, symptoms) obtained in the study.  
In Part [ADDRESS_638931] 
completed their Week 8 visit. The purpose of this interim analysis is to review the sample size (calculated based on GGT and ALP changes) to assess if it is also adequate to provide precise enough  t reatment  difference  estimates  in  itch  parameters,  a  key  tolerability  endpoint.   
A blinded sample size re -estimation will be performed and a proposal to increase the sample 
size submitted to the DMC as needed. The DMC will decide whether it is appropriate to increase the sample based on an unblinded interim analysis, which will be performed by a study independent statistician and programmer with outputs provided to the DMC only. Recruitment will continue while the IA is being  performed.  
 
11.9 Interim analyses on locked  data 
This study will utilize a staggered lock of the clinical database, so that the data can be locked after completion of Part 1, or a set of Cohorts in Part 1. 
Once a Cohort’s data has been locked, treatment codes for the relevant cohort (s) will be 
released and made available for data analysis.  
The results from the locked interim analysis can be communicated beyond [COMPANY_001] to groups 
including, but not limited to individuals treating the study’s subjects, Health Authorities and on clinica l registries.

Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 [ADDRESS_1237119] that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate 
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  1.1 Title 
Comparison of Bleeding Risk Between Rivaroxaban and Api[INVESTIGATOR_675218] (COBRRA)  
 1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the incidence  of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events among subjects recently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884257]. 
 1.[ADDRESS_1237120] confirmed, adjudicated occurrence of a major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event  through 90 days of anticoagulation treatment. 
 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
The hazard ratio for the clinical trial is unknown because the tr ial is still ongoing. Based upon a recent meta-analysis 
comparing the safety of api[INVESTIGATOR_884258] a real-world evidence context , power was calculated using  an array of 
effect sizes (Aryal et al. 2019). 
 
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding  
o Adjudicated major bleeding events 
o Adjudicated clinically  relevant non-major bleeding events 
o Recurrent VTE  
o All-cause mortality 
 
1.6 Trial estimate  
The trial is ongoing and scheduled to complete in June of 2023.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposur e of interest is defined by a prescription drug claim indicating api[INVESTIGATOR_728413]. New i nitiation will be 
defined by [CONTACT_728433][INVESTIGATOR_728414] 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period) and fulfillment of study 
eligibility criteria.   Comparator agent: 
The comparator is defined by a prescription drug claim indicating rivaroxaban dispensation. New initiation will be defined by [CONTACT_884289] 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period) and fulfillment of study eligibility criteria. 
 6.2 Preliminary Covariates: 
• Age 
• Gender  
• CCI score  
 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 6 The covariate listed above represents only a small subset of the covariate vector that will ultimately be controlled for in the 
design and analysis. We use the covariate s above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be 
sufficient overlap between treatment gr oups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study 
has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B).  
 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1237124] (definitions provided in Appendix):  
§ Primary outcome: Major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 3 months of treatment with 
api[INVESTIGATOR_470953].  
§ Secondary outcomes:  
o To assess the frequency of major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding individually  
o To assess extracranial and intracranial major bleeding events separately  
o To assess recurrent VTE 
o All-cause mortality 
 
6.3.2  Study follow -up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on day of cohort entry. The as-treated  will be the primary analysis. An allowable gap of 10 days between records indicating  each treatment will 
qualify as “ continuous therapy ” with respect to follow -up in the as-treated analysis.  
The follow-up will start the  day after drug initiation (i.e., cohort entry date), and will continue until the earliest date of the following 
events:  
• The first occurrence of the outc ome of interest 
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database  
• End of the study period at 90 days 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 7 • Measured death event occurs 
• Switch  
• Discontinuation (10-day allowable grace period and risk window) 
• Nursing home admission 
• Initiation of another DOAC (dabigatran or edoxaban) or warfarin  
 
In the secondary ITT analysis, we will not censor for discontinuation or switching among study drugs

• If final feasibility and power analyses are reviewed and approved, proceed to the remaining protocol steps. 
• All study team and advisory board members that review this protocol should at this stage provide their level of confidence fo r the 
success of the RWD study in the Google Form. This form also provides space for reviewers to list any concerns that they feel may  
contribute to a failure to replicate the findings of the RC T, including differences in study populations, poor measurement of study

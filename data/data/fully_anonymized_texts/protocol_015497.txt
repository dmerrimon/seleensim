 PROTOCOL  
 
Protocol No./ Title:  Prospective study investigating the optimal duration of indwelling 
urinary catheter following infraperitoneal colorectal surgery and role of 
postoperative alpha -blockad e 
Study Rationale  The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a postoperative pelvic 
colorectal patient can safely have an indwelling catheter removed on 
postoperative day one  with the addition of a study medication , without a 
statistically significa nt difference in the incidence of urinary retention 
compared to the standard, accepted approach of delayed removal.  
Study Population:  Determine the incidence of retention of two groups. A control group of 
72 hours catheterization (Group 1) to 24 hours cat heterization  plus 
medication  (Group 2) to potentially reduce retention.  
 
Data Description :    Non-inferiority study  
pA=0.15 , pB=0.15,  d=0.1 5 (tolerance).  
We would like to test  1) If Group 2 is non -inferior to Group 1 (2 is not 
worse than 1). 
 
Power Analys is and Sample Size Calculation:  
 
A sample size for 80% power is [ADDRESS_1265203] significance level,  
a (one-sided)    0.[ADDRESS_1265204] expected proportion, pT 0.150  
Expected difference, pT - pS, D1 0.000  
Power (%)      [ADDRESS_1265205] infections, and experience 
improvement in quality of life measures.   
Study Design:  Single -center,  randomized, prospective study.  Patients in the 24-hour 
catheter removal group  will be given  1 mg prazosin  orally (per os) . The 
pharmacy will be responsible for the distribution of the me dication  
when indicated.   The study drug will be given 6 hours prio r to catheter 
removal in Group 2 patients.  
  
Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint:  Acute urinary retention (Re -catheterization)  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  1.  Urinary tract infection (>105 CFU/mL with  symptoms)  
2.  Cardiopulmonary complications  
3.  Surgical site infections  
4.  Anastomotic leaks  
5.  Quality of life  
6.  Length of postoperative stay  
7.  Volume of retained urine if re -catheterized (Bladder Scan)  
8.  Adverse side effects from treatment drug  
Safety Endpoints:  Receiving care patient would have otherwise received.  
Sample size:  With a sample size of [ADDRESS_1265206] 80% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference between acute urinary retention in patients with urinary 
catheter removal 24 hours posto peratively compared to 72 hours 
postoperatively.  
Interim Analysis  There will  be an interim analysis after 71  patients enrolled (half the 
study group)

Regimen/ Duration:  Patients will be assigned into one of three groups:  
Group 1-  removal of urinary catheter 72 hours postoperatively 
(Control)  
Group 2 – randomized to receive prazosin  6 hours prior to catheter 
removal  and removal of urinary cathet er 24 hours postoperatively  
Treatment Failure/

other event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_902025].

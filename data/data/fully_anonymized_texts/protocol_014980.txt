 B. BACKGROUND  
B.1. Unrecognized CI is common, especially among older adults with chronic medical illness.  Cognitive 
impairment that does not meet the threshold of dementia affects approximately 22% of the adults older than 
70, in the [LOCATION_002].8 The diagnosis of cognitive impairment is often missed in primary care clinics.9,10 This 
may be due, in part, to the high prevalence of co -existing medical conditions that compete for a provider’s time 
and attention. Among VA primary care users >= 65, who have lower health status and higher comorbidity 
compared to age -matched counterparts who don’t receive VA care, 42.5% of primary care users >= [ADDRESS_1107313] previously unrecogniz ed cognitive impairment (total n=630; n=21 with dementia, n=247 with 
cognitive impairment, no dementia [ CIND ]).2 In a recent study of Veterans with heart failure , a prevalent 
condition associated with high self -care needs, the prevalence of unrecognized CI was 58%.[ADDRESS_1107314] functional impairments; in a national sample, 45% of individuals with CI were found to have one or more 
impairments in an instrumental activity of daily li ving.1 Moreover, patients with CI develop dementia at a greater 
rate than those with normal cognition .8  Dementia is well -known to be associated with higher health care costs 
and increased severity of co -morbid illnesses and potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].14 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802274]; they also constitute a significant burden on patients and families. A large proportion of chronic 
illness care relies on principles of self -management  and patients with CI likely need increased support in order 
to comply with complicated medication and care regimens, and avoid subsequent unnecessary emergency 
department (ED) and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399].  
B.3. Unmet needs and opportunities for intervention.  
B.3.a. Poorly coordinated care . Patients with medical complexity and CI receive care that often is fragmented, 
inefficient, and ineffective.  For example, the risk of potentially avoidable inpatient admissions or preventable 
complications in an inpatient setting i ncreases dramatically with the number of chronic conditions among older 
adults.15 People with multiple chronic conditions  (MCC)  are seen by [CONTACT_802292] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], EDs, outpatient and specialty clinics, nursing  homes, home health care 
providers).The need to receive, process, and integrate information from multiple settings and providers is 
especially difficult for patients with CI. Thus, care coordination , which recognizes the diversity of the full 
spectrum of d isease burden in older adults, rather than trying to manage each condition in isolation, is an 
essential component of improving care in this population.16 Care coordination directly addresses medical 
complexity through reducing workload burden.4 
B.3.b. Risk of progression to dementia . CI progresses to dementia at an annual rate of 12%.8  Thus, protecting 
cognitive health is an essential goal in this population. The Institute of Medicine recently endorsed three 
evidence -based strategies for promoting cognitive health: 1) increasing physical activity; 2) reducing 
cardiovascular risk factors includi ng hypertension, diabetes, and smoking; and 3) managing medications and 
health conditions that could affect cognition.6 Interventions to promote cognitive health directly address 
complexity through enhancing capacity.3 
B.3.c. New care models need to be integrated with primary -care and scalable . Given the increasing number of 
affected individuals, specialized medical homes for complex -needs patients in commun ities throughout the 
U.S. are not likely to be feasible.17 In VA, the majority of patients with MCC are cared for in traditional PACTs; 
thus it is essential to develop c are models t hat are integrated with primary care. The geographic dispersion of 
Veterans receiving care throughout VHA makes it imperative to develop care models beyond traditional face –
to-face encounters.  
B.4. Previous studies of interventions for patient s with medical complexity and CI. A recent review 
highlighted the fact that few dementia care management programs have targeted patients with mild cognitive 
deficits; the majority of interventions have focused on caregivers and none specified reducing hosp italizations 
as a primary aim, although reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802275] 20 20.18  
3 
         Version AMD7 IRB Approved  10.5.17 B.4.a. Rising rates of internet use and video visits with older adults . Among older adults who use the interne t, 
71% go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% go online three to five times per week. 
These older internet users also have strongly positive attitudes about the benefits of online information in their 
personal lives. Rates of intern et use among older adults are rising rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], at an annual rate of 6 -10% per 
year.19 A 2013 study compared video visits to in -person visits in patients with Parkinson’s disease (mean age 
67, 22% female) and found them to be feasible (93% completed as scheduled) with no difference in clinical 
outcomes between the groups.[ADDRESS_1107315] the opportunity to assess a patient’s 
environment, thereby [CONTACT_802293], and are currently used to provide clinical care 
for geriatric populations within VA , such as Home Based Primary Care.  
Key conclusions from evidence review   
 1. CI is prevalent and often unrecognized among medically complex patients.  
 2. There is a need for new interventions aimed at reducing acute care utilization among patients with CI.  
3. Increasing numbers of older adults use the internet and are open to technology -enhanced interventions.  
4. There is some evidence supporting the feasibility of video visits in older adults; but it is uncertain 
whether video visits offer advan tages over telephone -based care  management in this population . 
B.5. Conceptual Framework. The 
conceptual model by [CONTACT_802294] 
(illustrated in Figure 1).3 Patients with 
chronic conditions face many treatment 
demands, including managing 
appointments and advice from multiple 
treating providers, following medication 
schedules, self -monitoring their condition, 
and practici ng proactive health 
behaviors. These constitute a patient’s 
workload . Other demands/factors  that 
may limit capacity  include financial 
concerns, access (transportation) problems , low health literacy, lack of social support, and prevalence of 
mental health disorders like depression and CI.4  We will target patients with high cumulative complexity 
by [CONTACT_802295] ( CAN ) scores and identifying those with 
the addi tional, significant capacity -limiting factor of CI.  Our intervention  will focus on both pathways that 
interact to lead to poor health outcomes: healthcare workload demands, and factors that limit patient capacity.  
Consistent with the model’s emphasis on so cial support as an essential factor in overall complexity, we  will 
engage and incorporate a Care P artner (friend, family member, or caregiver) as a critical member of the patient 
care team.  
B.6. Alignment with VA Goals and Objectives . The study directly addresses a major priority for VHA as 
outlined in the VHA Blueprint for Excellence, Transformational Action 1.2. a. Enhance Coordination -of-Care and 
the use of Patient -Aligned Care Teams (PACT) for Veterans with the Most Complex Care -Needs and 
Transformational Action 3.2.d. Proactively identify individual patients at risk for undesirable outcomes such as 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or preventable medical complications and identify specific interventions that are most 
likely to reduce risk .[ADDRESS_1107316]. Hastings leads Discharge Information an d Support for Patients Receiving Outpatient Care in  the

VAMC’s primary care clinics (N=5 88) that

broad experience delivering nurse -led 
interventions, including recruiting and enrolling dyads of medically complex Veteran patients.  
B.7.b Estimates of cognitive impairment in patients with multiple chronic conditions ( MCC ). In order to collect 
preliminary data for the current proposal, we administered the Telephone  Interview of C ognitive Status, 
modified version ( TICS -m) to 3 5 participants in DISPO ED, a clinical trial that enrolls patients with a history of 
high health care utilization and MCC .21 Figure 2 displays TICS -m score, according to age. Overall 3 4% of 
respondents  scored in the rang e of 20 -29, suggestive of mild CI .23

[CONTACT_220712]’ DISPO ED study and [CONTACT_68857]’s HI -FIVES study we examined prevalence and 
characteristics of internet use, and attitudes about new technology in Veterans and  caregivers aged 65 and 
over (n = 59; see Table 1 ).  We found that 58-75% of Veterans and caregivers aged [ADDRESS_1107319] year, and both groups indicated a high level of comfort with it (mean 4.2 on 5-point scale).  A 
key findi ng was that Veterans ages 65 and over indicated high levels of willingness to communicate with a 
health team using videoconferencing software on a cellphone, tablet or laptop (mean 4. 3 on 5-point  scale).

C. SIGNIFICANCE  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_802279], 
acceptability and 
usability of a novel care management program for a large and vulnerable group of Veterans, who are high 
utilizers of the health care system and at risk for adverse health outcomes. In 2012, over 52% of t he 6.2 million 
Veterans receiving primary care in VA were age 65 years or older; thus, if proven effective, the care 
management program for medically complex Veterans with CI could have a direct impact on the way care is 
delivered to a large number of Vete rans.  This study  is extremely timely timely and innovative in its use  of a 
population -based screening approach  to identify  patients for a multi -faceted, non -disease based  intervention, 
and its exploration of video visits in patients with CI and a self -iden tified Care Partner. D. APPROACH  
D.1. Overview of Study Design . We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_441165] a 12-week  video -enhanced nurse care 
management program for medically complex older Veterans with CI, delivered via telephone or through video 
visits. This study  will test a 12 -week intervention; in a larger RCT, we plan to continue the intervention for 12 -
months. Veterans aged 65 or older with Care Assessment Need ( CAN ) scores >= 75will be contact[CONTACT_802297] -m. Respondents with scores in the range of 20 -29 (predictive of cognitive 
deficits in the mild range)23 will be invited to participate in the study. Following informed consent and baseline 
data collection, participan ts will be randomized (1:1) to receive the intervention via telephone  or through video 
visits on iPads.  The program will consist of monthly telephone or video calls enabled by [CONTACT_802298] (version 12.2)  on iPads,  with the goal of providi ng structured information and support in two key 
areas: (1) care coordination  (reduce workload) and (2) protecting cognitive health  (build capacity) .All subjects 
will participate in an  outcome assessment call at week [ADDRESS_1107320] qualitative interviews with participants and their care partners after the 
14 week assessment. The se calls will be recorded and transcribed .  At the beginning of each call, study staff 
will capture ea ch patient’s and care partner’s assent to record the phone call.  Study flow is illustrated in Figure 
3. The study will enroll 40 dyads (Veteran participants and Care Partners).   
 
 
D.2 Participant eligibility criteria.  
D.2.a. Inclusion Criteria (Veteran) . To be included in the study, patients must meet all of the following:  
1. Receive primary care from a Durham VAMC affiliated primary care clinic ( ≥ 1 visit within the previous 
12 months)  
2. Age > 65

         Version AMD7 IRB Approved  10.5.17 D.2.b. Rationale for targeting patients age ≥[ADDRESS_1107322] to identify a 
medically complex population. The CAN score  (v. 2.0)  is derived using predictive analytics from 36 input 
variables  captured from various Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) domains.24 CAN scores provide an 
estimated probability of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802280] a specific time frame (either 90 days or 1 year). The 
score is expressed as a percentile and is reflective of how a given p atient compares with other VA patients in 
terms of probability of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]. For this study, we will use the model calibrated for predicting 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 1 year, and focus on Veterans with CAN score of >75.We target individuals 65 and older 
due to higher prevalence of CI in this population.  
D.2.c. Cognitive Screening Procedures . The TICS -m (9-11 min administration time) is a 50-point global 
cognitive screening tool  that has been well -validated for use in multiple populations and was  specifically 
designed for use over the telephone (i.e. no visually mediated items). TICS -m scores in elderly populations 
have been shown to be normally distributed and without evidence of a ceiling effect which limits the ability of 
other instruments to d etect early CI.[ADDRESS_1107323] for telephone -based 
detection of cognitive impairment.26,23 Participants w ith score between 20 and 31 (education -adjusted)  will be 
eligible for the study, because scores in this range have been shown to correlate with cognitive impairment in 
the mild range23 and to differentiate normal from impaired individuals when adjustment for education level is included . 
The small number of p atients who scored in the 30-[ADDRESS_1107324] 
months of study enrollment (original TICS criteria range = 20 -29) will be re -contact[CONTACT_802299] . The VHA “Screening for  Cognitive Impairment” directive  does not recommend screening for 
cognitive impairment in asymptomatic older adults . The directive also states c linicians should be alert to early 
signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment and evaluate as appropriate.  Therefore, a t each nurse encounter , 
participants will have a note entered into the electronic health record (CPRS) notifying the patient’s primary 
care team of any rel evant clinical issues.  If symptoms of cognitive impairment are noted by [CONTACT_802300].   
D.2.d. Exclusion criteria  (Veteran).   Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following:  
1. CI or dementia (identified via ICD diagnosis codes or PCP note in previous 2 years)  
2. Enrolled in  or have an active consult for  a special population PACT (e.g. GeriPACT, Home Based 
Primary Care, Mental Health, Post -Deployment, etc.)  
3. Are enrolled in a study that prohibits  participation in another study  
4. Serious mental illness defined as diagnosis of psychosis of any type , schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129339] y ear or current high -risk suicide flag in their CPRS medical 
record  
5. Are currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802281]  
6. Active substance abuse , documented in the medical record within the previous year  
7. Eligible for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], palliative care, or prognosis of less than [ADDRESS_1107325]  
9. Referred to institutional care or residing in nursing home  
10. Unable to communicate on the telephone, or no telep hone access for duration of study  
11. Care Partner fails six -item screener or has no access to phone, and no other Care Partner available  
At the clinical discretion of the study physician (PI), subjects may be enrolled in the study with an exclusion criteria if the 
clinical criteria (#1, 4, 7) is determined not to affect eligibility (for example, a previous dementia diagnosis in a patient 
whose clinical record notes do not indicate evidence of dementia).  
D.2.e. Care Partners . The Veteran participant will ident ify their Care Partner of choice. Care Partners must be 
aged 18 or older, able and willing to provide informed consent for study participation  (must score 5 or higher on 
a brief and reliable 6 -item cognitive screen),26 and able to communicate by [CONTACT_756].  In order to serve as the 
Veteran’s Care Partner, an individual must be willing to join the Veteran for telephone or video calls and 
participate in outcome assessment calls. We propose to enroll dyads for three key reasons.  First, the study 
focuses on old er Veterans with CI ; the participation of a partner can help the Veterans to understand and 
implement care recommendations, as well as access the technology required for video visits. Second, in our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], many Veterans expressed to us that their u sual and preferred manner of receiving health 
information is through a spouse or adult child.[ADDRESS_1107326] been eligible for this study in March, 2015 
based on age, CAN score  >=90 , and no pre -existing diagnosis of dementia is listed in Figure 4. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_611006], we examined the prevalence of other eligibility criteria and found that 1.3% did not have a valid 
telephone number, 1.7% were nursing home residents, and 1.9% were unable to talk on the telephone. 
Therefore, taking additional exclusions into account and antic ipating 34 -40% will score between [ADDRESS_1107327] a CAN score > 75, they may seek additional 
medical care for events related to their diseases (and care may involve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).  They may also 
experience seasonal health issues such as flu or allergies.  It is also anticipated that during study participation, 
they may se ek medical assistance to recover from accidents or planned surgical procedures.  
 
D.3. Enrollment Procedures . Using an automated data pull, study staff will first identify the pati ents who meet 
criteria for age and  CAN score  and apply exclusion criteria based on 
clinic stop and diagnosis codes available in CDW. Study staff will 
then conduct  a brief medical record review to check for exclusions 
that are not readily available in CDW (e.g. residential status).  During 
the medical record review study staff will determine if the patient has 
“decision -making capacity” by [CONTACT_802301] “capacity”.  The patient will be considered 
initially eligible if study staff finds that the p atient has decision -
making notated in the medical record.  The patient will not be initially 
eligible if the term or similar term  “lack of decision -making capacity”  
is found in the record. If term “capacity” is  not found, study staff will 
assume decision -making capacity is intact. Of those  eligible, we will 
mail introductory recruitment letters  signed by [CONTACT_978] (see Sample 
Letter; Appendix).  Patients will be provided a toll -free number to 
contact [CONTACT_220669].   Starting about one week after mailing recruitment letters, a 
member of the study staff will call patients to ascertain eligibility and  obtain  informed consent  from the Veteran 
participant and Care Partner. During the phone screen process, study staff may use their discre tion with the in -
put of the Care partners to further determine whether the patient’s decision -making capacity is intact. For the 
Care Partner, t he Six Item Screener (SIS), a cognitive assessment instrum ent, will be administered by  [CONTACT_802302] .  If there is any question as to whether or not a potential adult subject 
has decision -making capacity , study staff  will consult with a qualified practitioner (i.e., the study physician or 
study RN) about the individual’s decision -making capacity before proceeding with the informed consent 
process.  Because the screening and enrollment  is entirely telephone based, we will seek a waiver of 
documentation of informed consent, as approved by [CONTACT_802303] .   
  Figure 4.  Study Recruitment Pool  
D.3.g. Rationale for Enrollment and Screening over the Telephone . We have opted not to enroll Veterans at a 
primary care visit or other in -person visit for a number of reasons. First  a telephone -based strategy expands 
the reach of the intervention by [CONTACT_802304] -based outpatient care clinics  and 
not just the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132265]. Most importantly this strategy mimics more closely how this intervention w ould 
be implemented if effective. We will track number of attempts to contact, and examine differences between 
patients who enrolled or refused and those we were unable to contact [CONTACT_220672].   
D.3.h. Randomization Procedure . Once patients and Care Partners have provided verbal consent and 
completed the baseline measurement battery, study staff  will randomize the Veteran to Telephone -Based Care 
Management  (Section D.4) or Video -Enhanced Care Management (Section D.5).  Randomizati on assignments 
will be performed by [CONTACT_802305].   We will stratify randomization based on whether or not patients are ‘experienced with 
relevant technology’. Parti cipants will be considered ‘experienced with relevant technology’ if they indicate use

D.4. Arm 1: Telephone -Based Care Management Intervention. The core components of the intervention 
(delivered to both arms) are listed in Table 2. Based on a strong concep tual framework,12 the care 
management program features monthly calls to deliver information related to improving care coordination28 
(e.g. assistance with medication and appointment management) and protecting cognitive health13 (e.g. 
promoting physical act ivity and smoking cessation). Consistent with the literature on the most effective care 
coordination models, the study nurse will also accompany patients to one PCP visit (for those who have one 
scheduled during the study period), and provide additional ca lls and support after any ED visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021].  For patients randomized to Arm 1: Telephone -Based Care  Management Intervention  all study 
contacts (excepting the PCP visit) will occur over the telephone.  
 
 
D.4.a. Structure  and timing of nurse contacts . Scheduled calls with the study nurse will begin 2 weeks after 
randomization (to reflect the time needed for the Pexip  test call, Section D.5.a ), and occur every 4 weeks 
thereafter. Beyond having a more sustained intervention period, we anticipate that more frequent contacts may 
be beneficial; however, in this feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_802282] a total of [ADDRESS_1107328] -study completion (Section 
D.6.b ). The Care Partner will be encouraged to participate in all calls. Also as noted in Table 2, the nurse will 
make additional telephon e calls to patients as needed for acute events (e.g. ED visits), and will accompany the 
patient to a PCP visit, for those patients who have one scheduled during the intervention period.

guiding principles for the intervention content (Table 2), other potential topi[INVESTIGATOR_802285], blood 
pressure manageme nt, diabetes care, informal care support programs,  sleep patterns,  and falls prevention.  
Following each  telephone or video visit, the  study nurse will enter a note in CPRS  documenting the 
information reviewed and referrals made. All notes will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_802286]’ PCP and PACT Nurse . 
Following procedures in use in DISPO ED, the study nurse will enter unsigned orders, if needed, for the PCP 
to review and accept (sign).   Examples include orders for exercise program referrals. This approach has been 
used successfully with very high uptake of recommendations (93%) in a previous VA study.29  
The study nurse will use software already developed for previous  Durham HSR&D Center of Innovation  
(COIN) studies including  DISPO ED, to guide content delivery during calls, including scrip ts and questions for 
patients. This software adheres to current VA information security standards, and will be linked with a secure 
SQL Server database, fo llowing procedures developed by [CONTACT_802309]. Patients are offered printed and mailed information about the topi[INVESTIGATOR_802287], including how to reach the study nurse for additional questio ns or issues. Each call will end with open -
ended questions, allowing Veterans to describe additional  needs that were not addressed.  In order to 
understand staff time needed for the full intervention, we will carefully track interventionist time spent on ca lls 
(including attempted and incomplete calls), reviewing medical records, and documenting and making referrals.  
D.5. Arm 2: Video -Enhanced  Care Management Intervention . Patients randomized to Arm 2: Video -
Enhanced Care Management Intervention  will receive  the same number of contacts  delivered on the same 
schedule and focused on the same key components as the telephone -based program. The primary difference 
in the video -enhanced intervention is that the nurse will communicate with the patient and Care Partne r using 
video visits  in secure Virtual Meeting Rooms , facilitated through  the Pexip Infinity applications (version 12.2) ) 
on iPads . We will use tablets (instead of desktop or laptop computers) so that participants can move them 
around easily if needed to f acilitate observation of the Veteran or some aspect of their home environment; iPad 
is a tablet approved for use with the Pexip In finity application (version 12.2) . Table [ADDRESS_1107330] access to an iPad will be loaned one for use during the study. All participants 
will be provided with detailed instructions  for installing the Pexip Infinity application (version 12.2)  application or 
have the application pre-installed on their device ) and will have access to IT support over the telephone or in-
person at the Durham VA with a study staff member and the facility te lehealth coordinator if needed. 
Consistent with current clinical policy for video visits , study staff will collect participant emails addresses to 
send an encrypted email to facility telehealth team for scheduling purposes. Emails addresses will not be 
stored in VA research databases. Research staff will not directly send or receive any emails to patients.  All 
patients will participate in a test call with facility telehealth staff before scheduling their first study nurse  call. We 
allot [ADDRESS_1107331] call.  If the patient 
cannot complete the Pexip Infinity application (version 12.2)  installation within this 2 -week time frame (for any 
reason), the intervent ion will continue using telephone calls only. All patients in the Video -Enhanced Care 
Management Program (Arm 2) will be provided with an iPad  cover with built-in stand and keyboard to make 
logging into Pexip  easier and quality of video interaction better.  
D.5.b. Technology solutio n for video calls . We have selected the Pexip Infinity application (version 12.2) for the 
video calls for several key reasons: 1) this technology meets all VA security standards and is currently in use 
10 
         Version AMD7 IRB Approved  10.5.17 for in -home video telehealth  encounters throughout VHA (FaceTime, Skype, etc. are not approved for use by 
[CONTACT_802310]); 2) facility telehealth coordinators can provid e ongoing IT support (see Telehealth Coordinator 
letter of support); and 3) use of a tablet (iPad) enables mobility of the device to expand the applications of the 
video link to viewing aspects of the users home environment.  
D.6. Measures and Data Sources  
D.6.a. System Usability Scale . We will use the  simplified language version of the System  Usability Scale (SUS ; 
see Appendix ) to measure usability of video visits via iPad. The SUS is a widely -used, simple but reliable 
method to evaluate the usability of new technologies.30 The SUS is well-validated and consists of 10 Likert -
scaled items with scores ranging from 0 to 100.31  
D.6.b. Participant and study staff feedback . Patients  and C are Partners will participate in semi -structured 
interviews regarding perceived benefit s and challenges of the care management program.   Interviewer scripts 
will include open -ended questions about barriers and facilitators of success in the program, including 
technology -related, and as we ll as more specific questions to elicit stakeholder perspectives on intervention 
content, and recommendations for improvement  (see Evaluation Table; Appendix) . We will also seek feedback 
from primary care providers and study staff.  
D.6.c. Measures of inter vention effectiveness . In preparation for a future RCT, we will collect outcome 
measures we anticipate using to test intervention effectiveness. Patient reported outcomes will be examined at 
baseline and the 14 -week follow -up call  (immediately following co mpletion of the 12 -week intervention period 
that begins at week 2; Figure 3) . Consistent with our conceptual framework, the balance of workload demands 
and capacity directly affect utilization and outcomes; thus we plan to focus on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED vis its, and 
patient -reported outcomes recommended for use in patients with MCC ,16 that may be responsive to the 
intervention.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210364] . To calculate this outcome, we add the total number of days a patient is 
in the emergency department (ED), or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In order to avoid doub le-counting events, we only count ED 
visits as a discrete day if the ED visit did not lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. We include observation stays as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598]. Data from the outpatient and inpatient files from the CDW  will be used to generate counts of 
days associated with emergency care (treat and release), observation stays, and inpatient care, over the 1 4 
week observation period. ED visits will be identified through the outpatient files according to clinic stop codes 
(130, 131, 102130 and 102131).32  Inpatient encounters will include total days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DISDAY minus 
ADMITDAY).  
PROMIS -29. The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement System 29 -item Health Profile (PROMIS -
29) has good evidence of reliabilit y and responsiveness, and is suitable for telephone administration. PROMIS  
has published its results in [ZIP_CODE]+ adults, many with MCC, and has been recommended by [CONTACT_802311], an expert panel convened by 
[CONTACT_802312] w ith Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.1611 .16 The 
tool has also undergone extensive valuation work enabling translati ng PROMIS -29 responses into quality -
adjusted life -years.33  
Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE ).  The PASE is a self -report, 12 -item scale that measures 
occupational, household, and leisure activity during a one -week period.34 This scale was developed for use 
among older adults and has been validated for use via telephone.  
Medical Outcomes Study: Short Form Social Support Survey Instrument.  This  8-item measure reflects 
how often a person looks to others for companionship, ass istance, or other types of support, and is well -
validated.[ADDRESS_1107332] been no studies reporting harm related to receiving a 
diagnosis of CI; however, some groups have raised concerns about this possibility. Thus we will measure 
symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ] -9) and anxiety (General Anxiety Sca le [GAD] -7) 
at baseline and the 14 week follow -up call. The PHQ -9 is a nine item depression scale that is well validated 
and documented in a variety of populations including a geriatric populations and primary care settings.36 The 
GAD -7 is a 7 -item anxiety scale with good reliability, as well as criterion, construc t, factorial, and procedural 
validity.37 We will utilize a safety protocol to address suicide risk identified during the administration of study 
measures (Appendix).  
[ADDRESS_1107333] information on patient socio -demographics, chronic medical conditions, 
self-rated health , health literacy , and sleep questions . We will review patient medical records to determine 
actions taken by [CONTACT_802313] a result of the TICS -m score progre ss note (e.g. Geriatrics, Neurology referrals, 
Neuropsychology testing, scheduling a follow -up visit, etc.) and new diagnoses of CI or dementia.  
D.7. Analyses  
D.7.a. Aim 1:  Examine the feasibility and acceptability  of a 12 -week care management program for medically 
complex Veterans with CI, delivered via telephone or through video visits . Feasibility will be examined by 
[CONTACT_802314], as well as rates of attrition, adherence  to nurse calls or 
video visits, and interview completion.  Clinical and personal characteristics associated with enrollment and 
study completion will be explored as well via contingency tables and regression analyses.   Acceptability will  be 
assessed using in -depth interviews with study participants (Veterans and Care Partners), primary care 
providers, and study staff  (Section D.6.b.) . We will conduct a  formative evaluation of the intervention in order to 
elicit information about ways to e nhance acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention in anticipation of 
testing it in a larger study.38 Collecting qualitative data from relevant stakeholders including study participants, 
PCPs and study staff, will provide additional rich context for interpreting other quantit ative study results.39 
Tasks and methods for each evaluation stage are described in the Appendix .  
D.7.b. Aim 2: Assess the usability  and perceived value  of video -enhanced care management, compared to 
telephone -based, among older Veterans with medical complexity and CI . We will administer the SUS at the 14 -
week outcome call to participants ra ndomized to Arm 2 (video -enhanced .), care partners, and clinical staff.  If 
any participants choose to withdraw from this Arm, we will administer this measure prior to withdrawal. We will 
examine overall sample mean, median, and distributions of scores acco rding to established thresholds (e.g. 
>70 = excellent usability among those aged ≥65 years).  Additionally, we will look at responses to individual 
items to see if certain items are more frequently endorsed (e.g. technical support item) to make refinements  
prior to a larger RCT. We will calculate means (or medians, as approp riate) and distributions of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits, and patient -reported outcomes (PROMIS 29, PASE , MOS Social Support , PHQ -9, 
GAD -7) across time points , as well as  changes between  baseline and [ADDRESS_1107334] statistical testing.  However, our descriptive analyses 
will allow us to evaluate whether there are clinically relevant differences in mean study outcomes between the 
two Arms (video -enhanced vs. telephone -based).  Perceived value associated with each delivery method will 
be explored through questionnaires and in -depth intervie ws with study participants and study staff.  
D.7.c. Sample size considerations .  This is an exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_802288].  While 
the sample size chosen must reflect the pragmatics of recruitment during a short enrollment per iod, we will 
have adequate sample size to provide meaningful confidence interval s for our estimates of feasibility, and 
comparisons between video and telephone delivery methods, and will have sufficient diversity of input on the 
intervention to plan refine ments, if needed, prior to testing it in a larger RCT.  
D.8. Dissemination and Implementation Plan   
The results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_802289] , acceptability, usability, and 
perceived value of a care management program for medically complex Veterans with CI, delivered via 
telephone or through video visits on iPads. By [CONTACT_802315] a large RCT, we will enhance the efficiency  and overall 
value of the subsequent trial. Specifically this pi[INVESTIGATOR_802290], and if so, whether it offers added benefits, 
compared to telephone. To examine video visits, we will use the Pexip Infinity application  which  is currently 
approved and in preliminary clinical use  in VHA , making rapid implementation highly feas ible, if proven 
effective.  
D.9. Project Management Plan  
D.9.a. Summary of Research Team Experience . The research team is comprised of investigators from the 
HSR&D COIN for Health Ser vices Research in Primary Care; the Geriatrics, Research, Education and C linical 
Center (GRECC) at the Durham VA , the Duke University Center for the Study of Human Aging and 
Development and Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. We have assembled a multidisciplinary study team 
with a track record of productive collaboration, as well as  relevant experience with all the methodology, data 
sources and analytic techniques described in the current proposal.

D.10. Data Management  
 
The Durham HSR&D CoE  adheres to VA policy and Durham VAMC IRB requirements, but has also developed 
additional Standard Operating Procedures for data security which have been designed to ensure continued 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of research data. These proc edures, which protect both paper and 
computer based records, have been used successfully in many studies, and will be followed for the proposed 
study.  
With respect to all data, these procedures mandate the following to ensure confidentiality and safe hand ling of 
all data: (1) Access to all participant data and information will be restricted to authorized personnel; (2) 
Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_169351], nor will data be presented in such a 
way that the identity of i ndividual participants can be inferred; (3) Each participant will be assigned an 
anonymous study ID which will be used on all study forms; and (4) All study personnel will maintain certification 
with the Durham VAMC IRB that they have completed training in  research ethics and confidentiality.  
With respect to paper based records, these procedures mandate the following: (1) All study records that 
contain participant information will be kept in secured locked areas when not in use; and (2) In addition, such 
materials, when in use, will be kept safe from public scrutiny. With respect to computer based records, the 
following practices are followed: (1) All research data are stored on VA -administered servers which are 
physically secured in a Durham VAMC server ro om; (2) Individual computer accounts, password protected, are 
issued to staff members; and (3) Access to computer data is granted by [CONTACT_220691]&T personnel after confirming 
appropriate documentation through the IRB, per CoE policies. Utilization data will be downl oaded directly from 
national files to the Durham HSR&D CoE servers. Of study personnel, only the study Statisticians and 
Economist will have access to these data, which will not be moved from this secured environment.  
The key linking the study ID numbers t o the patients identifying information will be stored in a password 
protected electronic database and maintained on a password protected VA server, with access only available 
to approved study staff and investigators.  The name [CONTACT_802317] m embers identified by [CONTACT_802316].

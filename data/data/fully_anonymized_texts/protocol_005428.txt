TITLE OF STUDY: A Randomized, Double -blind Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy
andSafety ofABP 710Compared toInfliximab inSubjects With Moderate toSevere
Rheumatoid Arthritis
STUDY CENTERS: Approximately 90 study centers in Euro pe, North America, and
Australia
STUDY PERIOD: A total of up to [ADDRESS_440299] hascompleted thelaststudy
assessment.PHASE OF
DEVELOPMENT:
Phase 3
PLANNED STUDY DATES: The expected enrollment duration is 10.[ADDRESS_440300] willparticipate forupto54weeks.
OBJECTIVES:
Primary Obje ctive : The primary objective for this study is to assess the efficacy of 
ABP 710compared withUS-licensed infliximab (infliximab).
Secondary Objectives : The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and
immunogenicity ofABP 710compared withinflixim ab.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: This is a randomized, double -blind, active -
controlled study inadult subjects withmoderate tosevere rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have 
an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Approximately 550 subjects (275 per
treatment group) will be enrolled. The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
either ABP 7103mg/kg infusion onday1,atweeks 2and6,andevery 8weeks thereafter
(treatment group A),orinfliximab 3mg/kg infusion on day 1, at weeks 2 and 6, andevery
8weeks thereafter (treatment group B), until week 22.
At week 22, subjects initially randomized to the infliximab group will be re -randomized in a
1:1 ratio to either continue receiving infliximab infusion every 8 weeks (treatment group B1 ), 
or to switch to ABP 710 (treatment group B2) every 8 weeks. Subjects initially randomized 
to ABP 710 (treatment group A) will continue on the same treatment. Re-randomization will 
be managed to ensure that the blind to the initial study group is maint ained.   Subjects who 
are unable to complete the week 22 visit within the visit window of ±[ADDRESS_440301] treatment for all subjects who do not discontinue early will be at week 46. 
Subjects will be considered study completers when they finish the week 50 end -of-study 
assessments. An independent data monitoring committee will evaluate the safet y data 
throughout the study.

Confidential6INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology in 
which patients exhibit systemic features such as fatigue, low -grade fever, weight loss, 
anemia, and increased systemic measures of acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte
sedimentation rates [ESRs] and C -reactive protein [CRP]; Aletaha et al, 2010 ). Although 
the disease is systemic in nature, the primary target tissues are the synovial membrane, 
cartilage, and bone ( McInnes and Schett, 2007 ), which exhibit uncontrolled 
synovium/pannus p roliferation and excess fluid production, and ultimately undergo 
progressive destructive arthropathy ( Aletaha et al, 2010; Choy and Panayi, 2001 ).
The destruction of the cartilage seen in RA, and related inflammatory diseases, is 
considered to be due to th e activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are 
produced by [CONTACT_353645] ( Feldmann M et al, 
1996 ).
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), in conjunction with interleukin (IL) -1, plays a key 
role in synovial inflammation by [CONTACT_353646] -cell adhesion 
molecules, which cause retention of lymphocytes in the affected joint ( Chin JE et al , 
1990 ). Tumor necrosis factor alpha promotes joint damage by [CONTACT_353647], particularly MMP -3 (Carrasco R et al, 2010 ), involved in the breakdown of the 
connective tissue matrix and by [CONTACT_353648] ( Shingu M et al, 1993 ). Tumor necrosis factor alpha also has a role in 
the bone damage seen in RA, by [CONTACT_353649], either directly 
through tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 or indirectly through additive effects with 
receptor activator of nuclear factor -KB ligand ( McInnes and Schett, 2007 ).
In an in vitro study conducted with synovial tissue isolated and cultured from the joints of 
patients with RA (thus containing a mixture of synovial cell types, eg, macrophages, 
Tcells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and plasma cells), blockage of TNFα diminished the 
production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin -1 beta ( IL-1β), interleukin -6 (IL-6),
and interleukin -8 (IL-8),and granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating facto r, 
suggesting that TNFα can modulate proinflammatory cytokine production within the local 
synovial environment ( Butler DM et al, 1995 ). Conversely, blocking interleukin -1 (IL-1)
activity had no effect on TNFα concentrations, indicating that IL -1 was not s olely 
involved in regulating TNFα production in RA ( Butler DM et al, 1995 ).

ConfidentialAngiogenesis and increased expression of endothelial molecules are also prominent 
features in RA, as they are in other chronic inflammatory disorders. This is manifested 
by [CONTACT_353650], facilitating cell trafficking in and out of the inflamed 
tissue ( Tracey D et al, 2008 ).
6.2 Infliximab
Remicade®(infliximab) is a chimeric human- murine monoclonal antibody that binds with 
high affinity to both soluble and transmembra ne forms of TNFα, but not to lymphotoxin α 
(REMICADE Prescribing Information ). Elevated concentrations of TNFα have been
found in the joints of patients with RA and correlate with elevated disease activity. In 
RA, treatment with infliximab reduced infilt ration of inflammatory cells into inflamed areas 
of the joint, as well as reduced expression of molecules mediating cellular adhesion,
chemo- attraction, and tissue degradation. After infliximab treatment, patients with RA 
exhibited decreased concentrations of serum IL -6 and CRP; and patients with reduced 
hemoglobin concentrations had increased hemoglobin concentrations compared with 
baseline. Peripheral blood lymphocytes showed no significant decrease in number or in 
proliferative responses to in vitro mi togenic stimulation when compared with untreated 
patients’ cells.
Infliximab, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the reduction of signs 
and symptoms of RA, as well as the improvement in physical function in adult patients 
with active disease when the response to disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including MTX, has been inadequate and in adult patients with severe,
active and progressive disease not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs 
(REMICADE Prescribing Informat ion).
6.3 Compound Review
ABP 710 is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Remicade®(infliximab) for the 
treatment of RA and other indications: Crohn’s disease (adults/pediatrics), ulcerative 
colitis (adults/pediatrics), ankylosing spondylitis (adults) , psoriatic arthritis (adults), and 
plaque psoriasis (adults). The active ingredient of ABP [ADDRESS_440335] similar binding affinity for human TNFα and comparable inhibition of

cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicit y activity in vitro. In a 
toxicology study in rats, administration of ABP 710 or inflixim ab was similarly well 
tolerated at doses of up to 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks. In the absenc e of pharmacologically 
relevant preclinical species to evaluate on-target effects in v ivo, ABP 710 and infliximab 
demonstrated a similar lack of activity in an in vitro cytokine  release assay with human 
peripheral blood leukocytes and endothelial cells. Refer to the  investigator’s brochure

analytical and pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 710 and infliximab are summarized 
briefly in more detail in the IB.
A phase 1 study of ABP 710 compared with infliximab (US) and infliximab (EU) (Study 
20140108) was conducted in 148 healthy adult men and women. Subjects received a 
single 5 mg/kg IV infusion of ABP 710, inf liximab (US), or infliximab (EU), and were 
followed for [ADDRESS_440338] 
common treatment -emergent adverse events were somnolence (53.4%), headache 
(31.8%), nasopharyngitis (8.8%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (4.7%), and nausea 
(4.2%).  The percentage of subjects who were positive for binding antibodies was 
42.9%, 36.0% and 32.7% for ABP 710, infliximab (US) and inf liximab (EU), respectively. 
Thus, it is expected that the safety profile of ABP 710 is similar to that of infliximab.
The current study is designed to demonstrate the clinical similarity between ABP 710 
and infliximab in terms of efficacy, safety, and imm unogenicity for moderate and severe 
RA and in accordance with the biosimilar regulations and guidance ( EMA/CHMP/437/04

The following concomitant medications are permitted:
methotrexate as specified in Section 8.5.1
oral corticosteroids at a do se of ≤ [ADDRESS_440374] of the study
nonlive vaccinations are allowed any time throughout the study
If at any time a subject clinically needs additional therapy (other than those specified in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), incl uding a significant increase in the MTX dose to treat RA, the 
investigator should contact [CONTACT_353658] (or designee) to determine if the 
subject is eligible to remain on investigational product. If the subject is no longer eligible 
to remain on investigational product, then the subject should undergo the evaluations 
and procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Concomitant Medications
All of the following are prohibited at an y time during the study:
nonbiologic DMARDs (other than MTX; as per exclusion criteria)
any biologic treatment for RA (eg, anakinra, soluble IL -1 type II receptor, 
etanercept, infliximab [except for investigational product], onercept, 
abatacept, tocilzumab , golimumab, certolizumab, rituximab, and 
adalimumab)
chronic minocycline or tetracycline (except use for ≤ 10 days to treat 
infection, or for nonarthritis indications, eg, acne), hydroxychloroquine, 
mycophenolate mofetil, or sulfasalazine

[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Medication
The definition of rescue medication is any medication other than prohibited medication 
that is used to treat RA. The use of rescue med ication is allowed in this study under the 
following conditions:
oral corticosteroids: the maximum dose allowed is 10 mg prednisone (or 
equivalent) per day; the dose can be decreased if needed, per the 
investigator’s clinical judgment
acetaminophen, hydroc odone, codeine, tramadol, and/or propoxyphene 
may be used by [CONTACT_353659]. However, no rescue 
analgesics will be allowed within 12 hours before clinical efficacy 
assessments (ie, at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 46, and

NSAIDs/cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors: If the subject enters the 
study taking an NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor, the dose of NSAIDs/COX -[ADDRESS_440375] of care. In cases of flare, the dose of 
NSAIDs/COX -[ADDRESS_440376] return to the maintenance dose (the dose at 
baseline) as soon as the flare resolves. In subjects not taking an 
NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor, one may be added temporarily to treat a flare in 
RA. It should be tapered and discontinued with resolution of flare. In all 
cases, these agents will not beallowed within 12 hours before clinical 
efficacy assessments (ie, at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 
46, and 50)

The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of disease activity in RA.  It is a continuous 
measure based on 28 Disease Activity Score (DAS) joints from th e ACR, the Subject's 
Global Health Assessment score and CRP, as follows:
DAS28-CRP = 0.56*(TJC28)0.5+ 0.28*(SJC28)0.5+ 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96
where TJC28 is the tender joint count of the 28 joints in the D AS, SJC28 is the swollen

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical
conditi on.  Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes,
migraine headaches, andgout) hasincreased inseverity, frequency, and/or duration,
and/or hasan association with a significantly worse outcome.  In the case of 
worsening of a pre- existing condition, the start date of the event is the date when the 
first signs ofworsening were observed.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened 
during thestudy or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a
medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.

(US) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) version 4.03 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
investigational product. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33248]?”
The investigator is responsible fo r reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  A subject, or subject’s legal
guardian, can also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event.  If the
subject withdraws consent, the subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an
end-of-study assessment.

state o f health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, 
an agreement will be obtained in writing.
The investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained. On eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the sponsor o r the CRO, subjects must not be 
identified by [CONTACT_2300]. Instead, subjects will only be known by [CONTACT_353676]. Subjects will 
retain this unique number throughout the study. The investigator will keep a separate 
log of these codes.
To comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject safety, it may be 
necessary for the sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research 
review board, or the US FDA to review subjects’ medical records as they relate to this 
study. Only the subject’s unique number on the eCRFs will identify him/her, but their full 
names may be made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized 
government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by [CONTACT_103].
Documents that are not for submission to the sponsor or the CRO (eg, consent forms) 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_1210], except to the extent necessary

approval (where one is provided as requested, according to local country requirements) 
will be provided to the investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s).
15.2 Protocol A mendments
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6 (R1) Guideline for GCP, the investigator should not 
implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without agreement by [CONTACT_29688]/IEC of a protocol amendment except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in 
monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]).
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by [CONTACT_456]. A written amendment must be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/ IECassuming this responsibility. 
The investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before 
implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to subjects. In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified within [ADDRESS_440430] be approved in writing by [CONTACT_353678] I RB/IEC, except for administrative amendments, which 
require notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29614], with instructions to append the 
amendment to the protocol.
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC, the investigator and/or sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design or procedures and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require modification. The modified 
ICF must also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], appropriate regulatory 
authorities, and the IRB/IEC. In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before participation continues.

Intheevent ofasignificant protocol deviation duetoanemergency, accident, or
error, the investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_353679].  This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to 
whether ornot the subject should continue in the study.  The investigator, sponsor, 
andmedi calmonitor will document this decision.

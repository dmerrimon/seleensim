2.1 Introduction  
 
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non -profit 
research and educational organizat ion working to obtain approval as a clinical trial 
sponsor  for the prescription use of 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA) -
assisted psychotherapy in patients with  chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  
This study is a part of a global series of  Phase [ADDRESS_510269] pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (MP -1) in the United 
States (U.S.) [1]. Findings from the long -term follow -up of MP -[ADDRESS_510270] -treatment [2]. The 
sponsor’s second Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_404668] (MP -2) in [ADDRESS_510271] 
statistical significance [3]. Long -term follo w-up data [ADDRESS_510272] population. Ongoing and 
planned P hase 2 studies, along with the study described in this protocol,  are laying the 
groundwork for an eventual End -of-Phase 2 mee ting with FDA and possible Phase 3 
multi -site MDMA/PTSD research studies.   
 
This Phase [ADDRESS_510273] 
six months  duration who were unable to achieve remission despi[INVESTIGATOR_404669]/duration or 
who discontinued treatment due to lack of tolerability.  Two active doses of MDMA and a 
compara tor dose will be assessed in Stage 1, as will the benefit of three versus two active 
dose sessions. Subject s who received the comparator dose during Stage [ADDRESS_510274] or an “intern” co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404670]-licensure, is 
licensed but with less experience,  has a different therapy backgr ound than indicated in the 
manual, or practices a different healing profession (physician, nurse, social worker).  
 
This study is designed to obtain estimates of effect size for safety and efficacy. The data 
will be combined with ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_510275] 19, 2014   
 Page 6 of 81 dose MDMA. This study is also intended to continue the deve lopment of a manualized 
psychotherapeutic approach to this potential treatment.  
 
2.2 Background  
 
2.2.1 PTSD  
 
PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric disorder arising after a traumatic life event. PTSD 
severely reduces quality of life and may directly or indirec tly lead to or exacerbate other 
psychiatric and medical problems. A complex biopsychosocial condition, PTSD is 
characterized by a combination of three types of symptoms: hyperarousal symptoms such 
as hypervigilance, anxiety and sleep disturbance,  intrusive  re-experiencing of traumatic 
experiences,  such as intrusive memories, nightmares or flashbacks, and avoidance 
symptoms, including  emotional  numbing and withdrawal  [4, 5]. The DSM -IV criteria for 
PTSD include:  
 
a. Exposure to a significant traumatic event accompanied by [CONTACT_404772].   
b. Persistent re -experiencing of the event or aspects of the e xperience.   
c. Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, and/or withdrawal from 
some aspects of life.   
d. Persistent symptoms of increased arousal.   
e. The above symptoms must last for more than one month for Acute PTSD and 
more than three months for Chronic PTSD.  
 
The lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the U.S. general population is between 6% and 10%  
[6-10], but it is common in other countries as well [7, 11-14]. According to some 
estimates, PTSD appears to be less prevalent in the general population of Europe at 1.9% 
[15]. In U.S. soldiers returning from combat  in the Iraq war, the incidenc e of PTSD is as 
high as 18% [16], and it is estimated that the number of service members returning home 
with PTSD will ultimately be between 75,000 and 225,000 [17]. In countries with 
endemic armed conflict, the incidence of PTSD in  civilians is often far greater  [18-20].  
 
PTSD is clearly a  serious public health problem and contributes substantially to 
healthcare costs [5, 8, 9]. PTSD  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a chronic illness [6, 21] associated with high 
rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity, disability, suffering, and suicide [7-10, 22]. 
People suffering from  PTSD face challenges in relationships a nd work productivity [23]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_404671], 
questions remain concerning the best possible treatments [24]. Two selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), sertraline and paroxetine , which are known to affect the 
serotonergic components of PTSD, are currently marketed as PTSD medications in the 
U.S. [25, 26]. In additi on, SSRIs must be used every day in order to be effective  for 
PTSD symptoms  [27], and are associate d with a high rate of discontinuation due to lack 
of tolerability caused by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent side effects that may be under -reported [28, 
29]. 
  

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510276] of PTSD 
patients fail to respond to established PTSD psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_404672] a 
clinical ly significant manner  [30-32]. In the U.S. National Comorbidity Study, the 
median time to remission for PTSD was [ADDRESS_510277] of  the patients still had symptoms several 
times per week after 10 years  [33].  Forty to 60% of PTSD patients were found to be 
resistant to treatment in this study. In a comparison of two types of psychotherapy for 
women with PTSD after sexual assault in 2002, 47% of each treatm ent group still 
satisfied diagnostic criteria for PTSD based on high Clinician Administered PTSD Scale 
(CAPS) scores , and this was considered highly efficacious  [34]. At least one study of 
parox etine indicated that men with PTSD did not respond to this drug [25], and another 
randomized, double -blind  study found no difference between sertraline and placeb o in the 
treatment of PTSD [35]. These findings suggest that there is still a substantial need for 
innovative treatments for PTSD.  
 
Another treatment approach is to develop drugs and/or psychotherapeutic treatments that 
may indirectly decrease or elimi nate the neurochemical pathologies underlying the 
chronic hyperarousal associated with PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly 
prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, are considered among the most 
effective psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Other me thods such as psychodynamic therapy and eye 
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have also proven to be effective in 
treating some symptoms of PTSD [28], although some patients may need more than one 
type of treatment to reduce or resolve those  symptoms [20]. A recent meta -analysis 
concluded that all “bona fide” psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including those listed above, are similarly 
effective with PTSD [29].  In recent years, there has been a growing amount of research 
into drugs and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for 
PTSD (see [36] for a review).   Examples of this are virtual reality -assisted exposure 
therapy [37, 38] and D -cycloserine -assisted psychotherapy [39]. MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy is another such app roach.  
 
2.2.2 MDMA  
 
MDMA is a ring -substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative invented by [CONTACT_120566] 1912 [40, 41]. MDMA is a monoamine releaser that has its 
greatest effects on serotonin, followed by [CONTACT_90005][INVESTIGATOR_57174] [42-48]. MD MA 
is capable of inducing unique psychopharmacological effects, including:  
 
• Decreased feelings of fear.  
• Increased feelings of well being.  
• Increased sociability and extroversion.  
• Increased interpersonal trust . 
• Alert state of consciousness.  
 
Early observers n oted increased acceptance of self and others, increased tolerance of 
emotionally upsetting materials and the ability to address these issues without extreme 
disorientation or ego loss  [49-52]. In the U.S., MDMA was used as an adjunct to 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510278] 19, 2014   
 Page 8 of 81 psychotherapy by a considerable number of psychiatrists and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404673], relationship problems, and PTSD [49, 50, 53, 54] before it was 
placed in Sc hedule I in 1985 as a result of extensive non -medical use [52, 55, 56]. 
Placement in Schedule I prohibited it for use except in a federally approved research 
setting.  
 
In contrast to daily administrations of SSRIs, MDMA -assisted psychotherapy consists of 
several drug-assisted sessions interspersed with  a mo derate course of non -drug 
psychotherapy. Thus the effects of MDMA are distinct from and go well beyond those of 
anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Furthermore, there is no evidence that 
MDMA creat es a physical dependency, as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_404674]. Previous studies of 
polydrug users found a small percentage of people exhibit problematic use of ecstasy, 
(material represented as containing MDMA) [57, 58]. Studies of regular or problematic 
ecstasy users indicate that on average, regular use occurs no more often than once a week 
[59]. Hence, MDMA may have moderate abuse potential. See the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for a more detailed explanation.  
 
2.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience with MDMA  
 
Classification  as a Schedule I drug  hampered research into the medical uses  of MDMA. 
In recent years, clinical investigation of the safety and eff ectiveness of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy has become more feasible due to an open IND with the FDA [60-62]. The 
first double -blind , placebo controlled U.S. Phase 1 study sanctioned by [CONTACT_404773] 1994, with findings that suggested MDMA caused a significant increase in 
body temperature and heart rate in some healthy volunteers [63]. However, these 
increases were found to be transient and generally tolerable in a control led clinical setting 
[63]. Subsequent trials confirmed that MDMA produced significant increases in heart rate 
and blood pressure that were likely to be well tolerated by [CONTACT_302047] [63-69]. 
The noted elevation in body temperature was not clinically significant [1].   
 
The potentially therapeutic effects of MDMA were initially investigated starting in 2000 
in a MAPS -sponsor ed dose  response pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] s tudy in Spain in women survivors of sexual 
assault with treatment -resistant PTSD [70, 71]. Unfortunately, the study in Spain was 
halted in 2002 due to political pressure from the Madrid Anti -Drug Authority. Prior to its 
suspension, six women were enrolled and treated in this study without any adverse events 
(AEs) or signs of deteriorating mental health, and with s ome mild signs of improvement, 
with single doses ranging from 50 mg to 75 mg [71].  
 
MAPS went on to sponsor  the first U.S. Phase 2 study of MDMA -assisted psychothe rapy 
for the treatment of chronic, treatment resistant PTSD, designated as MP -1. This study 
employed the CAPS as a primary outcome measure, with PTSD symptoms measured by a 
blinded  Independent Rater  (IR) at baseline, three  to five days after each experimen tal 
session, and two months after the final experimental session. Data from this randomized, 
placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_404675]  (N=20) [1]. Findings from the long -term 
follow-up evaluating these subjects at an average of [ADDRESS_510279] been sustained over time on average, although two 
subjects experienced a relapse in PTSD symptoms [2]. The sponsor  also supported a 
randomized, double -blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] [ADDRESS_510280] significant improvement in subjects receiving full dose MDMA, when 
compared to 25 mg active placebo MDMA at two -month follow -up. The improvement 
continued to increase during the 12 -month follow -up [3]. In addition, the sponsor 
supported an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_404676] 25 
mg active placebo MDMA in Israel that enrolled five subjects , with no drug -related 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Subjects reported benefits that were not reflected in 
CAPS scores, leading to termination of the study for additional training of the Israeli 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404677]. Most recently, in the U.S., MA PS has commenced a follow -
up to its initial U.S. trial with a PTSD relapse study, along with a second Phase [ADDRESS_510281] s, in 
both Ph ase 1 and Phase 2 studies, without any occurrences of unexpected drug-related 
SAEs  [1, 3, 47, 68, 72-95].  
 
2.2.4 MDMA -assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD  
 
In the context of psychotherapy,  MDMA has been noted to reduce defenses and fear of 
emotional injury while enhancing communication and capacity for introspection  [55]. 
MDMA -assisted psychotherapy is an innovative mode of treatment that combines 
psychotherapeutic techniques with the administration of MDMA, a pharmacological 
adjunct that may enhance or amplify certain aspects of psych otherapy. MDMA possesses 
unique pharmacological properties that may make it especially well suited to use as an 
adjunct to psychotherapy in PTSD patients [67, 72-74, 79, 96, 97].  
 
Treatment goals of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy for PTSD include alleviating 
symptoms , interrupting and counteracting the stress -induced neuro biological 
abnormalities that may be associated with  the condition. In fact, the biologic and 
psychotherapeutic approaches overlap and re inforce  each other. Knowledge about the 
connections between the neurobiological and therapeutic effects of MDMA is far from 
complete, but it has been observed that MDMA acutely decreases activity in the left 
amygdala [96], and attenuates amygdalar response to angry faces [73]. This action is 
compatible with its reported reduction in fear or defensiveness, and is in contrast to the 
stimulation of the amygdala observed  in animal models of conditioned fear, a state 
similar to PTSD [98-100]. The reduction in stress -induced activat ion of the amygdala  
may be supported and enhan ced by [CONTACT_404774][INVESTIGATOR_404678].  
 
Oxytocin is a neurohormone associated with pair bonding and social affiliation in 
mammals [101]. Oxytocin administration is associated with increased interpersonal trust 
and attenuated reactivity to threatening faces [102, 103], and some researchers have 
suggested a role for oxytocin in treating PTSD [104]. MDMA has been shown to elevate 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510282] 19, 2014   
 Page 10 of 81 serum oxytocin in humans [67, 105]. Brain imaging after MDMA indicates less reactivity 
to angry facial expressions and greater reward in happy faces [73]. The effects of MDMA 
on oxytocin may increase empathy or compassion for self and others and decrease 
defensiveness . Findings from a recent imaging study suggests that MDMA can make 
recall of negative memories more tolerable [74] , and other studies report increased 
interpersonal or social focus reflected in language use and a greater readiness to see 
others as empathetic and caring [97, 106, 107] . These  factors taken together can provide 
the opportunity for a corrective emotional experience [49].  
 
A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy  may be especially useful  for 
treating PTSD because MDMA can attenuate the fear response of a perceived threat to 
one’s emotional integrity and decrease defensiveness without blocking access to 
memories or preventing a deep and genuine experience of emotio n [1, 50, 52, 71]. 
Elimination of these conditioned fear responses can lead to more open and comfortable 
communication about past traumatic events and greater access to information about them 
[49]. Subject s are able to experience and express fear, anger, and grie f with less 
likelihood of feeling overwhelmed by [CONTACT_120568]. MDMA seems to engender internal 
awareness that even painful  feelings that arise are an important pa rt of the therapeutic 
process. In addition, feelings of empathy, love, and deep appreciation  often emerge, along 
with a clearer perspective of the trauma as a past event , a more accurate perspective about 
its significance and a heightened awareness of the support and safety that exist s in the 
present. As a result MDMA -assisted psychotherapy may enable the subjects  to restructure 
their intrapsychic realities and develop a wider behavioral and emotional repertoire with 
which to respond to anxiogenic stimuli.   
 
A comprehensive review of MDMA research is included in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_429] . Thi s document should be reviewed prior to initiating the protocol.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_510283] to manualized psychotherapy. In Stage 1 the study will assess two different 
active doses ( 100 mg and 125  mg) and one comparator dose ( 40 mg) of MDMA,  an 
optional supplemental dose that is half of the assigned dose may be offered to all subjects 
1.[ADDRESS_510284] of two blinded 
expe rimental sessions and one open -label experimental session of manualized MDMA -
assisted psychotherapy, each lasting six to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks 
apart, within a moderate course of non -drug psychotherapy.  
 
The study will be unblinded one month after the second experimental session in Stage 1, 
after completion of outcome measures, which constitutes the primary endpoint 
assessment. After unblinding, subjects who received active dose 1 (125 mg MDMA with 
optional supplemental half dose) du ring the first two sessions will receive the same active 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510285] experimental session. Subjects who received active dose 
2 (100 mg MDMA with optional supplemental half dose) during the first two sessions 
will be able to choose, in consultation with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], to either continue to receive 
active dose [ADDRESS_510286]  psychotherapy visits according to the treatment 
manual [108]. Subjects will either be treated by [CONTACT_404775] -
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404679] -
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Information will be collected regarding consistency and r esponse between the 
teams by [CONTACT_404776]. This study 
will also continue the refinement of the treatment manual.  
 
2.4 Rationale of Dose Selection  
 
This study will compare the effects of psychotherapy se ssions assisted by  [CONTACT_404777] a comparator dose.  The active dose 1 will be 125 mg 
MDMA followed 1.5 to 2.5 hours later by [CONTACT_404778] 62.5 mg 
MDMA.  The active dose 2 will be 100 mg MDMA followed 1.5 to 2.5 hours later by [CONTACT_404779] 50 mg MDMA. The comparator dose will be 40 mg 
MDMA followed 1.5 to 2.5 hours later by  [CONTACT_404778] 20 mg 
MDMA. Eighteen  of 23 subjects, or 78%, will be assigned to one of the active dose 
condition s, and five of 23, or 22%, will be assigned to the comparator dose condition.   
The active dose 1 is equal to the full dose in other MAPS -supported MDMA/PTSD 
studies.

The active dose [ADDRESS_510288] also used 
doses within this range [63, 64, 66, 68, 109-114]. Prior to the scheduling of MDMA, 
similar doses and regimens were used in psychotherapy [50, 52, 55]. The initial active 
doses are expected to produce all the commonly reported effects of MDMA , including 
changes in affect , mood , and cognition and changes in  feelings of interpersonal closeness 
and trust . The supplemental dose will prolong subjective drug effects without producing 
physiological effects any greater than peak effects occurring after the initial dose.   
 
The doses to be compared in this study have  been chosen on the basis of the Sponsor’s 
ongoing initiative to develop a dose response curve of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in 
the treatment of PTSD.  They are very similar to doses used in Phase 1 studies [64, 69]. 
This dose is  expected to produce increases in positive mood and tension, in combination 
with a lower degree of  therapeutic effects  than the active d oses.  
 
The [ADDRESS_510289], will decide whether the same do se or an initial 
dose of 125 mg (each with the corresponding optional supplemental dose) would be more 
likely to constitute the optimal therapeutic dose for each of these experimental sessions.

The safety objectives of the study are to monitor and assure safety of subjects during and 
after the experimental session s by [CONTACT_194955], psychological distress, 
adverse events, spontaneously reported reactions  and suicidality.   
 
• Suicidality will be assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -
SSRS) during some visits prior to experimenta l sessions, twice during 
experimental sessions, and several times after each experimental session, with 
comparisons made between subjects in each condition.  
• Assess cognitive function with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) 
and the Repeatable B attery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status 
(RBANS) at baseline and the primary  endpoint by [CONTACT_3004], and end of Stage 
1/end of Stage 2 for maximal exposure.  
• Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) and vital  signs including blood pressure, heart 
rate, and temperature will be measured during each experimental session, and 
vital signs  will be compared between subjects in each condition . 
• Collect changes to pre -existing tinnitus and/or chronic pain symptoms using a 
visual analog scale, specifically in su bjects with a medical history of tinnitus 
and/or chronic pain.  
• Serious adverse events, adverse events, and spontaneously reported reactions  will 
be collected during the study , as described in Section 8.[ADDRESS_510292] six months duration . Stage 1 will include two  blinded and one 
open -label MDMA -assisted psychotherapy session  scheduled approximately one month 
apart with a  male/female co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194889]. There will also be a moderate course of 
preparatory and integrative psychotherapy sessions as described in the Time and Events 
Table.  
 
There will be t wo types of male/female co -therapy teams treating subjects, one type will 
have two experienced psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_404680].  An “intern” co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404681]  a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404682]-licensure, licensed but with less experience,  has a 
different therapy background than indicated in the manual, or practices a different healing 
profession (physician, nurse, social worker). Each subject will be treated by [CONTACT_404781]-
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404683].  
 
Upon enrollment, subjects will be ra ndomly assigned to receive either active d ose 1 (nine 
subjects), active dose 2 of MDMA  (nine subjects), or comparator dose (five subjects). In 
Stage 1, subjects will meet with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404684] -assisted psychotherapy. 
After each experimental session, subjects will stay overnight at the site and complete an 
integr ative psychotherapy session the next day, followed by [CONTACT_404782]. One month after the second 
experimental session, the primary endpoint assessment will take place, after which the 
blind will be broken . Subjects who receive one of the active doses will receive a third 
open -label experimental session with similar procedures. Subjects who receive the active 
dose [ADDRESS_510293] experimental sessions, with an optional supplemental half dose at each of three 
experimental sessions at time points equivalent to those in Stage 1 (S ee Time and Events  
Table ). 
 
A blinded IR will administer out come measures . The IR will assess PTSD symptoms 
with the CAPS , quality of life w ith the GAF,  symptoms of depression with the BDI -II, 
sleep quality with the PSQI , posttraumatic growth with the PTGI (in reference to the start 
of the study), and dissociation with the DES -II. The subjects will complete the PDS, a 
self-report measure of their PTSD symptoms, to provide correlations  with measures 
administered by [CONTACT_32629]. A blinded IR will also assess cognitive function with the Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment 
MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510294] 19, 2014   
 Page 16 of 81 of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) at baseline and the primary  endpoint by 
[CONTACT_3004], and end of Stage 1/end of Stage [ADDRESS_510295] experimental session in Stage 1 and Stage 
2, if applicable. In addition all subjects will comple te a visit 12  months after th eir final 
experimental session where outcome measures and a questionnaire on any lasting benefits 
or harms of the treatment will be administered (see Time and Events Table) . 
 
The Sponsor  will conduct an ongoing review  of videot apes of  psychotherapy  sessions, 
entry criteria, vital signs, and reaction data for completed sessions  and any AEs. The 
sponsor will provide ongoing feedback to the co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404685] e proper 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73775], subject safety, and  to ensure standa rdization of therapy techniques in 
the Sponsor’s ongoing effort to manualiz e MDMA -assisted psychotherapy .

5.[ADDRESS_510308] ’s experimental sessions nor have any 
information regarding the experimental sessions. Subjects will be instructed not to inform  
the IR of any beliefs they or others have concerning their condition assignment during the 
evaluation session. The CAPS provides a standardized method to evaluate the frequency 
and intensity dimensions of each symptom, impact of symptoms on the subject ’s social 
and occupational functioning, overall severity of the symptom complex and global 
improvement since baseli ne and the validity of the ratings obtained. The CAPS interview 
takes approximately one hour to complete. All assessments, including those at baseline, 
will use the CAPS assessment of symptoms over the last month. The CAPS has been 
determined to have good internal consistency, concurrent validity, and test/retest 
reliability [115, 116].  
 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510309] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 24 of 81 The secondary measure of  PTSD symptoms will be the PDS, a self -report  measure 
designed to follow DSM -IV criteria for assessing PTSD. The measure is derived from the 
Posttraumatic Symptom Scale – Self Report (PSS -SR), a measure also intended to tap 
into diagnostic criteria for PTS D. The PDS contains 49 items, with responses made on a 
four-point scale, ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“five or more times a week”). The 
PDS consists of a list of [ADDRESS_510310] on areas of 
life function  [117]. Items addressing elements of the traumatic event  and life function are 
answered as either present or not present (Yes or No). The 17 items are summed to create 
a symptom severity scale. Cronbach’s alpha for the symptom severity scale is 0.92. The 
PDS has test -retest reliability of 0.74 after a two -week and one -month interval, and 
subscales are inter -correlated, with correlations ranging from 0.73 to 0.82, and PDS 
scores ha ve a moderate to good correlation with SCID diagnosis, with kappa = 0.65  
[117]. Subjects will complete the PDS questionnaire  at baseline, after each experimental 
session, and the end of Stage 1 or Stage 2, as specified in the Time and Events Table .  
 
The BDI-II is a 1996 revision of the BDI, a 21 -item self -report measure [118, 119], that 
will serve as a measure of depressi on according to DSM -IV criteria [120]. The BDI -II 
has been validated, has high internal consistency and good test/re -test reliability and is 
not overly sensitive to dai ly variations in mood . It takes five to ten minutes to complete  
[120]. Score cutoffs indicate: 0 -13 minimal depression, 14 -19 mild depression, 20 -28 
moderat e depression, and 29 -63 severe depression. Higher scores indicate more severe 
depressive symptoms. Subjects will complete the BDI -II at the same times as the CAPS.  
 
The GAF  is a measure of quality of life and general function made through observations. 
The GAF consists of a single score, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 
reflecting superior function and 0 reflecting serious risk of causing harm to the self or 
others. The GAF is a reliable, validated measure of social functioning [121]. Subjects will 
complete the GAF at the same time a s the CAPS.  
 
The PSQI  is a measure of self -reported sleep quality over a one -month period. The PSQI 
was designed to be a reliable, standardized measure able to distinguish between good and 
poor sleepers. It consists of 19 items, with possible responses ran ging from 0 to 4 on a 
five-point scale [122]. The PSQI consists of seven sub -scales; sleep quality, sleep 
latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_398334] s, and daytime dysfunction. These are all summed to produce a single global 
scale. Global scores can range from [ADDRESS_510311] reliability ranges from 0.85 to 0.87, and it is internally consistent, 
with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83  [122, 123]. Global scores correlate with other measures 
of alertness and self -reported sleep quality [124]. Subjects will complete the PSQI  at the 
same time as the CAPS . 
 
The PTGI is  a 21-item self -report measure of perceived growth or benefits occurring after 
a traumatic event. I t contains five subscales; relationship to others, new possibilities, 
personal strength, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312] c hange, and appreciation of life [125, 126]. In this study, 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510312] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 25 of 81 subjects will complete the PTGI in reference to the time since the trauma at baseline, but 
will respond in reference to the beginning of their participation in the study on all 
subsequent occasions. Subjects  will complete the PTGI  according to the Time and Events 
table.   
 
The DES -II is a 28 -item self -report measure of dissociation , defined as a la ck of normal 
integration of an individual’s thoughts, feelings, or experiences into the stream of 
consciousness or memory  [127, 128]. It is an established measure of dissociative 
symptoms. The scale consists of statements describing facets of dissociation . 
Respondents indicate how often the specific experience happens to them, from “never” to 
“always.” Res ponses on the original scale were made via visual analog scales. The DES -
II uses the same items but with responses made on a ten -point scale from “0%” to 
“100%” of the time. The scale is scored by [CONTACT_404786] a total score. The DES -II can also be used to produce scores for three factors, 
amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization. The scale differentiated between 
respondents without psychiatric disorders or with psychiatric disorders with few 
dissociative symptoms and  respondents with psychiatric disorders associated with 
dissociative symptoms [127]. Reliability of the DES -II is high (ranging from 0.79 to 0.96 
in an early review), and a reported Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95 [128, 129]. There may be a 
relationship between experiencing dissociation and occurrence of chronic PTSD [128, 
130]. 
 
The long -term follow -up questionnaire has been developed internally by [CONTACT_404787] -term benefits and  harms of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy at the long-term 
follow -up visit.    
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_510313] safety. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404690] (BLS) certification.  
 
Safety measures, including vital signs and a measurement of psychological distress , will 
be asse ssed during all experimental sessions. Subjects will rate their current degree of 
subjective distress with  the SUD scale, which is a single -item self -report scale. The SUD 
will be completed  repeatedly during the experimental sessions, with the degree of di stress 
marked along seven points.  Results of the SUD are intended to assist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404691].  
 
The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404692], on each 
integrative session an d during telephone calls for seven days. Results of this scale are 
intended to assist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404693].  
 
The C -SSRS is a clinician -administered measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect 
potential suicidal t houghts or behaviors during a clinical trial [131]. It consists of a 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510314] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 26 of 81 “Baseline” form that assesses lifetime suicidal ideation, ideation intensity , and behavior  
and a form for assessing current suicidal ideation and behavior. The C -SSRS consists of a 
series of questions, and can be administered during a face -to-face interview or over the 
telephone. Suicidality will be assessed at baseline, during  most  face-to-face visits, during 
the second and seventh days of telephone contact, and twice during each experimental 
session. Subjects who are discontinuing medication to participate in the study will 
complete the C -SSRS before and after medication washout.  The C -SSRS dat a will be 
collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs) for all administrations except for the second 
integrative session, unless the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404694]. C -SSRS data 
from the second integrative session after each experimental session will be kept with the 
subject’s source record . 
 
The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Statu s (RBANS) 
[132] is a relatively brief battery of assessments for cognitive function. It consists of 12 
subtests that co ver verbal and visual memory and attention and takes approximately 30 
minutes to administer. Tasks include recall of lists, figures and stories, pi[INVESTIGATOR_320516], 
semantic fluency, copying a figure, digit span and coding, and line orientation. Scores on 
the RBANS subtests can be used to obtain a total score and five index scores; attention, 
immediate memory, delayed memory, language and visuospatial/constructional scores. 
Factor analyses of the RBANS and samples of veterans and people with schizophrenia 
sugge st that the RBANS possesses two factors rather than five [133, 134]. The RBANS 
has alternate forms, allowing  repeated administration. Test performance by [CONTACT_404788]’s 
disease or the neurodegenerative condition Huntington’s disease [135], and the test has 
high split -half reliability, with coefficients ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 [132]. Test -retest 
reliability is good for total RBANS scores in healthy controls and psychiatric patients 
[136]. The RBANS has been used in community -based and psychiatric samples [133, 
137] and in a prospective investigation of the effects of chemotherapy upon cognitive 
function [138]. Each administration of the RBANS will use one of parallel forms of 
RBANS, and each participant will not complete the same form twice. This measure was 
employed as a means of assessing safety after two sessions of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy for PTSD [1]. See Time and Events Table for a detailed schedule.  
 
The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is a measure of psychomotor speed, 
auditory information processing and computation ability [139]. The PASAT was 
originally designed to assess recovery after traumatic brain injury, and has been used 
subse quently to assess cognitive function in other populations [139-141]. It takes 
approximately ten to [ADDRESS_510315] responses, time to response (latency of response) and any failure to 
respond. There was a positive correlation between responses on the PASAT and a non -
numerical paced measure. The measure is internally consistent (Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.90), and it has high test -retest reliability, with reliability ranging from 0.90 to 0.97 
[140-142]. The first administration of the PASAT will use one of the t wo alternate forms, 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510316] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 27 of 81 and the second administration will use the other. This measure was employed as a means 
of assessing safety after two sessions of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy for PTSD  [1]. 
See Time and Events Table for a detailed schedule.  
 
Cardiovascular e ffects will be assessed via blood pressure and pulse measurement.  
Blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed periodically during each experimental 
session  by [CONTACT_404789] (BP) and pulse monitor . Blood pressure and pulse 
will be measured  at the outset of the experimental session, and once approximately every 
[ADDRESS_510317] body temperature approximately every 60 to 90 minutes. Cardiovascular 
effects will be assessed via blood pressure measurement. The timing of these 
measurements will be adjusted so they do not interfere with the therapeutic process.   
 
A 100-millimeter visual analog scale will be used to assess changes in symptoms of pre -
existing tinnitus and/or chronic pain  [143-145]. The Changes in Tinnitus a nd/or Pain 
visual analog scale will allow rating of symptom severity from “None” to “Worst Case 
Imaginable”. This exploratory measure will enable quantification of subjective somatic 
symptoms that are known to be associated with PTSD [144, 146-148]. Presence of 
chronic pain is associated with PTSD, possibly as a result of psychological response to 
traumat ic stress as reflected in brain activity, such as increased amygdalar activity in 
response to pain and transmitter systems involved in the stress response [144, 147, 148]. 
 
All AEs and spontaneously reported reactions will be collected , as described in Section 
8.5. AEs and spontaneously reported  reactions may be collected during face -to-face visits 
or over the telephone. Common reactions that are spontaneously reported are collected 
for seven days after each experimental session on a separate CRF page and will be 
categorized as mild, moderate, or  severe.

Page 28 of 81 The SOCQ  is a 100 -item questionnaire based on the “Peak Experience Profile” designed 
by [CONTACT_194973] [149, 150]. Subject s respond to the SOCQ using a six -point 
Likert -type scale anchored at 0=none at all and 5=extreme (more than ever before in my 
life). It has seven subscale scores; internal unity, external unity, transcendence of time 
and space, ineffability and paradoxicality (claim of difficulty in describing the experience 
in words), sense of sacredness, noetic quality, and deeply felt positive mood. The 
measure is a self -report instrument and takes approximately [ADDRESS_510320] will indicate their belief of condition assig nment and certainty based on the active  
doses (125 mg or 100 mg ) and comparator dose groups. In line with informed consent 
obfuscation, where the comparator dose is not revealed, subjects will initially be asked if 
they believe they received MDMA or not du ring this assessment. If they believe they 
received MDMA, they will be asked about what dose they think they received. These 
beliefs are collected as a part of the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to optimize the double -
blind as a part of dose resp onse studies .  
 
Subject perceptions about experimental  sessions will be collected from each active dose 
subject at the Primary Endpoint after unblinding and the two -month follow -up in Stage 1. 
Stage 2 subjects will complete the same measure at the Secondary Endpoint a nd the two -
month follow -up in Stage 2. These perceptions  are collected as a part of the sponsor’s 
ongoing initiative to assess the therapeutic value of the third experimental session and to 
gather information on the optimal therapeutic dose for MDMA.  
 
The Reactions to Research Participation Questionnaire (RRPQ) [151] is an assessment of 
causes for taking part in research and responses to the experience of being a research 
subject. Subject s will complete this measure during their two-month follow -up, with 
exact time of completion varying in accordance with participation  in the third open -label 
experimental session in Stage [ADDRESS_510321]’s experi ence as a research subject, perceived reasons for consenting to be a

Prospective subject s will be prescreened by [CONTACT_194976] -approved 
script to learn if they meet b asic eligibility criteria. All individuals who are prescreened 
should be assigned a screening number a nd recorded on the Subject Screening Log  where 
information on the selection of potential subjects in the trial should be collected.  
 
Upon signing the IRB -approved informed consent form (ICF), the potential subject may 
commence study -related screening activities. The screening number should also be 
recorded on the signed ICF . If a subject is enrolled, the study staff should record the 
enrollment date and as sign a subject number. If a subject is not enrolled, an explanation 
should be recorded on the Screening L og. A CRF will not be completed for subjects who 
are not enrolled. These subjects will only be documented on the Screening L og and 
source records . It is the responsibility o f the investigator to file the Screening L og in the 
investigator site file (ISF) to be readily available for on -site monitoring and/or inspection 
by [CONTACT_190660].  
 
Screening may take place over more than one day and should be  complete by [CONTACT_404791]. Screening may take up to two months , with the baseline 
CAPS being conducted no more than [ADDRESS_510324] information on pre -study and current 
medications.

• Electrocardiogram (EC G). 
• Serum electroly tes, metabolic profile, urinalysis and complete blood count . 
• Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 and free T4.  
• Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serology . 
• Urine -dip pregnancy test on fema les with childbearing potential.  
• Urinary drug test.  
 
Results o f HIV serology will be kept confidential, and appropriate referral for counseling 
may be necessary  in accordance with state law . The clinical laboratory values will be 
used to establish eligibility and will be kept with the subject’s source record. The cli nical  
laboratory values will not be captured in the CRF, but will be used to  establish eligibility 
and will be kept with the subject’s source record . Clinically significant abnormal values 
will be captured as medical history. If, upon examination, there ar e questions raised about 
possible medical problems, the study physician  will request a review of subject medical 
records and request additional tests or assessments as indicated.  
 
A blinded  IR who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions will  administer:  
 
• Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnoses  I Research Version  (SCID -I-RV) to 
assess eligibility based on Axis I diagnoses, which includes a self -report 
questionnaire to focus on modules to use based on symptoms.  
• SCID -II Axis 2 questionnaire  to determine if any modules of the SCID -II 
Interview are required to exclude possible personality disorders in Cluster A, B or 
C. If required, specific modules of the SCID -II Interview will be conducted to 
confirm diagnoses of personality disorders.  
• Last-month CAPS to assess PTSD symptoms  and eligibility, which may be 
recorded to video in as many instances as necessary to establish inter -rater 
reliability.  
• GAF to assess general psychological function . 
• PASAT to assess cognitive function.  
• RBANS to assess cog nitive function.  
 
The subject will complete the following self -report measures:

5.2.7 Evaluation at Primary Endpoint and Unblinding - Visit 12 (Stage 1)  
 
The primary endpoint  evaluation in Stage 1 will occur one month (with in a window of 
plus or minus two weeks) after the second blinded experimental session . This visit will 
consist of two meetings that may be completed on separate days, one with the IR  and the 
other with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . Subjects who have withdrawn from treat ment but have 
continued for follow -up will also complete this time point one month after their last 
experimental session.  
 
At the primary endpoint:  
 
a. Subjects will meet the IR for at least an hour and a half.  
b. The blinded IR will administer:   
• Last month CAPS  to assess PTSD symptoms, which may be recorded to video 
in as many instances as necessary to establish inter -rater reliability.  
• GAF to assess general psychological function.  
• PASAT to assess cognitive function.  
• RBANS to assess cognitive function.  
c. The subje ct will complete the following self -report measures:  
• PTGI to assess post -traumatic growth (in reference to start of the study)  
MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510344] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 39 of 81 • PDS to assess PTSD symptoms.  
• BDI-II to assess depression symptoms.  
• PSQI to assess changes in sleep quality.  
• DES -II to assess diss ociation symptoms.  
d. After completing all assessments and measures with the IR, the subject will meet with 
the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404727] [ADDRESS_510345]’s condition assignment. Only the IR will 
remain blind to condition assignment at this time.   
i. If the subject was assigned  to receive  comparator dose  MDMA, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404728] 2 (s ee Section 5.2.9). Comparator dose subjects will not 
complete the third experimental session and associated integrative sessions in Stage 1.  
j. Collect perceptions of experi mental session s from active  dose subjects  after 
unblinding . 
k. If the subject was assigned to receive active  dose MDMA, the subject will complete a 
third open -label experimental session, with associated daily phone calls and 
integrative sessions in Stage 1 ( see Section s 5.2.3 -6).  
 
5.2.8 End of Stage 1 - Visit 17 (Active Dose Groups Stage 1)  
 
Active  dose subjects will re peat all outcome measures with the IR and meet with the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404729] (within a window of plus or minus two weeks) after their 
final open -label experimental session, which will be the final visit in Stage 1 ( see Section 
5.2.7). This visit will consist of two meetings that may be completed on separate days, 
one with the IR and the other with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . 
 
At the end of Stage 1:  
 
a. The Independent Rater will administer the last month CAPS, GAF, RBANS and 
PASAT.  
b. Subjects will complete the PDS, BDI -II, DES -II, PSQI, and PTGI  (in reference to 
start of the study).

5.2.9 Open -label Stage 2 (Comparator Dose Subjects from Stage 1)  
 
During Stage 2:  
 
a. Subjects will be reminded that participation in Stage [ADDRESS_510347] will 
complete a single preparatory psychotherapy session instead of three (see Section 
5.2.2),  and varied active doses of MDMA will be administered in an open -label 
context to explore the optimal therapeutic dose (e.g. without unblinding). Visits 
will be scheduled consecutively according to the Time and Events Table.  
c. Assessment of PTSD symptoms at the primary endpoint will serve as baseline 
assessments in Stage 2.  
d. If the start of Stage 2 is delayed for more than eight weeks  from the primary 
endpoint (Visit 12)  to the first preparatory session in Stage 2  (Visit 18),  the IR 
will re -administer the CAP S and GAF . The subjects will complete the PDS, BDI -
II, PSQI, PTGI (in reference to start of the study), and the DES -II. These scores 
will be used as the baseline for comparison to assessment at the secondary 
endpoint and the end of  Stage 2.  
e. Experimental se ssions will be conducted according to procedures described in 
Section 5.2.3.  
1. During the first experimental session, subjects will receive a [ADDRESS_510348], will decide whether to 
administer an initial dose of 100 mg or 125 mg initial dose of MDMA. If a 
100 mg initial dose of MDMA is selected, an optional suppleme ntal dose of 
50 mg MDMA may be administered. If a 125  mg initial dose of MDMA is 
selected, an optional supplemental dose of 62.5  mg MDMA may be 
administered . 
3. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_194916]/or the

capsules will be kept in their respective inner envelopes inside of the primary 
container in the safe.  
f.    Integrative sessions will be conducted according to procedures described in 
Sections 5.2.[ADDRESS_510349] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 41 of 81 h.  At the secondary endpoint based on procedures described in Section 5.2.7, the  
Independent Rater will administer the CAPS and GAF. Subjects will complete the 
PDS,  BDI-II, PSQI, PTGI (in reference to the start of the study), and DES -II as 
described in the Time and Events Table.  
i.   At the end of Stage 2 based on procedures described in Section 9.4.8, the 
Independent Rater will administer the CAPS, GAF, RBANS and PASAT . 
Subjects will complete the PDS, BDI -II, DES -II, PSQI, and PTGI (in reference to 
the start of the study), as described in the Time and Events Table.  
j.  The end of Stage 2 will be completed in the same manner as the end of Stage 1 
(see Section 5.2.8).  
k.  Inves tigators will follow the most recent treatment manual  in all matters relating to 
the Open -Label Stage 2 experimental psychotherapy sessions .  
 
5.2.10 Long -term Follow -up 
 
All subjects will be evaluated for long -term effects 12 months (within a visit window  of 
plus or minus one month) after their last MDMA -assisted psychotherapy session. This 
visit will consist of two meetings, one with the IR and the oth er with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . 
Subjects who have withdrawn from treatment but have continued for follow -up will also 
complete this time point.  
 
At the long -term follow -up visit:  
 
a. The IR will administer the last month CAPS, PDS,  BDI-II, GAF , PSQI , PTGI ( in 
reference to start of the study),  and DES -II. 
b. Subjects will have a final meeting with at least one of the thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_404730]. Subjec ts should bring the 
Memory Aid Cards to this visit , to be used as aids in recollection. These cards 
will not be collected . AEs and Medications will be collected , as described in 
Sections 8.[ADDRESS_510350] Numbering  
 
Prior to enrollment, subjects will be tracked with their initials and a screening number 
assigned sequentially starting at “S001”. Subjects who meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be assigned a f ive-digit subject 
number. The first two digits will be “12” and will identify the protocol number . The next 
three digits identify the subject wi thin the site and will be assigned sequentially, with [ADDRESS_510351] will be 120 01, 
second [ZIP_CODE], etc.  
 
In total, 23 subjects will be enrolled into the study. The randomized portion of the s tudy 
will be blinded and there will be a  9:9:[ADDRESS_510352] ’s condition assignment, the blind 
may be broken for an individual subject. The investigator may be provided with the 
condition assignment in case of emergency through the web -based r andomization system.

Subjects will be clinically monitored after withdrawal, the cause of which will be re -
corded in the subject’s source records and CRF. Whenever possible, the tests and 
evaluations lis ted for the termination and outcome visits will be carried out. Efforts will 
be made to obtain information about AE outcomes, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
sponsor.

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510354] will discontinue treatment but remain in the study for follow -up 
purposes.  Whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the primary endpoint 
and 12 -month follow -up will be carried out. Efforts will be made to obtain information 
about AE outcomes, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_473], Medical Monitor and/or 
Sponsor . 
 
Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the primary en dpoint will be replaced. 
Individuals who replace these subjects will be assigned the next available subject 
number. Subjects who discontinue treatment after the primary endpoint in Stage [ADDRESS_510355] the randomization monitor for replacement instructions. Detailed 
instructions will be provided to the site in a separate document.  
 
5.5 Premature Discontinuation of the Study  
 
The Sponsor  or the lead Clini cal Investigator (following consultation with the Sponsor ) 
has the right to discontinue this study at any time. If the trial is prematurely terminated, 
the investigator is to promptly inform the study subjects and will assure appropriate 
therapy and follow -up. If the trial or study is prematurely discontinued, all procedures 
and requirements pertaining to retention and storage of documents will be observed. All 
other study materials will be returned to the Sponsor  and will be treated in accordance 
with fede ral and state regulations.

6.2.2 Compounding  
 
MDMA in  bulk will be sent from a Schedule 1 licensed storage facility to the Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule I license  holder for the study. The Schedule I 
license holder and unblinded randomization monitor will oversee compounding by a 
pharmacist  in a manner that will maintain the blind for the Schedule I license holder. The 
pharmacist will provide bulk lactose for compounding MDMA capsules. The pharmacist 
will weigh  the MDMA  into doses of 125 mg, 100 mg, 62.5 mg, 50  mg, 40 mg, 20 mg, 
and 12.5 mg  (calculated as the weight of the hydrochloride salt) and placed in gelatin 
capsules  with lactose. Capsules for the initial dose will be clearly differentiated  from 
capsules used for the supplemental dose. All capsules will be  compounded so that they 
weigh the same amount, but contain varying amounts of MDMA and lactose.  
 
The encapsulation will be performed by a pharmacist who has the appropriate skills. The 
MDMA will be weighed out (calculated as the weight of the hydrochlori de salt) into 
gelatin capsu les in combination with lactose  used to ensure that all capsules have similar 
appearance and weight. Capsules for all experimental, double -blind sessions will be 
MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510359] as to prevent Clinical Investigator s and sub jects from 
distinguishing contents of active  dose and comparator dose capsules. Dosage for open -
label sessions will be cle arly indicated in the packaging.  
 
6.2.3 Labeling  
 
The IP for each experimental session will be packaged in one primary container,  labeled 
with a unique container number, protocol number, drug name, lot number, sponsor name, 
experimental session number, stage, and a statement that the drug is restricted to  clinical 
trial use only . All drug labels will comply with federal and state  regulat ions and will be 
provided in English . The initial and supplemental dose will be packaged in separate 
labeled “inner envelopes” within the primary container. There will be one primary 
container per subject per experimental session. The sponsor randomization  monitor will 
oversee the process of blinded drug packaging conducted by t he pharmacist  according to 
the randomization list. This list will not be shared with any blinded site or sponsor staff. 
The pharmacist and randomization monitor will be the only staff who are unblinded.

randomization system will enable tracking of blinded primary containers for drug  
accountability purposes.  
 
6.4 Drug Storage and Handling  
 
MDMA is a Schedule I compound and will be stored and handled in compliance with all 
relevant federal and state regulations. In accordance with these requirements, the 
Schedule I license holder will  be responsible for storing, dispensing, and administering 
the MDMA. It will be stored in a secure safe in accordance with federal and state 
regulations.   
 
IP will only be removed for a single experimental session at a time and will be 
administered orally  at the office of the Principal Clinical Investigator (PI) . All doses 
administered will be recorded on the appropriate accountability  and administration  logs.  
Only the initial dose is required to be given at each experimental session. Supplemental 
doses ar e provided for each experimental session but are optional to use. In addition, the 
clinical titration doses with corresponding supplemental dose are provided in Stage [ADDRESS_510374] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 48 of 81 6.5 MDMA Stability  
 
Complete details on the chemistry, manufacturing, and control of the MDMA to be  used 
are described in Drug Master file (DMF) # 6293. As described in that file, MDMA was 
prepared for human consumption in 1985 by [CONTACT_147969], Ph.D., at the Dept. of 
Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Purdue University.  The identity and purity of 
this MDMA was confirmed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in 
1997 as described in DMF # 6293 and was found to be 99.87% pure. On August 12, 
2002, Chemic Laboratories reanalyzed the MDMA at the request of the sponsor  prior to 
starting MAPS’  first U .S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_120545] -assisted psychotherapy in people with 
PTSD. The analysis found the MDMA to be more than 99.7% p ure. A more recent 
analysis performed by [CONTACT_194962]. Carl Hart on February, 
2006, continued to  find a high degree of purity. This analysis found the MDMA in 
question to be 99.9 % pure. This MDMA is currently in use in an ongoing investigation of 
MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in the U .S., was also used in MP -1 with drug 
administration ending in 2008,  and it was also used in a non-sponsor  supported study in 
2006  [155]. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_510375] generally not been associated with serious disc omfort by [CONTACT_404802]. Common reactions include lack of  appetite, insomnia, dizziness, tight 
jaw or bruxism (tooth -grinding), difficulty concentrating, impaired gait or balance, dry 
mouth, ruminations, and thirst. Other slightly less common reaction s include restlessness, 
parasthesias (odd somatic feelings, such as tingling, feeling hot or cold), impaired 
judgment,  perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], drowsiness, and nystagmus (eye -wiggling). While anxiety, 
headache, fatigue, insomnia and lack of appeti te were spontaneously reported by 40% to 
80% of subject s in both conditions in MAPS study MP-1 (N=23), tight jaw, nausea, 
impaired gait/balance, and sensitivity to  cold were more often reported by [CONTACT_1130] s in the 
MDMA than the placebo condition, and irrita bility was slightly more likely to be reported 
in the placebo condition. Additionally, subject s in the MDMA condition were more likely 
to report muscle tension in various body parts and diarrhea .  
 
These effects are transient and diminish as drug effects w ane. Sub -acute effects that may 
either continue for the next 24 hours or appear later include insomnia, fatigue, needing 
more sleep, weakness, heavy legs, dry mouth, low mood or irritability. Sub -acute effects 
are reported less often than acute effects. Mo re information on spontaneously reported 
reactions is described in the IB.  
 
MDMA may produce mild alterations in sensory perception and altered perception of 
time [66, 75, 156]. Women may be more sensitive to these effects [110].  MDMA acutely 
affects attention, information processing, and memory . MDMA acutely impairs verbal 
memory and recall for object location without affecting recall of complex scene change s 
[157]. For this reason, subjects will stay at the site overnight and will not be permitted to 
drive after experimental sessions.  
 
MDMA may produce modest changes in immune functioning, lasting up to [ADDRESS_510376] clinical 
significance beyond several days of possible increased risk of viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_404733].  
 
Further information on the risks associated with MDMA, including information drawn 
from cas e reports and studies of ecstasy users, can be found in the sponsor’s Investigator 
Brochure.

5.1.2. During experi mental sessions the co -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404735] a developi[INVESTIGATOR_404736]. Subjects reporting chest pain, shortness of breath or 
neurological s ymptoms or other potential indicators of hypertension will have more 
frequent measurements and assessment by [CONTACT_5989]. Any subject  who 
experiences medical complications  during an experimen tal session will not be given 
another experimental sessio n unless it is approved by [CONTACT_120666] , study 
physician  and the Medical Monitor.    
 
In case of need, subjects will be transferred to the emergency room at the closest hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
as described in Section 8.4. Reasons for moving a patient to an E mergency Department 
(ED) would include, but not be limited to, severe headache in the setting of hypertension, 
angina, or neurological deficits regardless of blood pressure. The investigators and study 
physician may, at any time, make a clinical judgment t o transfer the patient to the ED for 
closer monitoring and additional treatment.  
 
The study physician  will be prepared to respond to rare complications of cardiovascular 
effects, such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction  (AMI). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404737] , and will notify the study 
physician if this occurs for on -site evaluation or a decision to initiate tr ansfer to the ED . 
If any subject  has neurological deficits, as assessed by [CONTACT_5989], whether or not 
they are associated with hypertensive crisis, they will receive oxygen and will be 
monitored as described above. If necessary, they  will be trans ported to the emergency 
department at the closest  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404738]. If evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404739] a nonhemorrhagic stroke, there will be time to administer recombinant tissue

experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated with hypertensive

described abov e. If necessary, he or she will be transported to the ED  or a location in the 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510379]  has had an AMI,  they will be well within the time 
frame required for definitive therapy. The American College of Cardiology/  American 
Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of AMI recommend percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) as the treatment of choice when it can be 
performed within [ADDRESS_510380] ECG 
evidence  of AMI [160]. 
 
7.2.2 Psychological Distress  
 
Mild anxiety and depressed mood are occasionally reported one to three  days after 
MDMA administration [64, 110, and see the IB ]. Psychological distress from MDMA 
could arise from the first indications of drug effects until t he last effects have dissipated 
(approximately three  to five hours after drug administration) , or even later . Anxiety or 
distress during the ses sion may last for as little as five  minutes or for as long as five hours  
or more . In addition, psychological dis tress could arise following an MDMA session as a 
result of subjects having difficulty integrating their experience after the MDMA effect 
has subsided. In previous Phase [ADDRESS_510381] 
with acute or sub -acute reaction s. The potential fo r destabilizing psychological distress 
will be minimized by:  
 
• Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed 
with bipolar affective disorder -1 or with psychotic disorders) . 
• Preparatory non -drug psychotherapy sessions before t he experimental session . 
• Creating an atmosphere of trust during the experimental session . 
• Close monitoring . 
• Daily contact [CONTACT_404804] a week after the experimental session  
• Providing non -drug integrative psychotherapy sessions . 
• Subjects will remain at the study site for the night of each experimental session to 
further reduce psychological distress. Qualified personnel will be available during 
the overnight stay to respond to the needs of the subject. Attendants will be 
instructed to cont act the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404741] a 
potential serious adverse event.  
 
During the preparatory sessions, subjects will be made aware of the fact that difficult 
emotions, including grief, rage and fear or panic, may arise durin g experimental sessions. 
Every effort will be made to help subjects resolve difficult symptoms and to arrive at a 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510382] is still severely 
agitated or experiencing any other severe psychological distress, the following measures 
will be taken:  
 
• If the subject is anxious, agitated, in danger of any self -harm or is suicidal at the 
end of the experimental session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404742]. During this time, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404743], will talk with the subject to help him or her gain 
cognitive perspective of their experiences, and will help them implement the self - 
soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the preparatory 
session. If this situation should occ ur during an integrative therapy session, at 
least one of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404744].  
• If a subject remains severely anxious, agitated or in danger of self -harm or 
suicide, or is otherwise psy chologically unstable at the end of this two -hour 
stabilization period, the clinical investigator will decide between the following 
options:  
1. A psychiatric nurse, therapeutic assistant , physician,  or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404745] s or her appointment with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404746]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404747] .  
2. If a subject experiences severe, persisting emotional distress, such as panic 
attacks, severe gener alized anxiety, or insomnia following an MDMA session, 
the study physician  may prescribe a rescue medic ation  such as a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_404748]'s clinical judgment.  This medication will be captured  on the 
concomitant medications CRF page. The physician  should not prescribe an 
SSRI, SNRI or MAOI in this context  unless it has been determined that the 
subject will be withdrawn from the study . Residual symptoms will be 
addressed during the frequent foll ow-up psychotherapy visits with the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . 
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194943]. If a subject should become psychotic  
arrangements will be made to stabilize them and transfer them to the ED if 
necessary.  
 
Subjects hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] a severe panic reacti on will be suspended from the protocol 
until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investigators will carefully evaluate 
the subject’s emotional status.   
 
For those subjects engaged in an ongoing therapeutic relationship with a psychotherapis t 
or psychiatrist, the subject’s outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404749]. For those subject s engaged in an ongoing psycho therapeutic

Page 53 of 81 relationship with the investigator(s), the management of any psychiatric com plications 
will be undertaken by [CONTACT_404805][INVESTIGATOR_11437].   
 
7.2.3 Body Temperature  
 
MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body 
temperature [110] and ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight 
elevation in humans.   
 
If temperature rises more than 1° C, attempts will be made to lower it by [CONTACT_404806], decreasing the ambient temperature and, if ne cessary, 
directing a fan toward the subject . If at any time the t emperature rises more than 1.5° C 
above baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], the study physician will be consulted for further 
evaluation and treatment .   
 
7.2.4 Reproductive and Developmental Risk s 
 
Risks posed by [CONTACT_147989]. One of two studies of Ecstasy 
users suggests that use of Ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be associated 
with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association [161, 162], 
and a third reported some developmental delays in mothers reporting use of ecstasy and  
other drugs during pregnancy [163]as discussed in the IB.   
 
Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from participation in the study , and 
women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before 
undergoing each experimental session and must agree to use birth control for the 
treatment portion  of the study.  
 
7.2.5 Potential Neurotoxicity Associated with Ecstasy Use  
 
Some researchers belie ve that MDMA is neurotoxic in humans even at doses used in 
clinical trials [164].  However, they are basing their case on studies that employed 
inappropriately high doses of MDMA utilized in animal studies, and on human studies 
comparing the effects of repeated use of ecstasy, often along with other drugs. 
Meanwhile, another recently published meta -analysis has taken careful steps to  overcome 
methodological limitations in previous work, and found only modest evidence of 
neurotoxicity [165]. We have carefully considered the risks of such neu rotoxicity and 
conclude that they are minimal in the proposed study. This conclusion is supported by 
[CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_404750]. More information on the potent ial neurotoxicity of 
MDMA can be found in the IB.   
 

MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510384] exhibits any signs of toxicity or 
clinically significant dilutional hyponatremia despi[INVESTIGATOR_404751],  they will not be given another experimental session unless it is 
approved by [CONTACT_120666] , study physician  and the Medical Monitor.    
 
7.3 Abuse Liability  
 
Findings in humans and animals suggests that MDMA possesse s moderate abuse 
potential that is higher than that reported for “classic hallucinogens” like psilocybin, but 
lower than that reported for psychostimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine. 
More information on abuse liability is provided in the IB.  
 
Whet her MDMA -assisted psychotherapy will cause PTSD patients to develop symptoms 
of abuse  is an open question  that the sponsor is addressing on an ongoing basis.  Based on 
long-term follow -up data from two sponsor -supported studies (N=32), o nly one subject  
took Ecstasy after completing the study and failed to reproduce the experience  from the 
study , and a number of subjects volunteered that they would never seek out Ecstasy 
outside a legal,  controlled, therapeutic setting . In addition, negative results from MDMA -
specific drug testing data obtained from the Swiss study MP -2 (N=12) supports that none 
of these subjects took Ecstasy outside of the study during the long -term follow -up period.   
 
Diversion is not an issue in this protocol because MDMA will only be admi nistered a few 
times under the supervision of the clinical investigator and no take -home doses will be 
permitted. MDMA will be handled following all regulations pertaining to the handling 
and dispensing of controlled substances within research studies.  
 
8.0 Adverse Events  
 
8.1 Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a clinical research study subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or dise ase, temporally associated with the 
subjects’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation 
in the research. This definition includes concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation 
of pre -existing conditions.  
 
MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510385] 19 , 2014  
 
Page 55 of 81 An unexp ected adverse event  is one that is not listed in the current IB or an event that is 
by [CONTACT_29288] a listed event.  
 
All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_404752], if the AE becomes 
chronic, a cause identified.   If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the protocol, a 
clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_1755]/or Medical Monitor as to 
whether continued follow -up of the AE is warranted.  
 
The severity of events reported on the “Adverse Events” CRF  will be determined by [CONTACT_404807]:  
 
• Mild: No limitation in normal daily activity.  
• Moderate: Some limitation in normal daily activity.  
• Severe: Unable to perform normal daily activity.  
 
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be det ermined by [CONTACT_404808]:  
 
1. Not Related  
 
The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product has not occurred, or the 
occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered un likely 
to be related to use of the investigational product, i.e. there are no facts (evidence) or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, or the AE is more likely related to the 
subject’s pre -existing condition.  
 
2. Possibly Related  
 
The administration  of the investigational product and AE are considered reasonably  
related in time and the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_150916].  
 
3. Probably Related  
 
Exposure to the investigational product and AE are reasonab ly related in time and the  
investigational product is more likely than other causes to be responsible for the AE, or is 
the most likely cause of the AE.

document.  
 
During or after the study , the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or representatives of the 
Sponsor  may request access to all source documents, CRFs and other protocol 
documentation for on -site audit or inspection.  
MAPS Study MP -[ADDRESS_510401] size of  the three doses for 
all outcome measures for Stage 1, Stage 2, and 12 months after the final experimental 
session will be estimated using Cohen ’s techni ques.  
 
The Sponsor will examine each active dose group and the comparator dose group for 
homogeneity through comparing demographic characteristics. There is no expectation 
that conditions will differ in composition by [CONTACT_547], race or ethnicity, duration of  PTSD 
diagnosis or presence versus absence of other permitted psychiatric disorders, as 
depression. However, owing to small sample size, such variations may arise by [CONTACT_3364].  
 
The Sponsor  will examine CAPS scores for the primary outcome analysis at baseline  and 
the primary endpoint  in each active dose and comparator dose conditions. Active dose 1 
and active dose 2 CAPS data at the primary endpoint will be tested for equivalence using 
confidence intervals. If the two groups are found to be equivalent, then ou tcomes for the 
active dose groups will be combined and will be tested for significant differences from 
the comparator group using difference scores in independent sample t -tests, with p value 
set at 0.05 . If CAPS scores for active dose 1 are not equivalent  to active dose 2,  then 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare outcomes from all three groups. 
Additional exploratory analyses comparing the effect of a third experimental session with 
either active dose [ADDRESS_510402] 
experimental session.  
 
For exploratory purposes, t he spon sor will examine individual PDS, BDI -II, GAF, PSQI, 
PTGI, and DES -II scores at baseline and the primary endpoint  in each active dose and 
comparator dose conditions. A nalysis of variance , or nonparametric analysis if 
assumptions are not met, will be used to  compare the dose conditions for change in BDI -
II, PTGI, PSQI, GAF, and DES -II scores separately. If scores cannot be examined 
sufficiently in this model, then analyses will compare available data through the use of 
difference scores.  
 
Changes in CAPS  from the primary /secondary  endpoint to the two -month follow -up in 
Stage 1/Stage [ADDRESS_510403] analysis of crossover 
participants in Stage 2.  
 
A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed upon PDS scores 
at baseline, after each experimental session, and at the end of Stage 1, with p value set at 
0.05. Condition will serve as a between -subjects factor. Results of ANOVA analysis will 
be used to examine the effects of each experimental session on self -reported PTSD 
symptom severity. PDS and CAPS scores will be correlated via Pearson’s product 
moment correlation at baseline and the primary endpoint to provide a comparison of a 
self-report measure with a clinician -administered measure of PTSD symptoms.    
 
The sponsor  will compute descriptive statistics for SOCQ sc ores from after each MDMA -
assisted psychotherapy session, and average SOCQ scores for blinded experimental 
sessions will be compared between condition s. The data will be explored for effects of 
condition on domain scores in the  SOCQ.  
 
The sponsor will coll ect Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain  visual analog scale scores from 
any subject reporting tinnitus or chronic pain during each point of administration, 
including baseline, experimental and integrative sessions, the primary endpoint, and two -
month follow -up. The sponsor will plot out and examine all c hanges in tinnitus and/or 
pain visual analog scale  scores across both groups and in each active dose group and the 
comparator dose group for trends. Formal analysis of changes in tinnitus and/or pain 
visual anal og scale scores will only occur if three or more subjects complete changes in 
tinnitus and/or pain visual analog scale at baseline and primary endpoint. Likewise, 
formal between -groups analyses will not be performed if all primary endpoint scores are 
from subjects assigned to the same condition. The sponsor will perform an independent t -
test on the difference between baseline and primary endpoint Changes in Tinnitus and/or 
Pain visual analog scale scores between each active dose and comparator dose conditio ns, 
with p. set at 0.05. If the only scores available are for subjects in a single condition, then 
a paired t -test will be performed comparing baseline and primary endpoint Changes in 
Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores, with p. set at 0.05.    
 
Perception of the experimental sessions will be examined during Stage [ADDRESS_510404] 
session for future protocol development. These data may be correlated with 
primary/secondary endpoint CAPS data compared to end of Stage 1/Stage [ADDRESS_510405] analysis with p  value  set at 0.05.  
 
The sponsor will compare baseline and primary endpoint  RBANS and PASAT scores in 
each active dose group and comparator dose groups. Active dose 1 and active dose 2 
RBANS and PASAT data will be tested for equivalence using confidence in tervals. If the 
two groups are found to be equivalent, then outcomes for the active dose groups will be 
combined and will be tested for significant differences from the comparator group using 
difference scores in independent sample t -tests, with p value se t at 0.05 . If scores for 
active dose 1 are not equivalent to  active dose 2,  then analysis of variance (ANOVA) will 
be used to compare outcomes from all three groups.  The sponsor will examine the effects 
of maximal exposure to MDMA on neurocognitive functi on using the RBANS and 
PASAT by [CONTACT_746] a within -subject  repeated measures ANOVA with time of 
administration  as a within -subjects factor.  
 
The sponsor  will collect ratings  of adherence to the treatment manual  from specifically  
selected types of session s. Descriptive statistics will be computed for each adherence 
scale within a given session. The sponsor will explore the factors and structure of the 
measures of adherence to assist in further development of adherence and competence 
measures. If sufficient  data is available, the sponsor will correlate the mean adherence 
ratings for adherence scale and session type with Global CAPS scores to investigate the 
effects of adherence to the treatment manual on reduction in PTSD symptoms. If it is 
found that there are specific factors within the adherence scales, then the factor will be 
correlated with Global CAPS score.  
 
Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the primary endpoint will be asked to 
complete an outcome assessment prior to continuing to the long -term follow -up. The data 
from these subjects will be tested for equivalence to data from subjects completing the 
study per protocol. If found to be equivalent, data from these subjects will be presented as 
an exploratory Intent -to-treat analysis to examine results without bias towards subjects 
more likely to complete the study per protocol, with last observation carried forward.

rate and body temperature for subject s during experimental sessions. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404765] , as described in Section 8.5. 
Descriptive statistics will be computed for vital signs and subjective distress during each 
experimental or open -label sessio n. Whenever possible, the sponsor will compare peak 
blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature after active dose 1, active dose [ADDRESS_510406] 
size is large.  
 
Analyses of MAPS’ completed U .S. study of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in [ADDRESS_510407] size of 1.24 for treatment efficacy, as represented by 
[CONTACT_404811] [166]. The estimated effect size for this study may be lower as a 
result of comparing each active  dose with the comparator  dose instead of with an inactive 
placebo, small sample size , and unequal distribution of conditions. The sponsor  intends to 
pool data across studies or perform meta -analyses of CAPS scores across all pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].  
 
The sponsor  used Java applications created b y Lenth to calculate estimated statistical 
power for  the primary outcome measure of this study . The calculation assumed that 
active dose [ADDRESS_510408] of two ses sions of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy on 
symptoms of PTSD [167], reducing the effect size to account for the hypothesized ef fects 
of using a comparator do se of [ADDRESS_510409] size of 0. 55, but higher than previously calculated prior to the 
addition of these subjects . Statistical power estimates were not available for secondary 
and exploratory measures, as they were previously not used in sponsor -supported studies.

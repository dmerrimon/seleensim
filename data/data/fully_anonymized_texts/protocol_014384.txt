2. BACKGROUND 
 
      2.1 Disease 
 
  Poor risk AML and MDS and allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
 
 The prognosis of AML with poor risk cytogenetics treated with conventional 
chemotherapy is dismal with 5 year overall survival rates ranging from 4-14%1. 
Similarly, the outlook for patients with intermediate-[ADDRESS_324966] confirmed its potentially curative role for these 
diseases. But even after transplant outcomes are worse for patients with adverse risk 
factors, particularly patients with monosomal karyotypes3.  A study by [CONTACT_267114] 5 and 7 
abnormalities showed a 25% 3-year overall survival rate.  Benefits were confined to 
 
 2 
 patients younger than 40 years of age with overall survival of 38% versus 8% for 
those older than 404. 
   
 More recent studies for both high risk AML and MDS as well as secondary AML still 
show a long term overall survival rate between 20% and 45%  after allogeneic 
transplants5,6,7.  Recurrence of leukemia constitutes the most important cause of 
treatment failure for patients transplanted in remission.  The ultimate objective of our 
proposed study is to develop strategies to further improve the outcomes of allogeneic 
transplantation in high risk patients. 
 
  Evolution of transplant related mortality and relapse rate 
 
In the past decade, the outcome of stem cell transplantation has significantly 
improved, in part due to the advances of conditioning regimens as well as improved 
supportive care. While the risk of non-relapse mortality has been reduced by 52% 
since the years [ADDRESS_324967] reduction of 21%8.Reductions in the intensity of the pretransplant 
conditioning have opened the option of an allogeneic stem cell transplant to patients 
previously thought not fit for the procedure but the success of non-myeloablative 
transplants is compromised by [CONTACT_267115] 40-50% (9,10 ). 
A recent retrospective analysis of over [ADDRESS_324968] 
remained unchanged (11 ).  The development of conditioning regimens with increased 
antileukemic efficacy but limited toxicity represents a major challenge.  
It is with this purpose that we propose a novel strategy to enhance the susceptibility 
of leukemic cells to the conditioning regimen. 
 
DNA methylation and sensitivity to chemotherapy 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_267096], a process that may be reversed through 
hypomethylating agents (12, 13). There is now burgeoning preclinical evidence for a 
chemosensitizing effect of the hypomethylating agents 5-Azacytidine and Decitabine 
for a range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors as well as their ability to 
restore disrupted proapoptotic pathways (13, 14, 15, 16, 17 ).  
Furthermore, a prospective study conducted at our center by [CONTACT_267116] (18).  Although it was a phase 1 study not designed to assess 
efficacy there was an encouraging CR rate of 83% for intermediate and poor risk 
AML patients. 
In the current study we plan to use azacytidine based chemosensitization prior to 
transplant with a well-established conditioning regimen,

 2.2 Investigational Agent 
 
  5-Azacytidine 
 
5-Azacitidine (4-amino -1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2(1 H)-one) is an analog of 
the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, cytidine. It differs from cytidine 
in having nitrogen in the 5-position of the heterocyclic ring 
Therapeutic classification: At lower doses acts as DNA-hypomethylating agent. 
At higher doses acts as a cytidine analog. 
 
Pharmacological data:  5-azacytidine is supplied as a lyophilized powder in 
single-use vials containing 100 mg of each 5-azacytidine and mannitol as a 
freeze dried cake or powder. It is reconstituted with 4ml of sterile water per 100 
mg of drug. 
Dosing information: The usual dose is 75 to 100 mg per m2 by [CONTACT_267117] 7 days, repeated every 4 weeks. 
Drug interactions: none known 
Side effects: Myelosuppressio n, with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
and febrile neutropenia is the major dose limiting toxicity of 5-azacytidine. 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain are common. 
Signs of CNS depression, including lethargy, confusion and coma have been 
reported. 
Laboratory abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, 
hypokalemia, and elevations of liver function tests are common. 
Mechanism of action: At lower doses, 5-azacytidine causes hypomethylation of 
DNA. In neoplastic cells, this hypomethylation can either induce apoptosis or 
restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular 
differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. At higher doses, it acts as a cytidine 
analog, becoming incorporated into nucleic acids, and causing DNA transcription 
and replication errors. Nonproliferating cells are relatively insensitive to 5-
azacytidine. 
Pharmacokinetics/metabolism: The currently available form of the drug is not 
orally bioavailable. Following administration, the drug is activated inside cells to 
its triphosphate form. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the 
urine. The elimination half time is about [ADDRESS_324969] prophylaxis on a study 
previously published by [CONTACT_267118]. combining a Fludarabine/Melphalan based 
reduced intensity conditioning regimen with Alemtuzumab as an in vivo T-cell 
depleting agent with standard risk AML and MDS as indication.  While retaining the 
efficacy of the prior regimen of Fludarabine/Melphalan without T-cell depletion, this 
regimen has shown remarkably low rates of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (10%) and 
extensive chronic GVHD (18%). Overall survival at 18 months was 48% (19,20,21). 
 
 [ADDRESS_324970] 20 years despi[INVESTIGATOR_267097] (8,9). 
 
Given the wealth of preclinical data on the chemotherapy sensitizing effect of 
hypomethylating agents on a wide range of tumors (12-17) and the proof of principle 
of clinical feasibility of this concept in AML (18) there is rationale to employ 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_267098]. In the 
study conducted by [CONTACT_267119], increased hematologic toxicity had been a concern 
initially, but in fact there was a suggestion of more rapid platelet recovery and no 
delay in neutrophil recovery in the patients undergoing pre induction Decitabine, 
dispelling this fear. 
Furthermore, in the case of allogeneic transplantation, hematologic toxicity is not a 
major concern as recovery is based on engraftment of allogeneic cells and given the 
short half life of 5-Azacytidine (4 hours), there should no longer be any clinically 
relevant serum drug levels at the time of transplantation. 
 
The dosing of 5-azacytidine is derived from both clinical experience and preclinical 
efficacy studies comparing the hypomethylating activity of 5-azacyidine and 
decitabine which showed a 2 to 10 fold stronger hypomethylating activity on AML 
cells for decitabine compared to 5-azacytidine.(22). 
The routine dose for 5-a zacytidine to treat MDS is 75 mg/m2 for 7 days. (23). Our 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_267099] 20 mg/m2 /d either as 1h infusion or 
24h CVI for 3, 5 or 7 days and no significant difference in the global hypomethylating 
activity was found. 
Given the possibility of administering 5-azacytidine subcutaneously without the need 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267100]. A dosing schedule of 50 
mg/m2/d for [ADDRESS_324971]-priming 
measurements of the methylation status of the HIST1H2AA gene in bone marrow 
samples (see below).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_324972] established that 5-azacytidine is a potent hypomethylating agent capable of 
decreasing both universal cytosine methylation (at repetitive elements, or in total 
hydrolyzed genomic DNA) and select CpG Island methylation.  
 
 5 
 As a measure of 5-azacytidine’s ability to induce genome wide hypomethylation we 
will measure the methylation status of the HIST1H2AA gene in in CD 34+ bone 
marrow cells, which can serve as a surrogate marker for global gene methylation status 
(18).  
 
We will then compare patient samples obtained before, and immediately following 
priming treatment to establish the pharmacodynamic activity of 5-azacytidine.

    5.4        Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
As the stem cell transplantation is a non-repetitive intervention there will be no cycles 
of treatment. Patients will be followed for disease free and overall survival as well as 
for secondary endpoints.  They will remain on study until one of the following occurs 
 
o Disease recurrence 
 
o Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 
o Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
 
o Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
o General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_324983].  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
  
Given the higher than expected rate of grade [ADDRESS_324984] 12 patients  were 
treated with azacytidine 75m/m2 daily x 5 days  (2 with grade 3, 2 with grade 4) we will reduce 
the dose of Azacytidine to 50 mg/m2  daily x [ADDRESS_324985] six patients, then the dose of azacyt idine will be further reduced 
to 32 mg/m2 / day x [ADDRESS_324986] six patients 
at the 32 mg/m2/d level, the trial will be considered too toxic and closed for accrual.  If one or 
fewer grade 3 or 4 renal toxicities occur, accrual will continue at this dose level with close 
continuous observation for renal toxicity.  
7. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
investigator will be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings that 
suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects, or precautions pertinent to the 
safe use of the drug under investigation.  Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_267125], as well as by [CONTACT_267126], x-rays, electrocardiographs, etc. 
For the purposes of this study, the pre-conditioning 5-azacytidine administration is the only 
investigational component of the treatment. All other components (conditioning therapy, 
gvhd prophylaxis, transplant etc.) are considered standard interventions.  
 
7.1  Investigational Agent Risks:  
 
5-Azacytidine: 
 
Myelosuppression, with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and febrile 
neutropenia is the major dose limiting toxicity of 5-azacytidine. 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain are common. 
Signs of CNS depression, including lethargy, confusion and coma have been reported. 
Laboratory abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and 
elevations of liver function tests are common. 
 
7.2  Adverse Event Characteristics   
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
 
 13 
 (CTCAE) version 4 .0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
 Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
- Probable –  The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated –  The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
 
7.3  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events and SAE 
 
 All infections, acute GVHD and any other grade 3 or higher adverse events will be 
recorded on a patient specific adverse event log.  The AE log will be maintained by [CONTACT_267127]’s research chart.  
 Stem Cell transplant is a complex procedure with prolonged initial admission and 
numerous immediate and delayed complications as well as frequent readmissions. 
 
 Expected adverse events are those listed in the consent form and include regimen-related 
toxicities, myelosuppression, opportunistic infections and GVHD.   Expected adverse 
events of grade III and higher CTC severity will be captured in the transplant database 
and reported to the IRB upon request.  
 
 
 Grade three or higher adverse events that are judged to be unexpected and possibly 
related to the investigational procedure, will be reported to the study chairman within 48 
hours of investigator notification. Such events will be reported to the local IRB within 
the institution’s prescribed time period. 
 
 All fatal Adverse Events will also be reported to the study chairman within 48 hours and 
reported to the local IRB within the institution’s prescribed time period.

8.5 Other agents and procedures: 
 
 Melphalan:  
 
Therapeutic Classification: Alkylating agent. 
Pharmaceutical data: Supplied as 50 mg vials reconstitute in 10 ml of diluent. 
Stability and storage: Reconstituted solution retains 90% potency for about [ADDRESS_324989] packages can be stored at room 
temperature. 
Route of Administration: intravenous, oral, intraperitoneal. 
Side effects: Dose limiting toxicity is hematological. Possible delayed toxicity in patients 
with irradiated bone marrow. Gastrointestinal toxicity is infrequent and usually mild; 
occasional azotemia has been reported in certain cases. Tissue necrosis may result if 
infiltration occurs.  
Mechanism of action: Interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA and 
ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid function. 
Human Pharmacology: Melphalan is incompletely and erratically absorbed, has a 
prolonged plasma half-life, and is excreted largely unchanged in the urine. Intravenous 
melphalan result in very high peak concentration, plasma levels followed by [CONTACT_267128] (half-life 30-60 minutes). Most of the administered dose is recovered in 
the urine, almost none in the feces, and no significant quantity of any metabolite has been 
identified.   
Human Toxicology: Myelosuppresion is the major toxicity and is dose related. Nausea and 
vomiting is almost uniformly observed, mucositis and diarrhea have also been observed. 
Transient rises in BUN and creatinine have occurred with high dose melphalan as also 
acute renal failure. Hypersensitivity reactions to high dose melphalan have been reported. 
 
Fludarabine: 
 
Fludarabine is the 2-fluoro, 5-phosphate derivative of vidarabine.     
 
 16 
  
DOSING INFORMATION:  Doses of 25 mg/mL(2)/day (30-minute infusion) for 5 days 
every 4 weeks has been effective previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia; in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a loading dose of 20 mg/m(2) intravenously 
followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 30 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 48 hours, has 
been effective; dose reductions are suggested in renal insufficiency. 
 
PHARMACOKINETICS:  Following intravenous administration, fludarabine phosphate is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_267107] 2-fluoro-vidarabine, which subsequently enters tumor cells 
and is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate derivative; peak plasma levels of 
2-fluoro-vidarabine have ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 mcg/mL following a short infusion of 25 
mg/m(2) fludarabine; 24% of a dose of fludarabine is recovered in the urine as 
2-fluoro-vidarabine; the elimination half-life of 2-fluoro-vidarabine is 9 hours. 
     
CAUTIONS:  Myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia, is the predominant adverse 
effect; a severe neurotoxicity has been observed, mainly with higher doses; other adverse 
effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin rash, and somnolence; 
pneumonitis has been reported in 1 patient.        
                                       
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS:  Intravenous fludarabine has been highly effective in 
heavily pretreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; the drug has also produced 
responses in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute leukemia; however, 
neurotoxicity has been a major concern, even with low doses, and more studies are needed 
to clarify its ultimate place in therapy. 
 
Alemtuzumab: 
 
Therapeutic Classification: Humanized monoclonal antibody 
 
Side effects: The infusion of Alemtuzumab has been associated with fever, nausea, 
headache, vomiting, rash, chills and rigor. Occasionally hypotension and bronchospasm 
have been reported. This can be managed by [CONTACT_267129]. 
 
Pharmaceutical Data: Alemtuzumab is supplied as a purified preparation diluted in PBS 
with 0.05 mm EDTA. Each Ampoule contains 30 mg of Alemtuzumab. 
 
Administration: 20 mg of Alemtuzumab is given intravenously or subcutaneously for 3 to 
5 days. 
 
Mechanism of Action: Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_267108] T- and B- lymphocytes, but not on NK cells. It has 
 
 17 
 been extensively used for the prevention of GVHD both in vitro and in vivo. 
 
 
Tacrolimus: 
 
  TACROLIMUS is a macrolide compound with potent immunosuppressant properties.                              
    DOSING INFORMATION:  TACROLIMUS is usually given intravenously initially in 
doses of 0.03 mg/kg/day for 3 days, followed by [CONTACT_267130] (0.09 mg/kg 
twice daily); dose adjustments are required in patients with hepatic dysfunction.                      
   
PHARMACOKINETICS:  The oral absorption of TACROLIMUS is erratic and 
incomplete; absolute bioavailability is approximately 25%; peak serum levels are seen [ADDRESS_324990] ranged from 0.2 to 6 
ng/mL; TACROLIMUS is extensively metabolized in the liver, with only small amounts of 
unchanged drug (2% or less) being recovered in the urine; the elimination half-life of 
TACROLIMUS is approximately 10 h.     
                                    
    CAUTIONS:  Common adverse effects of TACROLIMUS are headache, hyperesthesia, 
tremors, circumoral numbness, insomnia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and appetite       
insomnia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and appetite changes; all of these effects occur 
primarily with IV TACROLIMUS and are more frequent during combined use of 
TACROLIMUS and CYCLOSPORINE; other adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, 
hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, dysphasia, photophobia, flushing, and 
lymphoproliferative disorder; unlike CYCLOSPORINE, hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, 
and hypertension are generally not seen with TACROLIMUS; combined therapy with 
CYCLOSPORINE has resulted in increases in cyclosporine serum levels and more severe 
nephrotoxicity.               
 
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS:  TACROLIMUS is primarily indicated for prophylaxis of 
organ rejection in patients receiving an allogeneic liver transplant.

hepatic function. 
9. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES 
 
9.1 Laboratory Correlative Studies 
Bone marrow samples  (3 to 5 mL) will be obtained by [CONTACT_737], or co-
investigator, within [ADDRESS_324991] 
 
 19 
 dose of 5-azacytidine (day - 6).  Samples will be processed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_267139] at Weill Medical College of Cornell University.  
These samples will serve to measure global gene methylation status through 
HIST1H2AA methylation evaluation. 
10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
 
Disease-free survival is the primary endpoint. Bone marrow biopsies at days +30, 
+100, +180, +[ADDRESS_324992] recurrent 
disease. As the patients will be monitored after stem cell transplantation on a very 
regular basis (at least weekly for the first 3 months), it will be at the investigators 
discretion to perform a bone marrow biopsy outside of these time points if a change 
in blood counts raises the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_267109]. Relapse will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_267134], if these cells were on 
subsequent testing confirmed to be increasing in number. The diagnosis of disease 
recurrence will be based on clinical and pathological criteria. 
 
Toxicity will be scored according to the Bearman criteria,(25, 26 ) (Appendix B) and 
acute GVHD will be scored according to the criteria proposed by [CONTACT_267135][INVESTIGATOR_267110].(24) Chronic GVHD will be scored according to appendix D. Limited Chronic 
GVHD is defined as GVHD with limited skin involvement only or presenting with 
liver function abnormalities only. All other presentations of chronic GVHD are 
defined as extensive and will require treatment. 
 
High risk extensive chronic GVHD is characterized by [CONTACT_267136] (<100,000/mm3). (12) 
 
Myeloid engraftment will be defined as the first day in which the ANC is > 500/mm3 
for three consecutive days. Cytogenetic and chimerism studies will be performed to 
confirm donor origin. 
  
Platelet engraftment will be defined as the first day the platelet count is > 
20,000/mm3 without transfusion support for seven consecutive days.  
 
Failure to engraft will be defined as lack of evidence of hematopoietic recovery 
(ANC < 500/mm3 and platelet count < 20,000/mm3 ) by [CONTACT_4475] +35, confirmed by a 
biopsy revealing a marrow cellularity < 5%. Graft failure will be defined as initial 
myeloid engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] +35, documented to be of donor origin, followed by a 
drop in the ANC to < 500/mm3 for more than three days, independent of any 
myelosuppressive drugs, severe GVHD, CMV, or other infection.  
 
Graft rejection will be defined as graft failure with documentation of return of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_267111]/or chimerism studies.

 11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Data Collection 
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture all treatment, 
toxicity, and efficacy data for all enrolled patients.  
11.1.1  REDCap 
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software 
system that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421]-Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool 
for the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web-
based data-entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features including 
user and group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP system, with a 
full audit trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on 
CTSC-owned servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted (SSL-based) 
connections.  Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced and supported through 
a multi-institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422]. 
 
 
11.1.2  Regulatory Considerations 
 
All protocol amendments and consent form modifications will be made by [CONTACT_1268]. 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1 Statistical Design 
 The primary endpoint will be disease-free survival (DFS), as measured from the 
start of the treatment to the date of either documentation of disease recurrence or death.  
The diagnosis of disease recurrence will be based on clinical and pathological criteria.  
All patients will be observed for a minimum of one year.  The 1-year DFS for patients in 
the study cohort has been estimated to be 35%; therefore, the target 1-year DFS for the 
regimen under evaluation will be 50%.  We will define “evaluable” patients as patients 
who met eligibility requirements, have initiated therapy, and were not removed from the 
study for non-compliance or patient withdrawal within the first 12 months.  Sample size 
recommendations for the phase II design are determined according to A’Hern’s exact 
single-stage phase II design (28 ).  We project a DFS at 1 year of 35%, below which the 
regimen will be unacceptable, and a DFS at 1 year of 50%, above which the regimen will 
be considered worthy of further exploration.  The null hypothesis that the 1-year DFS 
proportion is less than or equal to 35% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis 
that the 1-year DFS proportion is greater than or equal to 50%. 
 
The sample size computations were performed assuming a 10% level of significance and 
80% power.  Patients will be continuously accrued throughout the study up to a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_324993] single-stage design yields a ≥ 0.80 
probability of a positive result if the true DFS proportion at 12 months is ≥ 50%.  It yields 
a ≥ 0.90 probability of a negative result if the true D FS proportion at 12 months is ≤ 35%.  
A 95% confidence interval constructed around the expected 12-month DFS proportion of 
50% can be estimated to be within ± 14.0% of the observed DFS proportion.  Assuming 
10% are unevaluable/ineligible, we anticipate that a total of [ADDRESS_324994] Disease (Acute GVHD) 
 
Our hypothesis is that the graft failure rate is ≤5%. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_267112] [ADDRESS_324995] graft failure, the 
trial will be terminated. 
 
The expected transplant related mortality should not exceed 25%. The trial will be 
considered for termination for safety concerns if by [CONTACT_4475] +180,  [ADDRESS_324996] disease, we will be operating 
under the hypothesis that the rate is ≤30%. The trial will be considered for 
termination if by [CONTACT_4475] [PHONE_5581] of the first 10, [ADDRESS_324997] 20 
patients develop grade 3-4 acute GVHD. 
 
 12.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
 
The planned sample size will be [ADDRESS_324998] an accrual rate of 2-3 
patients per month 
 
12.4 Analysis of Endpoints 
 
Analysis Plan for Endpoints:  
   Primary Endpoint:  
  The primary endpoint is the DFS proportion at 1 year; A 95% confidence interval will be 
estimated for the 1-year DFS proportion via binomial proportions.  
 
   Secondary endpoints: 
  Secondary endpoints include graft failure, acute graft versus host disease, high risk 
extensive chronic graft versus host disease, and overall survival (OS).  Median DFS and 
OS, including survival curves, will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  
Greenwood’s formula will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the Kaplan-
Meier estimates. 
 
  All analyses will be performed in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
 
 22 
 Carolina) and STATA Version 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, [LOCATION_007]).

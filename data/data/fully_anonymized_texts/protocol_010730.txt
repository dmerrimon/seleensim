Protocol Title: Two and three dimensional c ontrast-enhanced ultrasound for screeni ng of renal cell 
carcinoma recurrence following cryoablation  
 
Trial Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to:  
· Evaluate if contrast -enhanced ultrasound can be used to successfully detect recurrence  of renal cell 
carcinoma following cryoablati on therapy when compared to the gold standards of contrast enhanced 
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.   
 
The secondary aim of this trial is to:  
· Establish whether three -dimensional contrast -enhanced ultrasound provides superior screening of 
renal cell carcinoma recurrence relative to two -dimensional contrast -enhanced ultrasound.    
 
Trial Design:  This is an open -label, non -randomized trial that will be conducted at one clinical site.  The 
subject population will be patients scheduled for follow up contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of a previously cryoablatated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) through 
Thomas Jefferson University’s Urology clinic.   Eligible f ollow up imaging will include patients being 
seen for an 8, 12, 18, 24, or [ADDRESS_206951]/MRI follow up.  The study will consist of a single ultrasound 
exam, although p atients will be eligible  to re-enroll in  multiple studies  (for example  exams at 8, 12 and 18 
months), if these exams fit within the study  timeframe.  
 
Ultrasound imaging will be performed using a state of the art  ultrasound scanner with two and three 
dimensional curvilinear transducer s.  If available, image fusion may also be used from patient’s previous 
MR/CT imaging.  Patients will first u ndergo baseline grayscale B -mode and power Doppler imaging 
(PDI) of the treated mass.  Patients will then receive a bolus [ADDRESS_206952] injection  of Optison (GE 
Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) , while being imaged with two-dimensional (2D) dual mode B -mode / coded 
harmonic  imaging.  Following a [ADDRESS_206953] agent along with three -dimensional (3D) nonlinear imaging.  Tumor 
vascularity and flow kinetics will be determi ned using  both modes  and compared to the patient’s 
corresponding contrast -enhanced MRI or CT exams.  
 
Trial Population: This trial will consist of up to 1 00 adults  (18 years of age or older) who have previously 
undergone cryo ablation  of RCC at Thomas Jeffer son University.  
 
Trial Procedures: Subjects eligible for trial enrollment will be identified by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators, Drs. 
 4 Shaw , Lallas and Trabulsi  from their patient population of subjects being seen for follow up of a 
cryoablated renal mass.   These pat ients will be accrued from the Urology department, as well as from the 
Small Renal Mass Center at the Genitourinary Multidisciplinary Cancer Center of the Kimmel Cancer 
Center at Thomas Jefferson University.   Current clinically -indicated follow up interval s include 8, 12, 18, 
24, or 36 MR/CT post cryoablation.  A research coordinator will explain the study to the patient.   The 
patient will be given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and ask questions about 
participation.  The coordinator w ill review the consent form with the patient and then the patient will be 
given the form to review.  The patient, coordinator, and a study investigator will all sign the consent form. 
The patient will be given a copy of the signed consent form for their re cords.  
 
After consenting to participate in this study, a  full demographic profile, known drug allergies or 
intolerances, and review of the subject’s medical/surgical history will be recorded .  If the subject is a 
woman of childbearing potential, she will h ave a urine pregnancy test (the results of which will be made 
available to the subject prior to study initiation).   
 
Study participation will consist of a single ultrasound exam. A baseline ultrasound grayscale scan will be 
used to identify the tumor and to evaluate the following criteria: size, shape, and orientation of the lesion; 
echogenicity compared to surrounding tissue.  Standard PDI of the lesion will also be performed.  When 
possible, previous MR/CT data will be uploaded onto the scanner in order to perform image fusion for 
ultrasound guidance during imaging.  The distribution of color signals and the overall color content of the 
tumor will be evaluated by [CONTACT_176818].   
Following baseli ne scanning, patients will receive  a 1 ml  intravenous injections of Optison (GE 
Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) in a peripheral vein followed by [CONTACT_176819] 2D coded harmonic 
imaging (CHI; a nonlinear contrast imaging package).  Ten  minutes after the 2D contrast -enhanced 
ultrasound (CEUS)  exam, patients will  receive a second bolus in jection of Optison followed by 3 D CHI 
(using a curvilinear 3D array ).  All contrast injections will be supervised by a board certified physician. 
Resuscitation equipment an d trained personnel will be immediate proximity to the patient during each 
contrast -enhanced ultrasound exam.  Digital clips of th e exam s will be recorded through the contrast 
agent wash -in and wash -out phases for at least two minutes and stored for later use.  The subject will then 
be monitored fo r adverse reactions for [ADDRESS_206954] -enhanced MRI/CT exam  will be 
 [ADDRESS_206955] enhancement within the ablation cavity.  Finally, following a one month wait period and 
randomization, readers will again review cases in order to calculate intra -reader variability.   
 
The proposed agent for the current study, Optison  is a sterile non -pyrogenic suspension of encapsulated 
perflutren microbubbles [Goldberg et al 2001; Miller & Nanda 2004].  The contrast  agent is consists of a 
human serum albumin shell with perflutren core and contains 5.0 - 8.0 x 108 microspheres/ ml.  The 
microbubble agent is supplied in a standard -size 3 ml vial and is prepared by [CONTACT_176820].  
Optison will be stored in a  secure refrigerator, with only the study investigators and research personnel 
having access.  Optison is currently only approved for use in echocardiography.  The agent will be used as 
an off -label indication for this study.   
 
Statistical Methodology: Th is project is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_176806] .  
Our statistical analysis will address two major questions:   
1. Does renal mass vascularity and blood flow kinetics measured on  CEUS correlate with 
findings on contrast -enhanced MRI/CT (and thus, can be used as a possible recurrence 
screening imaging alternative)?  
2. Does the inclusion of volumetric ultrasound improve the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS 
for monitoring recurrence of RCC post cryotherapy?  
 
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value will be 
calculated for the CEUS exam s using both the standard of care  contrast -enhanced MRI or CT, or 
pathology when retreatment is indic ated as the reference standards.  The dichotomous parameter needed 
for these calculations will be derived by [CONTACT_176821] d during the CEUS study.  
This parameter will be based off of each reader’s first read.  In the event of discordant readings during 
this analysis, recurrence will be decided by [CONTACT_176822].  Correlations between these 
findings and both contrast -enhance d cross -sectional findings and patient outcomes will be compared 
using the Fisher exact test.  Inter - and intra -observer variability will also be calculated.  Quantitative 
parameters of mass vascularity, changes in perfusion, and changes in contrast fill t ime will also be 
 [ADDRESS_206956].  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is becoming increasingly common within the US, with over 64,000 new 
cases and 13,500 deaths expected to occur in 2012 [NCI 2012].  Detection  rates of RCC have doubled 
over the last 50 years, with nearly half of reported cases being detected incidentally during cross sectional 
imaging [Venkatesan et al. 2011].  While surgical extirpation remains the standard of care, cryoablation 
therapy is pla ying a larger role in the treatment of poor surgical candidates and also can preserve renal 
function [Levinson et al 2008].   Cryoablation is performed at our institution using a Cryocare Surgical 
System (HealthTronics, Austin TX; formerly EndocareInc, Irvi ne CA), an FDA approved device for the 
ablation of malignant tissues (510(k) K003811).  Protocols for follow up imaging vary, but mainly rely on 
contrast -enhanced CT or MRI [ADDRESS_206957] cryoablation to evaluate effective ablation based on a lack 
of vasc ularity within the mass as well as a reduction in tumor volume [Gervais et al 2008b; Zagoria 
2004].   At our institution contrast -enhanced CT or MRI at [ADDRESS_206958] -ablation 
inflammation [Thumar et al. 2010].  Assuming successful treatment, serial follow up imaging is then 
scheduled in [ADDRESS_206959] 
been associated with nephro -toxicity (iodinated contrast) and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (gadolinium -
based contrast) [FDA Alert 2006] and are not we ll suited for a patient population with compromised renal 
function.  Thus, an imaging technique which could effectively screen for recurrence  without the 
associated adverse renal side effects would be beneficial in this patient population.   
 
Ultrasound co ntrast agents are gas filled microbubbles, encapsulated by a lipid shell for stability.  Due to 
their size (1 -8 μm in diameter), these agents are small enough to pass through the pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], 
but still restricted to the vascular system [Goldberg et al. 2001].  These microbubbles have been approved 
for use echocardiography in the [LOCATION_002] and also for the characterization of liver lesions throughout 
Europe and Asia [Bouakaz and de Jong, 2007].  This project will investigat e the applicability o f CEUS 
for monitoring RCC recurrence post  cryoablation  using both 2D and 3D ultrasound .  Because ultrasound 
contrast agents act as a blood pooling agent, enhancement and contrast kinetics on CEUS are expected to 
correlate well to those observed on MR/CT.  
 
1.1 Background  
 7 Kidney and renal pelvis cancers account for 5 and 3% of new cases of cancer diagnosis in US men and 
women , respectively [ACS 2011].  When clinical intervention is deemed necessary open or laparoscopic 
surgery represents the first course of treat ment [ACS 2011].  In patients not eligible for surgery such as 
those with multiple renal masses or those with comorbid conditions, ablation treatments are preferred to 
better preserve renal function [Gervais et al. 2005a].  Ablation of RCC can be performed  laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_176807].  However, percutaneous ablation has been associated with fewer probes, shorter 
anesthesia times, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960], and quicker time to total recovery relative 
to laparoscopic approaches [Ba ndi et al. 2008; Hinshaw et al. 2008].  Percutaneous ablation can be 
performed with RF heating (50 -60º C for effective cell death) or cryoablation ( -40 to -50º C for cell 
death).  The current clinical standard at Thomas Jefferson for renal ablation is cryo ablation for two 
reasons: cryoablation creates an ice ball which can be tracked during the ablation session and is also 
significantly less painful than heat based techniques which avoids the use of general anesthesia in patients 
who are frequently suboptim al candidates for general anesthesia [Allaf et al. 2005].  Cryoablation is 
performed using a Cryocare Surgical System (HealthTronics, Austin TX; formerly EndocareInc, Irvine 
CA), an FDA approved device for the ablation of malignant tissues (510(k) K003811) . Follow up is 
initially performed by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced CT or MRI at [ADDRESS_206960] 
administration with both of these imaging modalities has well -described toxicity:  iodinated intravenous 
contrast given with CT is nephrotoxic, especially in patients with renal impairment; and gadoliniu m-based 
contrast given with MRI has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with advanced 
kidney disease.   
 
Ultrasound contrast agents are well tolerated and administered intravenously, making them an ideal 
noninvasive screening too l.  Commercially available contrast imaging packages are now available on 
most ultrasound scanners.  Coded h armonic imaging ( CHI) represents the current industry standard and 
improves contrast to tissue ratios by [CONTACT_176823] [Goldberg et al. 2001].   It has been shown that nonlinear imaging using these agents 
provides visualization of internal tumor morphology better than PDI  [Forsberg et al 2007].  
 
The majority of literature involving CEU S and renal masses involves classification prior to biopsy.  
Tamai et al. performed CEUS on 29 patients prior to resection and biopsy and found sensitivities of 94.4 
and 88.9% for CEUS and contrast CT respectively but specificities of 45.5 and 72.7% [Tamai  2005].  In a 
larger study involving 143 patients with renal masses, Ignee et al. found that CEUS had a sensitivity of 
 8 97% and specificity of 45% when predicting malignancy [Ignee et al. 2010].  Additionally, Williams et al. 
used CEUS with a flash replenis hment imaging mode to measure RCC tumor response to the 
antiangiogenic drug sunitinib and found a significant drop in fractional vascularity over a two week 
treatment regime (73.2%, p < 0.002), but no correlation with progression free survival.  
 
One of the  few studies in the literature using CEUS to evaluate renal ablation was performed by [CONTACT_176824] [2008]. Using CEUS as a follow up after percutaneous RF ablation, the group found a 
sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 100% when comparing to e ither the clinical standard of contrast 
enhanced MRI or CT.   These results are quite convincing, and indicate CEUS should also be useful as a 
follow up image modality for renal cryoablation. However, this group did not use an FDA approved 
ultrasound contra st agent and did not use either a standardized ultrasound system or clinical standard.  
Consequently, our group has proposed the use of CEUS for monitoring the effectiveness of renal mass 
cryoablation [Eisenbrey et al. 2014].  In one of the first studies u sing CEUS as an imaging tool before and 
after cryoablation , our group showed that all masses initially showed heterogeneous enhancement with 
both subharmonic (an emerging nonlinear imaging technique) and CHI.  No adverse events were 
observed during the stu dy.  The optimal dosages of Optison for renal imaging were found to be 1 ml for 
CHI and 2 ml for subharmonic imaging.  In cases where the lesion was adequately visualized at 4 month 
follow -up subharmonic and harmonic ultrasound showed accuracies of 83% and  75%, respectively in 
predicting treatment outcome, with a lack of enhancement on CEUS correlating to lack of enhancement 
on MRI/CT.  Additionally, relative to the  ablation cavities measured on  contrast -enhanced MRI/CT, SHI 
ablation volumes resulted in a m ean error of 3.8 ± 5.4 cm3 (p = 0.29) , and HI resulted in a mean error of 
1.7 ± 1.2 cm3 (p = 0.39)  [Eisenbrey et al. 2014] .  However, no cases of recurrence were observed in this 
study, making it difficult to define the technique’s predictive values.   
 
The proposed agent for the current study, Optison is a sterile non -pyrogenic suspension of encapsulated 
perflutren microbubbles [Goldberg et al 2001; Miller & Nanda 2004].  The contrast agent is consists of a 
human serum albumin shell with perflutren core an d contains 5.0 - 8.0 x 108 microspheres/ ml.  The 
microbubble agent is supplied in a standard -size 3 ml vial and is prepared by [CONTACT_176820].   
Optison is currently only approved for use in echocardiography.  The agent will be used as an off -label 
indication for this study.   
 
Optison Clinical Safety  
Optison is well tolerated and has been used extensively in echocardiography applications [Goldberg et al 
2001].  In pre -market clinical trials, Optison was administered to 279 patients.  In these p atients 47 
 9 (16.8%) reported at least one adverse event.  Of these events, [ADDRESS_206961] frequently reported were headache (5.4%), nausea and/or vomiting (4.3%), warm sensation or 
flushing (3.6%), and dizziness (2.5%).  Additional risks associated with the contrast material ar e 
described in the attached Optison Product insert (Appendix B).  All of the non -serious reported side 
effects  have been transient, usually lasting only a few minutes.

findings will correlate with MRI/CT recurrence findings . If CEUS correlates with the current clinical 
standard of a contrast -enhanced MRI  or CT , this alternative will lead to substantial cost savings and a 
non-nephrotoxic follow up imaging alternative in patients with renal compromise.  
 
We propose a clinical trial to determine the feasibility of using 2D and 3D CEUS for the evaluation of 
RCC recurrence post cryoablation .  The purpose of this study is to compare ultrasound derived vascularity 
and blood flow measurements post ablation to both the clinical evaluation standard and patient outcomes  
(when retreatment is indicated and pathology becomes availabl e).  
 
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
 
Trial Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to:  
· Evaluate if CEUS  can be used to successfully detect RCC  recurrence in patients who are up to three 
years  post cryotherapy.  
 
The secondary aim of this trial is to:  
· Establish whether 3D CEUS  provides a n improvement over 2D CEUS  in monitoring cryoablation 
therapy and detecting recurrence.    
 
The tertiary aim of this trial is to:  
· Add to the emerging literature on the safety of Optison in patients with renal impairment.    
 
 
3. TRIAL DESIGN  
 
This is an open -label, non -randomized trial that will be conducted at one clinical site.  The subject 
population will be patients scheduled for follow up contrast enhanced CT or MRI of a previously 
cryoablatated RCC through Thomas Jefferso n University’s Urology clinic.   Eligible follow up imaging 
will include patients being seen for an 8, 12, 18, 24, or [ADDRESS_206963]/MRI follow up.  The study will 
consist of a single ultrasound exam, although p atients will be eligible to re-enroll in multiple  studies  (for 
example exams at 8, 12 and 18 months), if these exams fit within the study timeframe.   Study 
participation will consist of a single ultrasound exam. During each exam patients will undergo a grayscale 
B-mode, power Doppler, and [ADDRESS_206964] wash -in and wash -out cycle and compared to MRI / CT 
follow up results and patient outcomes.   When avai lable, image fusion may also be incorporated to aid in 
scanning and lesion identification.  The second CEUS exam will then use a 3D curvilinear  probe to 
provide volumetric CHI of the mass.  At a minimum, volumes will be acquired at baseline, contrast wash -
in, peak enhancement, and during contrast wash -out.  Volumes will again be compared to MRI / CT 
follow up results and patient outcomes.  
 
3.1  Trial Duration  
Individual participation for the majority of patients will be limited to 1 ultrasound exam during t heir 
cryoablation follow up in Thomas Jefferson University’s Urology clinic .  However, patients will be 
eligible for serial imaging (for example exams at 8, 12 and 18 months), if these exams fit within the study 
timeframe.  Exams will take place the day of  the patient’s MRI /CT follow up or during their Urology 
clinic follow up (in cases where MR/CT imaging is performed outside of Jefferson).  The entire 
ultrasound imaging protocol will require approximately one hour including a [ADDRESS_206965] 22 months ( January  2015 – November , 201 6). Analysis and 
publication of results are expected to take an additional 2 months ( November 2016 – January, 2016 ).  
Volunteer Registry Database forms will be submitted to the National Institute of Health’s Office of 
Regulatory Compliance and Quality at the completion of the research study.   
 
4.  TRIAL POPULATION  
 
Trial Population: This trial will consis t of up to 1 00 adults ( 18 years of age or older) undergoing MRI/CT 
imaging to monitor recurrence of RCC following cryoablation therapy.  
 
Subjects eligible for trial enrollment will be identified by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators, Drs. Shaw , Lallas and 
Trabulsi  from their patient population of subjects who have previously undergone cryoablation of RCC 
and are being monitored for recurrence .  These patients will be accrued from the Urology department, as 
well as from the Small Renal Mass Center at the Genitourinary Mul tidisciplinary Cancer Center of the 
Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  A research coordinator will explain the

This is an open -label trial; therefore, no blinding or unblinding procedures for the trial drug are requir ed.  
 
5.5  Storage  
 14 Optison vials will be stored in a secure refrigerator, with only the study investigators and research 
personnel having access.  The study research nurse will be responsible for drug suspension and inventory 
control.  
 
6.  TRIAL PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Patient Enrollment  
Trial Procedures: Subjects eligible for trial enrollment will be identified by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators, Drs. 
Shaw , Lallas and Trabulsi  from their patient population of subjects under active surveillance for 
recurrence of a previously  cryoablated RCC .  A research coordinator will explain the study to the patient.  
The patient will be given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and ask questions about 
participation.  The coordinator will review the consent form with the p atient and then the patient will be 
given the form to review.  The patient, coordinator, and a study investigator will all sign the consent form.   
The patient will be given a copy of the signed consent form for their records.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_206970]’s 
medical/surgical history will be recorded .  If the subject is a woman of childbearing age, she will have a 
urine pregnancy test (the results of which will be made available to the subject prior to study initiation).   
 
6.[ADDRESS_206971] the 
morning prior to  the patient’s 8, 12, 18, 24, or [ADDRESS_206972]/MRI follow up  (scheduled as part of their 
clinical care)  or during their consultation in Jefferson’s Urology clinic (for patients who have imaging 
performed outside Jefferson) .  Procedures and equipment for this trial will be used in accordance with 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_176809].  All trial procedures will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice.  For the ultras ound examination, the patient will be asked to lie in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_54904] a 
catheter will be placed in a superficial vein (preferably an antecubital vein).   Acoustic coupling gel will be 
applied to the area of interest.  A state of the art  ultrasound s canner with 2D and 3D curvilinear  probe s 
will be used.   
 15  
A baseline ultrasound grayscale scan will be used to identify the tumor and to evaluate the following 
criteria: size, shape, and orientation of the lesion; echogenicity compared to surrounding tissu e.  Standard 
power Doppler  of the lesion will also be performed.  When possible, previous MR/CT data will be 
uploaded onto the scanner in order to perform image fusion for ultrasound guidance during imaging.  The 
distribution of color signals and the overa ll color content of the tumor will be evaluated by [CONTACT_176825].   Following baseline scanning, patients will 
receive  a 1 ml  intravenous injection of Optison (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) in a p eripheral vein 
followed by [CONTACT_176819] 2D CHI  (a nonlinear contrast imaging package).  Ten  minutes after 
the 2D CEUS exam, patients will receive a second bolus in jection of Optison followed by 3 D CHI (using 
a curvilinear 3D array) .  All contrast  injections will be supervised by a board certified physician. 
Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel will be immediate proximity to the patient during each 
contrast -enhanced ultrasound exam.  Digital clips of th e exam s will be recorded through the contrast 
agent wash -in and wash -out phases for at least two minutes and stored for later use.  The subject will then 
be monitored fo r adverse reactions for [ADDRESS_206973] of care.  No further patient monitoring is required as 
side effects of Optison are acute in nature and no renal toxicity has been reported (See Table 1, section 
2.1).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_206974] -enhanced MRI/CT exam will be 
independent and randomly reviewed by [CONTACT_176826].  Readers will evaluate the presence of signal enhancement within the mass, sign al distribution 
and heterogeneity, signal intensity relative to the normal renal parenchyma, and contrast agent wash -in 
and wash -out kinetics relative to the surrounding parenchyma.  The readers will also be asked to evaluate 
if CEUS findings indicate RCC recurrence.  Recurrence will initially be defined as the presence of 
contrast enhancement within the ablation cavity.  Finally, following a one month wait period and 
randomization, readers will again review cases in order to calculate intra -reader variabil ity.  Both 
qualitative and quantitative findings will be obtained for the ultrasound study. Sensitivity, specificity, 
 [ADDRESS_206975] or MRI, and pathology  
(if retreated) as the reference standard s.  The dichotomous parameter needed for these calculations will be 
derived by [CONTACT_176827] .  Correlations between these 
assessments  and both contrast -enhanced MRI or CT findings will be compared using the Fisher exact test.   
Inter - and intra -observer variability  will also be calculated.  Quantitative parameters of mass vascularity, 
perfusion, and contrast fill time will be computed relative to the surrounding renal parenchyma and again 
correlated to the clinical standard.  Finally, the patient’s billed amount for  their contrast -enhanced 
MRI/CT exam (cost of exam prior to insurance reimbursements) will be recorded and compared to the 
cost of a real ultrasound exam and one vial of ultrasound contrast agent to compare potential cost savings 
to the patient.  Quantitat ive parameters will be compared between recurrent and disease free groups using 
a Student’s t -test. 
 
6.6 Safety Assessments  
Adverse events will be monitored during the entire procedure.  Specifically, the patient will be monitored 
with non -leading question s to monitor the patient for the transient side effects that are described below.  
 
6.6.1  Risks/Benefits Assessment.   
Serious cardiopulmonary and allergic reactions including fatalities have occurred during or following 
administration of Optison, causing the FDA to place a black box warning on the agent.   However these 
occurrences have been rare (less than 1 in 5,000 patients).  As a result, patients with cardiac shunts or 
unstable cardiopulmonary conditions will be excluded.  All contrast injections will be supervised by a 
board certified physician.  Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel will be immediate proximity to 
the patient during each contrast -enhanced ultrasound exam.  Patients will also be monitored for [ADDRESS_206976] frequently reported were headache (5.4%), nausea and/or vomiting (4.3%) , warm 
sensation or flushing (3.6%), and dizziness (2.5%).  
 
The use of an intravenous needle and the fluids given through the needle may cause minor discomfort, 
bleeding under the skin (bruise), and possible infection at the site of needle insertion.   
 
 [ADDRESS_206977] media in 
renally compromised patients would be of imme nse benefit.    
 
To minimize and/or eliminate risks a  nurse will be present during the entire procedure.  Adverse events 
will be monitored during the entire procedure and for [ADDRESS_206978] injection.   
 
The risk benefit ratio is low.  Based on the availa ble non -clinical and clinical safety data and the dosage  
levels of Optison that will be used in this study, safety concerns are minimal.  The potential side effects 
related to Optison administration are described  in Table 1  above.  
 
6.6.2  Adverse Events  
An AE includes any condition that was not present prior to trial treatment, but appeared following 
initiation of trial medication; any condition that was present prior to trial treatment, but worsened during 
trial medication; or any condition, of which the subject has a history, that was not present prior to trial 
medication initiation but reappeared following administration of Optison.  This would include conditions 
that are likely to be associated with an underlying or intermittent disease (e.g., angina, f lu, etc.).  
 
The subjects will be monitored for AEs during the entire procedure.  All AEs, including both observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms, and diagnoses, occurring from the initiation of 
Optison dosing until the completion of  the Optison administration will be recorded on a serious or non -
serious AE data form, whether or not associated with the use of the trial medication.  All adverse events 
are reported to the Clinical Trial Support Office (CTSO) via the password protected K immel Cancer 
Center Adverse Event Reporting System.  In addition all unexpected and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
are reported to the TJU IRB and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if applicable.  The 
investigator is required to submit all unexpecte d and serious adverse events to the TJU IRB and the 
DSMB within [ADDRESS_206979] be reported 
within 24 hours to the TJU IRB and the DSMB through  the CTSO.  Fatalities not related to the study 
drug/device must be reported within 5 days.  
 
The AE forms will include: subject identification number and initials; subject’s date of birth, gender, and 
ethnicity; date of Optison administration; signs/symptoms and severity; date of onset; date of resolution  
or death; relationship to the study drug; action taken; concomitant medication(s) including dose, and route 
and duration of treatment.   
 18  
Whenever possible, the AE will be evaluated and reported as a diagnosis rather than individual signs and 
symptoms.  I f a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms will be recorded.  
The investigator will evaluate and note the duration, intensity, and relationship to (association with) the 
Optison administration, the action taken, and the det ermination of seriousness for each AE.  
 
INTENSITY OF AES  
The intensity of the AE will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe.   Mild AEs are usually 
transient, require no special treatment, and do not interfere with the subject's daily activities.   Moderate 
AEs traditionally introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with 
daily activities but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].   Severe AEs interrupt a 
subject's usual daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_176810].   When the 
intensity of the AE changes over time, the maximum intensity will be recorded.  
 
RELATIONSHIP TO OPTI SON ADMINISTRATION  
The relationship or association of the AE to the Optison administration w ill be characterized as 
"unlikely," "possible," or "probable."  A relationship assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_176828] a data form.  The investigator will 
refer to the Optiso n Package Insert for assistance in determining AE relationship.  
 
An "unlikely" relationship indicates that there is little or no chance that Optison caused the reported AE; 
other conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease state, or a 
reaction to a concurrent medication, appear to explain the reported AE.  
 
A "possible" relationship indicates that the association of the AE with Optison is unknown.  However, the 
AE is not reasonably attributed to any other condition.  
 
A "probable" relationship indicates that a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and 
Optison administration and, based upon the investigator's clinical experience, the association of the event 
with the trial medication seems likely.  
 
SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS  
A "serious" AE (SAE) is defined as a significant clinical hazard, contraindication, or precaution that:  
Results in death  
 19  Is life -threatening (In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], there is an immediate risk of death from the 
AE as it occurre d. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death.)  
 Results in a persistent or significant temporary disability/incapacity defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life funct ions 
 Results in or prolongs an existing in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
regardless of length) [Note: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176811], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -exist ing condition which did not worsen, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176812], do not constitute an SAE.]  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject taking the trial medication, 
regardless of time to diagnosis)  
 Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176813], the event may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed for 
the definition of a serious adverse experience.  
 
All unexpected and serious adverse events are reported to the TJU IRB and to FDA if applicable.  The 
investigator is required to submit all unexpected and serious adverse events to t he TJU IRB and the data 
safety monitoring board within [ADDRESS_206980] be reported within 24 hours to the TJU IRB and the DSMB through the CTSO.  
 
The written report for any SAEs that occur dur ing the study, whether or not related to the Optison 
administration will be submitted immediately (within 24 hours) to the TJU IRB.  
 
The designated medical monitor will review all serious and unexpected adverse events associated with the 
protocol and provi de an unbiased written report of the event within [ADDRESS_206981]'s data forms.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_206982] from the tria l if, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not safe for the subject to continue.  The 
 [ADDRESS_206983] is withdrawn from a treatment and/or from the trial and the reason for discontinuation 
will be recorded on the CRF.  
 
Trial participation will be consider ed completed if the subject has met the following trial requirements:  
 Has received two injections of Optison combined with 2D and 3D imaging of the area of interest  
If a subject's participation in the trial is interrupted for any reason (e.g., because of a n AE) and the subject 
has met the criteria described above for completing the trial, the subject's trial participation will be 
considered completed.  If a subject's trial participation is interrupted for any reason by [CONTACT_423]'s or 
investigator's choice  and the subject has not met all of the criteria listed above, then the subject will be 
considered a discontinued subject.  
 
Findings from this study will be submitted in abstract form to the annual meetings of the American 
Institute of Ultrasound in Medici ne, the Radiological Society of North American, and the American 
Urological Association.  A manuscript detailing study findings will also be submitted to either a  
Radiology of Urology journal.   
 
7.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
7.[ADDRESS_206984] -enhanced MRI/CT exam will be independent and random ly 
 [ADDRESS_206985] agent wash -in and wash -out kinetics 
relative to the surrounding parenchyma.  The readers will also be asked to evaluate if CEUS findings 
indicate RCC recurrence.  This parameter will be based off of each reader’s first read.  In the event o f 
discordant readings during this analysis, recurrence will be decided by [CONTACT_176822].  
Finally, following a one month wait period and randomization, readers will again review cases in order to 
calculate intra -reader variability.  
 
Quantita tive findings we be generated by [CONTACT_176829], perfusion, and contrast fill time.  
This will be done using a commercial contrast quantification package, which fits wash -in and wash -out 
curves to signal intensity as a function of time to quantify key parameters.  Contrast parameters in the 
area of the previously treated mass will be computed relative to the surrounding renal parenchyma and 
again correlated to the clinical standard.   Finally, the patient’s billed amount for their contrast -enhanced 
MRI/CT exam (cost of exam prior to insurance reimbursements) will be recorded and compared to the 
cost of a real ultrasound exam and one vial of ultrasound contrast agent to compare potential cost savings 
to the patient.  
 
Data will first be analyze d on a per case basis (treating each case as an independent data point).  
However, analysis may also be performed on a patient by [CONTACT_176830] a large number of enrolled 
patients undergo serial imaging (potentially required to ensure adequate enrollmen t).  Sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value will be calculated for the 
qualitative data using both the standard of care contrast -enhanced CT or MRI, and pathology (if retreated) 
as the reference standar d.  The dichotomous parameter needed for these calculations will be derived by 
[CONTACT_176831] -enhanced ultrasound.  Correlations between these 
findings and both contrast -enhanced MRI or CT findings will be compared using the Fisher exact test.  
Inter-rater variability will be calculated using each reader’s first set of reads, while int ra-rater variability 
will be calcul ated by [CONTACT_176832]’s initial and 1 month analysis. Intra -rater and inter -rater 
variability will be calculated using a Shrout and Fleiss Interclass Correlation [Shrout and Fleiss 1979].  
Quantitative parameters will be compared between groups  using a Student’s t -test. 
 
7.2.1   Sample Size Calculation  
We hope to enroll up to 1 00 patients within 22 months  as part of this study.  This should be achievable , 
 22 given that our Urology clinic sees approximately 200 cryoablation follow up patients annually.  As this is 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_176814] a priori.   However, a power analysis was 
run in PASS12 ( NCSS LLC,  Kaysville, UT) to estimate the size of the confidence interval when 
estimating the test’s overall level of specificity .  A two sided confidence interval of one proportion was 
simulated using a Clopper -Pearson exact solution, assuming 100 patients and a total study recurrence rate 
of 5%.  The relationship between the confidence level and 95% confidence interval and confidence 
interval width is shown below.  
 
       
Confidence  Size Target  Actual  Proportion  Lower  Upper  Width if  
Level  (N) Width  Width  (P) Limit  Limit  P = 0.[ADDRESS_206986] to within 11% with 90% 
confidence.  While multiple time points of the same patients cannot strictly be t reated as independent 
samples (required to achieve adequate sample size within the two year window), data will also be 
analyzed on a per patient basis.  Additionally, d ata from this study  will also be used for future  grant 
submission s to run a fully powere d study in which conclusive hypotheses comparing 2D and 3D, as well 
as quantifiable parameters can be answered.

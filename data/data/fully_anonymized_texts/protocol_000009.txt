 Purpose:  
In this randomized,  controlled,  observer -blinded study we plan to evaluate  ultrasound -guided 
fascia iliaca  compartment block with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_367491]  (THA) . 
 
Background:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_367492] , postoperative pain is not always effectively treated 
(1). Optimal pain management technique  balance s pain relief with  concerns about safety and 
adverse  effects  associated with analgesic techniques . Currently, p ostoperative pain is 
commonly  treated with systemic opio ids, which are associated with numerous adverse effects 
including nausea and vomiting, dizz iness, drowsiness, pruritus,  urinary retention , and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]  (2). Use of regional and local anesthesia has been shown to reduce 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_367493] -relate d side effects.  Therefore, their use has been  emphasized 
(3, 4, 5 , 6).  
 
Fascia Iliaca  compartment  block (FI CB) is a field block that blocks the nerves from the lumbar 
plexus supplying the thigh (i.e., lateral femoral cutaneous femoral and obturator  nerves). The 
obturator nerve  is sometimes involved in the FI CB but probably plays little role in postoperative 
pain relief for most surgeries of the hip and proximal femur.  It has been traditionally used by 
[CONTACT_367516] g the hip joint,  anterior thigh and knee surgery  (7, 8, 9 ).  The extent of nerve blockade 
depends on the spread of local anesthesia under the fascia, therefore , a large volume of local 
anesthetic up to 60 mL may be needed to ensure adequate coverage  (8, 10, 11). One study 
compared FI CB to sham block without showing significant benefit, but used significantly lower 
volume (30  mL) than proposed for this study (12). Another study showed use of doses of 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_367494] 300mg for wound infiltration is safe which is equivalent to 60  mL 0.5% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (13).  The advent of ultrasound guided regional anesthesia has brought more 
precision to this technique , including the ability to visualize the anatomy, perform real-time 
navigation, and direct observation of local anesthetic spread , as it allows a greater degree of 
sensory and motor blockade (4,1 4).  
 
An alternative to the FICB is periarticular infiltration , which is increasingly being used, as it has 
also been reported to prove adequate analgesia  (15). However, to date, FICB has not been 
compared with periarticular  infiltration.  
 
We hypothesize that  a FICB would provide superior analgesia when  compared to infiltration , 
because infiltration is surgeon and technique dependent . The primary aim of this study  is to 
compare the pain scores and the secondary objectives are to compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_367495].  
 
Concise Summary of Project:  
Patients undergoi ng THA (n=60) at Parkland and UT Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s will be randomized into one of 
two groups to receive either ultrasound -guided FICB with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  300 mg and 150 mcg 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_367496] 60 mL  (Group 1) or periarticular  infiltration ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 300 mg and 150 
mcg epi[INVESTIGATOR_367497] 60 mL  (Group 2) for postoperative pain management . The 
remaining aspect of perioperative care, including the anesthetic  technique  (i.e., spi[INVESTIGATOR_367498]) , pre- and postoperative care  will be standardized and will be similar for all patients.  
Page [ADDRESS_459502] 24 -h postoperative period,  patients in both groups will receive 
acetaminophen 1000  mg and gabapentin 300 mg, po every 8  h, meloxicam  15 mg, po daily , 
Oxycodone 10 mg, in the evening and hydromorphone  0.4 mg, IV bolus, q 3h, prn  as a rescue . 
In the 24 -48 h study period, all patients will receive  meloxicam 15 mg, po daily, gabapentin 300 
mg, po  every 8 h , and a hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10 mg/ 325 mg, po q 4 h, as needed .  
 
The postoperative analgesia will be documented using the visual analog score (0=no pain,  
10=worst pain). In addition, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_367499] 48-h study period will be documented. 
Postoperative n ausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system (none=0, mild=1, 
moderate=2,  severe=3)  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_367500] . Rescue  antiemetics will 
be given to any patient who complain s of nausea and/or vomiting. All variables  will be assessed 
at 2, 6, 12, 24 , and 48 hours , postoperatively by [CONTACT_367517].   
 
Study Procedures:  
We will  study  60 American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) physical status [ADDRESS_459503] meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria , the subject will be asked to sign 
the Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization Form prior to any study procedures  in a face -to-
face meeting with the researchers .  
 
Protected patient information will include name, medical record nu mber, date of birth, and 
contact [CONTACT_367518]. Height and weight will also be recorded.  All 
patients will receive a standardized spi[INVESTIGATOR_367501] 4 mg IV and dexamethasone 8 mg IV. One of the investigators will randomly 
allocated p atients using computer generated randomization schedule to one of two groups - 
ultrasound -guided FICB with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_367502] .  
 
Fascia iliaca  compartment block will be performed by [CONTACT_367519] -guided technique using  the SonoSite Edge  and linear 6 -13 MHz 
transducer . With the patient placed supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], the ultrasound transducer will be placed in 
a para -sagittal orientation inferior -medially to the anterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], over the inguinal 
ligament (4).  Using real -time ultrasound imaging we will identify internal oblique,  sartorius  and 
iliacus muscles , covered by [CONTACT_367520] . Following asep tic preparation of the injection site 
and the ultrasound probe, a 22-gauge 10 mm insulated needle (Stimuplex A, B -Braun Medical, 
Melsungen, [LOCATION_013])  will be introduced parallel  to the ultrasound guided beam ( in- plane 
technique) from caudad -to-cephalad  direction, through the sartorius muscle , directed towards 
the iliacus muscle, until its tip reaches the plane between internal oblique and iliacus  muscl es. 
With the needle  tip placed beneath the fascia and above the muscle), a few milliliters of 
Page [ADDRESS_459504] of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (total 60 ml)  will be injected in [ADDRESS_459505] 24 -h postoperative period  
patients  in both g roups will include  acetaminophen 1000  mg and gabapentin 300 mg, po  
every 8 h, meloxicam 15 mg, po daily, oxycodone 10 mg, in the evening and 
hydromorphone 0.4 mg, IV bolus, q 3h, prn  as a rescue . In the 24 -48 h study period, all 
patients will receive, meloxicam 15 mg, po daily, gabapentin 300 mg, po every 8 h and a 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/ 325 mg, po q 4 h, as needed.   
 
The efficacy of postoperative analgesia will be documented in all pati ents using the visual 
analog score ( 0=no pain , 10=worst pain). In addition, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_367503] 48-h study 
period will be documented. Postoperative nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring 
system (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_367500]. 
Rescue antiemetics will be given to any patient who complain s of nausea or vomiting. All 
variables will be assessed at 2, 6, 12, 24 , and 48 hours  postoperatively by [CONTACT_367521].

Potential Risks:  
Risk of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] : 
 The incidences of adverse neurologic reactions associated with the use of local 
anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are 
also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the 
physical status of the patient . 
 There is minimal risk of local anesthetic toxicity  with in advert injection of local anesthetic 
into the blood ve ssel while performing the block.  If injected into a blood vessel, in large 
amounts it can cause seizures and even cardiac arrest. There are no major vessels  at 
the site of injection with both techniques , therefore the risk is minimal.  If it is happen lipid 
emulsion will be given which is  standard treatment of local anesthetic toxicity.  
Risk of Injection:   
There is a risk of h ematoma at the site of block placement  or local infiltration.  Anytime a needle 
is used there is a risk of bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding tissue.  
 
 
 
 
Risk for epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]:  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_367506], however the dose of epi[INVESTIGATOR_367507]'t expect the increase of heart rate and blood pressure . 
 
Risk of increased opi[INVESTIGATOR_367508]:  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_367509].  
 
There is risk of loss of confidentiality and psychological stress with any research participation.  
 
Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
Independent research experts , Drs. John Pennant  and Weike Tao,  will review data and safety 
information at [ADDRESS_459507] recruitment intervals and report any safety co ncerns to PI [INVESTIGATOR_367510].  
Page 6 of 7  
 As with any local anesthetic products, monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status, as 
well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 
 
Procedures to Maint ain Confidentiality:  
A non -identifiable code will be assigned to the data collection sheet so that there is not a direct 
link to specific names. Patient IDs will be standardized as Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_367511] 3 digit number: IG01, IG02… ….IG30 .  
 
A key to the coding system will be maintai ned in a locked storage cabinet  with limited access 
until all the data is collected and analyzed.  Patient identifiers will not be destroyed, as they are 
necessary for one of  the functions of this research , however , identifiers and protected health 
information will not be stored together.  Only the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_367512]. 
Subject identifiers will not be reused or disclosed to any othe r person or entity for research  
unless required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized conduct and oversight of the study, or for other IRB -
approved research . 
 
Following the completion of the analysis and the project , the key to the coding system or subject 
identifiers themselves will be destroyed by [CONTACT_367526] t identifiers and information.  
 
All electronic data generated will be password  protected with access limited to the immediate 
study team.  
 
Potential Benefits:  
The study is not designed for direct benefit to study subjects who participate in research. 
However, patients who involved in this study  may have superior  postoperative pain relief . 
However, the  potential benefits to patients in the future could be substantial. We can potentially 
improve the course of the early postoperative period in terms of b etter pain control, less opi[INVESTIGATOR_367513] -related side effects.  
 
 
 
Statistics:  
Sample size was calculated assuming a standard deviation of 2.[ADDRESS_459508] 80% power using  a repeated measures ANOVA 
F test.  Assuming a 14% loss to follow -up, n = 60 patients will be enrolled at 1:[ADDRESS_459509] (FIB vs. local infiltration) and one within subject 
(time) factor will be used for the primary outcome of pain scores and other continuous outcome 
measures.  Model assumptions will be assessed using standard residual diagnostics and 
alternative analyses procedures will be considered in case of violations.  All analyses will be 
done using SAS 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) software and p -values less than 0.05 will be 
considered statistical significance.  Bonferroni adjustments will be used for multiple 
comparisons where appropriate.

I.   INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
Over the past decade, transradial access (TRA) for invasive cardiac catheterization procedures 
has gained significant popularity in Europe, Canada, South America, Japan, and other sites 
outside of the [LOCATION_002] where TRA is used in more than 60% of the cases.[ADDRESS_190668] 
range of diagnostic and interventional cardiovascular procedures. In the [LOCATION_003], TRA 
catheterization procedures are gaining significant momentum with a significant growth fro m 2% 
in 2007 to approximately 15 % in [ZIP_CODE], and an estimated 30 - 35% in 2015.   Moreover, with 
increased availability of training opportunities the TRA utilization rate is expected to grow to 
50% or more in the next 2 – [ADDRESS_190669] band .  These 
‘Hemostasis Bands’ are inflated with air in a somewhat arbitrary manner and often require  
prolonged hemostatic pressure. The disadvantage of these methods is the complete interruption 
of arterial flow because of the inability to gauge the hemostatic pressure applied , regardless of 
the methodology developed for their use. It has been demonstrated that when occlusive 
pressure is maintained for  a period longer than two hours radial artery occlusion (RAO) occurs 
more often.6,[ADDRESS_190670], RAO after TRA procedures is not uncommon and occurs in approximately 
5-10% of cases, and is accurately described as a function of time and pressure.  
Incidence RAO  =  f (Time,  Pressure)  
In order to minimize the occurrence of RAO, Pancholy introduced the “patent” non -occlusive 
hemostasis technique , designed to address the pressure side of the RAO equation8. With this 
technique, a Hemostasis band is place d and a pulse oximeter  is attached to the ipsilateral 
thumb. Then, while the sheath is being removed, the balloon is fully inflated with approximately 
15-18 cc of air to completely occlude the r adial artery. Subsequently, the device is slowly 
deflated while occlusive manual pressure is applied to the ulnar artery located at the Guyon’s 
canal, lateral to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_164314].  Patent hemostasis is achieved when oximetry  becomes 
positive and a plethys mographic waveform can be visualized. This technique assures the 
presence of antegrade flow in the radial artery during hemostasis.   Later in recovery, small 
amounts of air can be periodically released, until the device is completely deflated and then 
removed. Using this technique, late occlusion rates can be reduced to approximately less than 
5%.8 
THE CLINICAL NEED  
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_164315]’s  technique, meticulous patent hemostasis with careful 
ascertainment of adequacy of the antegrade radial  flow to the hand is performed in less than 
50% of cases and about a third of transradial operators are unaware of the RAO rates in their 
own practices.[ADDRESS_190671] procedure monitoring  is required solely due to 
hemostasis band management is significant, resulting in delayed or postponed procedures, 
delayed discharges, additional staff expense, and other care related costs.  
 
One method to attack these deficiencies in current p rogram practice is to attack th e time 
component of the hemostasis equation.   In doing so, it is hypothesized that if radial artery 
compression time can be shortened to 40 minutes or l ess, the following could result:  improved 
catheterization lab efficiency, greater patient satisfaction and lower complication rates, including 
RAO, may be improved.   As concerns improved cath lab efficiency, a system that standardizes 
compression techniq ue and shortens compression time to that which is fully under the 
supervision and care of cath lab holding room personnel, will also eliminate the variability of 
recovery staff needing to manage the hemostasis band / site, and complications typi[INVESTIGATOR_164316].   
To summarize, the potential advantages of a hemostasis system for PCI incorporating the 
benefits of the StatSeal technology used in combination with a hemostasis ba nd as compared to 
a hemostasis band alone may include:  
▪ Decreased radial artery compression times, aka Band In Place (BIP) time.   
▪ Decreased incidence of RAO complications at discharge, or [ADDRESS_190672] 
▪ Decreased incidence of other compli cations associated with TRA, such as hematoma, 
bleeding, and oozing.  
▪ Elimination or reduction in the need for additional equipment, such as Doppler units, 
plethysmographs and pulse oximeters to assess hemostasis band efficacy  
▪ Facilitate arterial site management to the more specialized catheterization lab 
staff/personnel that are better trained to recognize complications that occur during (BIP) 
band in place time.  
▪ Decreasing  the workload to the staff by [CONTACT_164329] e procedural throughput.  
▪ Facilitate greater patient comfort resulting from decrease band in place time and faster 
wound healing.  
To do so, the effects of anticoagulation used during a PCI must be taken in to account.    
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY DEVICE:   
Recently, a new compound – potassium ferrate, in combination with a hydrophylic polymer 
which  is formed in to  a disc when compressed - has been used in conjunction with hemostasis 
bands to shorten compression times.  This product (trade name [CONTACT_164343]) is an FDA 
approved product comprised of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_164317], [Photo 
1] formed by [CONTACT_164330].  
  
 
Photo 1:    StatSeal Advanced Disc  
 
When in the direct contact [CONTACT_164331] a small amount of blood, the compound forms an occlusive 
seal through simultaneous iron -mediated agglomeration of blood solids/proteins and rapid 
dehydration of the blood.  Seal formation is independent of the clotting cascade, facilitating 
sealing regardless of anticoagulation / antiplatelet status of the patient.    Following cessation of 
pressure being applied to the site, the remnants of StatSeal form what resemble a ‘scab’, and 
remains in place for [ADDRESS_190673] methods, and did so regardless of 
the patient’s anticoagulation status.  
INDICATION FOR USE 
StatSeal Advanced is a commercially available product in the [LOCATION_002], and is indicated for 
use on patients in whom the radial artery has been used to gain vascular access for a 
cardiovascular proc edure.   
DEVICE STORAGE AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
StatSeal Advanced is provided in a sterile, foil pouch to protect it from humidity / moisture.  As 
with most medical products, it should be stored in a cool, dry, secure environment.  StatSe al 
Advance will be prov ided at no charge by [CONTACT_164332].  
Damaged devices will be returned to the manufacturer (Biolife, LLC, Sarasota,FL). All unused 
devices may be retained by [CONTACT_164333], if they so choose.  
  
  

III. STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  
The primary objectives of this study are to  evaluate  the performance of StatSeal Advanced used 
in conjunction with the TR Band  (SSA)  as compared to the TR Band without SSA (TRB) relative 
to: 
1. the incidence of peri -procedural radial artery occlusion  (RAO)  at discharge or [ADDRESS_190674],  and; 
2. the Time to Hemostasis (TTH)  
HMS i s defined as the Hemostasis Management System employed based on which gro up the 
patient is randomized to (either SSA or TRB) . 
Radial Artery Occlusion is defined as the absence of flow to the hand based upon 
plethysmography – pulse oximetry (Pleth -Ox) performed using the Barbeau scale . 
Time to Hemostasis (TTH) is defined as the time period required to achieve hemostasis, more 
specifically the time during which the subject  is wearing the HMS system and the system is 
active, e.g. applying compressive force to the access site.   For clarity, the time period that a 
HMS is left on the wrist while totally deflated is not considered as part of the TTH time.  
 
IV. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOL OGY 
STUDY DESIGN

Transradial Catheterization  Procedure  
Transradial Cardiac Catheterization  will be performed according to local practice standards  with 
use of a sheath diameter of up to 6 Fr.  (A 7Fr -in-6 Glidesheath Slender®, with an outer 
diameter of 6Fr is defined as a 6F sheath and is allowed .)  In accordance with current 
recommendations for minimizing radial artery occlusion, a minimum of 5,[ADDRESS_190676] 5 minutes following the initial 
dose of anticoagulant , although every patient receiving 5,000 units of heparin will be eligible for 
the study.  Vasodilators (nitroglycerin, verapamil) will be administered in accordance with local 
practice.  
Timing of Subject Enrollment  
A subject will be  consented  into the study prior to the administration of sedation prior to the 
procedure, and randomized at the conclusion of a successful  procedure  (after all 
anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication decisi ons have been made), at which time 
placement of the  assigned HMS device will occur . Eligibility for the study will be assessed at this 
time and the subject will have to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria . 
Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_164335] 30. 
Each envelope  will be  labeled by [CONTACT_164336].    Device 
designation in the envelopes will be random in occurrence.  When a patient is officially enrolled 
(after successful completion of a TRA procedure), the envelope corresponding to that patient 
number in the Study Patient log will be pulled, opened , and the assignment revealed.  
Each of 4 sites will be allotted an initial block of 30  envelopes, and sets of backup blocks of 30 
envelopes.  On the discretion of the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164318], 
enrollment may continue until each site enrolls 30 patients. The maximum enrollment at any one 
site shall not exceed 50% of the total study enrollment, or 90 patients.  
 
End of Study Status / Effect of Withdrawals:  
A subject will have completed the study when one of the following events is documented:  
1. The patient is successfully enrolled, treated with a HMS, and completes all required 
follow up tests.  
2. A subject withdraws consent to participate. Patients who withdraw from the study will be 
replaced  and excluded from data analysis . 
 
 
Protocol : 
Control patients:  Patients will have a TR band applied over the arteriotomy site and inflated with 
15-18ml of air.  After aspi[INVESTIGATOR_164319], the radial sheath 
will be removed.  The TR band will be deflated until bleeding occurs, and [ADDRESS_190677] for 2 hours f ollowing the procedure for all patient s 
(regardless of diagnostic or PCI procedure) , after which deflation attempts will 
commence.  
 
Statseal Protocol : Patients will have a Statseal Advance (SSA) disc applied after withdrawing 
the radial sheath 2 -4 cm. A Te gaderm dressing will be applied to secure the disc 
position.  The TR band will be applied over the SSA disc with the center of the balloon 
(the green dot) over the center of the SSA disc.  The TR band will be inflated with 8cc of 
air (which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_164320]), and the sheath removed.  No deflation will 
occur immediately.  After 20 minutes of pressure, 3 cc of air will be removed from the TR 
band. After an additional 20 minutes (40 minutes after procedure), the TR band will be 
completely deflat ed, and the TR band left in place. After an additional 20 minutes (60 
minutes after procedure) the TR band will be removed.

X. RISK BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
General Risks and Presumed Benefits : 
Application of a HMS in a setting absent an actual radial arteriotomy presents negligible risk to 
the subject.  The only foreseen risk would be leaving an inflated band in place for an extended 
period of time.  This risk is negligible provided the protocol is followed.  An action of this nature 
would be considered a protocol violation.  
Patients assigned to the SSA g roup may enjoy less discomfort from the shorter length of time 
that the HMS is in place.   Patient in the TRB group should experience no difference in benefit 
than those having been treated with a traditional HMS prior to the study.  
The potential benefit o f subject participation is gratification from making a contribution to science 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_164328] a new clinical method to achieve hemostasis 
following a radial artery procedure.   This new method could potentially provide a safer , more 
efficient,  and more effective HMS  for clinicians to use in treating patients undergoing the radial 
approach for cardiovascular procedures.   
Risks related to Hemostasis Bands : 
Currently marketed hemostasis bands have been associated with complication s such as, but 
not limited to, skin irritation, radial artery occlusion, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, failure to 
achieve hemostasis, and general wrist discomfort.   
Risks Specific to the Study Device : 
There are no known risks specific to the study device . 
Risk Mitigation : 
Every effort will be made to mitigate risks in this Study.  Those efforts include requiring 
investigators to be highly experienced Radialists, practicing at Radial First centers, and have 
used the study device in a minimum of ten cases.  
 
Clinical monitoring will occur in real time to ensure the accurate collection and reporting of data, 
and ensure that the Site is in compliance with the clinical protocol requirements that mitigate risk 
such as patient entry criteria, use of the study devic e in accordance with instructions, and 
compliance with study test procedures and methods.

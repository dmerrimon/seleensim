PRÉCIS
Background
•Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor.  With optimal treatment, 
consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_208592], median survival is 14.[ADDRESS_1070551] evidence of tumor 
progression within one year of diagnosis despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391].  At progression, treatment 
options are limited and mostly ineffective.
•Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab 
indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months 
of 0%.
•Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Kit, and 
was recently FDA approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
•Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and HIF-1 alpha inhibitor with 
reasonably high CNS/CSF penetration
•Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic 
chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of 
Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor 
vasculature (both existing capi[INVESTIGATOR_778843]), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1 alpha 
inhibition, and the induction of DNA damage. Further support for the combination comes 
from recent data tying drug-induced VEGF inhibition to the induction of HIF-1 alpha 
activity in GBM suggesting possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan
•The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in 
animal models 
Objectives
•6 month progression free survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) patients with 
no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group A).
•3 month progression free survival rate for rGBM patients with prior bevacizumab 
exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group B).
Eligibility
•Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS) 
with evidence of progression on MRI or CT scan. 
•Patient must have failed prior chemoradiation with temozolomide and any other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778844] (group A), or must have failed primary chemoradiation and a BEV-
incorporating treatment (group B).
•Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiation.

•No history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of 
the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that disease for a 
minimum of 3 years are eligible.
•No clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for 
gastrointestinal bleeding including, or the absorption of the medications.

•No serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could 
interfere with subject’s safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study 
procedures. 
•No ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is > Grade 1 and/or that is 
progressing in severity, except alopecia.

inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors (except bevacizumab). Prior treatment with TKIs that do not 
impact VEGFR -1, -2, or -3, PDGFR –a, -b of cKIT could be allowed.
Design
This is a 2 arm phase II trial of the combination of topotecan and pazopanib in patients with 
recurrent GBM or GS. Patients will be enrolled into one of the following groups:  (A) 
Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma with no prior bevacizumab exposure: (B) Glioblastoma or 
gliosarcoma with prior bevacizumab exposure. Topotecan and pazopanib are administered orally 
daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) at six months from 
patient registration for bevacizumab naïve patients and PFS at 3 months for patients with prior 
bevacizumab treatment.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 OBJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary endpoint:
•6 month progression free survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) patients with 
no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group A).
•3 month progression free survival rate for rGBM patients with prior bevacizumab 
exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group B).
1.1.2 Secondary endpoint:
•Overall survival for rGBMs (Group A and Group B) treated with pazopanib and 
topotecan measured from time of study enrollment.
•Objective response rate for rGBM (Group A and Group B) treated with pazopanib and 
topotecan. 
•Patient related outcome measures.
•To evaluate the occurrence of symptoms and correlate to disease progression and 
tolerance to treatment using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module 
(MDASI-BT) self-reporting tool.  This will include:
oTo evaluate longitudinal changes in symptom measures and determine the impact 
of the therapy on these parameters.
oTo measure symptom burden over the course of therapy to evaluate differences 
between patients individual symptom severity, overall mean symptom severity, 
and difference in scores on the interference items between responders and non-
responders.
oTo describe the variability of symptom severity longitudinally over the treatment 
course and follow-up period. 
1.2 BACKGROUND
1.2.1 Glioblastoma (GBM) 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor.  With optimal treatment, 
consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_208592], median survival is 14.6 months (Stupp et al. 987-96;Stupp et al. 459-66;Stupp et 
al. 459-66;Stupp et al. 987-96).  Cure is exceptional and most patients have evidence of tumor 
progression within one year of diagnosis despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391].  At progression, treatment options are 
limited and mostly ineffective; most clinical trials demonstrate six month progression free 
survival rate of only 9-15% and median overall survival is less than 25 weeks from time of tumor 
progression (Lamborn et al. 162-70).  Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM 
based on data from Vredenburgh et al. and Kreisl et al. (Kreisl et al. 740-45;Vredenburgh et al. 
4722-29)  Data on patients who fail bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 
weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months of 0%.
Numerous molecular changes drive the growth and pro-angiogenic behavior of GBMs (Lim et al. 
158-64). Among the molecular features of GBM, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 10 of 96
overexpression is nearly universal and higher levels are correlated with higher tumor grade (Plate 
et al. 845-48;Chi et al. 621-36). Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR)-alpha is 
expressed in nearly all malignant gliomas and high levels of PDGFR-beta are seen on endothelial 
cells of capi[INVESTIGATOR_778847] (Hermanson et al. 3213-19). Stem cell factor receptor (c-
Kit) pathway activation is less well defined in malignant glioma. Reports vary widely as to its 
expression from as high as 75% to as low as 4% (Morris and Abrey 193-200). C-Kit 
amplification may be associated with the presence of PDGFR-alpha expression, and may be seen 
more commonly in recurrent astrocytic tumors (Puputti et al. 927-34). Intriguingly, in a small 
number of patients with recurrent malignant glioma whose tumors possessed c-Kit polysomy or 
amplification, treatment with a c-Kit inhibitor resulted in a far longer freedom from progression, 
as compared to those patients whose tumors contained a normal c-Kit copy number (Reardon et 
al. 1995-2004).
Recent work has begun to subcategorize GBM into various subgroups based on the primary 
molecular pathways involved (Phillips et al. 157-73;Brennan et al. e7752). One study of 
particular relevance to this proposal, using proteomic analysis, identified three patterns of 
expression and activation of proteins in glioma signaling pathways, one of which was a PDGF-
pathway activation which was primarily ligand driven (Brennan et al. e7752). The other 
pathways were EGFR and NF1. GBM patients were evenly distributed among the three groups, 
suggesting up to 1/[ADDRESS_1070555] activation pattern. 
There was a trend for tumors that had been previously treated to reside in the PDGF group 
(p=0.11). Interestingly, even though this group of tumors was defined by [CONTACT_778884], none of the tumors in the class showed gene amplification of either 
PDGF receptors or ligands. The PDGF pathway analysis included a cluster of [ADDRESS_1070556] closely resemble the tumors recently described as “pro-neural” (Phillips et al. 
157-73). 
1.2.2 Pazopanib:
Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Kit, and was 
recently FDA approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Single-agent Pazopanib at 800 mg 
daily was tested in a phase 2 study in recurrent GBM and was well tolerated. However, 
Pazopanib demonstrated a 6-month progression free survival (PFS6) of only 3% (not meeting the 
efficacy target), a median PFS of 12 weeks, and a median overall survival of 35 weeks. 
However, Pazopanib did demonstrate biological activity, in that 11 patients (31%) had a PR or a 
<50% reduction in tumor, indicative of Pazopanib’s effect on tumor vasculature (Iwamoto et al. 
855-61). Pazopanib (in combination with lapatinib) in relapsed malignant glioma showed a 
clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD > 8 weeks) of 50-68%. 
1.2.3 Topotecan:
Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and HIF-1 alpha inhibitor(Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_57177]. 
6845-48) with reasonably high CNS/CSF penetration (Baker et al. 195-202). A 1996 study of 
high dose IV topotecan in 31 adults with recurrent malignant gliomas demonstrated 1 CR in 
GBM and 1 PR in the anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) group (Macdonald et al. 205-07). More 
interestingly, the median time to progression was 19 weeks and the overall PFS6 was 23%, 
which is similar to the figure (21%) reported for temozolomide in recurrent GBM (Yung et al. 
588-93) (outcomes were similar for GBMs and AAs with respect to duration of stable disease). 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 11 of 96
Additionally, a recent phase 2 study of metronomically administered single-agent oral topotecan 
showed some efficacy in childhood brain tumors (Minturn et al. 39-44).
1.2.4 Rationale for combination therapy:
Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic 
chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of Pazopanib + 
Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor vasculature (both existing 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_778848]), 
immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1 alpha inhibition, and the induction of DNA 
damage. Further support for the combination comes from recent data tying drug-induced VEGF 
inhibition to the induction of HIF-1 alpha activity in GBM (Keunen et al. 3749-54) suggesting 
possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan. 
The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in animal 
models (Hashimoto et al. 996-1006;Merritt et al. 985-95). A mouse model of ovarian cancer 
showed substantially improved outcomes when both Pazopanib and Topotecan were 
administered in a metronomic fashion as compared to either agent alone, or when given in non-
metronomic schemes (Hashimoto et al. 996-1006). Further, the combination resulted in 
improvements in animal survival (and decreased tumor weight), decreased tumor microvessel 
density, decreased tumor cell VEGFR2 phosphorylation, decreased numbers of migrating tumor 
cells, decreased tumor cell proliferative activity, and increased percentages of tumor cells 
undergoing apoptosis (Merritt et al. 985-95). These pre-clinical findings led to a phase [ADDRESS_1070557] 
which showed the combination to be well tolerated, and with evidence of responses. 
The single-center, open-label phase I study included 25 extensively pretreated patients (pts) with 
gynecologic tumors (6 cervical, 7 endometrial, 8 ovarian, 4 other) were enrolled. Mean age was 
61 years; 19 Caucasian, 6 African American. This study comprised 28-day cycles of daily oral 
topotecan/pazopanib at dose levels of 0.50/400, 0.25/800, 0.25/600, and 0.25/[ADDRESS_1070558] 
3+3 dose escalation design was used. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as ≥ grade 3 
adverse event (AE) occurring in cycle 1, noncompletion of cycle 1 at prescribed dose, or 
inability to start cycle 2 as scheduled due to toxicities. Imaging was conducted after every 2 
cycles for response assessment. Median number of cycles received was 4 (range 1-19). DLTs 
occurred ≥  2 pts for A (2/6), B (2/7), C (3/7). For level D, 1/5 had a DLT, but one dose level C pt 
with a DLT received level D dosing due to unavailability of pazopanib. 9/25 pts had any serious 
adverse event (SAE), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_778849] (4/16 SAEs). Nausea, fatigue, 
dysgeusia, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most common conditions reported as non-serious 
AEs. The best overall response was 28%. The conclusions were that DLTs in dose levels C and 
D were effectively managed with minor dose and schedule adjustments. 4 pts with DLTs at these 
doses remained on treatment for 4, 5, and 6 months, with one pt still on treatment at 9 months. 
The overall response rate (CR + PR + SD) was 36% and 42% in the higher dosed groups.

Given the initial biologically favorable signal in this heavily pretreated group and low toxicity, 
the investigators recommended a randomized phase II trial to define efficacy using the 0.25/600 
regimen allowing for dose reduction if needed. 
Thus, several lines of reasoning argue for testing the oral combination of metronomic Topotecan 
and Pazopanib in recurrent GBM patients: A) There is prior clinical evidence of some, albeit 
limited, benefit of both Topotecan and Pazopanib, individually, in glioma patients (however, 
Topotecan has not been previously evaluated using metronomic dosing in GBM). B) The targets 
of Pazopanib and Topotecan, VEGFR, PDGFR, c-Kit, HIF-1 alpha, are all relevant in recurrent 
GBM. C) VEGF inhibition induces HIF-1 alpha activity in GBM, creating an environment for 
synergy. D) Recurrent GBM after standard therapy with chemoradiation or at the time of 
recurrence after bevacizumab (BEV) therapy are major problems, and unmet clinical needs. E) 
The oral administration of these agents will allow for rapid accrual and completion of this study 
and determination of an efficacy signal.
1.2.5 Rationale for patient outcomes measures:
This study seeks to establish effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778850].  We hypothesize that using a combination of pazopanib and 
topotecan will result in improved survival.  It will be important to determine whether any 
determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening 
of symptoms offset the increase in survival. 
Precedence for measuring “non-therapeutic” endpoints exists in oncology research.  For 
example, Gemcitabine was approved by [CONTACT_264330] a consequence of the decrease in 
pain reported in pancreatic patients who were treated, not on the basis of survival improvement 
which was modest, at best (Siu et al. 144-51).  There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to 
evaluate secondary endpoints using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit.  
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) allows the self-
reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities.  The MDASI-BT has 
demonstrated reliability and validity in the adult primary brain tumor patient population 
(Armstrong et al. 27-35). This tool represents a modification of the widely used and validated 
MDASI, with particular attention to symptoms common in patients with brain tumors.   The 
availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact 
of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.  This evaluation of symptom burden in this 
study will assist in finding the best possible treatment with the least toxicity.
2 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT AND ENROLLMENT
2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
2.1.1 General Inclusion Criteria 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme 
(GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original 
histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a 
GBM or GS is made. Patients must have evidence of progression of the 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070559] failed prior 
chemoradiation with temozolomide and any other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778851] 
(group A), or must have failed primary chemoradiation and a BEV-
incorporating treatment (group B).
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses.  Relapse 
is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if 
that was used as initial therapy).  The intent therefore is that patients had no 
more than 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If the 
patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer 
therapy was instituted for up to [ADDRESS_1070560] relapse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of 
chemoradiation or any additional radiation to reduce the chance of 
pseudoprogression.
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease is required unless patient is post-operative and in that 
case patient can have no evidence of disease.
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of 
the investigational nature of this study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Archived tumor tissue must be available for all subjects for confirmation of 
the diagnosis before or during treatment. Samples must be provided within 4 
weeks of enrollment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must be ≥ 18 years old.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60.
[IP_ADDRESS] At the time of registration:  Patients must have recovered from the toxic 
effects of prior therapy: > 28 days from any investigational agent, >28 days 
from prior cytotoxic therapy, >14 days from vincristine, >42 days from 
nitrosoureas, >21 days from procarbazine administration, >21 days from 
bevacizumab administration and >7 days for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., 
interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer 
does not count).  Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic 
agents should be directed to Academic PI.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have adequate organ function:
•Bone marrow function (WBC > 3,000/µl, ANC > 1,500/mm3, platelet count of > 
100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin > 10 gm/dl).

2.4 DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS
Patients with recurrent GBM or GS will be enrolled into one of the following groups: (A) 
Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma with no prior bevacizumab exposure: (B) Glioblastoma or 
gliosarcoma with prior bevacizumab exposure. Accrual goals and endpoints for each group are 
determined separately as described in the statistical section.
There will be a total accrual of approximately 66 eligible patients to this 2-arm Phase II study 
(34 recurrent GBM/GS patients with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, and 32 GBM/GS 
patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab).
3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a 2 arm phase II trial of the combination of topotecan and pazopanib in patients with 
recurrent GBM or GS. Patients will be enrolled into one of the following groups: (A) 
Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma with no prior bevacizumab exposure: (B) Glioblastoma or 
gliosarcoma with prior bevacizumab exposure. Topotecan and pazopanib are administered orally 
daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) at six months from 
patient registration for bevacizumab naïve patients and PFS at 3 months for patients with prior 
bevacizumab treatment.
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
Patients will be treated with the combination of topotecan and pazopanib at the following doses:
[IP_ADDRESS] Pazopanib: Starting dose is 600 mg (3x200mg) per day to be taken orally, 
daily, continuous, without food at least one hour before or two hours after a 
meal.
Pazopanib should be taken whole with water and must not be broken or crushed.
If a dose of pazopanib is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours until the next 
dose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Topotecan:  Starting dose of topotecan is 0.25 mg orally, daily, continuous.
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS:
3.3.[ADDRESS_1070586] the Academic PI [INVESTIGATOR_778853]’s Research Nurse Melanie Herrin, RN; [PHONE_16216]; 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 21 of 96
fax: [PHONE_5472], [EMAIL_14845]. Topotecan length of treatment is until 
progression, up to one year. Drug may be held up to 3 weeks waiting from toxicities to 
resolve. Drug dose will not be reduced.
3.3.2 Pazopanib length of treatment is until progression, up to one year. Dose of Pazopanib 
may be held up to 3 weeks waiting from toxicities to resolve and reduced to 400 mg or to 
200 mg daily based on side effects. Patient may be maintained on the lower dose of 
pazopanib during protocol if deemed to be deriving benefit from the drug.
If a patient is felt to be deriving benefit for the agent(s) and is stable at the one year time point, 
based on discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_778854]. 
3.3.3 Patients with stable or responding disease may be retreated at the same dose (both 
Topotecan and Pazopanib) or at a reduced dose level (pazopanib only), depending upon 
the adverse events observed in the current cycle and any adverse events present on the 
first day of the next cycle. If multiple toxicities are seen, the dose administered in a 
subsequent cycle should be based on the most severe toxicity experienced in the current 
cycle. 
Dose modifications or delays should be made based upon whether toxicities occur within a 4-
week treatment cycle or at the expected start of the next treatment cycle. 
3.3.4 Within Treatment Cycles:
[IP_ADDRESS] Topotecan:
For patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or other non-hematologic toxicities, the 
topotecan dose can be held up to 3 weeks waiting for toxicity to resolve to < Grade 2. Drug may 
be resumed at that time at same dose. If toxicity does not resolve in 3 weeks, patient will be 
taken off study. Patients with Grade 2 diarrhea may need to follow the same dose modification 
guidelines. 
Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is more than or equal to 1.5 
x 109/L, the platelet count is more than or equal to 75 x 109/L, and the hemoglobin level is more 
than or equal to 9 g/dL (after transfusion if necessary). 
Standard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan 
with other medications (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. Please refer 
to section 4.1 for protocol guideline regarding G-CSF administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pazopanib:
For Pazopanib, two dose reductions are permitted, from [ADDRESS_1070587] the dose re-escalated after completion 
of one cycle with toxicities less than or equal to grade 1.
3.3.5 Hematologic Toxicity:

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of other drug related complications:
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1 Management of Hepatic effects:
Cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during the use of pazopanib. In 
clinical trials with pazopanib, increase in serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were 
observed. In the majority of the cases, isolated increases in ALT and AST have been reported, 
without concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. The vast majority (92.5%) 
of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first [ADDRESS_1070589] 4 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated. Periodic monitoring 
should then continue after this time period.
The following guidelines are provided for patients with baseline values of total bilirubin ≤1.[ADDRESS_1070590] and ALT ≤[ADDRESS_1070591].
•Patients with isolated ALT elevations between [ADDRESS_1070592] may be 
continued on pazopanib with weekly monitoring of liver function until ALT return to 
Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline.
•Patients with ALT of >[ADDRESS_1070593] pazopanib interrupted until they return 
to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline. If the potential benefit for reinitiating 
pazopanib treatment is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then 
reintroduce pazopanib at a reduced dose of 400 mg once daily and measure serum 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 23 of 96
liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Following reintroduction of pazopanib, if ALT 
elevations >[ADDRESS_1070594] recur, then pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. 
•If ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_1070595] occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >[ADDRESS_1070596] 
pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. Patients should be monitored until 
return to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline. Pazopanib is a UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, 
indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s 
syndrome. Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, known or 
suspected Gilbert’s syndrome, and elevation in ALT >[ADDRESS_1070597] should be managed 
as per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations.
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations and should 
be undertaken with caution and close monitoring. 
Beyond recommending that patients with mild hepatic impairment are treated with 800 mg 
pazopanib once daily (600 mg daily for this study) and reducing the initial starting dose to [ADDRESS_1070598] been established for patients with preexisting 
hepatic impairment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and management of hypertension
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypertension including hypertensive crisis have 
occurred.  Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 or diastolic blood pressure ≥  100 mm Hg) 
occurs early in the course of treatment (39% of cases occurred by [CONTACT_2006] 9 and 88% of cases 
occurred in the first 18 weeks).
Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating pazopanib (see [IP_ADDRESS])  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 BP MONITORING:
•Check BP twice weekly for the first 2 months of therapy, then weekly for 2 months, 
and then once per month thereafter. On days that the patient is not scheduled for 
clinic visits, BP can be taken at home, local Pharmacy or local Physician’s office. 
•BP should be taken preferably in the morning and after resting for at least 5 minutes.
•If BP is ≥140/90, then it should be repeated twice ([ADDRESS_1070599] 
reading). The lowest of these 3 readings will be the one considered for grading and 
management purposes. 
•If BP measured outside the clinic visits is ≥140/90, the result should be immediately 
reported to the Research Nurse and/or treating physician to take appropriate action as 
outlined below.  
BP MANAGEMENT BASED ON GRADE (CTCAE 4.02):
Hypertension- Adverse Event Grade Management
Grade 1 (systolic 120-139, diastolic 80-
89)•no need to modify or add anti BP meds; if the patient 
is already taking BP meds, reinforce need for 
compliance.
•continue pazopanib and topotecan at same doses.
Grade 2 (systolic BP 140-159 or •add or increase dose of BP meds (at the discretion of 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 24 of 96
diastolic 90-99)* the treating physician); 
•continue topotecan; 
•HOLD pazopanib at the discretion of the treating 
physician until AE recovers to grade 0-1, then restart 
same dose. 
Grade 3 (systolic ≥160 or diastolic ≥100)* •add or increase dose of BP meds (at the discretion of 
the treating physician); 
•continue topotecan; 
•HOLD pazopanib until AE recovers to grade 0-1, 
then restart pazopanib reducing 1 dose level.
Grade 4 (malignant hypertension; 
transient or permanent neurologic 
deficit, hypertensive crisis)•DISCONTINUE pazopanib; 
•patient finishes trial participation.
*Note: for elevated BP to be considered grade 2 or 3 the patient should be previously 
normotensive or should be taking BP medication/s regularly. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 IF THE PATIENT IS NOT COMPLIANT:
•REINFORCE need for strict compliance with current BP medication/s, 
•HOLD pazopanib AND CONTINUE BP monitoring at least once a day until BP 
returns to grade 0-1, 
•Then resume pazopanib at same dose.
THIS ELEVATED BP WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AN AE UNLESS THERE IS A 
SECOND OCCURRENCE WHILE TAKING BP MEDICATIONS REGULARLY.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes:
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT prolongation or Torsade de Pointes have 
occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation, patients taking antiarrythmics or other medications that may potentially prolong 
QT interval, or those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using pazopanib, baseline 
and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (calcium, 
magnesium, potassium) within normal range is recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Arterial Thrombotic Events: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, myocardial infarctions, angina, ischemic stroke and transient 
ischemic attack were observed. Fatal events have been observed. Pazopanib should be used with 
caution in patients who are at increased risk of thrombotic events or who have had a history of 
thrombotic events. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had an event within the 
previous 6 months. A treatment decision should be made based upon the assessment of 
individual patient’s benefit/risk.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hemorrhagic Events:
In clinical studies with pazopanib hemorrhagic events have been reported. Fatal hemorrhagic 
events have occurred. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who had a history of 
hemoptysis, cerebral, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. 
Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with significant risk of hemorrhage.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 25 of 96
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Gastrointestinal Perforations and Fistula:
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation or fistula have 
occurred. Fatal perforation events have occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in 
patients at risk for GI perforation or fistula.
[IP_ADDRESS] Wound Healing issues: 
No formal studies on the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted. Since 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors may impair wound healing, treatment 
with pazopanib should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to 
resume pazopanib after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Pazopanib should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothyroidism: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypothyroidism have occurred. Proactive 
monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, proteinuria has been reported. Baseline and periodic 
urinalyses during treatment are recommended and patients should be monitored for worsening of 
proteinuria. Pazopanib should be discontinued if the patient develops nephrotic syndrome.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy: 
Pre-clinical studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. If the patient becomes pregnant 
while receiving pazopanib or topotecan, the potential hazard to the fetus should be explained to 
the patient. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving treatment with pazopanib or topotecan. Pazopanib or topotecan should not be 
used during pregnancy or lactation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Topotecan-induced neutropenic colitis:
Topotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic 
colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, 
neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis 
should be considered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Interstitial lung disease: 
Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which 
have been fatal. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, 
thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, 
dyspnea and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is 
confirmed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea
Diarrhea, including severe diarrhea requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], has been reported during treatment 
with oral topotecan. The incidence of diarrhea has been reported to be greater in patients 
receiving oral topotecan compared to those receiving topotecan i.v. Additionally, in patients with 
relapsing small cell lung cancer, greater than 65 years of age, there is substantially higher risk of 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 26 of 96
severe diarrhea and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778855] 65 years of age. 
Communication with patients prior to drug administration regarding diarrhea and proactive 
management of all signs of diarrhea is important. Physicians are advised to follow guidelines that 
describe the aggressive management of this event. This includes use of anti-diarrheal agents, 
administration of fluids and electrolytes and interruption or discontinuation of therapy with oral 
topotecan. 
Diarrhea related to oral topotecan can occur at the same time as drug-related neutropenia and its 
sequelae.
[IP_ADDRESS] At the Start of the Next Treatment Cycle:
A new course of treatment may begin when the ANC is at least 1500/mm3 and the platelet count 
is at least 75,000/mm3 and any other treatment-related toxicities are less than or equal to grade 1.  
If after a one-week delay, all treatment related toxicities are less than or equal to grade 1, then 
proceed with treatment at the dose level dictated by [CONTACT_778886].  If 
treatment related toxicities have not resolved to less than or equal to grade [ADDRESS_1070600] be held for more than 2 weeks the investigator should be notified.  If a patient 
develops another DLT at the reduced dose or if they experience a life-threatening toxicity at any 
time, they will be removed from study.
3.4 ON STUDY EVALUATION
3.4.1 General Requirements
[IP_ADDRESS] CBC with differential and platelets and serum chemistries and LFTs (ALT, 
AST and bilirubin) will be performed every two weeks X 2, (+/- 3 days) then 
every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) prior to each cycle during treatment. UPC (+/- 3 
days) will be done monthly prior to each cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] A brain MRI/CT for group B will be done monthly until 3 months then every 
other month thereafter, for group A scan will be obtained every other month 
prior to initiation of odd numbered 28 days treatment cycles (+/- 3 days).
[IP_ADDRESS] All relevant information regarding drug doses, concomitant medications, and 
doses, measurable lesions with measurements, tumor response, laboratory 
examinations, and treatment-related toxicities shall be documented in the 
patient’s medical record and flow sheets.
3.4.2 A complete Neurologic exam (to include documentation of the patients Karnofsky 
Performance Status) will be performed prior to every evaluation where an MRI is 
scheduled. The MDASI-BT (Appendix 15.5) will be completed at baseline and at the 
time of each evaluation that includes an imaging study. 
3.4.3 The patient will complete the MDASI-BT (see Appendix 15.5) at the time of clinical 
evaluation with MRI as long as the clinical therapy is being administered, unless clinical 
deterioration makes self-report not possible before that time.  The time when patients are 
unable to complete the self-report questionnaires will be used as part of the study 
analysis.  The MDASI-BT will be completed only by [CONTACT_102], unless changes in vision 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070601] with marking the severity number or score 
as described by [CONTACT_102]. A patient caregiver may complete the questionnaires as a 
patient-preference proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self-report.
[IP_ADDRESS] A measurement of BP should be taken twice weekly for the first 2 months of 
therapy, then weekly for 2 months, and then once per month thereafter as 
detailed in [IP_ADDRESS]. BP can be assessed by [CONTACT_70485] (i.e., at home or by 
[CONTACT_20427]) as long as the treating physician is informed of the 
measurement, verifies any measurement that is not normal and takes 
appropriate action.
[IP_ADDRESS] Thyroid function test (T4 and TSH) (+/- 3 days) are to be monitored every 8 
weeks (+/- 3 days)
[IP_ADDRESS] EKG before treatment and week 4 and then every 8 weeks until end of 
treatment (+/- 3 days)
3.4.4 Follow-up
Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at the end of each cycle. In addition, all serious 
adverse events will be reported to the NCI BTTC as in section 8.6. 
All patients will be followed for overall survival, when possible.
Patients who discontinue treatment due to progression will be followed for survival every 3 
months.
Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression should be followed until 
progression or institution of new anti-tumor therapy.  They should then be followed for survival.
3.5 QUESTIONNAIRES
The MDASI-BT will be utilized for this portion of the study. Full instruments are provided in the 
Appendix 15.5  In addition, information regarding demographics and treatment history will be 
collected as part of the larger study and used in this analysis.   
The MDASI-BT consists of 23 symptoms rated on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) to indicate the 
presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you 
can imagine.” Each symptom is rated at its worst in the last 24 hours. Symptoms included on the 
instrument include those commonly associated with cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], those associated with 
increased intracranial pressure, and those related to focal deficits.  The questionnaire also 
includes ratings of how much symptoms interfered with different aspects of a patient’s life in the 
last 24 hours. These interference items include: general activity, mood, work (includes both work 
outside the home and housework), relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life. 
The interference items are also measured on 0 - 10 scales. The average time to complete these 
instruments is 5 minutes. The MDASI-BT has been translated into 18 languages [17, 20]

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
4.1 G-CSF ADMINISTRATION
[IP_ADDRESS] If neutrophil count < 1500/mm3 or platelet count < 75,000/mm3, hold 
topotecan until counts resolve to < grade 2 CTC grade toxicity. If neutrophil 
count remains < 1500/mm3 x 1 week or more, granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor may be used to support. If neutrophil count achieves level 
> 1500/mm3, patient may resume treatment with oral topotecan. If toxicities 
do not resolve to < CTC grade [ADDRESS_1070605] be removed from study.  Platelet counts that do not 
resolve to < CTC grade [ADDRESS_1070606] not be on a dexamethasone dose of 
greater than 16 mg/day.
4.3 ANTI- SEIZURE MEDICATIONS
Anti-seizure medications should be used as indicated. If for unavoidable clinical reasons (severe 
allergies, toxicities, etc.) a patients AED is switched to the alternate AED group the following 
guidelines must be followed:
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients are to be maintained on non-EIAEDS
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1070607] be started on a non-EIAED. Two weeks 
washout after this change are required before starting treatment on 
study.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Patients who were previously on a non- EIAED and were 
inadvertently and temporarily changed to an EIAED, should 
immediately be started on another non-EIAED. The patient may 
continue the current treatment dose while a non- EIAED is re-
started.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who were previously on a non-EIAED and need to permanently 
change anticonvulsant, but who cannot change to another non-EIAED need 
to be removed from the study due to drug-drug interactions
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who were previously on a non-EIAED and need to change 
anticonvulsants, should be started on another non-EIAED if at all possible. 
No delays in treatment would be required.

& social security number “blacked out” and the assigned patient ID number and protocol number 
written in. Patient initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification.
6.1.4 Safety Data 
All patients receiving study agents will be evaluated for safety.  The safety parameters include all 
laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, CNS observations, physical examination 
findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_1962].  All 
toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and recorded prior to each course 
of therapy.  Life-threatening toxicities that are unexpected and assessed to be possibly related to 
the study agent/s should be reported immediately as per section  7.2.
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other 
means, will be collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form and followed as 
appropriate. An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring 
after starting study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study 
drug.

Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 34 of 96
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered adverse 
events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). 
Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent 
form are recorded on the Baseline Evaluations Case Report Form. Abnormal laboratory values or 
test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require 
therapy, and are also recorded on the Adverse Events Case Report Form.

6.4 RESPONSE C RITERIA
The primary efficacy endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) at six months from patient 
registration for bevacizumab naïve patients and PFS at 3 months for patients with prior 
bevacizumab treatment.  However, objective response status should be measured and recorded.
6.4.1 Definitions of Response
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Disease: Bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly 
defined margins by [CONTACT_28842].
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Disease: Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with 
margins not clearly defined. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Evaluable Disease: Not Applicable for response evaluation
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Status, To Be Recorded at Each Evaluation: If there are too many 
measurable lesions to measure at each evaluation, choose the largest two to 
be followed before a patient is entered on study.  The remaining lesions will 
be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  
Unless progression is observed, objective status can only be determined 
when ALL measurable and evaluable sites and lesions are assessed.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all 
measurable and evaluable disease.  No new lesions.  No evidence of 
non-evaluable disease.  All measurable, evaluable and non-evaluable 
lesions and sites must be assessed using the same techniques as 
baseline.  Patients must be on no steroids.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Partial Response (PR):  Greater than or equal to 50% decrease under 
baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all 
measurable lesions.  No progression of evaluable disease.  No new 
lesions.  All measurable and evaluable lesions and sites must be 
assessed using the same techniques as baseline. The steroid dose at 
the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the 
maximum dose used in the first 8 weeks from initiation of therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Partial Response, Non-Measurable (PRNM): Not applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Stable/No Response: Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  
All measurable and evaluable sites must be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline.  The steroid dose at the time of the scan 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070615] 8 weeks from initiation of therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Progression: 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable 
lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) 
using the same techniques as baseline, OR clear worsening of any 
evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR clear 
clinical worsening or failure to return for evaluation due to death or 
deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer). 
Patients will also be considered to have progressive disease if there 
is significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesions AND 
clinical progression. (See section 6.4.1 and 6.3.7 for definitions). To 
be considered progressive disease, increase in T2/FLAIR should 
occur on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to 
baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, and 
should not be due to co-morbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post-operative 
changes, or other treatment effects).
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Unknown: Progression has not been documented and one or more 
measurable or evaluable sites have not been assessed.
6.4.[ADDRESS_1070616] Response: This will be calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.
For patients with all disease sites assessed every evaluation period, the best response will be 
defined as the best objective status as measured according to Section 6.4.1.  If the response does 
not persist at the next regular scheduled MRI, the response will still be recorded based on the 
prior scan, but will be designated as a non-sustained response.  If the response is sustained, e. g. 
still present on the subsequent MRI, it will be recorded as a sustained response, lasting until the 
time of tumor progression.  Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best 
response or increasing disease and if all objective status determinations before progression are 
unknown.
6.4.3 Neurological Exam: Although not used for determining response, it is useful to evaluate 
improvement in the neurologic exam, (as compared to the baseline assessment), that 
should coincide with objective measurement of tumor size.

Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 37 of 96
6.4.4 Performance Status: Patients will be graded according to Karnofsky Performance Status 
(See Appendix 15.1). Clinical progression can be declared if there is a decrease in [ADDRESS_1070617] 7 days and not attributable to comorbid events or change in steroid dose.
6.4.5 Time to Treatment Failure: From date of registration to the date of first observation of 
progressive disease (as defined in Section 6.4 .1.4.5), non-reversible neurologic 
progression or permanently increased steroid requirement (applies to stable disease only), 
death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. 
6.4.6 Time to Death: From date of registration to date of death due to any cause.
6.4.7 Documenting FLAIR: investigators will be asked to measure tumor related changes on 
FLAIR sequence as best as possible, as non-enhancing patterns of recurrence can 
occur.  If this occurs within the setting of clinical progression not caused by [CONTACT_778890], the patient will be considered to have progressive disease. Please 
see section 6.4.1 for definition of clinical progression.
Presumed non-enhancing tumor without clinical progression should be observed. The time of 
progression if eventual clinical deterioration occurs can be back dated to the time of the increase 
in non-enhancing tumor. Investigators will also be asked to document if recurrence of disease is 
multifocal.
6.5 TOXICITY CRITERIA
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1070618] access to a copy of the CTCAE version

[IP_ADDRESS] IRB Approvals 
The Administrative PI [INVESTIGATOR_778857] a copy of the participating 
institution’s approved yearly continuing review.  Registration will be halted at any participating 
institution in which a current continuing approval is not on file at the NIH Intramural IRB.
7.3 NIH REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
7.3.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team 
The clinical research team will have a teleconference every other week when patients are being 
actively treated on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and 
dose escalation if applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients. 
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_778891][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, 
new information that might affect either the ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or 
protocol deviations will be immediately reported to the IRB using eIRB system. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_131729]. The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_131730]. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1070619] 25% of enrolled patients will be randomly selected and monitored at least biannually or 
as needed, based on accrual rate. The patients selected will have 100% source document 
verification done. Additional monitoring activities will include: adherence to protocol specified 
study eligibility, treatment plans, data collection for safety and efficacy, reporting and time 
frames of adverse events to the NIH Intramural IRB and FDA, and informed consent 
requirements. Written reports will be generated in response to the monitoring activities and 
submitted to the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74837], CCR, 
NCI.
7.3.3 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)
This protocol will require oversight from the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  Initial 
review will occur as soon as possible after the annual NIH Intramural IRB continuing review 
date.   Subsequently, each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the quarterly meeting 
schedule permits or more frequently as may be required by [CONTACT_4484].   For initial and subsequent 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070620] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2))
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death,
•A life-threatening adverse event (see 8.1.3)
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32)
8.1.4 Severity
The severity of each Adverse Event will be assessed utilizing the CTCAE version 4.0.
8.2 ASSESSING CA[LOCATION_003]LITY
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent/s 
caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 40 of 96
Yes: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event.
No: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.
8.3 PROTOCOL SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778858]: 
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
• treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition that did 
not worsen
• treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
Pregnancy, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also be reported on a serious 
adverse event form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or 
congenital abnormalities.
8.4 GUIDELINES & PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING D EVIATIONS A ND UNANTICIPATED 
PROBLEMS
Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines define the term “protocol deviation.”  The 
definition is often left to the Lead Institution IRB.  Accordingly, since NCI, Center for Cancer 
Research is the Coordinating Center and the Administrative PI [INVESTIGATOR_778859], the definitions for unanticipated problem and protocol deviation as 
described in Policy [ADDRESS_1070621]. 
Protocol Deviations or Unanticipated problems occurring at a participating institution will be 
submitted to that institution’s own IRB in accordance with local policies and procedures.   
However, the participating institution must submit a report to the BTTC Coordinating Center 
even in instances where the local IRB does not require a report. 
Deviations or Unanticipated problems must be submitted to the NCI BTTC Coordinating Center 
within 5 working days after becoming aware of the event (if not reportable to the local IRB). 
When Deviations or Unanticipated Problems are reported to BTTC, but, the local IRB does not 
require a report, the report that is submitted to the NCI BTTC Coordinating Center must be 
accompanied by a formal memo explaining the local policy and the rationale for not reporting 
the event to the local IRB.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 41 of 96
Deviation or Unanticipated problem Reports and any accompanying documentation (to include 
the local IRB acknowledgement of the event when applicable) are to be submitted to the NCI 
BTTC Coordinating Center using the problem report form in Appendix 15.9  via fax at: 301-451-
5429.
NCI Center for Cancer Research Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the 
deviation/unanticipated problem report from the participating institution, the NCI BTTC 
Coordinating Center will submit the report to the Academic PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294]. 
8.5 REPORTING TO THE STUDY DRUG MANUFACTURER (NOVARTIS)
The NCI BTTC Coordinating Center will forward all SAE reports to the lead IRB via the lead 
investigator, FDA (when applicable), and [COMPANY_001]:
[COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Corporation
FAX:  [PHONE_2093]
SAEs will be forwarded to [COMPANY_001] via the NCI BTTC Coordinating Center in accordance 
with the following:
All serious adverse events should be reported to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_1070622] for reporting 
procedures.  In brief:
The Investigator/Sponsor may report serious adverse drug reactions 
(SADRs) using either: 
An ADEERS form (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System) available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html  
OR
A MedWatch form available at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/ 
Occasionally BTTC may contact [CONTACT_15483], clarification, or current 
status of the subject for whom an adverse event was reported. 
8.6 GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS TO BTTC
What to Report? When to Report?
1. All Deaths, except that due to 
progressive disease, occurring from the 
time the consent is signed through [ADDRESS_1070623] day of active 
treatmentWithin 1 working  day (24 hours) from the 
time the research team becomes aware of

What to Report? When to Report?
2. Other Serious Unexpected Suspected 
Adverse Reactions (that did not result in 
death) occurring from the time the 
consent is signed through [ADDRESS_1070624] also submit the report to their IRB in accordance with their 
institutional policies. 
The BTTC Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Serious Adverse Events from 
each institution. The BTTC Coordinating Center will notify all investigators of any serious and 
unexpected adverse experiences that are possibly related to the study agent/s.  The investigators 
are to file a copy with their protocol file and send a copy to their IRB according to their local 
IRB’s policies and procedures.

survival curve methodology.  Six-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals.  
Recurrent glioblastoma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab cohort (Group A):  A 
maximum of [ADDRESS_1070626] 
stage, 9 patients will be accrued.  If two or more patients are progression-free at 6 months 
(PFS6), an additional [ADDRESS_1070627] 
PFS6, then the study will be declared promising. This study has a 5% chance of declaring 
promise if the PFS6 rate is at most 15%.  It has an 80% chance of declaring promise if the PFS 
rate is at least 35%. 
Recurrent glioblastoma with prior exposure to bevacizumab cohort (Group B):  In the 
group that failed bevacizumab, a maximum of 32 patients will be observed in a two-stage Simon 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070628] stage, 14 patients will be accrued.  If one or more patients is 
progression-free at 3 months (PFS3), an additional [ADDRESS_1070629] PFS3, then the study will be declared promising.  This study has a 5% chance of 
declaring promise if the PFS3 rate is at most 1%.  It has an 80% chance of declaring promise if 
the PFS rate is at least 12%. 
In both patient cohorts, for patients who drop out for reasons other than PD or toxicity, we will 
replace them. We expect the dropout rate to be not more than 10%, therefore in general it is not 
an issue to implement the design. The patients who drop out due to toxicity will be counted as 
treatment failure when implementing the Simon’s two stage design and assessing the 6-month 
PFS rate in either cohort. 
The trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_778892], Morris D. Groves, MD, and the study 
statistician, Yuan Ying, PhD.
We will monitor the toxicity based on the combined data from the above two cohorts with a total 
sample size of 66. All grade 3 or greater toxicities attributable to the study treatment will be 
counted. Accrual will be temporarily suspended for analysis after each of the following interim 
accrual goals. We will monitor the toxicity when the accrual is 5, 10, 20, 35, and 50 based on 
using the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]: if the posterior probability of toxicity greater than 0.3 is 
greater than 0.95 (i.e., Pr (toxicity>0.3|data) >0.95), we terminate the study for toxicity. 
Assuming the beta prior Beta (0.6, 1.4) for the toxicity, we have the following operating 
characteristics. 
Operating characteristics of the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_778860] 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5

We obtain the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]: the study will be terminated if we observe >= 4/5, 
6/10, 10/20, 16/35, 21/50 (# of patients experienced DLTs/# of patients treated).  Note that our 
safety monitoring starts with a small cohort size of 5, and then gradually increases to 15. 
Therefore, if the treatment agents are overly toxic, the trial will stop before exposing many 
patients to toxicities.
Patient-reported outcomes:  The sample size for this trial was based on the primary endpoint of 
the study.
Received MDASI-BT forms will be checked versus the timing schedule and considered as valid 
if they fall within ten days of the scheduled assessment.  Compliance rates will be calculated as 
the number of received valid forms over the number of expected forms. Differences between 
groups in compliance will be tested by [CONTACT_264348]’s exact test at every time point.
We will use descriptive statistics to describe how patients rate symptom severity and interference 
with function at each time point.  Error bar graphs for each of the symptoms will be constructed 
at each time point.  The proportion of patients rating their symptoms to be 7 or greater (on a 0-10 
scale) will also be reported.  We will construct individual patient profiles for each of the selected 
symptoms to describe the individual patients’ patterns of change over time. We will calculate the

on the title page of this study.  In addition, there is a CDA ([ZIP_CODE]-17) in place with [COMPANY_001].  
Other agreements are found in Appendix 15.13, Technology Transfer Agreements. 
11HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS
11.[ADDRESS_1070631] SELECTION
This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to measure 
differences of intervention effects.  Males and females will be recruited with no preference to 
sex.  No exclusion to this study will be based on race.  Minorities will actively be recruited to 
participate.  High grade gliomas occur in patients of all races and although there is a slight 
predominance in men, this is a disease that is also common in women.  The molecular targets of 
pazopanib and topotecan within the tumor are not known to be different among patients based on 
sex or race; hence this study will be open to all adults.
11.[ADDRESS_1070632] glioblastoma, and because of unknown toxicities of the study agents in the 
pediatric patient.  Furthermore, the targets of the pazopanib and topotecan are not as prevalent in 
pediatric malignant gliomas and therefore, the efficacy of this regimen will be initially 
determined in the adult population before consideration of its use in pediatrics.
11.3 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The primary risk to patients participating in this research study is from the toxicity of pazopanib 
and topotecan, or both drugs.  Both are investigational agents in the treatment of gliomas, 
although bevacizumab is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.  The 
protocol provides for detailed and careful monitoring of all patients to assess for toxicity.  
Toxicity data from the current dose level will be collected and reviewed to ensure that there were 
no severe toxicities that would preclude further patient enrollment.  Patients will be treated with 
therapeutic intent and response to the therapy will be closely monitored.

and/or survival.  
11.4.2 Risks
Risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the 
Consent Document or this protocol document.  Frequent monitoring for adverse effects will help 
to minimize the risks associated with administration of the study agents.
11.4.3 Risks/Benefits Analysis
The potential benefits from this therapy are disease stabilization or shrinkage and a reduction in 
symptoms caused by [CONTACT_264349].  Given the 
efforts to minimize risk with the administration of this combination, this protocol involves 
greater than minimal risk, but presents the potential for direct benefit to individual subjects.
11.5 CONSENT AND ASSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
All patients who are being considered for this trial will undergo informed consent prior to being 
enrolled on the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_264289]. 
Patients and family members when applicable will be asked to read the consent and will be 
encouraged to ask questions. It will be stated clearly that participation in the research study is 
voluntary and that participants can withdraw from the study without losing benefits they would 
otherwise be entitled to. Patients will be enrolled after the consent document has been signed. 
Separate consents will be obtained for any surgical procedures performed.  The informed consent 
process will be documented in the patient’s medical record and on the informed consent 
document. This process will be performed by [CONTACT_264350] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/ benefit assessment, the 
consent form will be reviewed and updated as necessary. All subjects (including those already 
being treated) will be informed of the new information, be given a copy of the revised form, and 
be asked give their consent to continue in the study.

13 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
There will be no IND obtained for the use of Topotecan or Pazopanib for this study. 
This study meets the criteria for exemption for an IND as this investigation is not intended to 
support a new indication for use or any other significant change to the labeling;
the drugs are already approved and marketed and the investigation is not intended to support a 
significant change in advertising; and the investigation does not involve a route of administration 
or dosage level in use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks 
(or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.

13.1.6 Mechanism of Action: The anti-tumor activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of 
topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately involved in DNA replication as it relieves the 
torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits 
topoisomerase-I by [CONTACT_778894]-cleaved DNA 
which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of inhibition of

patients following doses of 1.2 to 3.1 mg/m2 and 4 mg/dose administered daily for 5 days.
[IP_ADDRESS] Absorption
Topotecan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_778861] 1 to 2 hours 
following oral administration. Following co-administration of the ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 
(P-gp) inhibitor, elacridar (GF120918) at 100 to 1000 mg with oral topotecan, the AUC 0-inf of 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 48 of 96
topotecan lactone and total topotecan increased approximately 2.5-fold. Administration of oral 
cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg), an inhibitor of transporters ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCC1 (MRP-1) as 
well as the metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, within 4 hours of oral topotecan increased the dose-
normalized AUC 0-24h of topotecan lactone and total topotecan approximately 2.0- and 2.5-fold, 
respectively. Following a high-fat meal, the extent of exposure was similar in the fed and fasted 
state while t max was delayed from 1.5 to 3 hours (topotecan lactone) and from 3 to 4 hours (total 
topotecan). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Distribution 
The binding of topotecan to plasma proteins was low (35%) and its distribution between blood 
cells and plasma was homogeneous.
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism
A major route of inactivation of topotecan is a reversible pH-dependent ring opening to the 
inactive carboxylate form. Metabolism accounts for less than 10% of the elimination of 
topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite was found in urine, plasma, and feces. Following oral 
administration the mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio was less than 10% for both total topotecan 
and topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronide of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has been 
identified in the urine. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A nor did it 
inhibit the human cytosolic enzymes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase or xanthine oxidase.
[IP_ADDRESS] Elimination 
Following oral administration, the plasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially. The 
pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan are approximately dose proportional. There is little or no 
accumulation of either formulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing, and there is no 
evidence of a change in the pharmacokinetics with multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of 
topotecan after oral administration have been evaluated in cancer patients following doses of 1.2 
to 3.1 mg/m2 and 4 mg/dose administered daily for 5 days. Oral topotecan exhibits a mean 
terminal half-life of approximately 3.0 to 6.0 hours. Overall recovery of drug-related material 
following five daily doses of topotecan was 49% to 71% of the administered oral dose. 
Approximately 20% was excreted as total topotecan and 2% was excreted as N-desmethyl 
topotecan in the urine. Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 33% while fecal 
elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.5%. Overall, the N-desmethyl metabolite 
contributed a mean of less than 6% (range 4–8%) of the total drug related material accounted for 
in the urine and feces.
13.1.[ADDRESS_1070638] the pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan.
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal impairment 
Patients with small cell lung carcinoma who participated in oral topotecan clinical trials had a 
serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (133umol/L) or a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 
greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. Dosing recommendations for patients receiving oral 
topotecan with CrCl less than 60 mL/min have not been established. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 49 of 96
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan has not been specifically studied in patients with impaired 
hepatic function.
13.1.9 Pre-clinical Toxicology:
[IP_ADDRESS] Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis
The carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied. In common with a number of other 
cytotoxic agents, and resulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to 
mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone 
marrow cells in vivo.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive toxicology
As with other cytotoxics, topotecan was also shown to cause embryo-fetal toxicity when given to 
rats (0.59 mg/m2/day) and rabbits (1.25 mg/m2/day) at doses less than the clinical i.v. dose in 
humans (1.5 mg/m2/day). A dose of 0.59 mg/m2 was teratogenic in rats (predominantly effects of 
the eye, brain, skull and vertebrae).

[IP_ADDRESS] Special Warnings and Precautions for Use
Topotecan is approved for treatment of patients with ovarian, cervical cancers and small cell 
lung cancer.  There is less experience in treating primary brain tumor patient, thus there is always 
potential for unexpected adverse events.

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Pregnancy: Topotecan is contraindicated during pregnancy and 
during breast-feeding.
Women of childbearing potential must be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, which 
includes severe malformation (teratogenicity), failure to thrive and fetal death (embryotoxicity).
Topotecan has been shown to be both embryotoxic and fetotoxic in preclinical studies. As with 
other cytotoxic drugs, topotecan may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women 
and therefore is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant during therapy with topotecan and to inform the treating physician immediately should 
this occur.
Topotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding. Topotecan should not be used during 
pregnancy.

observed when driving or operating machinery if fatigue and 
asthenia persist.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Pharmacokinetics of oral 
topotecan have not been specifically studied in patients with 
impaired hepatic function.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Patients with Renal Impairment: Patients with small cell lung 
carcinoma who participated in oral topotecan clinical trials had a 
serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (133umol/L) or a 
creatinine clearance (CrCl) of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. 
Dosing recommendations for patients receiving oral topotecan with 
CrCl less than 60 mL/min have not been established.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: The 
carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied. In common 
with a number of other cytotoxic agents, and resulting from its 
mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells 
(mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse 
bone marrow cells in vivo . As with other cytotoxics, topotecan was 
also shown to cause embryo-fetal toxicity when given to rats (0.59 
mg/m2/day) and rabbits (1.25 mg/m2/day) at doses less than the 
clinical i.v. dose in humans (1.5 mg/m2/day). A dose of 0.59 mg/m2 
was teratogenic in rats (predominantly effects of the eye, brain, skull 
and vertebrae).
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Pediatric Use:  Use in children is not recommended as only 
limited data are available.
[IP_ADDRESS].7 Geriatric Use:  No overall differences in effectiveness were 
observed between patients over 65 years and younger adult patients. 
However, it has been reported that patients older than 65 years old 
receiving topotecan experienced an increase in drug related diarrhea 
compared to those younger than 65 years of age.
[IP_ADDRESS].8 Capsules:
Interaction with Other Medications: As with other myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents, greater 
myelosuppression is likely to be seen when topotecan is used in combination with other 
cytotoxic agents (e.g. paclitaxel or etoposide) thereby [CONTACT_778896]. However, in 
combining with platinum agents (e.g. cisplatin or carboplatin), there is a distinct sequence-
dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on day [ADDRESS_1070641] be given compared to the doses which can be given if the platinum agent is 
given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. When topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive 
days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on Day 1) were administered intravenously in 13 patients with 
ovarian cancer, mean topotecan plasma clearance on Day 5 was slightly reduced compared to 
values on Day 1. As a result, systemic exposure of total topotecan, as measured by [CONTACT_163240], on Day 5 were increased by 12% (95% CI; 2%, 24%) and 23% (95% CI; —7%, 63%), 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 54 of 96
respectively. No pharmacokinetic data are available following topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 3 
consecutive days) and cisplatin (50 mg/m2/day on Day 1) in patients with cervical cancer.
When oral topotecan was combined with cisplatin in a randomized Phase 3 study in 
chemotherapy-naïve, extensive disease, small cell lung cancer patients, the regimen of oral 
topotecan (1.7 mg/m2/d for 5 days) with i.v. cisplatin (60 mg/m2 on day 5) was selected.
Topotecan is a substrate for both ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein). Inhibitors of 
ABCB1 and ABCG2 (eg. elacridar) administered with oral topotecan increased topotecan 
exposure. The effect of elacridar on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous topotecan was much 
less than the effect on oral topotecan Cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of ABCB1, ABCC1 [MRP-1], 
and CYP3A4) with oral topotecan increased topotecan AUC. 
Patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events when oral topotecan is administered 
with a drug known to inhibit ABCG2 or ABCB1.
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan after oral administration were generally unchanged when 
coadministered with ranitidine.

13.1.11 Clinical Pharmacokinetic Properties:
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan after oral administration have been evaluated in cancer 
patients following doses of 1.2 to 3.1 mg/m2 and 4 mg/dose administered daily for 5 days.
[IP_ADDRESS] Absorption and Distribution
Absorption
Topotecan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_778861] 1 to 2 hours 
following oral administration. Following co-administration of the ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 
(P-gp) inhibitor, elacridar (GF120918) at 100 to 1000 mg with oral topotecan, the AUC (0-inf) of 
topotecan lactone and total topotecan increased approximately 2.5-fold. Administration of oral 
cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg), an inhibitor of transporters ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCC1 (MRP-1) as 
well as the metabolising enzyme CYP3A4, within 4 hours of oral topotecan increased the dose-
normalized AUC (0-24h) of topotecan lactone and total topotecan approximately 2.0- and 2.5-
fold, respectively.
Following a high-fat meal, the extent of exposure was similar in the fed and fasted state while 
tmax was delayed from 1.5 to 3 hours (topotecan lactone) and from 3 to 4 hours (total topotecan).
Distribution
The binding of topotecan to plasma proteins was low (35%) and its distribution between blood 
cells and plasma was homogeneous.
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism and Elimination
Metabolism
A major route of inactivation of topotecan is a reversible pH-dependent ring opening to the 
inactive carboxylate form. Metabolism accounts for less than 10% of the elimination of 
topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite was found in urine, plasma, and feces. Following oral 
administration the mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio was less than 10% for both total topotecan 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 56 of 96
and topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronide of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has been 
identified in the urine. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A nor did it 
inhibit the human cytosolic enzymes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase or xanthine oxidase.
Elimination
Following oral administration, the plasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially. The 
pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan are approximately dose proportional. There is little or no 
accumulation of either formulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing, and there is no 
evidence of a change in the pharmacokinetics with multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of 
topotecan after oral administration have been evaluated in cancer patients following doses of 1.2 
to 3.1 mg/m2 and 4 mg/dose administered daily for 5 days. Oral topotecan exhibits a mean 
terminal half-life of approximately 3.0 to 6.0 hours. Overall recovery of drug-related material 
following five daily doses of topotecan was 49% to 71% of the administered oral dose. 
Approximately 20% was excreted as total topotecan and 2% was excreted as N-desmethyl 
topotecan in the urine. Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 33% while fecal 
elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.5%. Overall, the N-desmethyl metabolite 
contributed a mean of less than 6% (range 4–8%) of the total drug related material accounted for 
in the urine and feces.

When a number of investigators are participating on a clinical study at the same institution, one 
investigator should be considered or designated the Principal or lead investigator under whom all 
investigational agents for that protocol should be ordered. 
13.1.15 Agent Storage and Accountability: 
The investigator is responsible for the proper and secure physical storage and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_778862]. Specifically, the investigator must:  
•Maintain a careful record of the receipt, use and final disposition of all 
investigational agents received, using the NCI Agent Accountability Record 
Form (DARF), http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html.  
•Store the agent in a secure location, accessible to only authorized personnel, 
preferably in the pharmacy.
• Maintain appropriate storage of the investigational agent to ensure the 
stability and integrity of the agent.
• Return or destroy any unused investigational agents at the completion of the 
study or upon notification that an agent is being withdrawn.
The intent of the agent accountability procedures described in this section is to assist the 
investigator in making certain that agents received from BTTC are used only for patients entered 
onto an approved protocol. The record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_778863]. Investigators are responsible for the use of investigational agents shipped in their 
name. Even if a pharmacist or chemotherapy nurse has the actual task of handling these agents 
upon receipt, the investigator is the responsible individual and has agreed to accept this 
responsibility by [CONTACT_366946] 1572, 
http://www.fda.gov/opacom/morechoices/fdaforms/FDA-1572.doc.
13.1.16 BTTC Procedures for Agent Accountability and Storage 
•Each investigational agent should be stored separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent 
is used for more than one protocol, there should be separate physical storage 
for each protocol. Remember that agents are provided and accounted for on a 
protocol-by-protocol basis.
•Each agent should be accounted for separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent is used 
for more than one protocol, there should be a separate Drug Accountability 
Record Form (DARF) for each protocol, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html. There should be a separate DARF for 
each agent in a multi-agent protocol.
•Separate accountability forms should be maintained for each different strength 
or dosage form of a particular agent (e.g., an agent with a 1-mg vial and a 5-
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 58 of 96
mg vial would require a different DARF for the 1-mg vial than for the 5-mg 
vial).
• The DARF has been designed for use at each location where agents are 
stored, e.g., main pharmacy, satellite pharmacy, physician's office, or other 
dispensing areas.
•The DARF is also designed to accommodate both dispensing records and 
other agent transaction documentation (e.g., receipt of agent, returns, broken 
vials, etc.). A copy of the DARF may be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html.
•Unauthorized inter-institutional transfer of BTTC investigational agents from 
one participating institution to another is not permitted.  For some protocols 
the lead institution may enter into contractual agreements to forward agents to 
participating institutions (see BTTC Operations Manual).
•BTTC Supplied agents must not be repackaged and forwarded to patients on a 
routine basis. Refer to the BTTC Operations Manual for BTTC polices on 
forwarding BTTC supplied agents under certain limited circumstances.
Verification of Compliance
Investigators are reminded that compliance with procedures to ensure proper agent usage will be 
reviewed during site visits conducted under the monitoring program. Specifically, site visitors 
will check that the agent accountability system is being maintained, and will spot-check the 
agent accountability records by [CONTACT_264361]' medical records to verify that 
the agents were administered to a patient entered in the recorded protocol
13.1.17 Returning or destroying unused and/or defective Agent: 
Investigators/Designees should make every effort to minimize the amount of agent ordered and 
returned or destroyed unused, (e.g. limit inventories to an 8 week supply or less). 
Investigators/Designees must return/or destroy unused supplied agent when: 
•The agent is no longer required because the study is completed. 
•Agent is outdated. 
•The agent is damaged or unfit for use. 
General Guidelines 
•Regulations require that all agents received be returned to the supplier for 
accountability and disposition or destroyed on-site in accordance with local 
procedures for agent destruction. On-site agent destruction must be 
documented in the protocol specific accountability records.
•Return only unused vials/bottles. Do NOT return opened or partially used 
vials/bottles unless specifically requested otherwise in the protocol. 
•Return only supplied agents. Do NOT ship agents received from other sources 
to the supplier.

induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in various animal 
models, and the growth of multiple human tumor xenografts in mice.
13.2.9 Pharmacology
DRUG INTERACTIONS
In vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver microsomes   
is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. 
Therefore, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of pazopanib.
Agents that may Increase pazopanib Blood Concentrations
CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Co-administration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 
family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase pazopanib 
concentrations. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib. 
Administration of 1500 mg lapatinib a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP 
with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50 % to 60 % increase in mean pazopanib 
AUC(0-24) and C max compared to administration of [ADDRESS_1070646] be co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Dosage and 
Administration ).
Agents that may Decrease pazopanib Blood Concentrations 
CYP3A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib 
concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme 
induction potential is recommended.
Effects of Pazopanib on CYP Substrates
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 
1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was 
demonstrated in an in vitro human PXR assay. Clinical pharmacology studies, using pazopanib 
[ADDRESS_1070647] 
on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe 
substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in 
an increase of approximately 30 % in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe 
substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan 
concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe 
substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 
(CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26 % and 31 % in 
paclitaxel AUC and C max, respectively.
Effects of Pazopanib on Other Enzymes and Transporters 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070648] of concomitant use of Pazopanib and Simvastatin
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. 
Across monotherapy studies with pazopanib, ALT > 3x ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of 
patients who did not use statins, compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant 
use of simvastatin (p= 0.038). If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT 
elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib posology and discontinue simvastatin. Insufficient 
data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and 
pazopanib.
Effect of Food on Pazopanib
Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold 
increase in AUC and C max. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least [ADDRESS_1070649] also been conducted. Definitive studies 
were conducted with the monohydrochloride salt which is used in the clinic and with batches 
having a similar impurity profile. The toxicokinetic profile of pazopanib was evaluated in all 
definitive repeat dose studies, and comparison of systemic exposure to pazopanib achieved in 
key toxicology studies is presented in Table 4 in the investigator’s Brochure. Exposure margins 
are presented based upon comparison of the animal systemic exposure with that reported for 
cancer patients receiving an oral therapeutic dose of 800 mg/day pazopanib (AUC of 1037 
μg.h/mL and a C max of 58.1 μg/mL). 
The principal nonclinical toxicology findings associated with pazopanib treatment are believed 
to be directly associated with VEGFR-[ADDRESS_1070650] the responsive nature of these species to inhibition of VEGF receptors 
(Patyna et al. 905-16). These include effects on bone, bone marrow, incisor teeth, ovary, kidney, 
pancreas, nails, testes, adrenal, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], trachea, hematological tissues, salivary glands and 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_472556]/fetus. Some effects occurred at doses of 3 mg/kg/day. Other effects have 
been noted in liver, small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes (mice, rats, monkey). Toxicities 
observed in rodents in teeth, bone, pancreas, nails, bone marrow, kidney and liver were assessed 
clinically and/or via serum chemistries in the clinic, or in the case of other pre-clinical targets 
such as adrenal, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], trachea and spleen, were of minimal severity and unlikely to result in 
adverse clinical events.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 62 of 96
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Effects:
Cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during the use of pazopanib. In 
clinical trials with pazopanib, increase in serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were 
observed. In the majority of the cases, isolated increases in ALT and AST have been reported, 
without concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. The vast majority (92.5%) 
of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks. Grades are based on 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3 (NCI 
CTCAE). 
Monitor serum liver tests before initiation of treatment with pazopanib and at least once every [ADDRESS_1070651] 4 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated. Periodic monitoring 
should then continue after this time period. 
The following guidelines are provided for patients with baseline values of total bilirubin ≤1.[ADDRESS_1070652] and ALT ≤[ADDRESS_1070653].
•Patients with isolated ALT elevations between [ADDRESS_1070654] may be 
continued on pazopanib with weekly monitoring of liver function until ALT return to 
Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline.
•Patients with ALT of >[ADDRESS_1070655] pazopanib interrupted until they return 
to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline. If the potential benefit for reinitiating 
pazopanib treatment is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then 
reintroduce pazopanib at a reduced dose of 400 mg once daily and measure serum 
liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Following reintroduction of pazopanib, if ALT 
elevations >[ADDRESS_1070656] recur, then pazopanib should be permanently discontinued.
•If ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_1070657] occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >[ADDRESS_1070658] 
pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. Patients should be monitored until 
return to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline. Pazopanib is a UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, 
indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s 
syndrome. Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, known or 
suspected Gilbert’s syndrome, and elevation in ALT >[ADDRESS_1070659] been established for patients 
with preexisting hepatic impairment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension:
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypertension including hypertensive crisis have 
occurred. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating pazopanib. Patients should 
be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. 
Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg) occurs 
early in the course of treatment (39% of cases occurred by [CONTACT_2006] 9 and 88% of cases occurred in 
the first 18 weeks). In the case of persistent hypertension despi[INVESTIGATOR_6698]-hypertensive therapy, the 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 63 of 96
pazopanib dose may be reduced. Pazopanib should be discontinued if there is evidence of 
hypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_6698]-hypertensive therapy and 
pazopanib dose reduction (see specific guidelines for BP monitoring and management in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS])
[IP_ADDRESS] QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes:
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT prolongation or Torsade de Pointes have 
occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation, patients taking antiarrythmics or other medications that may potentially prolong 
QT interval, or those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using pazopanib, baseline 
and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (calcium, 
magnesium, potassium) within normal range is recommended. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Arterial Thrombotic Events: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, myocardial infarctions, angina, ischemic stroke and transient 
ischemic attack were observed. Fatal events have been observed. Pazopanib should be used with 
caution in patients who are at increased risk of thrombotic events or who have had a history of 
thrombotic events. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had an event within the 
previous 6 months. A treatment decision should be made based upon the assessment of 
individual patient’s benefit/risk.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhagic Events: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib hemorrhagic events have been reported. Fatal hemorrhagic 
events have occurred. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who had a history of 
hemoptysis, cerebral, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months. 
Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with significant risk of hemorrhage.
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforations and Fistula: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation or fistula have 
occurred. Fatal perforation events have occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in 
patients at risk for GI perforation or fistula.
[IP_ADDRESS] Wound Healing: 
No formal studies on the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted. Since 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors may impair wound healing, treatment 
with pazopanib should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to 
resume pazopanib after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Pazopanib should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothyroidism: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypothyroidism have occurred. Proactive 
monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria: 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, proteinuria has been reported. Baseline and periodic 
urinalyses during treatment are recommended and patients should be monitored for worsening of 
proteinuria. Pazopanib should be discontinued if the patient develops nephrotic syndrome.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 64 of 96
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy: 
Pre-clinical studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. If pazopanib is used during 
pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard to 
the fetus should be explained to the patient. Women of childbearing potential should be advised 
to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with pazopanib.
13.2.12 Interactions
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce Cytochrome P450 3A4 Enzymes
In vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver microsomes 
is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. 
Therefore, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of pazopanib.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concurrent administration of a single dose pazopanib eye 
drops with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, in healthy volunteers resulted 
in 220 % and 150 % increase in mean AUC(0-t) and C max values, respectively. Co-
administration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase 
pazopanib concentrations. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations 
of pazopanib. Administration of 1500 mg lapatinib a substrate and weak inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50 % 
to 60 % increase in mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and C max compared to 
administration of [ADDRESS_1070660] be 
coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2 CYP3A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma 
pazopanib concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no 
or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effects of Pazopanib on CYP Substrates
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 
1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was 
demonstrated in an in vitro human PXR assay. Clinical pharmacology studies, using pazopanib 
[ADDRESS_1070661] 
on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe 
substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in 
an increase of approximately 30 % in the mean AUC and C max of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe 
substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan 
concentrations in the urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe 
substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 65 of 96
(CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26 % and 31 % in 
paclitaxel AUC and C max, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effects of Pazopanib on Other Enzymes and Transporters
In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib is a potent inhibitor of UGT1A1 and OATP1B1 with 
IC50 of 1.2 and 0.79 μM respectively. Pazopanib may increase concentrations of drugs primarily 
eliminated through UGT1A1 and OATP1B1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect of concomitant use of Pazopanib and Simvastatin
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. 
Across monotherapy studies with pazopanib, ALT > 3x ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of 
patients who did not use statins, compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant 
use of simvastatin (p= 0.038). If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT 
elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib posology and discontinue simvastatin. Insufficient 
data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and 
pazopanib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect of Food on Pazopanib
Administration of pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold 
increase in AUC and C max. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least 1 hour before or 
2 hours after a meal.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Medication that raise gastric pH
Concomitant use of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the bioavailability of pazopanib by 
[CONTACT_3450] 40% (AUC and C max), and co-administration of pazopanib with medicines that 
increase gastric pH should be avoided.
13.2.13 Pregnancy and Lactation
[IP_ADDRESS] Fertility
Pazopanib may impair fertility in human males and females. In female reproductive toxicity 
studies in rats, reduced female fertility has been observed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of pazopanib in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Pazopanib should 
not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
pazopanib. If pazopanib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard to the fetus should be explained to the patient. Women 
of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception and avoid becoming 
pregnant while receiving treatment with pazopanib.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lactation
The safe use of pazopanib during lactation has not been established. It is not known whether 
pazopanib is excreted in human milk. Breast feeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with pazopanib.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/[ADDRESS_1070662] on such activities would not be anticipated 
from the pharmacology of pazopanib. The clinical status of the patient and the adverse event 
profile of pazopanib should be borne in mind when considering the patient’s ability to perform 
task that require judgment, motor and cognitive skills.
13.2.15Adverse Reactions
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were evaluated in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre study. Patients with locally advanced 
and/or metastatic RCC were randomized to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily (N=290) or 
placebo (N=145). The median duration of treatment was 7.4 months for the pazopanib arm and 
3.8 months for the placebo arm.
Adverse reactions are listed below by [CONTACT_778899].

[IP_ADDRESS] Overdosage
Pazopanib doses up to 2,[ADDRESS_1070664] been evaluated in clinical trials. Grade 3 fatigue (dose 
limiting toxicity) and Grade 3 hypertension were each observed in 1 of 3 patients dosed at 2,000 
mg and 1,000 mg daily, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptoms and Signs
There is currently limited experience with overdosage in pazopanib.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by [CONTACT_778900], where available. Haemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of pazopanib 
because pazopanib is not significantly renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins.

13.2.17Clinical Pharmacokinetic Properties
[IP_ADDRESS] Absorption
Pazopanib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak concentrations of 2.[ADDRESS_1070665] 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal.
Administration of a single pazopanib 400 mg crushed tablet increased AUC(0-72) by 46% and 
Cmax by [CONTACT_3450] 2 fold and decreased t max by [CONTACT_3450] 1.5 hours compared to 
administration of the whole tablet. These results indicate that the bioavailability and the rate of 
pazopanib oral absorption are increased after administration of the crushed tablet relative to 
administration of the whole tablet. Therefore, due to this potential for increased exposure, tablets 
should not be crushed .
[IP_ADDRESS] Distribution
Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99 % with no 
concentration dependence over the range of 10-100 μg/ml. In vitro studies suggest that 
pazopanib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP).
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism
Results from in vitro studies demonstrated that the metabolism of pazopanib is mediated 
primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 69 of 96
[IP_ADDRESS] Elimination
Pazopanib is eliminated slowly with mean half-life of 30.9 hours after administration of the 
recommended dose of 800 mg. Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination 
accounting for < 4 % of the administered dose.
13.2.18Special Populations
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Impairment
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis using 408 subjects with various cancers, creatinine 
clearance (30-150 ml/min) did not influence clearance of pazopanib. Renal impairment is not 
expected to influence pazopanib exposure, and dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with 
creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Impairment
The median steady-state pazopanib C max and AUC(0-24) in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (defined as either normal bilirubin and any degree of ALT elevations or as an 
elevation of bilirubin up to 1.[ADDRESS_1070666] regardless of the ALT value) after a once daily dose of 
800 mg/day (30.9 μg/ml, range 12.5-47.3 and 841.8 μg.hr/ml, range 600.4-1078) are similar to 
the median in patients with no hepatic impairment (49.4 μg/ml, range 17.1-85.7 and 888.2 
μg.hr/ml, range 345.5-1482).
The maximally tolerated pazopanib dose (MTD) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(defined as an elevation of bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_1070667] regardless of the ALT values) was 200 
mg once daily. The median steady-state values of C max (22.4 μg/ml, range 6.4-32.9) and AUC(0-
24) (350.0 μg.hr/ml, range 131.8-487.7) after administration of 200 mg pazopanib once daily in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment were approximately 45% and 39%, respectively, that 
of the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in subjects with 
normal hepatic function. There are insufficient data in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin >3x ULN regardless of any level of ALT); therefore, use of pazopanib is not 
recommended in these patients.
13.2.19 Administration
Pazopanib (GW786034) is an orally administered multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
currently under development by [CONTACT_107403] a variety of human cancers in 
adults. Currently, pazopanib is administered orally at 800 mg daily in Phase II and Phase III 
monotherapy studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Combination therapy
Doses ranged from 200 to 800 mg daily in a Phase I combination dose-ranging study 
(VEG10006) in which pazopanib was administered in combination with the [COMPANY_001] compound 
lapatinib (GW572016). Pazopanib 200 to 800 mg daily is being investigated in combination with 
multiple cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosing information from recent studies combining Pazopanib and oral 
topotecan
Recent investigations of the combination, relevant to this study found safe and effective dosing 
of pazopanib using a starting dose of 600 mg (3x200mg) Pazopanib per day taken orally without 
food at least one hour before or two hours after a meal. The dose of Pazopanib may be held up to 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 70 of 96
3 weeks and reduced to 400 mg or to 200 mg daily based on side effects. Patient may be 
maintained on the lower dose of pazopanib during protocol if deemed to be deriving benefit from 
the drug. Length of treatment will be until progression, up to one year.
13.2.20 Supplier: [COMPANY_001]
[IP_ADDRESS] Ordering Study Agent/s: 
Study Agent/s may be requested by [CONTACT_9525] (or their authorized designees) at 
each participating institution. All regulatory document requirements (including a Pharmacy 
Initiation Worksheet), as described in the BTTC Operations Manual, must be current and up to 
date in the BTTC Coordinating Center. The participating institution must have received an 
Activation memo from the BTTC Coordinating Center prior to requesting study agents.  A study 
drug order form will be provided to the sites by [CONTACT_778901].
Signed and Dated Drug requests should be emailed to:
Uintavision
Attn: Michelle Dubois
Email: [EMAIL_7059]
When a number of investigators are participating on a clinical study at the same institution, one 
investigator should be considered or designated the Principal or lead investigator under whom all 
investigational agents for that protocol should be ordered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Agent Storage and Accountability
The investigator is responsible for the proper and secure physical storage and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_778862]. Specifically, the investigator must:  
•Maintain a careful record of the receipt, use and final disposition of all 
investigational agents received, using the NCI Agent Accountability Record 
Form (DARF), http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html.  
•Store the agent in a secure location, accessible to only authorized personnel, 
preferably in the pharmacy.
• Maintain appropriate storage of the investigational agent to ensure the 
stability and integrity of the agent.
• Return or destroy any unused investigational agents at the completion of the 
study or upon notification that an agent is being withdrawn.
The intent of the agent accountability procedures described in this section is to assist the 
investigator in making certain that agents received from BTTC are used only for patients entered 
onto an approved protocol. The record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_778863]. Investigators are responsible for the use of investigational agents shipped in their 
name. Even if a pharmacist or chemotherapy nurse has the actual task of handling these agents 
upon receipt, the investigator is the responsible individual and has agreed to accept this 
responsibility by [CONTACT_366946] 1572,

13.2.21BTTC Procedures for Agent Accountability and Storage 
•Each investigational agent should be stored separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent 
is used for more than one protocol, there should be separate physical storage 
for each protocol. Remember that agents are provided and accounted for on a 
protocol-by-protocol basis.
•Each agent should be accounted for separately by [CONTACT_990]. If an agent is used 
for more than one protocol, there should be a separate Drug Accountability 
Record Form (DARF) for each protocol, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html. There should be a separate DARF for 
each agent in a multi-agent protocol.
•Separate accountability forms should be maintained for each different strength 
or dosage form of a particular agent (e.g., an agent with a 1-mg vial and a 5-
mg vial would require a different DARF for the 1-mg vial than for the 5-mg 
vial).
• The DARF has been designed for use at each location where agents are 
stored, e.g., main pharmacy, satellite pharmacy, physician's office, or other 
dispensing areas.
•The DARF is also designed to accommodate both dispensing records and 
other agent transaction documentation (e.g., receipt of agent, returns, broken 
vials, etc.). A copy of the DARF may be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/index.html.
•Unauthorized inter-institutional transfer of BTTC investigational agents from 
one participating institution to another is not permitted.  For some protocols 
the lead institution may enter into contractual agreements to forward agents to 
participating institutions (see BTTC Operations Manual).
•BTTC Supplied agents must not be repackaged and forwarded to patients on a 
routine basis. Refer to the BTTC Operations Manual for BTTC polices on 
forwarding BTTC supplied agents under certain limited circumstances.
Verification of Compliance
Investigators are reminded that compliance with procedures to ensure proper agent usage will be 
reviewed during site visits conducted under the monitoring program. Specifically, site visitors 
will check that the agent accountability system is being maintained, and will spot-check the 
agent accountability records by [CONTACT_264361]' medical records to verify that 
the agents were administered to a patient entered in the recorded protocol.
13.2.22 Returning or Destroying unused or defective Agent
Investigators/Designees should make every effort to minimize the amount of agent ordered and 
returned or destroyed unused, (e.g. limit inventories to an 8 week supply or less). 
Investigators/Designees must return/or destroy unused supplied agent when: 
•The agent is no longer required because the study is completed. 
•Agent is outdated.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Pazopanib Topotecan
Version Date:  07/17/2025 Page 72 of 96
•The agent is damaged or unfit for use. 
General Guidelines 
•Regulations require that all agents received be returned to the supplier for 
accountability and disposition or destroyed on-site in accordance with local 
procedures for agent destruction. On-site agent destruction must be 
documented in the protocol specific accountability records.
•Return only unused vials/bottles. Do NOT return opened or partially used 
vials/bottles unless specifically requested otherwise in the protocol. 
•Return only supplied agents. Do NOT ship agents received from other sources 
to the supplier.
Procedure  
Unused or defective drug will be destroyed. [COMPANY_001] should be notified of this action.
13.2.23 Handling of Study medication: Pharmacists should use appropriate precautions in 
handling and disposal of hazardous agents. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 
15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F)

15.3 TUMOR TISSUE H ANDLING INSTRUCTIONS AND TISSUE COLLECTION SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_778867]: Tissue evaluation is highly recommended for this study. The 
evaluation will consist of confirmation that the histologic features meet WHO criteria for 
GBM or GS. All blocks for review will be sent directly to [CONTACT_295544].
Rationale
The purpose of analyzing the tissue samples is to confirm the diagnosis of GBM 
Specimen Collection: Tissue specimens should be taken from pre-study diagnostic open biopsy 
or surgical resection.       
To be eligible for this study, the patient must have a GBM, or GS, WHO grade IV.  Features of a 
high-grade astrocytic neoplasm with tumor necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation must be 
present.
The following materials will be required for tissue evaluation:
Representative tissue blocks or [ADDRESS_1070669] be 
present on the H&E slide. Blocks obtained via the C[LOCATION_003] methodology are not adequate for 
tissue analysis. Do not send blocks with tissue obtained by [CONTACT_115564]. 
An accompanying H&E is encouraged for rapid diagnosis but not required. If an H&E is 
included, [CONTACT_295544] will use this for the review. If not included, [CONTACT_295544] will cut a section 
from the paraffin block, stain this with H&E, and use that slide for the review.
A Pathology Report documenting that the submitted material contains tumor; the report must 
include the protocol number, patient case number, and the patient’s initials. The patient’s name 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or other identifying information should be removed from the report. The surgical pathology 
numbers and information must NOT be removed from the report.
A Tissue Collection Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_254316] (below) listing pathology materials being submitted for 
Tissue Evaluation completed by [CONTACT_778904]. These forms must include the protocol number, patient case number, and the 
patient’s initials.
Tissue evaluation is highly recommended for every case. Send pathology material by [CONTACT_778905]:

15.7 THE NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION (NYHA)  FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION 
The [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of 
classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how 
much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regards to normal 
breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and or angina pain:
Functional Capacity Objective Assessment
Class I.  Patients with cardiac disease but without 
resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain.No objective evidence 
of cardiovascular 
disease
Class II. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight 
limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at 
rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain.Objective evidence of 
minimal 
cardiovascular disease
Class III. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain.Objective evidence of 
moderately severe 
cardiovascular disease
Class IV. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal 
syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any physical 
activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular 
disease

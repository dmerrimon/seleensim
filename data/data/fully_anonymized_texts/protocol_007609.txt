2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Overview of Neuroendocrine Tumors
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by 
[CONTACT_707487].  Well-differentiated NETs can be broadly 
classified as either carcinoid or pancreatic NET. 
The treatment of advanced NET has undergone a rapid evolution in recent years.  In addition to 
controlling symptoms related to hormone hypersecretion, somatostatin analogs have also been 
shown to control tumor growth.  In the PROMID trial, patients with advanced small bowel 
carcinoid tumors receiving octreotide had a longer median time to tumor progression compared 
with those receiving placebo (14.3 vs. 6 months).(Rinke, Muller et al. 2009)  Further support for 
the antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogs in patients NET was demonstrated in the 
CLARINET trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluating the antiproliferative 
effects of lanreotide in patients with advanced well- or moderately-differentiated, non-
functioning gastroenteropancreatic NETs, including both gastrointestinal NET and pancreatic 
NET.  Patients receiving lanreotide had improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to 
those receiving placebo (median not reached vs. median of 18 months).(Caplin, Pavel et al. 
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
[ZIP_CODE]) 
Agents targeting the VEGF- and mTOR-pathway signaling pathways are also active in the 
treatment of NET.  In advanced pancreatic NET, independent randomized, placebo-controlled 
studies of everolimus and sunitinib demonstrated clear improvements in progression-free 
survival (PFS), leading to the approval of both agents for this indication.(Raymond, Dahan et al. 
2011, Yao, Shah et al. 2011)  In advanced carcinoid tumors, however, there remains no approved 
drug for tumor control, and the development of effective systemic therapy for this patient 
population represents a clear and unmet medical need.
VEGF Inhibition in Carcinoid Tumors
Several studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibition is a 
promising approach in treating patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.   A key role for 
angiogenesis and VEGF pathway signaling in NET has been suggested by [CONTACT_707488].  Additionally, pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that NET 
have increased expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and other growth factor 
receptors including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) α and β, stem-cell factor 
receptor (c-kit).(Fjallskog, Lejonklou et al. 2003, Hansel, Rahman et al. 2003, Fjallskog, 
Hessman et al. 2007, Bowen, Silva et al. 2009, Silva, Bowen et al. 2011)
The VEGF pathway inhibitors bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib have been 
evaluated in advanced carcinoid tumors in the phase II setting.(Hobday, Rubin et al. 2007, 
Kulke, Lenz et al. 2008, Yao, Phan et al. 2008, Phan, Yao et al. 2010) These drugs have shown 
low radiographic response rates, but a relatively high rate of disease stabilization and 
encouraging median progression-free survival durations (8-14 months). 
We have evaluated the prognostic significance of expression of VEGF pathway components, 
including VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, and VEFGR-2, in NET (Fig 1) and found that expression of 
VEGFR-2 appears to be an adverse prognostic factor associated with shorter overall survival 
(Fig 2).

2.2 IND Agent
Ramucirumab has been previously evaluated as monotherapy in separate clinical studies, and a 
recommended schedule and dose range for monotherapy has been determined. Detailed 
information about the characteristics of ramucirumab is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB).  The following sections provide a summary of the information most relevant to this phase II 
study.
2.2.1Ramucirumab
Mechanism of action:
Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B [LY3009806]) is a human receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody 
that specifically binds VEGF Receptor 2. The binding of ramucirumab to VEGF Receptor 2 
prevents its interaction with activating ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D).  As a result, 
ramucirumab inhibits ligand-stimulated activation of VEGF Receptor 2and its downstream 
intracellular signaling components, including Erk1/Erk2, neutralizing ligand induced 
proliferation and migration of human endothelial cells.
Pharmacokinetics:
Trough concentrations (or minimum concentrations [Cmin]) were collected in two Phase 3 
studies (REGARD and RAINBOW) in patients with gastric cancer. Following the recommended 
clinical dose regimen, 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, observed Cmin values were similar between
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, [ADDRESS_961320] and RAINBOW, as noted in the table below (Investigator’s Brochure, Table 6.1). The 
geometric mean observed trough values were approximately 50 ug/mL and approximately 60 to 
70 ug/mL before the fourth and seventh doses, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic data were from pooled from 8 studies including 497 patients with various 
malignancies for a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis. In these studies, ramucirumab 
was administered as a 1-hour I.V. infusion, at either 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks on a 14- or 28-
day cycle, or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks on a 21-day cycle. The geometric mean (percentage 
coefficient of variation [CV%]) of PopPK model-derived estimates of ramucirumab clearance 
(CL), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) and terminal half-life (t1/2) were 0.0140 L/h 
(29.8%), 5.5 L (14.4%), and 15 days (24.1%), respectively. These parameter estimates were 
consistent with those observed with other human monoclonal IgG1 (Keizer et al. 2010) 
antibodies. Results from the PopPK analyses indicate that the PK of ramucirumab following 8- 
and 10-mg/kg dose administrations were dose linear (absolute dose range: 169 to 1234 mg) and 
time independent.
Weekly doses of ramucirumab ranging from 2 to 16 mg/kg were evaluated in a Phase 1 study: 
I4TIE- JVBM [IMCL CP12-0401]. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for weekly dosing was 
identified as 13 mg/kg (2 dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] were observed in patients receiving the
16-mg/kg weekly dose: Grade 3 deep vein thrombosis and Grade 3 hypertension). Preliminary 
activity was observed across a range of doses, including the 2-mg/kg dose. Pharmacokinetic 
results from this study suggested that, as with other recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal 
antibodies targeting cell membrane-expressed antigens, ramucirumab exhibited nonlinear PK 
characteristics. 
Apparent nonlinear PK profiles were observed between 2 and 8 mg/kg; PK profiles appeared to 
be linear at and above 8 mg/kg, suggesting saturation of the target mediated (VEGF Receptor 2) 
clearance pathway. Every-2-week (6 to 10 mg/kg) and every-3- week (15 to 20 mg/kg) dose 
regimens were evaluated in an additional dose-ranging study (Study I4T-IE-JVBN [IMCL CP12-
0402]). No MTD was identified for every-2-week or every-3-week dosing; all dose regimens 
were well tolerated, and preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy was observed across a range of 
dose/schedule cohorts.

9Clinical Experience and Activity:
Ramucirumab has been studied and/or continues to be investigated in ongoing clinical studies for 
the indications as indicated in the Investigator’s Brochure.  As of 31 December 2013, 
ramucirumab or ramucirumab/placebo has been administered either as a single agent or in 
combination with various antineoplastic agents to approximately7000 patients with different 
oncologic conditions in Phase 1/1b, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Ramucirumab demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefit in overall survival (OS) 
as a single agent at a dose of 8 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_961321] 
supportive care [BSC] versus placebo with best supportive care.(Fuchs, Tomasek et al. 2014)  
Ramucirumab also has shown clinical efficacy in patients with gastric cancer in combination 
with paclitaxel in a phase III study of paclitaxel with ramucirumab compared with paclitaxel 
with placebo (RAINBOW).(Wilke, Muro et al. 2014)  A Phase 3 trial (ROSE) examining the 
combination of ramucirumab with docetaxel in previously untreated metastatic breast cancer 
failed to meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). In 
ROSE, while investigator-assessed PFS numerically favored ramucirumab, this difference was 
not statistically significant.(Mackey, Ramos-Vazquez et al. 2015)
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for updated information 
regarding the clinical experience and activity of ramucirumab.
Adverse Events:  
As of [ADDRESS_961322] (DP) on 7 Phase 1/1b studies, 18 open-label or unblinded Phase 2 
studies, and 3 completed Phase 3 studies, including monotherapy and combination therapy with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. Placebo-controlled blinded clinical trials are ongoing (1 Phase 2 
study, 3 Phase 3 studies); unblinded safety data for these studies are not available. Detailed AE 
information based on a review of Phase 1/1b, Phase 2, and completed Phase 3 clinical studies of 
ramucirumab DP (N=2485) are available in the Investigator Brochure.
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs; AEs for which a causal relationship to the investigational drug 
was considered at least possible) of special interest include AEs which have been associated with
antiangiogenic agents and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and include the following 
categories: infusion-related reaction (IRR), hypertension, proteinuria, arterial thromboembolic 
events (ATEs), venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), bleeding/hemorrhagic events, 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, and congestive heart failure (CHF) when used in combination 
with mitoxantrone or following prior anthracycline therapy.
Infusion-related reaction is considered an adverse event of special interest (AESI), as it has been 
observed in association with other approved and investigational therapeutic monoclonal 
antibodies. With the exception of liver injury/liver failure, the AESIs discussed are potentially 
associated with other agents that inhibit VEGF- or VEGF Receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis.
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, [ADDRESS_961323] been reported in clinical trials of ramucirumab DP, although in some 
instances a causal association with ramucirumab DP could not be clearly established. Liver 
failure and/or other significant liver injury events were included as an AESI in August 2012, 
following the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) recommendations in an ongoing
Phase 3 study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Study I4T-IE-JVBF
[IMCL CP12-0919; REACH]). 
Animal studies have not been specifically conducted to evaluate the effect of ramucirumab on 
female reproduction and fetal development, and there are no studies in pregnant women.
Please refer to Section 7 or the protocol and the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for 
updated information regarding the adverse events associated with ramucirumab.

8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
308.1 Ramucirumab
Ramucirumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G 
subclass 1 (IgG1) subclass. It is composed of 4 polypeptide chains, 2 identical heavy (γ) 
chains consisting of 446 amino acids each, and 2 identical light (κ) chains consisting of 
214 amino acids each. The antibody contains 1 conserved N-linked glycosylation site at 
each heavy chain, in the Fc region.
Molecular weight: The ramucirumab molecular masses, determined by [CONTACT_163893], of the light chain and the heavy chain are 23.2 kDa and 50.1 kDa, 
respectively, resulting in a relative molecular mass for the ramucirumab monoclonal 
antibody of 146.8 kDa. The theoretical molecular weights predicted by [CONTACT_707493] (cDNA) of the light chain and the heavy chain are 23.2 kDa and 
48.7 kDa, respectively, resulting in a theoretical relative molecular mass for the 
ramucirumab monoclonal antibody of 143.8 kDa. The difference between the observed 
and theoretical molecular weights, approximately 3 kDa, is attributed to posttranslational 
glycosylation.
Pharmacokinetic data from the 8 studies involving 497 patients were pooled together for 
a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis. In these studies, ramucirumab was 
administered as a 1-hour I.V. infusion, at either 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks on a 14- or 
28-day cycle, or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks on a 21-day cycle. The studies included patients 
with varying cancer indications: gastric cancer (80.5% of patients), non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC; 8.2%), breast cancer (2.2%), colorectal cancer (CRC; 1.6%), and other 
tumor types (7.4%). The geometric mean (percentage coefficient of variation [CV%]) of 
PopPK model-derived estimates of ramucirumab clearance (CL), volume of distribution 
at steady state (Vss) and terminal half-life (t1/2) were 0.0140 L/h (29.8%), 5.5 L (14.4%), 
and 15 days (24.1%), respectively. 
8.1.1 Form
Ramucirumab DP is a sterile, preservative-free solution for infusion of ramucirumab 
formulated in an aqueous solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL (500 mg/50-mL vial or 
100mg/10mL vial). The buffer contains 10mM histidine, 75mM sodium chloride, 
133mM glycine, and 0.01% polysorbate 80.  Ramucirumab DP is a clear to slightly 
opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow liquid without visible particles. The pH is 6.0. 
The osmolality is 285 mmol/kg. All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_707486].  No animal-derived components are used in the 
manufacture of ramucirumab DP excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
8.1.2 Storage and Stability
PREPARED RAMUCIRUMAB DOSING SOLUTION FOR INFUSION: Chemical and 
physical in-use stability for the prepared ramucirumab dosing solution has been 
demonstrated for up to 24 hours below 25°C (77°F). However, it is recommended that the 
prepared dosing solution be used immediately in order to minimize the risk of microbial

Only use sterile sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection as a diluent. DF/HCC sites 
will use their own practices with regards to calculating doses based on body weight (kg).
In case of prefilled I.V. infusion container usage:
Based on the calculated volume of ramucirumab, remove the corresponding volume of 
sterile sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection from the prefilled 250 mL I.V. 
container. Aseptically transfer the calculated volume of ramucirumab to the I.V. 
container. The final total volume in the container should be 250 mL. The container 
should be gently inverted to ensure adequate mixing. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the 
infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other solutions or co-infuse with other electrolytes 
or medications.

as serious, they must be reported as SAEs.
10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT
10.[ADDRESS_961365] – Solid Tumors
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks.
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.
10.1.1Definitions
Evaluable for Target Disease Response.  Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their 
disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Participants who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non-target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
10.1.2Disease Parameters
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_961366] x-ray or ≥[ADDRESS_961367] scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461].  All tumor 
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, [ADDRESS_961368] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable. 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_961369] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered 
non-measurable.
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease. 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.

DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
3710.1.3Methods for Evaluation of Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
FDG-PET. While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
(a) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.
(b)  No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
38progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.
(c)  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later data and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure 
from CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy. The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor markers. Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been 
published [JNCI 96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-[ADDRESS_961370]-line trials in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

39Cytology, Histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease
10.1.4Response Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
40Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of New Lesions
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, 
progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

10.1.5Duration of Response
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation).
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
10.1.6Progression-Free Survival
Overall Survival: Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death 
due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.
Progression-Free Survival: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
registration to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive 
without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints
The primary objective of this study is to assess the progression-free survival duration of patients 
with advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors treated with ramucirumab in combination with 
somatostatin analog therapy.  Patients will be accrued in one stage.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the earlier of 
progression as defined by [CONTACT_707494]. Patients will be censored in 
the analysis of PFS at the time they begin a new anti-cancer therapy if disease has not met the 
criteria for progression at the time the new treatment is started.  Participants alive without disease 
progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  
We will use the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the distribution of progression-free survival.   
12.[ADDRESS_961373]-defined response rates, they may be associated with 
significant improvements in progression-free survival. In the registration studies of sunitinib and 
everolimus in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, for example, PFS durations more than doubled 
while overall response rates were only 9% and 4%, respectively.(Raymond, Dahan et al. 2011, 
Yao, Shah et al. 2011)
NCI Protocol #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-072
Protocol Version Date: February 1, 2021
43In this study, we propose using PFS as the primary outcome measure. We note that all patients in 
our study will receive a somatostatin analog. The RADIANT 2 study provides a reasonable 
estimate of PFS duration in a large cohort of carcinoid tumor patients treated with either a 
somatostatin analog or somatostatin analog and an investigational agent.(Pavel, Hainsworth et al. 
2011) RADIANT 2 randomized 429 patients with a history of symptoms attributed to carcinoid 
syndrome and evidence for radiographic progression within 12 months of enrollment to receive 
everolimus plus octreotide LAR, or placebo plus octreotide LAR. A significant PFS benefit in 
favor of everolimus was demonstrated based on investigator radiology review (12 vs. 8.6 
months, p<0.01). However, the primary endpoint of the study was based on adjudicated central 
review, and while this analysis also favored the everolimus arm over placebo, the predefined 
threshold for statistical significance was not met. 
Investigator radiology review will be used to determine the primary endpoint in our study. We 
assume that an inactive agent will be associated with a PFS of 8 months, and that an agent 
worthy of further investigation will be associated with a PFS of 12 months or greater. A sample 
size of 43 achieves 80% power to detect the difference between the null hypothesis median PFS 
of 8 months and the alternative hypothesis median PFS of 12 months at a 0.05 significance level 
(alpha) using a one-sided test. The length of follow up is [ADDRESS_961374] 
passed and/or follow-up data are sufficiently mature for analysis. 
12.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
Analysis of endpoints of this study is described in Section 12.1.
12.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Secondary objectives of this study are to:
To determine the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab in combination with 
somatostatin analog therapy in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.  We will assess 
the rate of adverse events (as defined by [CONTACT_234794] (CTCAE), version 4.0), associated with treatment.
Because adverse events associated with the combination of ramucirumab and a somatostatin 
analog have not examined previously, toxicity and adverse events will be examined in the 
first 10 patients who complete one cycle of therapy before expanding enrollment.
To assess the overall radiographic and biochemical response rate associated with 
ramucirumab in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.  We will estimate the response 
rate and provide the associated 95% confidence interval.

if there are major protocol therapy deviations.  
Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of participants, excluding 
those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to 
other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  
However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions 
concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding participants from the 
analysis should be clearly reported.  If applicable to the endpoint, the 95% confidence 
intervals should also be provided.

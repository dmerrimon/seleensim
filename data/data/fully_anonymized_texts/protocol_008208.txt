  This study is a 4 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, ascending dose, 4-period crossover study 
designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK 
of JZP -110 (75, 150, and 300 mg) in the treatment of excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156112]. Depending on study center  capabilities, subjects  will ha ve the option of 
enrolling into 1 of 2 group s: Group 1 and Group 2. Subjects 
enrolled in Group 1 will undergo both objective ( Maintenance 
of Wakefulness Test [MWT ]) and subjective (Epworth 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] [ESS]) assessments of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Subjects 
enrolled in Group 2 will undergo only the subjective (ESS) assessment of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Following completion of the 
Screening and Baseline visits, approximately 49 eligible 
subjects will be randomly assigned (3:3:1) to [ADDRESS_180816] approximately 34 subjects complete 
Treatment Sequences  A and B, and 6 subjects complete 
Treatment Sequence C . There will be no stratification based on

During the first 6 days of each treatment period, subjects will 
take once -daily, oral doses of study drug (placebo, 75, 150, or 
300 mg JZP -110) with water at home, without regard to food, 
and within 1  hour of awakening in the morning (at 
approximately the same time each day) . If a subject fails to 
take the study drug within an hour of awakening, the subject should be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day. Subjects should take their PD medications and sleep medications allowed by [CONTACT_156213] l schedule each day.   
On the last day of each treatment period (i.e., Days 7, 14, 21, 
and 28) , subjects will take their usual PD medications and 
sleep medications  allowed by [CONTACT_156214], and return to the study center where the y will take

for efficacy, safety, and tolerability (Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6).  
Subjects will take their study drug with water in the morning at 
the study clinic after predose  assessments are completed. 
Subjects may be served a light meal at 15 minutes after dosing. 
Pending the investigator’s assessment of safety and tolerability, subjects will proceed to the next treatment period . 
Subjects who do not tolerate the study drug will be considered for early termination (at the discretion of the investigator). Subjects will receive their last  dose of study drug at Visit 6 
(Day 28) prior to the Week 4 visit assessments. Subjects will 
return for a  Safety Follow -up visit (Visit 7)  appro ximately 
[ADDRESS_180817] dose of study drug for follow- up safety 
assessments. Unless there are outstanding safety issues that require additional follow-up, subjects will be discharged from the study at the Safety Follow -up Visit (Visit 7).  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study and will include the following: monitoring of adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, changes in physical examination findings, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements (including measuring seated and standing blood pressure), and change in response to the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) at each 
visit.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_156215] , and  for su bjects who enroll in Group 1 and subjects 
who enrolled prior to Amendment 2, by [CONTACT_156216] 3 or 4 trials of the MWT.  
Exploratory efficacy assessments will include changes in scores  from baseline and/or the percentages of subjects 
improved, as applicable, on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Apathy Scale, and Scales for 
Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-cognition (SCOPA- cog). 
Parkinson’s disease clinical status (i.e., motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and motor function) will be assessed using the Movemen t Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale ( MDS -UPDRS) Parts III and IV.

EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  The following key efficacy endpoint is defined  in terms of 
change from study baseline (prior to first dose in Period 1) to 
the end of each Treatment Period (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28):  
• Change from Baseline in ESS score   
EXPLORATORY 
ENDPOINTS  Exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
• Change from Baseline  in the mean sleep latency time (in 
minutes), as determined from the 40- minute MWT  
• Change from Baseline in MDS -UPDRS Parts III  and IV 
scores 
• CGIc score and percentage of subjects reported as 
improved (minimally, much, or very much) 
• PGIc  score and percentage of subjects reported as 
improved (minimally, much, or very much)  
• Change from Baseline in FSS score  
• Change from Baseline in Apathy Scale score  
• Change from Baseline in SCOPA -cog score  
PHARMACOKINETIC 
ASSESSMENTS For subjects who enroll in the study prior to Amendment 2 
implementation, the PK profile of JZP-110 will be evaluated 
over an 8-hour period based on blood samples (4 mL) collected at predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dos ing at  
Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6. A sample was  also collected  7 to 8 hours 
after dosing, if feasible , at each visit . The PK parameters to be 
calculated for plasma JZP -110 concentrations will include the 
maximum concentration (C
max), time to C max (Tmax), terminal 
half-life (t 1/2), and area under the  curve (AUC), as appropriate.  
SAFETY  
ASSESSMENTS Safety and tolerability evaluations will consist of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuations 
due to AEs, and changes in clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs (including measurement of seated and standing blood pressure), 12- lead 
ECGs, physical exams, and C-SSRS assessments.   
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  Sample Size  
Approximately 49 subj ects will be randomized (3:3:1) to  the 
3 sequence groups (A, B, and C) with the goal of 40 subjects 
completing the study : 34 subjects each in Sequences A and B, 
and up to 6 subjects in sequence C. Although the primary 
objective of this study is to a ssess safety, efficacy

Page 11 of 115 endpoint -based power calculations were performed for 
reference. A sample size of 34 subjects (assuming 
17 completing in each of the S equences  A and B) will provide 
80% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_180829] deviation (SD) of 6 points for the change from baseline in ESS score and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) -based t -test for difference of means in a crossover 
design.  
The rationale for including S equence C in the study is to 
preserve study blinding. 
Statistical Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of JZP -110 is the primary objective of 
this study and descriptive statistics of all safety endpoints will 
be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. No inferential statistics will be provided for safety endpoints.  
For the analysis of the key efficacy endpoint of change from 
baseline in ESS , a mixed -effects model will be used as the 
primary method of analysis. This model will include fixed  
effects for treatment (dose), sequence, treatment -by-sequence 
interaction, and baseline value of the efficacy endpoint. The model will also include a random effect for subject within sequence. Model- adjusted differences between each active 
treatment dose (75, 150, and 300 mg ) and placebo, along with 
95% confidence interval s, will be presented.  
For the analysis of the MWT exploratory endpoint, a similar 
mixed -effect s model as for ESS will be used. However, 
because the MWT will be optional and consequently result in a reduced sample size, there may be convergence issues associated with the mixed -effects model. In th e event such 
issues do arise, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model without accounting for treatment sequence may be used at each visit.  
For the analysis of the efficacy endpoints of improvement in PGIc and CGIc scores, chi- square tests  will be used to test 
hypotheses of differences between placebo and each active dose. A mixed -effects model similar to the model described 
above will be used for the analysis of MDS- UPDRS, FSS, 
Apathy Scale, and SCOPA -cog endpoints. No adjustment for 
multiple testing will be performed.  
Summary statistics for all efficacy assessments will be

Page 22 of 115 1 INTRODUCTION 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] is a phenylalanine derivative 
(previously known as ADX-N05, R228060, and YKP10A) that is currently being 
investigated as a potential treatment for excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156120] (OSA). Nonclinical data indicate that JZP -110 is a wake-promoting agent that 
lacks the noradrenergic releasing effects of amphetamines (EDMS  PSDB -4956838, 
EDMS -PSDB -2735318, EDMS -PSDB -5305783) and does not produce rebound hypersomnia 
in rodent models ( Hasan et al. 2009). Pharmacologically, JZP-110 appears to be a 
low-potency reuptake inhibitor at dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_156121]. 
JZP-110 was originally synthesized by [CONTACT_156221] (South Korea). The molecule has 
been under development for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156122]. Jazz Pharmaceuticals intends to complete 
development of JZP-[ADDRESS_180841] (MWT) and 
decreased subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156123] (ESS).  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative brain disorder for which no cure has been identified. According to Decision Resources 2015, there were 926,000 patients with PD in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in 2014 (or 4.7 cases per 1000) ( Christmann et al. 2015). Due, in 
part, to the aging of the population, the prevalence of PD is estimated to increase approximately 2.7% per year through 2029, yielding 1.37 million in 2029. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by [CONTACT_156222], rigidity, resting tremor, and 
postural instability ( Halliday  & McCann, 2010). Postmortem studies suggest that 30% to 
50% of dopaminergic cell bodies are lost in the substantia nigra at the time motor symptoms appear ( Cheng  et al. 2010; Ishibashi et al. 2014 ) and imaging studies of patients with PD 
have shown decreased dopamine transporter levels beginning in the posterior putamen (Ishibashi et al. 2014). Although the etiology of PD is unclear, it is thought to involve both genetic and environmental factors.  
In addition to motor symptoms, most patients with PD experience clinically significant nonmotor symptoms such as changes in mood, memory, blood pressure, bowel and bladder function, sleep, fatigue, weight, and sensation. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep disturbances are common and can adversely affect quality of life of patients as well as their caregivers; however, sleep disturbances are often not diagnosed and consequently are often untreated ( Shulman et al. 2002 ; Karlsen et al.  1999; Weerkamp et al. 2013). Sleep 
disturbances in PD include the following: insomnia, rapid eye movement behavioral disorder (RBD), sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder, and excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (for review see Videnovic and Golombek 2013). In a large multicenter s urvey of 
nonmotor symptoms of 1072 PD patients, 21.2% of patients complained of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 36.9% referred insomnia, 29.6% suffered from behavioral sleep disturbances, and 15.2% from restless legs syndrome ( Barone et al. 2009). Further, in a Food and Drug

Page 23 of 115 Administration ( FDA ) patient-f ocused report that gathered perspectives from PD patients, 
caretakers and other patient representatives, over one-third of participants iden tified sleep 
disturbances as [ADDRESS_180842] significant symptoms that impacts daily life 
(FDA  Parkinson’s Dise ase Public Meeting 2015 ). 
In particular, excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156124] 20% to 50% of patients with PD ( Knie 2011; 
Arnulf 2005) and is more frequent in these patients than in age- matched healthy subjects 
(Tandberg et al. 1999; Brodsky et al. 2003) . Although excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156125], studies have shown that disease pathology is an important contributor 
of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Knie 2011). For instance, in a population-based prevalence study, 
the frequency rate of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156126] 6% at baseline to 41% after 8 years (Gjerstad et al. 2006). In addition, the pathophysiology of excessive sleepi [INVESTIGATOR_156127]- wake regulation as well as secondary 
mechanisms such as other disorde rs (e.g. OSA , depression) and use of anti-parkinsonian 
medication ( Videnovic and Golombek 2013). For instance, commonly prescribed dopamine 
agonists may contribute to excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Paus et al. 2003). However, [ADDRESS_180843] treatment (Gjerstad et al. 2006). Other studies suggest that excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156128] (Gao et al. 2011;  Abbott et al. 2005). For 
example, in a large epi[INVESTIGATOR_156129], there  was more than a 3 -fold increase in the 
risk o f developi[INVESTIGATOR_156130] (Abbott et  al. 2005). Taken together, these data indicate that 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156131], albeit to a less er degree, before the onset of Parkinsonism and before 
the use of dopamine agents, suggesting that other, disease-dependent factors contribute to the sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Arnulf & Leu-Semenescu  2009; Knie 2011;  Gjerstad 2002;  Gjerstad et al. 2006). 
Evidence- based g uidelines by [CONTACT_156223], including excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], in PD in controlled clinical trials (Zesiewicz et al. 2010).  Although there are no currently approved medications to improve 
wakefulness and to treat excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156132], there are a few specific guidelines for the pharmacotherapy of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156133] ( Rye 2006;  Zesiewicz et al.  
2010; Seppi [CONTACT_2297]. 2011; Ferreira et al. 2013). For instance, the guidelines specifically mention that modafinil should be considered for patients to improve their subjective perception of excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. However, modafinil does not appear to adeq uately promote wakefulness throughout the day with once daily dosing in patients with 
PD (Högl et al. 2002; Adler et al. 2003, Ondo et al. 2005; Lou et  al. 2009 ). 
As a result of the findings of significant decreases in excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (lower ESS scores) and significant increases in the ability to stay awake throughout the day (higher MWT sleep latencies) when adult patients with narcolepsy were treated with JZP -110, as well as the 
urgent clinical need reported by [CONTACT_156224][INVESTIGATOR_156134] t better treat their 
symptoms that significantly impacts their daily lives (FDA Parkinson’s Dise ase Public

during in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment (International Classification of Slee p Disorders, Third Edition, American Academy  
of Sleep Medicine [AASM 2014] ). For example, results from a previous Phase 2a, 4- week, 
crossover study of 300 mg JZP-110 (150 mg for 1 week followed by 300 mg for 1 week) compared with placebo in patients with narcolepsy dem onstrated a maximal difference in the 
means between drug and placebo of 11.8 minutes on a 40- minute MWT ( Bogan et al. 2015). 
Similarly, data from a  Phase 2b , 12-week, parallel -group study of JZP -110 (150 mg for 
4 weeks followed by 300 mg for 8 weeks) compa red with placebo  resulted in maximal 
differences in the means of 8.1 and 10.7 minutes between 150 or 300 mg JZP-110 and placebo, respectively, on a 40- minute MWT ( Ruoff et  al. 2016). Moreover, data from the 
Phase 2b study of JZP-[ADDRESS_180845] throughout the day. For instance, the mean change from baseline in sleep latency on the fifth trial of a  5-trial, 40 -minute MWT was 8.2 minu tes for the 300-mg dose of 
JZP-110 (signif icantly greater than placebo, p=0.0007). The mean change from baseline 
(5.4 minutes)  on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40 -minute MWT was also significantly greater 
than placebo (p=0.0002) for the 150-mg dose of J ZP-110.  
In contrast, previous studies of modafinil in patients with narcolepsy have demonstrated statistically significant increases in mean sleep latency using a 20 -minute MWT with 
maximal differences in the means between drug and placebo  groups ranging from 2.3 to 
4.5 minutes ( US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 1998, 
US Modafinil in  Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 2000, Harsh et al. 2006). However, a 
limitation of modafinil is that the therapeutic effects of this drug do not appear to last 
throughout the day and are markedly reduced by [CONTACT_156225] a 5 - or 6 -trial, 20- minute 
MWT ( Schwartz et al. 2003). For example, the effects of [ADDRESS_180846] 0  on the fifth and sixth trials of a 6 -trial, 20 -minute MWT (5 :00 to 7:00  
PM) when 
modafinil was given once daily in the morning (Schwartz et al. 2003). O nly a few studies 
have used objective measures of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], such as the MWT, in PD patients with subjective reports of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Perhaps similar to the limited effects of modafinil in patients with narcolepsy, a placebo- controlled, double -blind study of modafinil in patients 
with PD demonstrated no significant increase in mean sleep latency, compared to placebo, using a 40- min MWT ( Högl et al. 2002). Taken together, these data suggest that JZP -110 
might offer an important advance in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156135]’ ability to stay awake throughout the day beyond what has been demonstrated with current available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP166 -[ADDRESS_180847] on sleep  
following prolonged wakefulness, suggesting  potential effectiveness in treating  excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156136].  The wake -promoting action of JZP-110 differs from that of both 
d-amphetamine and  modafinil; both of which are used to treat excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156137].  
In vitro  and in vivo safety pharmacology  studies indicated no significant sa fety concerns. 
JZP-110 has minimal effects on cardiovascular function, including increases in blood 
pressure and heart rate.  
1.2.2  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
JZP-110 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_156138] (71% to  
100%) in mic e, rats,  and dogs. Single -dose half -life (t 1/2) values  following oral 
administration were 1, 2, and 4 hours in mice, rats (longer in chronic studies at high doses), 
and dogs, respectively,  with no unexpected accumulation with repeated administration.  In 
rats, the disposition profile in plasma was monophasic and elimination was mostly  by [CONTACT_156226]. Overall , the maximum concentration (C max) and area under the concentration- time 
curve ( AUC ) tended to increase proportionally with dose and were comparable in male and 
female animals.  
Plasma protein binding was low (8% to 17%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma.  
Metabolism is not an important elimination pathway  in humans as almost all (>90%) material 
excreted in  urine was unchanged drug with a minor metabolite (N -acetyl derivative of  
JZP-110 base) accounting for <1% of the dose excreted in  urine. The main metabolite in 
animal species was an acid metabolite, but a  parahydroxyphenyl  metabolite and its 
glucuronide were also identified.   
In vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) experiments  indicated low potential for JZP-110 drug- drug 
metabolism interactions by [CONTACT_156227]. JZP -110 did not

Page 26 of 115 inhibit CYP  enzymes including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. JZP-110 showed no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, or 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)  1A1  enzyme s. Furthermore, JZP-110 
was not a substrate or inhibitor of major uptake or efflux transporters, and did not inhibit UGT1A1 or U GT2B7 enzymes . 
1.2.3  Toxicology  
Single oral doses of JZP -110 at up  to 600, 750, and 140 mg/kg were  well tolerated by [CONTACT_156228],  
rats, and dogs, respectively. Clinical signs were mainly  related to central nervous system  
(CNS) stimulation in all species.  In addition to these clinical signs, dogs  also had salivation, 
mydriasis,  restlessness, panting, and/or marked transient elevation of body temperature.  
Repeat -dose toxicity studies of durations up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats, and 
12 months in dogs resulted in similar dose -related  CNS effects.  
A battery  of in vitro and in  vivo assays indicated that JZP-110 has no genotoxic potential. 
Two-year rat  and mouse carcinogenicity  studies are in progress. 
More detailed information  about the toxicology findings is provided in the JZP-110 
Investigator’ s Brochure . 
1.3 Clinical Experience  
Clinical studies of JZP -110 (seven Phase 1 and five Phase 2 studies) have been completed in 
1048 subjects,  of whom 690 subjects received 1 or more doses of JZP-110. In studies in 
which subjects received acute doses of JZP -110, doses ranged from 50 mg to 1200 mg. In 
studies in which subjects received repeated, daily doses of JZP -110, doses ranged from 
100 to 1000 mg/day (calculated based on the hydrochloride salt). The highest dose that is 
being used in the Phase [ADDRESS_180848] 90% of the dose being 
excreted as unchanged drug within 48 hours. Following single dosing and repeated doses administered twice daily, JZP -110 exposure was dose-propor tional, absorption (time to 
maximum plasma concentration [t
max]: 1.3 to 3.0 hours) and elimination (t 1/2: 5 to 7.6 hours) 
were relatively rapid, and steady state was reached in 3 days. JZP -110 displayed linear PK  
during 14 days of dosing over the dose range of 200 to 1000 mg per day. Limited accumulation and no enzyme auto-induction were evident.

(Studies ADX-N05 201 and ADX-N05 202), JZP- 110 significantly decreased the excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156140], with statistically significant differences from placebo 
on the primary efficacy endpoints. 
Study ADX-N05 201 was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter, crossover study. JZP-110 (after dosing with 150 mg/day for 1 week followed by 
[CONTACT_156229] 300 mg/day for a second week) effectively increased the mean sleep latency as measured by [CONTACT_156230]. Subjects were able to stay awake for an 
average of about 11 minutes longer following dosing with JZP-110 than placebo, a statistically significant difference. When the 5  MWT trials were analyzed separately, 
improvement in sleep latency statistically favored JZP -110 over placebo for all trials and 
improvements were maintained throughout the approximate 7-hour period after dosing. Results from analyses of the subjective measures of the ESS  and the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change (CGIc ) scale were consistent with MWT findings and statistically 
significant in favor of JZP-[ADDRESS_180849]- completed Patient Gl obal Impression of Change (PGIc ).

after 4 weeks (150 mg/day) and 11 minutes longer after 12 weeks (300 mg/day) of 
administration of JZP -110 than with placebo, a statistically significant difference. When the 
four MWT trials were analyzed separately, improvement in sleep latency also statistically favored JZP-110 over placebo for all trials at both Weeks 4 and 12 and was maintained throughout the approximate 9-hour period after dosing. 
Analyses of the investigator- completed CGIc  scale results were consistent with MWT 
findings and evidenced statistical superiority of JZP-110 over placebo. After 12 weeks, 
86% of subjects in the JZP-[ADDRESS_180851] minimal improvement on the

placebo.

1.4 Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks 
Parkinson’s disease is a p rogressive neurodegenerative disease, which ma nifests with both 
motor and nonmotor symptoms. Until recently, treatment has focused on improving the motor symptoms, however the nonmotor symptoms can also be prominent and disabling and treatment guidelines n ow recognize the n eed to improve these symptoms. Excessive

evaluated. The present Study JZP-166-201 will evaluate the effects of 75, 150, and  300 mg  of 
JZP-110 on excessive sle epi[INVESTIGATOR_156142] .  
The safety and tolerability of JZP -110 has been well characterized in multiple populations 
including healthy volunteers, patients with MDD, and patients with narcolepsy. Across 
3 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (R228060- NED -1, R228060-P01-101, and 
R228060- SAB -101) and 2 Phase 2 studies in patients with MDD (R228060- [LOCATION_003]-10 and 
R228060- MDD-201), data were pooled for 421 subjects who received JZP-110 at doses of 
200 to 1200 mg/day (with doses calculated based on the hydrochloride salt of the molecule) and [ADDRESS_180862] common (≥5%) treatment- emergent AEs 
that also occurred with a higher incidence with JZP-110 than with placebo were insomnia, headache, dizziness, anorexia, dry mouth, nervousness, nausea, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], agitation, abdominal pain, anxiety, fatigue, concentration impaired, and diarrhea. Common treatment -emergent AEs that occurred more often with placebo than JZP- 110 were 
somnolence and dyspepsia. Based on data pooled across 2 Phase 2 studies (Studies ADX-N05 201 and ADX-N05 202) of JZP-110 at doses up to 300 mg/day in subjects with narcolepsy (N=77, JZP- 110; N=82, placebo), the most frequent (≥5%) 
treatment -emergent AEs were insomnia, headache, nausea, decreased appetite, anxiet y, 
diarrhea, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], irritability, bruxism, and chest discomfort; all had a higher incidence with JZP -110 than with placebo.  
Randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in the narcolepsy and OSA populations are currently ongoing and remain blinded. 
No PK- based d rug-drug interactions are expected  between JZP-110 and the commonly used 
background P D therapy medications , as JZP -110 does not undergo hepatic m etabolism, and 
does not inhibit or induce major CYP450 enzymes . JZP -110 is eliminated primarily through 
renal excretion, and in vitro studies indicate that JZP-110 does not inhibit major uptake or 
efflux  transporters. The pharmacodynamic- based drug- drug interaction pot ential between 
JZP-110 (a selective norepi[INVESTIGATOR_33592]) and background 
dopamine replacement therapy used in PD is unknown, and the effect of coadministration will be evaluated via safety/efficacy assessments in the current study.  
Since there are limited therapeutic options , with no drugs that have been approved for the 
treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156143], there remains an unmet clinical need for a 
well-tolerated and effective therapy. The extensive clinical safety database across multiple 
populations for JZP -110 and the positive efficacy  results in narcolepsy patients provide an 
appropriate balance between risk and benefit. When all the considerations are taken together, they provide the basis to support the evaluation of the safety, tolerability , efficacy,  and PK 
profile of JZP -110 in patients with excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156144].

This is a 4 -week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose, 
4-period crossover study designed to evaluate t he safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of 
JZP-110 (75, 150, and 300 mg) in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156146]. Depending on study center  capabilities, subjects  will have the option of 
enrolling into 1 of 2 group s: Group 1 and Group 2. Subjects enrolled in Group 1 will undergo 
both objective (MWT) and subjective (ESS) assessments of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Subjects enrolled in 
Group 2 will undergo only the subjective (ESS) assessment of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Following completion of the S creening and Baseline visits, approximately 49  eligible subjects will be 
randomly assigned  (3:3:1) to [ADDRESS_180864] approximately 
34 subjects complete Treatment Sequences A and B, and 6 subjects complet e Treatment 
Sequence C . There will be no stratification based on group. Sequence C is added to  preserve

At the Screening v isit, the Baseline/Screening Version of the C- SSRS will be administered to 
subjects to exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior ( Appendix 11). 
The C -SSRS is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior. The instrument 
reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted suicide 
and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011). Suicidal ideation will be assessed for lifetime 
and over the past [ADDRESS_180902] 5 years with the Baseline/Screening Version of the C- SSRS. Th e Since Last Visit 
Version of the C- SSRS will be administered to subjects at the Baseline  visit; Visits 3, 4, 5, 
and 6/Early Termination; and at the Safety Follow-up visit ( Appendix 12).  
6.[ADDRESS_180903] 5 minutes. 
ECGs will be performed at every clinic visit. The schedule of ECG assessment is described in Section 7, Appendix 2 (Group 1), Appendix 3 (Group 1),  Appendix 5 (Group 2), and 
Appendix 6 (Group 2). In addition to local assessment by [CONTACT_458], a core laboratory will independently assess all Baseline and post- Baseline ECGs  for calculation of 
changes from Baseline.  
6.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.10.1  Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. Screening labs may be repeated 1  time  within the 30-day screening window. Clinical laborato ry tests to be 
conducted are listed in Table 1.  
The clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed  at a central laboratory. An authorized back-up 
laborat ory, as indicated on the Form FDA  1572 or equivalent, may be used if necessary as an 
emergency laboratory. The investigator will supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee with the back -up laboratory’s current licensure and laboratory reference ranges.  
Please note exclusionary clinical laboratory parameters listed in the exclusion criteria 
(Section 4.3). Clinically significant findings that represent a worsening from the Screening 
visit must be documented as AE s (see Section  6.14.1) . 
The central laboratory will calculate the estimated creatinine clearance rate at screening using 
the Cockcroft-Gault formula (FDA Guidance for Industry. Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Impaired Renal Fun ction – Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and 
Labeling, May 1998). 
CLcr (mL/min) = [140 – age (years)] x weight (kg) x (0.85 if female)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of an AE to study drug and to study 
procedure is required. The relationship or association of the study drug  or procedure in 
causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized using the following classification a nd 
criteria:  
Related  
or Suspected to be Related to Study Drug or Procedure There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure 
caused the event —i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug or procedure and the AE.  
Some temporal relationship exists between the event and the administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is 
unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , or accident.   
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence: 
• The event follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
study drug or procedure. 
• The event improves upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_156159] ( positive dechallenge).  
• The event reappears upon repeated exposure ( positive 
rechallenge) if medically appropriate.   
Not 
Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure There is not a reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the 
study drug or procedure caused the event.  
The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event.

investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US CFR , the EU Clinical Trial 
Directive (2001/20/EC) and/or local regulatory requirements. 
The reference safety information for the determination of expectedness for  JZP-110 is the 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) will be reported to the 
applicable regulatory authorities, CECs , and all participating  investigators no later than 
[ADDRESS_180928] knowledge of the event. S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life -threatening will be reported to the applicable regulatory 
authorities , IRBs, and investigators (if required by [CONTACT_1295]) no later than 7 days after 
knowledge of such a case, and relevant follow-up information provided within an additional 
8 days. 
Once a year throughout the study, a report listing of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs (and SAEs if required by 
[CONTACT_1295]) that have occurred during the period and a report of the subject’s safety will be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities and CECs . 
The subject’s treatment assignment may be unblinded for regulatory reporting purposes. Notification of the treatment assignment is only made known to those who require it for safety reporting and submission processes. All other individuals involved in the study, including the investigator, will remain blinded to the tr eatment assignment. Subjects  will not 
be withdrawn from the study solely based on unblinding for safety reporting . 
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_156252] (IRB)/ ethics committee will be done in accordance with the standard operations procedures

The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity for assessing subjective 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Johns 1991;  Broderick et al. 2013 ). While the ESS has been most frequently used 
as the primary or only assay of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156160], in a smaller number of studies the MWT has also been used as an additional assay ( Bliwise et al. 2012 ; 
Hogl  et al. 2002; Stevens et al . 2004; Razmy et al . 2004). The MWT is a validated objective 
measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period of time and is particularly useful for determining efficacy of treatment in sleep disorder populations such as narcolepsy (Doghramji et al. 1997;  Mitler et al. 1982 ). However, the MWT has not been specifically 
validated in PD, a population that experiences fluctuating nonmotor symptoms including greater day -to-day variability in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  (Roth et al.  2003). Additionally , the CGIc and  
PGIc have been used extensively in clinical trials to assess efficacy and quality of life.  
For subjects who enroll in the study prior to Amendment 2 implementation, the PK profile of 
JZP-110 will be evaluated  over an 8 -hour period based  on blood samples  (4 mL)  collected  at 
predose and  at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to 8 (if feasible) hours after dosing at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 
6. PK/pharmacodynamic modeling or population PK /pharmacodynamic modeling may be 
used to explore exposure-response relationships in subj ects with PD.
 
The use of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, standard AE reporting, and the questionnaires that have been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known risks of JZP -110. The C- SSRS is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a 
person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011).

9.1 General Considerations 
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_156256] . 
Categorical variables will be reported as frequency and percent (e.g. , gender, race). 
Continuous variables will be reported as number of subjects with observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum (e.g., age, weight). Listings will 
include the group number (e.g., Group 1 or Group 2) in which a subject was enrolled. All summaries, statistical analyses , and individual subject data listings described in this section 
will be produced using Version 9.3 or later of the SAS Statistical Analysis S ystem (SAS 
Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). 
9.[ADDRESS_180974] at 0.05 level.   
9.3 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 49 subjects will be randomized to the 3 sequence groups (A, B, and C) with the goal of 40 subjects completing the study: 34 subjects each in Sequences A and B, and up to 6 subjects in sequence C. The randomization ratio implemented will be 3:3:1 with expected randomization of subjects to sequences being approximately 21:21:7. 
Although the primary objective of this study is to assess safety, efficacy endpoint- based 
power calculations were performed for reference. A sample size of 34 subjects (assuming 
[ADDRESS_180975] eting in each of the Sequences A and B) will provide 80% power to detect a 
difference of 3  points in the change from baseline in ESS score between 1 of the JZP-110 and 
placebo groups not adjusting for multiple comparisons. This calculation assumes a common  
SD of 6 points for the change from baseline in ESS score and a 2- sided significance level of 
0.05 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based t- test for difference of means in a 
crossover design. The primary purpose of placebo S equence C  is to preserve  study blinding.

This population will be analyzed for safety evaluations and will be presented in the tables and listings of safety data.  
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) Population will include subjects who were randomized,

(Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) for each of the following assessments : 
• Mean sleep latency time (in minutes),  as determined from the 40- minute MWT  
• MDS -UPDRS Parts III and IV  
• CGIc  
• PGIc  
• FSS 
• Apathy Scale

Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, and area under the curve (AUC), as appropriate. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be estimated for subjects in the PK population who have evaluable PK data.  
9.12 Efficacy Analysis  
For the analysis of the key efficacy endpoints of change from baseline in ESS, a 
mixed -effects model will be used as the primary method of analysis. This model will include 
fixed effects for treatment (dose), sequence, treatment -by-sequence interaction, and baseline 
value of the efficacy endpoint. The model will also include a random effect for subject within sequence.   
SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. The estimates of treatment difference versus placebo and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
Additional statistical methodologies  will be explored to aid in the interpretation of the study 
results  due to treatment -by-sequence interaction and carryover effects . The de tails will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
For the analysis of the MWT exploratory endpoint , a similar mixed -effects model as for ESS 
will be used. However, because the MWT will be optional and consequently result in a 
reduced sample size, there may be convergence issues associated with the mixed -effects 
model. In the event such issues do arise, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model without accounting for treatment sequence may be used at each visit.  
For the analysis of efficacy endpoints of improvement in PGIc and CGIc, the chi- squared test 
will be used to test the hypotheses of difference between placebo and each active dose  
A mixed -effects model similar to the model described  above will be used for the anal ysis of 
MDS -UPDRS, FSS, Apathy Scale , and SCOPA-cog endpoints. Details of the analyses will 
be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

In addition, due to the removal of MWT as an eligibility criterion in Protocol Amendment 2, the efficacy endpoint summary may also be reported separately for subjects with eligible MWT at study entry versus those with either i neligible or missing MWT at study entry.  
No adjustment for multiple testing will be performed.  
Summary  statistics for all efficacy assessments/endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_156259]. 
9.13 Safety Analysis  
9.13.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system to classify events under primary system organ class and preferred term. T he number and 
percent of subjects who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, or SAEs; who died during the study; or who discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study due to an AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_156260]. Results will be presented by [CONTACT_9313] , and  preferred term.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that either began after first study drug dose or worsened after  
the first dose. When determining the percent of subjects who experience an AE, multiple increases in severity are only counted as one AE. For example, a subject who develops a mild headache after the first study drug dose (that was not prese nt during screening or at baseline),  
which subsequently worsens to moderate, then severe, is only counted once under the preferred term of headache.  
For all AE summaries, if a subject has more than one AE within a preferred term on a given 
dose, the subject is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to study drug. If a subject has more than one AE within a system organ class, the subject is similarly counted once when reporting results for that system organ class. 
All AE  data will be listed .   
9.13.[ADDRESS_180980] baseline visit in each vital sign parameter will

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; mustask about all types)Past X Years
or
Lifetime 
Actual Attempt:
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results,
this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anythin g to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? 
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY int ention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attem pt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed an d taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.
Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you 
actually did anything?

Aborted Attempt:

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, 
had potential for very serious lethality: put gun in mouth and pu lled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage;
laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away before run over).
0 = Behavior no t likely to result in injury
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)Since Last 
Visit
Actual Attempt:
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results,
this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done any thing to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? Were you trying to end your life when you _____?Or did you 
think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY inten tion of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, g et
sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_156279]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medica l damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away 
before run over).
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injur y
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death
2 = Behavior likely to result in death despi[INVESTIGATOR_156187]

This chart may not be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530], distributed or otherwise used in whole orin part without prior written consent of the Movement Di sorder SocietyPart III: Motor Examination
Overview: This portion of the scale assesses the motor si gns of PD. In administering Part III of the MDS-UPDRS 
the examiner should comply with the following guidelines: 
At the top of the form, mark whether the patient is on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease
and, if on levodopa, the time since the last dose. 
Also, if the patient is receiving medicati on for treating the symptoms of Parkinso n’s D isease, mark the pati ent’s 
clinical state using the following definitions: 
ON is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156189] a good response. 
OFF is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156190] a poor response in spi[INVESTIGATOR_156191].
The investigator sho uld “r ate what you see”.  Admittedly, concurrent medical problems such as stroke, paralysis, 
arthritis, contracture, and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with 
individual items in the motor examination. In situations wher e it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations, 
plegia, limb in a cast), use t he notation “ UR” for Unab le to Rate. Otherwise, rate the performance of each task as the 
patient performs in the context of co-morbidities. 
All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings). 
Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item. These should be followed in all instances. The 
investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter. 
For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17), these items have been placed 
purposefully at the end of the scale because clinical informat ion pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the 
entire examination. 
At the end of the rating, indicate if dyskinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time  of the examination, and if 
so, whether these movements interfered with the motor examination.

3.1SPEECH
 
Instructions to examiner: Listen to the patient’s free-flowing speech and engage in conversation if 
necess ary. Suggested topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: ask about the patient’s work, hobbies, exercise, or how he got to the 
doctor’s office. Evaluate volume, mo dulation (prosody) and clarity,  including slurring, palilali a (repetition 
of syllables) and ta chyphemia (rapid speech, running syllables together).
 
0: Normal: No speech problems.
 
1: Slight: Loss of modulation, diction or volume, but still all words easy to understand.
 
2: Mild: Loss of modulation, diction, or volume, with a few words unclear, b ut the overall 
sentences easy to follow.
 
3: Moderate: Speech is difficult to understand  to the point that some, but not most, sentence s are 
poorly understood.
 
4: Severe: Most speech is difficult to understand or unintelligible.SCORE
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
3.2FACIAL EXPRESSION
 
Instructions to examiner: Observe the patient sitting at rest for 10 seconds, without talking a nd also 
while ta lking. Observe eye-blink frequency, masked facies or loss of facial expression, spontaneo us 
smiling and parting of lips.
 
0: Normal: Normal facial expression.
 
1: Slight: Minimal masked facies manifested only by [CONTACT_156280].
 
2: Mild: In addition to decreased eye-blink frequency, Masked facies presen t in the lower 
face as well, namely fewer movements around the mouth, such as less 
spontaneous smiling, but lips not parted.
 
3: Moderate:  Masked facies with lips parted some of the time when the mouth is at rest.
 
4: Severe: Masked facies with lips parted mo st of the time when the mouth is at rest.

3.3RIGIDITY
 
Instructions to examiner: Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with th e patient in 
a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the l imbs and neck. First, test without an ac tivation 
maneuv er. Test and rate neck and each limb separately. For arms, test the wrist and elbow joints 
simulta neously. For legs, test the hip and knee joints si multaneously. If no rigidity is detected, us e an 
activation m aneuver such as tappi[INVESTIGATOR_156193], fist opening/closing, or heel tappi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a limb no t being 
tested. Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity.
 
0: Normal: No rigidity.
 
1: Slight: Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver.
 
2: Mild: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver, but full range of motion is eas ily 
achieved.
 
3: Moderate:  Rigidity detected without the activa tion maneuver; full range of motion is achieve d
with effort.
 
4: Severe: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver and full range of motion not 
achieved.SCORE

Instructions to examiner: Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms, with both feet on the
floor and sitting back in the chair (if the patient is no t too short). Ask the patient to cross his/her a rms 
across the chest and then to stand up. If the patient is not successful, repeat this attempt a maximum
upto two more times. If still unsuccessful, allow the patient to move forward in the chair to arise with 
arms folded across the chest. Allow only one attemp t in this situation. If unsuccessful, allow th e patient 
to pu sh off using his/her hands on the arms of the cha ir. Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off. 
If still not successful, assist the patient to arise. After the patient stands up, observe the posture for item
3.13
0: Normal: No problems. Able to arise quickly without hesitation.
1: Slight: Arising is slower than normal; or may need more than one attempt; or may 
need to move forward in the chair to arise. No need to use the arm s of the 
chair.
2: Mild: Pushes self up from arms of chair without difficulty.3: Moderate: Needs to push off, but tends to fall  back; or may have to try more than one
time 
using arms of chair, but can get up without help.
4: Severe: Unable to arise without help.SCORE
3.10GAIT
Instructions to examiner: Testing gait is best performed by [CONTACT_156281]. The patient should walk at least 10 me ters (30 feet), then turn around and ret urn to the 
examin er. This item measures multiple behaviors: stride amplitude, stride speed, height of foot lift, heel 
strike during walking, turning, and arm swing, but not freezi ng. Assess also for “ freezing of gai t” (next 
item 3.11) w hile patient is walking.  Observe posture for item 3.13
0: Normal: No problems.
1: Slight: Independent walking with minor gait impairment.
2: Mild: Independent walking but with substantial gait impairment.3: Moderate: Requires an assistance device for safe walking (walking stick, walk
er) but not a 
person.
4: Severe: Cannot walk at all or  only with another person ’sa s s i s t a n c e .

3.11FREEZING OF GAIT
 
Instructions to examiner: While assessing gait, also assess for the presence of any gait freezing 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_156198]. Observe for start hesitation and stuttering  movements especially when turning and reachi ng
the end of the task. To the extent that safety permits, patients may NOT use sensory tricks du ring the 
assessment.
 
0: Normal: No freezing.
 
1: Slight:            Freezes on starting, tu rning or walking through doorway with a single h alt during 
any of these events, but then continues smoothly without freezing during straight 
walking.
 
2: Mild: Freezes on starting, turning or walking through doorway with more than on e halt 
during any of these activities, but cont inues smoothly without freezing during
straight walking.
 
3: Moderate: Freezes once during straight walking.
 
4: Severe: Freezes multiple times during straight walking.SCORE
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
3.12POSTURAL STABILITY
 
Instructions to examiner: The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produ ced by a 
quick, forceful pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet 
comf ortably apart and parallel to each other. Test re tropulsion. Stand behind the patient and instru ct 
the patient on what is about to happen. Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid 
falling. There sh ould be a solid wall behind the examiner, at least 1-[ADDRESS_181063] so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient ’s limitations 
rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness. Observe standing posture for item 3.13
 
0: Normal: No problems: Recovers with one or two steps.
 
1: Slight: 3-[ADDRESS_181064] recovers unaided.
 
2: Mild: More than [ADDRESS_181065] recovers unaided.
 
3: Moderate: Stands safely, but with absence of postural response; falls if not caught by 
[CONTACT_156282].
 
4: Severe: Very unstable, tends to lose balance spontaneously or with ju st a gentle pull on
the shoulders.

3.13POSTURE
 
Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient standing erect after arising fro m a chair, 
during walking, and while being tested for postural reflexes. If you notice poor p osture, tell the patient 
to stand up straight and see if the posture improves (see option 2 below). Rate the worst post ure seen 
in these three observation points. Observe for fl exion and side-to-side leaning.
 
0: Normal: No problems.
 
1: Slight: Not quite erect, but posture could be normal for older person.
 
2: Mild: Definite flexion, scoliosis or leaning to one side, but patient can correct po sture to 
normal posture when asked to do so.
 
3: Moderate: Stooped posture, scoliosis or leaning to one side that cannot be corrected
volitionally to a normal posture by [CONTACT_102].
 
4: Severe: Flexion, scoliosis or leaning with extreme abnormality of posture.SCORE
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
3.14GLOBAL SPONTANEITY OF MOVEMENT (BODY BRADYKINESIA)
 
Instructions to examiner: This global rating combines  all observations on slowness, hesitancy, and 
small a mplitude and poverty of movement in general, including a reduction of gesturing and of cros sing 
the legs. This assessment is based on the examiner ’s global impression after observing for 
spontaneous gestures while sitting, and the nature of arising and walking.
 
0: Normal: No problems.
 
1: Slight: Slight global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.
 
2: Mild: Mild global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.
 
3: Moderate: Moderate global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.
 
4: Severe: Severe global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements. 
  
 
  
 
 
3.15POSTURAL TREMOR OF THE HANDS
 
Instructions to examiner : All tremor, including re-emergent rest tremor , that is present in this posture is 
to be incl uded in this rating. Rate each hand separately. Rate the highest amplitude seen. Instru ct the 
patient to str etch the arms out in front of the body with palms down. The wrist should be straig ht and 
the fingers c omfortably separated so that they do not touch each other. Observe this posture for 10 
seconds.
 
0: Normal: No tremor.
 
1: Slight: Tremor is present but less than 1 cm in amplitude.
 
2: Mild: Tremor is at least 1 but less than 3 cm in amplitude.

Instructions to examiner: This is tested by [CONTACT_156283]-to-nose maneuver. With the arm starting from the 
outstre tched position, have the patient perform at least three finger-to-nose maneuvers with each ha nd
reaching as far as possible to touch the examiner ’s finger. The finger-to-nose maneuver should be
performed slowly enough not to hide any tremor that could occur with very fast arm movements. Rep eat
with the other hand, rating each hand separately. The tremor can be present through out the movement 
or as t he tremor reaches either target (nose or finger). Rate the highest amplitude seen.
0: Normal: No tremor.
1: Slight: Tremor is present but less than 1 cm in amplitude.2: Mild: Tremor is at least 1 but less than 3 cm in amplitude.
3: Moderate: Tremor is at least 3 but less than 10 cm in amplitude.
4: Severe: Tremor is at least [ADDRESS_181066] TREMOR AMPLITUDE
Instructions to examiner: This and the next item ha ve been placed purposefully at the end of the 
examination to allow the rater to gather observations on rest tremor that may appear at any time dur ing
the exam, including when quietly sitting, during walking and during activities when some body parts a re 
moving but others are at r est. Score the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final score. 
Rate only the amplitude and not the persistence or the intermittency of the tremor.
As part of this rating, the p atient should sit quietly in a chair with the hands placed on the arm s of the 
chair (not in the lap) and the feet comfortably supported on the floor for [ADDRESS_181067] tremor is assessed separately for all four limbs and also for the lip/jaw. Rate only the 
maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final rating.

 Part IV: Motor Complications
 
 
Overview and Instructions: In this sect ion, the rater uses historical and objective information to assess two motor 
complications, dyskinesias and motor fluctuations that incl ude OFF-state dystonia. Use all information from patient, 
caregiver, and the examination to answer the six question s that summarize function over the past week including 
today. As in the other sections, rate using only integers (n o half points allowed) and leave no missing ratings. If the 
item cannot be rated, place UR for Unable to Rate. You will  need to choose some answers based on percentages, 
and therefore you will need to establish how many hour s generally are awake hours and use this figure as the 
denominato r for “ OFF” time  and Dyskinesias. For “O FF dystonia ”, the total “Off” time will be the denominator. 
Operational definitions for examiner ’s use.
 
Dyskinesias: Involuntary random movements
Words that patients often recognize for dyskinesias inclu de “irregular jerking”, “wiggling”, “ twitching ”. It is essential to
stress to the patient the difference between dyskinesias and tremor, a common error when patients are assessing
dyskinesias .
 
Dystonia: contorted posture, often with a twisting component:
Words that patients often recognize for dystonia inclu de “spasm s”, “cramps ”, “posture ”.
 
Motor fluctuation: Variable response to medication: 
Words that patients often reco gnize for motor fluctuation incl ude “weari ng out”, “we aring off”, “roll er-coaste r effect”, 
“on-off”, “un even medication effects”.
 
OFF: Typi[INVESTIGATOR_156190] a poor resp onse in spi[INVESTIGATOR_156199]. Words that patients often recognize include “low
time”, “bad t ime”, “sh aking time”, “sl ow time”, “time when my med ications do n’t work.”
 
ON: Typi[INVESTIGATOR_156189] a good response: 
Words that patients often recognize in clude “ good tim e”, “walk ing time”, “time w hen my medications work.”
 
A . DYSKINESIAS [exclusive of OFF-state dystonia]
 
 
4.1 TIME SPENT WITH DYSKINESIAS
 
Instructions to examiner:  Determine the hours in the usual waking day and then the hours of 
dyskinesias. Calculate the percentage. If the patient has dyskinesias in the office, you can point them 
out as a reference to ensure that patients and caregi vers understand what they are rating. You may also 
use your own acting skills to enact the dyskinetic movements you have seen in the patient before orshow them dyskinetic movements typi[INVESTIGATOR_156200]. Exclude from this  question early morning
and nighttime painful dystonia. 
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver].  Over the past week, how many hours do you usually sleep on a 
daily basis, including nighttime sleep and daytime na ppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]? Alright, if you sleep    hrs, you are awake
   hrs. Out of those awake hours, how many hours in  total do you have wiggling, twitching or jerking
movements? Do not count the times when you have tremor, which is a regular back and forth shaking
or times when you have painful foot cramps or spasms in the early morning or at nighttime. I will ask 
about those later.  Concentrate only on these types of wiggling, jerking and irregular movements. AddSCORE

being with people when these jerking movements oc curred? Did they stop you from doing things or 
from being with people?
0: Normal: No dyskinesias or no impact by [CONTACT_156284].

B . MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS
4.3 TIME SPENT IN THE OFF STATE
Instructions to examiner: Use the number of waking hours derived from 4.1 and determine the hours 
spent in the “OFF”  state. Calculate the percentage. If the pa tient has an OFF period  in the office, you 
can point to this state as a reference. You may al so use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_156201]. Additionally you may use your ow n acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function typi[INVESTIGATOR_156202]. Mark down the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156203], because you will  need this number for completing 4.6 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Some patients with Parkinson's disease have a good effect
from their medications throughout their awake hours and we call that “ON”time.   Other patients take 
their medications but still have so me hours of low time, bad time, sl ow time or shaking time. Doctors
call these low periods “O FF” time. Over the past week, you told me before that you are generally awake
hrs each day. Out of these awake hours, how many ho urs in total do you usually have this type of
low level or OFF function (Use this number for your calculations).
0: Normal: No OFF time. 
1: Slight: ≤ 25%  of waking day. 
2: Mild: 26 - 50% of waking day.

Instructions to examiner: Determine the degree to which motor fluctuations impact on the pat ient’s daily 
function in terms of activiti es and social interactions. This question concentrates on the difference 
betw een the ON state and the OFF state. If the pa tient has no OFF time, the rating must be 0, but if 
patients have very mild fluctuations, it is still possible to be rated [ADDRESS_181071] on activities 
occurs. Use the patient ’s and caregiver ’s response to your question and your own observations durin g
theoffice visit to arrive at the best answer.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Think about when those lo w or “OFF” periods have occurred o ver
the past we ek. Do you usually have more problems doing things or being with people than com pared to 
the rest of the day when you feel your medications working? Are there some things you usually do
during a good period that you have trouble wi th or stop doing during a low period?
 
0: Normal: No fluctuations or No impact by [CONTACT_156285].

4.5COMPLEXITY OF MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS
 
Instructions to examiner: Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose, time 
of day, food intake or other factors. Use the information provided by [CONTACT_156286]. You will ask if the patient can count on them always coming at
a special time, mostly coming at a special time (in which case you will probe further to separate slight
from mild), o nly sometimes coming at a special time or are they totally unpredictable? Narrowing d own 
the percentage will allow you to find the correct answer.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: For some patients, the low o r “OFF” periods happen at certain 
times during day or when they do activities like eating or exercising. Over the past week, do you usu ally 
know when your low periods will occur? In other words, do your low periods always come at a certain
time? Do they mostly come at a certain time? Do they only sometimes come at a certain time? Are 
your low periods totally unpredictable? ”
 
0: Normal: No motor fluctuations.
 
1: Slight: OFF times are predictable all or almost all of the time (> 75%).
 
2: Mild: OFF times are predictable most of the time (51-75%).

“OFF” time ( 4.3). Of these hours, determine how many are associated with dystonia and calc ulate the 
percent age. If there is no OFF time, mark 0.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: In one of the questions I asked earlier, you said you generally
have hours of low or “OF F”time when your Parkinson's disease is under poor control. During the se
low or “OFF” periods, do you usually have painful cramps or spasms? Out of the total hrs of this

Summary statement to patient: READ TO PATIENT
 
This completes my rating of your Parkinso n’s d isease.  I know the questions and tasks have taken several minutes, but 
I wanted to be co mplete and cover all possibilities. In doing so, I may have asked about problems you do not even 
have, and I may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all. Not all patients develop all these 
problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every patient. Thank you f or your time 
and attention in completing this scale with me.

Mistakes can be: the order, missing or not knowing a number, or not finishing off the series. Record the order of numbers named by [CONTACT_102]. If the patient asks where to start or how much to subtract, the researcher repeats the instructions but counts that as one mistake. If the patient makes a mistake but continues from that point to subtractthree, it is only one mistake. If the patient stops the order and starts all over again, it isone mistake.

Mistakes are: the order, missing or not knowing the next month, or not finishing off the series. Underline the months that are named correctly. When a month is passed over, this is a mistake, even if the patient corrects it later on. If the patient stops the order and starts all over again, it is one mistake.

Situation 1: YES = EVEN 
Put the card “YES=EVEN, NO=ODD” on the table and leave it there during the test. 
Instruction:
 "Say YES for an even number on a dice and NO for an odd number, when 
you see a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a dice with an EVEN number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_156208], I would like you to say YES, and NO when the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_156209]”.  Show the first two examples (3 even and 3 odd dices) and ask the patient “If you see one of these dice, do you say yes or no?” Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why. It is important that the patient says YES or NO and not EVEN or ODD. Show the next two examples (with only one dice) and ask the patient “if you see this dice, do you say yes or no?” Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not.

STUDY 
PROCEDURES:  
 
 
 
 Initially [ADDRESS_1034150] 2 cycles of 
therapy accrual will continue at the initial dose level.  
With approval of protocol amendment 2 (PA2) and change on dose 
and schedule of carfilzomib (from 6 to 3 doses per cycle), the n ext 6  
patients starting therapy wi ll be considered to be in a safety lead -in 
at the new dose and schedule and followed the same procedure 
outlined above. Once a new dose and schedule is declared safe, 
previously enrolled patients will switch from 6 doses of carfilzomib 
to 3 doses of carfilzomib per cycle.  
Subjects are expected to transition from induction therapy, to 
consolidation therapy and from consolidation therapy to 
observation/ maintenance therapy according to MRD status. 
Autologous hematopoietic ce ll transplantation (auto -HCT) is the 
initia l step in consolidation therapy. Subjects not eligible for auto -
HCT (per investigator’s assessment) or who choose to defer auto -
HCT will receive four additional cycles of consolidation therapy as 
“replacement” for  auto-HCT. Each cycle of therapy has duration of 
[ADDRESS_1034151] 16 weeks 
(including recovery)  
 
INDUCTION  THERAPY  
Screening  – Subjects likely to meet eligibility criteria will be 
offered participation in the study after the investigator verifies UAB 
CTNMO  registration. Subjects will sign informed consent prior to 
any protocol associated procedure. Screening procedures are 
outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1034152] 1) meets all the 
eligibility criteria, 2) obtain disease assessment to allow efficacy

 Page 8 of 126 measurements, 3) assess baseline toxicity, and 4) provide 
identification  samples for subsequent MRD assessment . 
KRdD Inductio n Therapy - The total duration of induction is 4 
cycles  of 28 -day duration each . In all cycles patients will receive 
dexamethasone 40 mg oral on days 1,8,15 and 22 and lenalidomide 
25 mg ( see adjustment for renal impairment in Table 5 ) daily from 
days [ADDRESS_1034153] dose of carfilzomib. During cycles 1 and 2 subjects will 
receive daratumumab 16 mg/kg on days 1,8,15 and 22.  During 
cycles 3 and 4 subjects will receive daratumumab 16 mg/kg on day 
1 and 15 of each cycle. Carfilzomib will be administered at dose of 
20 mg/m2 on day [ADDRESS_1034154] cycle and at dose of 56 mg/m2   on days 
[ADDRESS_1034155] ass essment  (in 
subjects found to be MRD -informative based on clone identification 
sample) will be  performed at the end of cycle 4 (hereafter referred to 
as induction MRD ).  
CON SOLIDATION THERAPY   
Auto-HCT  – Upon completion of induction therapy patients will 
proceed with standard of care auto -HCT  (consolidation 1) . 
Hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization will be performed 
utilizing growth -factors with or without the addition of plerixafor 
using sta ndard practices. The use of chemotherapy mobilization is 
not allowed as it may add toxicity, delay transplant and post -

 Page 9 of 126 transplant recovery. Chemotherapy mobilization may be employed 
after failure of initial mobilization attempt and after discussion with 
study PI. Subjects who are transplant eligible  (as determined by 
[CONTACT_1697]) , but choose to defer transplant, will collect 
hematopoietic progenitor cells and them proceed to KRdD 
consolidation. Auto -HCT conditioning therapy with consist of 
Melphalan 200mg/ m2 administered as  single dose on day -[ADDRESS_1034156] 
consolidation  (consolidat ions 2 and 3)  will be up to 8  cycles ( up to 
12 cycles for patients who don’t undergo auto -HCT)  of 28 -day 
duration each . In all cycles patients will receive dexamethasone 40 
mg oral on days 1,8 ,15 and 22 and lenalidomide 25 mg ( see 
adjustment  for renal impairment in Table 5 ) daily from days 1 -21, 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg on day [ADDRESS_1034157] two cycles of 
consolidation and on day 1 on remaining cycles  and carfilzomib 56 
mg/m2  on days 1,[ADDRESS_1034158] assay (in subjects found to be MRD -
informative based on clone identification sample) will be performed 
60-[ADDRESS_1034159] (or on day 1  of cycle 3 of KRdD 
consolidation #[ADDRESS_1034160]) , hereafter 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February [ADDRESS_1034161] , and, when applicable,  on day  1 
of cycles 3  KRdD  consolidation (cycle [ADDRESS_1034162] ) hereafter referred  to as consolidation -[ADDRESS_1034163]  
and on day 1 of cycle 7 of KRdD consolidation (cycle [ADDRESS_1034164]) hereafter referred to as 
consolidation -[ADDRESS_1034165] cycle of each 4 -cycle “block” of KRdD 
allows patients who have become confirmed MRD( -) to effectively 
receive two full cycles of consolidation (the third and fourth cycle in 
the block) before hav ing therapy discontinued.  
 
OBSERVATION/ MAINTENANCE THERAPY  
 
Transition to observation/ maintenance therapy  – Subjects will 
start observation/ maintenance therapy after completing the entire 
planned consolidation therapy or after obtaining a confirmed MRD( -
), defined as ≤10-[ADDRESS_1034166] negative observation cohort – Subjects who obtain  
confirmed  MRD( -) assessment  in either consolidation -[ADDRESS_1034167]  (-) observation  cohort . In this cohort, subjects will be 
observed without MM -directed therapy and undergo monitoring, 
including MRD surveillance  during an active surveillance phase (72 
weeks) . Subjects who test positive for MRD at any  of the 
subsequent surveillance MRD assessments while off therapy are 
encouraged to start standard of care maintenance lenalidomide as 
discussed for MRD(+) cohort.  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February [ADDRESS_1034168] positive  maintenance  cohort – Subjects who are not 
evaluable for MRD status or  don’t have confirmed MRD( -) at the 
end consolidation -[ADDRESS_1034169](+) cohort. 
In this cohort  subjects will be monitored for overall and 
progression -free survival. It is highly recommended that subjects 
receive standard of care lenalidomide maintenance. Recomme nded 
starting regimen is lenalidomide  10 mg/day continuously until 
progression or intolerance , with dose  modifications and  adjustments 
being performed at treating physician  discretion .  
MRD positive cohort d isease assessment - Response assessment 
based on s erum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine 
immunofixation and serum free light chains  is strongly 
recommended not  less often than every 16  weeks until disease 
progression .

METHODS:  
 Due to limited  data on the safety of the specific combination of 
agents being studied in the induction phase, a safety lead -in was 
performed and include d [ADDRESS_1034170] 2 cycles in 2 or more subjects (in fact, none of 
the first 6 subjects experienced dose limiting toxicity). The study 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February [ADDRESS_1034171] that 
recommended accrual will continue at the initial dose level.  
Using Simon’s optimal two -stage design  (optimal design) , a total of 
67 evalu able patients will achieve 80% power to detect  at least 15% 
more M RD negative subjects in the experimental intervention  
compared to the historical benchmark (  60% M RD negative  rate at a 
KRd  + auto -HCT trial) aiming to achieve  at least 75% M RD 
negative upon completion of consolidation in the current protocol .  
Twenty seven patients will be enrolled in the first stage; the trial 
will be terminated if [ADDRESS_1034172] stage. If the trial goes on to the second stage, an additional 
40 evaluable patients (total of 6 7 evaluable patients) will be studied. 
If the total number of subjects to become MRD negative is less than 
or equal to 46, the intervention will be c onsidered futile. By 
[CONTACT_251948] 20% of either subject  drop out or not informative for 
MRD , a total of [ADDRESS_1034173] risk (SR) and 44 high risk 
(HR) patients. The expansion will enable the exploratory objective 
to describe  PFS on HR  and SR patients with confirmed MRD ( -) 
status.

 Page 25 of 126 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.1 DISEASE SPECIFIC BACKGROUND  
 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder with no standard curative 
therapy (1) . Symptomatic MM is characterized by a clonal  proliferation of plasma cells 
preceding clinical findings that include bone lesions, fractures, anemia, renal failure and 
hypercalcemia. (2) MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the US with 
30,330 expected new cases in 2016 (3).  
For decades, low doses of melphalan and prednisone was the cornerstone of MM 
treatment. However, complete responses under this regime n are rare, and the median time for 
progression is not higher than 15 months (4, 5). A first significant advance in the management of 
MM was the upfront use of high doses of melphalan wi th autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplantation ( auto-HCT ), typi[INVESTIGATOR_755490].  Such treatment has allowed 
for improved response rates, progression free survival and  prolonged survival in MM (6-9) and its 
value has been recently confirmed even in the setting of modern induction therapy (10, 11). High 
dose melphalan with AHSCT  therefore  remains  a fundamental therapeutic modality as part of the 
initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM . 
Induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) has also evolved 
substa ntially. The use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the setting of 3 -drug regimens 
has produced remission rates in >90% of patients, is well tolerated, and prolongs survival over 
non-bortezomib containing regimens in patients who proceed to auto -HCT  as well as patients 
who remain on conventional therapy (12, 13).   
A major change in paradigm in upfront myeloma therapy has been the transition from 
fixed duration of therapy to continuous therapy, of ten in the format of single agent maintenance 
therapy a fter either conventional induction (14, 15) or induction followed by [CONTACT_331437] -HCT 
consolidation (14, 16, 17). This approach has impacted the duration of remission and, in a subset 
of studies, also overall survival (15, 16).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755491] r ates of complete remissions  with induction therapy  and 
implementation of maintenance therapy , the vast majority of MM patients will experience a 
relapse and eventually succumb to the disease, typi[INVESTIGATOR_755492].

develop more active treatment regimens and better tools for response assess ment.   
 
1.2 MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN MM  
 
More recently, the development and validation of minimal residual disease (MRD) 
assessment by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) has allowed identification of group of patients 
with very distinct prognosis according to  the burden of disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_755493] (18-20).  
The DFCI/IFM 2009 trial treated patients with a combination of bortezomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRD) as induction , followed by [CONTACT_755528] -HCT with subsequent VRD consolidation in both arms and 
lenalidomide maintenance (11). Patients with pre maintenance MRD( -)  had much improved 
progression free survival (>80% at 2 years) than patients MRD(+) , identifying a subset of 
patients who may be cured from the disease and validating a disease assessment tool that may be 
employed for response -adapted therapy (18, 21). MRD assessment by [CONTACT_755529] ® test . 
 Other modalities of MRD assessment in MM i nclude flow cytometry and allele -specific 
polymerase chain reaction. These modalities are currently less attractive as a management tool 
due to lower sensitivity , limited cross -validation , limited applicability  and/or higher cost.  
In a recent consensus paper the International Multiple Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) defined MRD negative status as < 10-[ADDRESS_1034185] negative rates according to IMWG definition, however for MR D-
adapted therapy we will utilize the more conservative approach of requiring confirmed (2 
consecutive tests) MRD negativity (  ≤ 10-5) to drive abbreviation and discontinuation of therapy.  
Functional imaging as FDG -PET scan can add to bone marrow -based MRD  testing by 
[CONTACT_755530] (22).  
While initial series using higher threshold for MRD detection indicated that MRD and 
cytogenetic abnormalities both contribute to post -remission prognosis (23, 24), more recent series 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE

cytogenetic risk classification (21, 25).  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1034187] ubiquitinated via the ubiquitin conjugation 
system.  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome by [CONTACT_755531]: a chymotrypsin -like activity, a trypsin -like activity, and a 
caspase -like activity.   
Carfilzomib (PR -171, Kyprolis® ) is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide -based inhibitor specific 
for the chymotrypsin -like active site of the 20S proteasome.  Carfilzomib is structurally and 
mechanistically distinct from the dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 
(Velcade®).  In addition, when measured against a broad panel of proteases including metallo, 
aspartyl, and serine proteases, carfilzomib demonstrated less reactivity against non -proteasomal 
proteases when compared to bortezomib (26, 27). 
Carfilzomib was initially approved in the US after demonstrating single agent activity in 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (28, 29), initially at the dose of 27 mg/m2 
on days 1,2,8,9 , 15 and 16 of each 28 -days cycle, with the dose being reduced to 20 mg/m2 on 
the first cycle.  
Subsequently, the dose of carfilzomib has been escalated in an attempt to improve anti -
myeloma activity. In a phase 1 study, the maximal tolerated dose of single agent carfilzomib was 
found to be 56 mg /m2 utilizing the traditional schedule and longer infus ion time (30 
minutes) (30). This regimen led to 55% overall response rate in an independent phase 2 trial of 
heavily pretreated patients (31). The toxicity profile of higher dose of carfilzomib was not clearly 
distinct from the initial dosing with the most common grades 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) being 
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia,  hypertension, pneumonia and heart failure.

bortezomib and carfilzomib , in patients with relapsed MM and 1 -3 prior lines of therapy (32). 
Bortezomib was administered by [CONTACT_6567] (79%) or intravenous (21%) routes and 
conventional schedule and doses  in combination with dexamethasone (Vd) . Carfilzomib was 
administered at convent ional schedule but in higher doses, 20 mg/m2 on days [ADDRESS_1034189] 
cycle and 56 mg/m2 thereafter  also in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) . Kd led to higher 
rate of response and median improvement in PFS by 9.3 months. Patients treated with Kd were 
more likely to develop grade 3 or higher heart failure (5% vs. 2%) but less likely to develop 
grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy (2% vs. 8%)  than patients treated with Vd . 
Investigators have also explored the use of higher doses of carfilzomib on a less  intense 
schedule, allowing for greater convenience. The Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 1 study explored weekly carfilzomib 
(i.e. days 1,8,15 of each 28 day cycle) as single agent and found the dose of 70 mg/m2 to be the 
maximum tolerated, leading to objective responses in 77% of patients with relapsed and 
refractory MM (33). More recently, the ARROW study compared weekly carfilzomib at 70 
mg/m2 with the traditional schedule at 27 mg/m2 in patients with relapsed and refractory MM and 
found the weekly dose to have similar safety profile and more prolonged progression -free 
survival (34).  
 
1.3.1 CARFILZOMIB COMBINATION WITH LENALIDOMI DE AND 
DEXAMETHASONE  
 
 
Prior phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the combination of 
lenalidomide  (revlimid®) , dexamethasone and carfilzomib in treating patients with rela psed 
myeloma (35). Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_755494] a large international phase 3 trial comparing this triple combination

28-days cycle at 20 mg/m2 on days [ADDRESS_1034190] cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter, reduced to 
days 1,2,[ADDRESS_1034191] in

of life. Patients randomized to KRd were more likely to develop hypertension (grade 3 or higher 
4.3% vs. 1.8%) and congestive heart failure (grade 3 or higher 3.8 vs 1.8%).

diagnosed MM producing 61% of stringent CR and 24 -month PFS rate of 92%  in one study (37). 
In another study including a subset of pa tients with smoldering MM, the combination of 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone led to 100% of VGPR or better. Importantly, 
among the 67% of patients who achieved MRD negative status by [CONTACT_077], none progressed in the 
first 12 months of therapy  (19). 
 
 
1.4 DARATUMUMAB  BACKGROUND  
 
Daratumumab is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed at CD38, a 
transmembrane protein that is overly expressed on plasma cells and malignant myeloma cells, 
while having low expression on normal lymphoid, myeloid, as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125]. (38) 
Functionally, daratumumab directly targets CD38 -expressing tumor cells and promotes antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement -
dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. (39) Preclinical data has demonstrated robust  antitumor 
activity in xenograft models, including those with lenalidomide and bortez omib resistant cell 
lines. (39) Daratumumab (Dar zalex®) is approved for treatment of relapsed MM, or newly 
diagnosed  transplant ineligible  MM, in combination w ith bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone . 
 
1.4.1 DARATUMUMAB SINGLE AGENT  
 
The phase 1/2 GEN501 study of daratumumab monotherapy enrolled consecutive cohorts 
receiving daratumumab from 0.005 to 24 mg/kg/dose (40) and identified 16mg/kg as the ideal 
dose with main toxicity being infusion -related events (IREs), mostly pyrexia, cough, dizziness, 
and bronchospasm. Efficacy was reported for the doses of 8mg/kg and 16 mg/kg and patients 
receivin g the 16mg/kg dose had improved ORR (36%) and PFS (5.6 months) compared with the 
8mg/kg.  
The MMY2002 “Sirius” study randomized patients with 3 or more prior lines of therapy 
including a PI [INVESTIGATOR_755495] -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 30 of 126 daratumumab at either 8mg/kg or 16 mg/kg every week for 8 weeks , then every other week for 
16 weeks and every week afterwards. Overall 106 patients w ere accrued to the 16 mg/kg arm. 
IREs were seen in 42% of patients, mostly during first infusion. In the 16 mg/kg arm the overall 
response rate was 29.2% and median duration of response was 7.4 months (41). 
1.4.2 DARATUMUMAB COMBINATION S 
 
In the phase 1/2 GEN 503 study, patients with relapsed MM received daratumumab in 
combination with l enalidomide and dexamethasone. Among the 32 patients who received 
daratumumab at 16mg/kg , the ORR was 88%, with 53% reaching VGPR or better. Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia was seen in 75% of subjects, but febrile neutropenia was uncommon. IREs occurred 
in 56% of patients with only 6% being grade 3 (38).  
The synergistic effect of daratumumab and IMiDs was further demonstrated with the 
combination of daratum umab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in [ADDRESS_1034193] 2 
prior lines of therapy including prior treatment with lenalidomide and bortezomib. IREs occurred 
at a rate (61%) similar to daratumumab single agent or in combination with lenalidomide and  
dexamethasone. Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity (55%). Objective 
responses were seen in 59% of patients, including 58% of the double refractory patients (42).  
Two randomized phase [ADDRESS_1034194] further solidified the benefit of daratumumab 
combinations with IMIDs or with PI. In the CASTOR tr ial patients with relapsed and refractory 
MM were randomized to receive bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without the addition of 
daratumumab. The rate of VGPR or better was higher in the daratumumab arm (59.2% vs. 
29.1%, P<0.001) as was median progress ion-free survival (not reached vs. 7.2 months, HR 0.39, 
P<0.001 (43). Using an IMID backbone, The POLLUX trial randomized  patients with relaps ed 
MM and at least one prior line of therapy to receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with or 
without daratumumab. The rate of VGPR or better was higher in the daratumumab arm (75.8% 
vs. 44.2%)  and media progression -free survival was not reached for the daratumumab arm vs. 
18.4 months in the control group (HR 0.37, P<0.001) (44) 
1.[ADDRESS_1034195] (sCR at 18 months 87% vs. 
55%) (45). There is limited overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_755496]. Additionally, there is strong evidence of synergism between daratumumab and IMiDs. We 
therefore hypothesize  that the combination of KRd plus daratumumab (KRdD), particularly in 
combination with auto -HCT, will be safe and lead to deep remission in a large proportion of 
patients with newly diagnosed MM. In fact, a phase 1 study has explored the use of KRdD in 
newly diagnosed MM patients and found the combination to be safe and highly active (46).    
Similar to the paradigm established in other  hematologic malignancies that are 
considered curable, the achievement of MRD( -) status is necessary for long term disease control 
in MM. Patients with sustained MRD( -) status may be able to undergo more abbreviated 
treatment and safely discontinue therapy  without disease recurrence, while patients who remain 
MRD(+) are more likely to benefit from continuous therapy.  
Therefore , this study assesses the safety and efficacy of induction therapy with KRdD, 
followed by [CONTACT_331437] -HCT and post-transplant  KRdD consolid ation , with duration of therapy 
determined by [CONTACT_755532]( -) status , and treatment discontinuation in  confirmed  MRD 
(-) patients. Since continuous therapy is considered the current standard of care for patients with 
newly diagnosed MM, the study wil l assess the feasibility of monitoring for MRD resurgence 
(≥10-5) on confirmed  MRD(-) patients off therapy providing the opportunity for those subjects to 
proceed with SOC maintenance lenalidomide if resurgence of MRD.

3.1.1 INDUCTION THERAPY  
The maximal tolerated dose of weekly carfilzomib when administered in combination 
with dexamethasone, lenalidomide and daratumumab has not been determined. The dose of 
56mg/m2 was chosen as a one level dose reduction from the dose of carfilzomib utilized as single 
agent in the ARROW trial, therefore accounting for the possib ility of added toxicity when 
carfilzomib is used in combination (34).  
Therefore, upon approval of PA2  6 subjects were  enrolled in a safety lead in cohort that

cells for identification of myeloma -specific sequences in IGH -VDJ, IDH -DJ and/or IGK. During 
screening a fresh bone marrow sample or archive, non -stained bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_755499]  (“ID 
sample”)  will be sent to Adaptive biotechnologies  to be assessed for the presence of myeloma -
speci fic sequences.  
For all samples with MRD assessment, MRD will be reported quantitatively as 
proportion of multiple myeloma -associated sequences. For treatment assignment and clinical 
trial outcome reporting, we will consi der MRD( -) if the burden of MM -assoc iated molecules  is < 
10-5. 
Subjects who achieve  confirmed  MRD( -) status with < 10-5 MM associated molecules 
during consolidation will undergo FDG PET/CT scan prior to starting the active surveillance 
phase in the  MRD( -) cohort. FDG PET/CT will be interpre ted by [CONTACT_755536] -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE

6.1 DRUG PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION   
6.1.1 CARFILZOMIB  
 
• Carfilzomib for Injection is supplied as a lyophilized parenteral product in single -use vials. 
The lyophilized product is reconstituted with Water for Injection to a final carfilzomib 
concentration of 2 mg/mL prior to administration.  The dose will be calculated using the 
subject’s actual BSA at ba seline.  Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based 
upon a 2.2 m2 BSA.   
• At the discretion  of the investigator, patients thought to be at particularly high risk for the 
development of TLS, based on high tumor burden , oral  hydration  will be enco uraged , at least 
48 hours before each dose of carfilzomib  (6 to 8 cups of liquid per day) continuing up to the 
time of treatment.   
• IV hydration will  be given immediately prior to carfilzomib.  This will consist of [ADDRESS_1034231] urine output (eg, ≥ 2 L/day).  Subjects should be monitored periodically 
during this period for evidence of fluid overload . On the days the subject receives both 
daratumumab and carf ilzomib, the infusion of daratumumab will replace the hydration to be 
given prior to carfilzomib . 
• If the subject has a dedicated line for carfilzomib administration, the line must be flushed 
with a minimum of 20  mL of normal saline prior to and after drug administration.     
• Carfilzomib will be given as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes  (±10 minutes) . 
The dose will be administered at a facility capable of managin g hypersensitivity reactions.   
• Carfilzomib will be provided by [CONTACT_11337] .

6.3 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
• A “first dose effect” has been seen with carfilzomib, which is notable for fever, chills, rigors, 
and/or dyspnea occurring during the evening following the first day of infusion and an 
increase in cr eatinine on the following day, which may be the clinical sequelae of rapid 
tumor lysis and/or cytokine release.    
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 63 of 126 • Carfilzomib will be generally administered on the same day of daratumumab administration. 
Carfilzomib should be administered after completion  of daratumumab administration. 
Therefore, subjects will have received [ADDRESS_1034250] 4 mg IV will be ad ministered prior to carfilzomib.  
• Should a “first dose  carfilzomib  effect” occur,  treatment with high dose glucocorticoids (e.g. 
methylprednisolone 50 –100 mg) is recommended.  In addition, intravenous fluids, 
vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, and acet aminophen should be available for immediate 
use and instituted, as medically indicated.  
• CrCl changes induced by [CONTACT_755542], reversible, and non -cumulative. 
All subjects should be well hydrated.  Clinically significant electrolyte abn ormalities should 
be corrected prior to dosing with carfilzomib. Renal function must be monitored closely 
during treatment with carfilzomib.  Serum chemistry values, including creatinine, must be 
obtained and reviewed prior to each dose of carfilzomib. Car filzomib must be held for 
subjects with a CrCl < 15 mL/min at any time during study participation.  
• Carfilzomib is associated with increased risk of cardiac events that are, at least in part, linked 
to increase in blood pressure. Intense blood pressure monitoring is required for patients being 
treated with carfilzomib. All subjects will receive a blood pressure monitoring log where 
daily blood pressure measurements will be recorded. The log will be reviewed at each 
clinical visit and hypertensio n will be actively managed by [CONTACT_093]  
• Subjects with active or suspected infection of any kind that required systemic treatment 
should not be dosed with carfilzomib , lenalidomide or daratumumab  until the infection has 
resolved (and preferentially the course of antibiotics has been completed ).  
• Carfilzomib treatment can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation sometimes 
requiring the use of antiemetic or antidiarrheal medications.  Fluid and electrolyte 
replacement should be administered to prevent dehydration.  
• Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, can cause limb abnormalities. If lenalidomide is used 
during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo -fetal death. Pregnancy must be 
excluded before start of treatment.  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 64 of 126 • Lenalidomide is assoc iated with increase in risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism. 
Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_755502].  
• Lenalidomide can impair stem cell mobilization. Stem cell collection is recommended after 
no more than 4 cycles of therapy containing lenalidomide for subjects who are consider 
adequate candidates for hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.  
• Daratumumab is associated with risk of infusion -related reactions  (mostly fever, cough, 
dizziness, bronchospasm)  in approxi mately 40% of patients. These reactions are mostly 
grades [ADDRESS_1034251] infusion. See guidelines for management of 
daratumumab infusion -related reactions in  6.3.2 . 
• The treatment with melphalan as outlined in this protocol constitutes stand ard of care. The 
dose of 200mg/m2 of melphalan is myeloablative, therefore subjects are expected to develop 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia requiring transfusion, grade 4 neutropenia with near 100% risk of 
neutropenic fever and anemia requiring transfusion of red  blood cells.  
• Melphalan at the doses employed in this protocol will cause nausea, vomiting and mucositis 
manifested mostly as oral pain, dysphagia and diarrhea. Subjects will receive antiemetic and 
antidiarrheal  medications according to institutional guidelines.  
6.3.1 GUIDELINES FOR MONITORING, PROPHYLAXIS, AND TREATMENT OF 
TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME (TLS)  
 
TLS, which may be associated with multiorgan failure, has been observed in some 
patients with MM who have been treated with carfilzomib , lenalidomide and dexamethasone, 
alone or in combination, during first or second cycles of therapy .  
 
The following safety measures are mandatory for all subjects.  In  addition, MM subjects 
with high tumor burden (e.g., Durie -Salmon or ISS  Stage II/III) or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_88150] M -protein 
or light chains or compromised renal function (CrCl < 50 mL/min) should be considered  to be at 
particularly high risk. Please see section  6.1.1  for hydration requirements.

MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 65 of 126 Appropriate c hemistries, including creatinine and complete blood counts (CBC) with 
platelet count, should be obtained and reviewed prior to carfilzomib dosing.  Results of 
laboratory studies must be reviewed and deemed acceptable prior to administering the 
carfilzomib dose.  Subjects with laboratory abnormalities consistent with lysis of tumor cells 
(e.g., serum creatinine ≥ 50% increase, LDH ≥ 2 -fold increase, uric acid ≥ 50% increase, 
phosphate ≥ 50% increase, potassium ≥ 30% increase, calcium ≥ 20% decrease) prior to  dosing 
should not receive the scheduled dose.  Subjects with such abnormalities should be re -evaluated 
again within the next 24 hours (or sooner, if clinically indicated) and then periodically as 
clinically indicated.    
[IP_ADDRESS]   Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrom e 
 
If TLS occurs, cardiac rhythm, fluid, and serial laboratory monitoring should be 
instituted.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and 
administer therapeutic and supportive care, including dialysis, as clinically indicated.  
All cases of TLS must be reported to [COMPANY_010]  as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) through 
the normal process within 24  hours of the clinical site becoming aware of the event.  
 
 
6.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR MONITORING, PROPHYLAXIS, AND TREATMENT OF 
DARATUMUMAB INFUSION -RELATED REACTION (IRR)  
 
Daratumumab infusion -related reactions occur in approximately 40% of patients 
receiving first dose of daratumumab. Most reactions are grade [ADDRESS_1034252] occurred.  
Common manifestations of IRR are pyrexia, cough, bronchospasm, dizziness,  urticaria

[IP_ADDRESS]  Prevention  
All patients receiving daratumumab will receive preinfusion medication consisting  of: 
• Dexamethasone 20 mg IV;  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 66 of 126 • Acetaminophen  650 to 1000 mg PO  
• Antihistamine given IV or PO (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).  
• Montelukast 10 mg PO the day before and day of infusion.  
For subjects with a higher risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], the following postinfusion 
medications should be considered:  
• Antihistamine given IV or PO (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent) on 
the first and second day after all the i nfusions  
• Short -acting beta 2 adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutamol aerosol.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of infusion -related reactions  
 
Subjects should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff 
at the  clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of any infusion reactions, and resources 
necessary  for resuscitation (eg, agents such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_117045], also 
medical  equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) mus t be 
available  at bedside. Attention to staffing should be considered when multiple subjects will be 
dosed at the  same time.  If an infusion -related reaction develops, then the infusion should be 
temporarily interrupted or  slowed down. Subjects who experien ce adverse events during the 
infusion must be treated  according to the investigator’s judgment and best clinical practice. The 
following guidelines  apply:  
• Subjects should be treated with acetaminophen, antihistamine, or corticosteroids 
as needed.  Intraveno us saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria , or 
dyspnea, subjects may  require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids, or 
bronchodilators. For hypotension,  subjects may require vasopressors.  
• In the event of a life -threatening infusion -related r eaction (which may include 
pulmonary or  cardiac events) or anaphylactic reaction, daratumumab should be 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February [ADDRESS_1034253]. Aggressive symptomatic  treatment should be applied.  
• If an infusion is paused or the infusion rate is decreased, then a longer -than-
anticipated  infusion time may occur. Overnight stays at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755503].  
• For IRR grades [ADDRESS_1034254]’s condition is stable, the infusion may be restarted at the  investigator’s 
discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that employed before  
the interruption. Subsequently, the infusion rate m ay be increased at the 
investigator’s discretion.  If the subject experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_1034255] be withdrawn from treatment.   
• For IRR grade [ADDRESS_1034256] be 
observed carefully until resolution of the adverse event. If the intensity of  the 
adverse event decreases to Grade 1 or 2 w ithin 2 hours, then the infusion may be 
restarted at  the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be

An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current IB or prescribing information for a marketed compound.   Also, 
reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented AE constitute unexpected AEs.   For example, an event more specific or more severe 
than described in the IB would be considered “unexpected”.    
Whenever possible, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 should be used  to describe the event and for assessing the severity of AEs (see 
Appendix  A).  Any events representing a change in the CTCAE Grade need to be reported on the 
AE case report form.  This includes any change in laboratory values.   
For AEs not adequately add ressed in the CTCAE, the severity Table  10 below may be 
used:

of the subject’s medical history.  
9.4 CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
Using the following c riteria, the relationship of the AE to the study drug should be assessed as 
follows:   
Yes:  The event is suspected to be related if:  
• there is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration 
of study treatment; and/or  
• there  is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study treatment to cause or contribute 
to the AE; and/or  
• the event responds to withdrawal of the study medication (dechallenge) and/or recurs 
with rechallenge (when clinically feasible); and/or  
• the AE cannot be reasonably attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures  
No:  
• the AE is more likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, underlying disease, 
concomitant medication, study or non -study procedure; and/or  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE

All AEs (e.g., any new event or worsening in severity or frequency of a pre -existing 
condition or laboratory finding) with an onset date after the subject signs consent for study 
participation must be promptly documented on the appropriate summary.  Details of the event 
must include severity, relationship to stu dy drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.  Serious 
adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the appropriate form.  
 
All AEs that are considered related to study drug must be followed to resolution or 
stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
 
AEs should be reported from the time the subject signs consent through [ADDRESS_1034276]’ s source document.  AEs continuing at [ADDRESS_1034277] ensure 
that these Sub -investigators are qualified to perform these duties under the supervision of the

A serious adverse event (SAE) based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death  
• Is life -threatening  
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific ju dgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually be considered serious.  
Any death for any reason occurring within [ADDRESS_1034278] be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43716]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] 
(e.g., social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755511]. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of 
the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.]  
• [For convenience the investigator may choose to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755512] t he treatment period.]  
 
9.8.2 LIFE -THREATENING CONDITIONS   
 
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event 
term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of 
efficacy will b e reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition.

versus the alternative that P>=0. 75, there is 69% probability  of early termination  if P=P0 .  If the 
trial goes on to the second stage, an additional 4 0 evaluable patients (total of 6 7 evaluable

equal to 46, the intervention will be considered futile. By [CONTACT_251948] ~20% of either patients 
drop out or subjects not informative for MRD, a total of 82 eligible patients will be required.  The

Upon  approval of protocol ammendment #4, the trial will be expanded to include a total 
of 123 patients (therefore 41 patients in addition to the 82 patients anticipated in original 
protocol and amendments 1, 2 and 3) in order to enable the exploratory objectiv e. Accrual will 
only continue if the study does not meet criteria for futility upon completion of Simon’s 
second stage (i.e. [ADDRESS_1034299] evaluable  patients ).    
 
The explo ratory objective is to describe progression -free survival (PFS)of high -risk [HR; 
i.e. myeloma cells harboring del17p or t(4;14) or t(14;16) ]and standard risk (SR) patients 
reaching confirmed MRD negative status (10-5) and  discontinuing therapy. High-risk patients 
account for a minority subset of patients with NDMM (currently at 27.5% in this study, 15 -20% 
in most trials for NDMM) and are also less likely to achieve MRD negative status upon therapy. 
Therefore, in order to f ulfill the exploratory objective of the study, some enrichment of the 
cohort for high -risk patients is necessary. In order to estimate the optimal accrual of HR and SR 
patients we assumed the rate of MRD evaluable patients to be 95% (consistent with curren t 
findings), the proportion of SR patients who achieve confirmed MRD negative status to be 85% 
and the proportion of HR  patients who achieve confirmed MRD negative status to be 75%. 
Different scenarios utilizing these parameters are displayed in Table 11.  The scenario with 65% 
patients evaluable for exploratory objective being SR and 35% being HR patients provides the 
best balance between HR enrichment and duration of enrollment. This scenario anticipates a total 
of 77 SR and 46 HR patients being accrued  (Figure below) so effectively 37.4% of accrued 
patients being HR  (46/123) to yield [ADDRESS_1034300] negative 
status and evaluable for exploratory objective.

Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the inte rval from the start of therapy to the earlier 
of the following events: documentation of objective disease progression  (appendix B), initiation 
of any non -protocol anti -myeloma therapy with exception of single agent lenalidomide in dose 
up to 15 mg/day (acc epted maintenance therapy)  or death from any cause. For the exploratory 
objective of describing PFS for patients with confirmed MRD negative status who discontinue 
therapy, PFS will be defined as the interval from discontinuation of therapy (and initiation  of 
observation) until the earliest of the following events:  documentation of objective disease 
progression  (appendix B), initiation of any anti -myeloma therapy or death from any cause.  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate the event -free curves an d corresponding qua rtiles

Response category  Criteria  
Stringent complete  
response (sCR)    
 • CR as defined below plus all of the following  
• Normal serum FLC ratio   
• Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_755564] (CR)  • Negative immunofixation of the serum and 
urine   
• If only the measurable non -bone marrow 
parameter was  FLC,  
normalization of FLC ratio  
• < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow   
• Disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas.  
 
Very good partial  
response (VGPR)  • PR as defined below plus all of the following:  
• Serum and urine M -component detectable by 
[CONTACT_755565]  
• If at on study, serum measurable, ≥ 90% or 
greater reduction in serum M -  
comp onent   
• Urine M -component <100 mg per 24 hour  
Partial response (PR)  One of the following:  
• If serum and urine measurable, ≥ 50% 
reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 
24-hour urinary M -protein by ≥ 90% or to < 200 
mg per 24 hour.  
• If only serum  measurable (but urine not), a ≥ 
50% reduction of serum M -protein.  
• If urine measurable (but serum not), a 
reduction in 24 -hour urinary M -protein by ≥ 
90% or to < 200 mg per 24 hour.  
• If only the measurable non -bone marrow 
parameter was  FLC, a ≥ 50% dec rease in the 
difference between involved and uninvolved 
FLC  
levels  or a 50% decrease in level of involved 
FLC with 50% decrease in ratio  
• If the bone marrow was only measurable 
parameter, ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow 
plasma cells is required in place  of M -protein,  
provided baseline percentage was ≥ 30%  
• In addition to the above criteria, if  a 
plasmacytoma is present at baseline, ≥  
50% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.

Progressive Disease (PD)  Increase of 25% from lowest response value in 
any of the following:  
• Serum M -component (absolute increase must 
be > 0.5 g/dL), and/or  
• Urine M -component (absolute increase must 
be > 200mg/24 h), and/or  
• Only in patients without measureable serum 
and urine M -protein levels: the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels 
(absolute increase must be > 10mg/dL)  
• Only in patients without measureable serum 
and urine M protein levels and with out 
measurable disease by [CONTACT_64391], bone marrow 
PC percentage (absolute percentage must be 
10%)  
• Definite development of new bone lesions or 
soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in 
the size of existing bone lesions or soft  
tissue plasmacytomas  
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected 
serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL) that can be  
attributed solely to the PC proliferative disorder

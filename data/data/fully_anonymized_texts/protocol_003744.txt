 SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_836386]  (ACP)  video decision support tool for  improving patients’ knowledge 
regarding their goals of care options and end of life (EOL) decision -making in patients with end-
stage liver d isease (ESLD).  
 
Aim 1:  To assess the feasibility and acceptability of an ACP video decision support tool for 
patients with ESLD  
• Hypothesis 1: The intervention will be deemed feasible  and acceptable  if at least 6 0% of 
eligible patients are enrolled in the study  and if at least 60% of patients randomly assigned 
to the video intervention report that the video is acceptable  
 
Aim 2: To assess the impact of an ACP video decision support tool on patients’ knowledge about 
their EOL care options  
• Hypothesis 2: Patients randomly assigned to the video intervention will report  improved 
knowledge of their EOL care options compared to those randomized to the verbal narrative 
control   
 
Aim 3: To assess the impact of an ACP video decision support tool on patients’ preferences for 
EOL care  
• Hypothesis 3 : Patients randomly assigned t o the ACP video will be more likely to prefer  
comfort care  compared to those randomized to the verbal narrative control arm   
  
• Hypothesis 4 : Patients  randomly assigned to the video intervention will be more likely to 
forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intubation compared to those randomized 
to the verbal narrative control arm   
 
Aim 4: To assess the impact of an ACP video decision support tool on patients’ documented EOL 
care preferences  
• Hypothes is 5: Patients randomly assigned to the video intervention will be more likely to 
have their code status documented in the electronic healthcare record compared to those 
randomized to the verbal narrative control arm  
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   
 
End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is a terminal condition for which liver transplantation is the only 
cure. Heralded by [CONTACT_836405], variceal bleeding, 
hepatic encephalopathy , or jaundice in patients with cirrhos is, ESLD is a state of limited life 
expectancy, with a median transplant -free survival of two years. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of 
ESLD is a terminal one for thousands of patients annually who are deemed ineligible for liver 
transplantation due to signif icant comorbid disease, substance use disorder, inadequate social 
support, or advanced age. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_836387], patients with ESLD who are non -
transplant candidates still receive aggressive medical care at the end of life (EOL). While mo st 
patients prefer to die at home, these patients are frequently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836388]

Patients with End -Stage Liver Disease  
Version 9: February 6, [ADDRESS_1161191] high rates of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].1-5 Furthermore, these patients often receive 
aggressive life -sustaining therapi[INVESTIGATOR_836389], such as 
cardiopulmonary r esuscitation (CPR) and intubation.6,7 The Institute of Medicine report, Dying in 
America, highlighted substantial deficiencies in EOL care for patients with serious illness and 
identified intensive and costly care at the EOL as poor -quality care given its burden on patients, 
families, and the health care system.8 Thus, there is a critical need to optimize the quality of EOL 
care for patients with ESLD who are not transplant candidates given their terminal diagnosis, poor 
prognosis, and the frequency with which they receive intensive and  costly medical care at EOL.  
 
Advance care planning (ACP) is the process by [CONTACT_836406].9-[ADDRESS_1161192] shown that patients with life -limiting illnesses who discuss their EOL care preferences with 
their clinicians are less likely to opt for aggressive medical interventions.18-23 Unfortunately, one 
retrospective analysis showed that only a minority (28 %) of patients with ESLD ineligible for liver 
transplantation had documented advanced directives.[ADDRESS_1161193] for this population, with rates of survival  
ranging from 0% to 16%.25-[ADDRESS_1161194] receive accurate and understandable information about their medical options to make 
informed dec isions about the care they would prefer to receive at the EOL.9,10 However, verbal 
communication strategies do not effectively inform patients of their EOL care options as they are 
often too complex for patients to comprehend.9-11,30 -34 Patients frequently find it difficult to 
realistically envision care in the intensive care unit (ICU) or medical procedures such as CPR and 
intubation, especially given the variability in the quality of communication between patients and 
their clinicians.9-11,30 -37 Videos can enhance p atients’ comprehension of complex health 
information by [CONTACT_836407], such as CPR and intubation.38,39 A video decision support tool offers an innovative 
strategy to educate transplant -ineligible patients with E SLD about CPR and intubation in order to 
empower them to make informed decisions regarding their EOL care.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Study Design and Schema:   
 
Our proposed project is a single -center  randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility , 
acceptability  and preliminary efficacy of an ACP  video decision support tool versus a verbal 
narrative alone on EOL care preferences in transplant ineligible patients with ESLD in the 
outpatient setti ng. We will recruit up to 70 consecutive patients with ESLD who receive 
ambulatory care at the MGH Liver Center for this study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 
fashion (Figure 1) . To ensure that patients in this sample received longitudinal care (ruli ng out

 those being seen for second -opi[INVESTIGATOR_836390]), we will only include those patients who have 
had two or more visits to the MGH Liver Center.  
 
Eligibility Criteria  
 
Our proposed project is a single -center  randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, 
acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an ACP video decision support tool versus a verbal 
narrative alone on EOL care preferences in transplant ineligible patients with ESLD. We will 
recruit up to 70 consecutive adult patients with ESLD who receive care at MGH for this study. 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion (see Schema for further details) .  
 
Eligibility Criteria  
 
All patients with ESLD who are ≥ [ADDRESS_1161195] one of the following clinically -evident  decompensating events: 1) ascites; 
2) hepatic encephalopathy; or 3) history of gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage  - which portends 
a poor prognosis.[ADDRESS_1161196] or the inpatient hepatology consult service attending will be eligible for this 
study as this is a patient population for whom the diagnosis of ESLD is a terminal one.  
 
Patients I nclusion Criteria:   
1. ≥ [ADDRESS_1161197] either 1) primary hepatologist at the MGH Liver Center or an MGH -
affiliated primary care physician, or 2) a previous inpatient admission at MGH  
3. Deemed ineligibl e for liver transplantation as determined by [CONTACT_836408]  
4. Ability to communicate in English and provide informed consent  
5. A score ≥ 7 on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire41 (Appendix A)  
 
Patients Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Severe hepatic encephalopathy which the primary hepatologist or the inpatient hepatology 
consult service attending believes prohibits informed consent or participation in the study  
2. Significant uncontrolled psychiatric disorders (psychotic disorder, bipola r disorder, major 
depression) or other co -morbid disease (dementia, cognitive impairment), which the 
primary hepatologist believes prohibits informed consent or participation in the study  
3. Prior history of liver transplantation  
4. Patient has been referred to  or enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]  
5. Patient has been referred to palliative care  
 
We have limited enrollment to patients able to comprehend English, as the video is only available 
in English at this time. If the intervention is effective in improving advance car e planning and the 
delivery of EOL care for patients with ESLD, we will develop videos in additional languages for 
future trials.

Patient Screening, Recruitment, and Enrollment Procedures  
 
The research assistant (RA) will recruit patients with ESLD from the inpatient units at MGH or 
outpatient clinics at the MGH Liver Center. The RA will be trained by [CONTACT_458] 
(PI, a gastroenterologist) to screen patients based on the eligibility criteria. The RA will be 
responsible for reviewing the inpatient hepatology consultation list , general medicine floors,  and 
the outpatient MGH Liver Unit clinic schedule on  a daily basis to ensure that we capture all 
potentially eligible patients for study participation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_836391] a daily basis 
to answer any screening questions regarding patients’ eligibility. We have utilized these 
procedures in pri or trials of patients with ESLD to identify all potentially eligible subjects.42,[ADDRESS_1161198] in the outpatient setting , or the  medicine  attending  and responding clinician  in the 
inpatient settin g (as well as the hepatology consult service if available)  to notify them that their 
patient is eligible for study participation and inquire about any concerns regarding their 
particpi[INVESTIGATOR_818687]. If the clinician s have objections to their patients’ participation in the study, we will 
document the reason and not approach those individuals. If the clinicians do not have objections 
to their patients’ participation in the study, we will ask the attendings to introduce  the study to the 
eligible patient to obtain permission for the study staff to approach the patient. After obtaining 
permission from the primary hepatologist,  inpatient hepatology consult attending and/or medicine 
attending,  the RA will review the consent form with potential participants which will detail the 
nature of the study procedures. When obtaining informed consent, the RA will describe the goal Screening

 of the study: to better understand how much patients with ESLD know about  ACP and EOL care 
preferences . The RA will also explain that the study requires completing a 15 -minute baseline 
questionnaire asking participants about their CPR and intubation preferences, eliciting prior 
advance care planning discussions, and assessing their knowledge regarding CPR and intubation. 
The RA will undergo standardized training in all aspects of the research protocol, including the 
use of structured scripts t o administer the questionnaires  (Appendix A) . For patients agreeing to 
participate in the study, t he RA will obtain written informed consent from the participants and 
provide them with a copy of the signed consent form.  
 
After obtaining informed consent, the RA will administer the Short Portal Mental Status 
Questionnaire (Appendix B) to participants to confirm fi nal eligibility. Immediately following 
enrollment, the RA will administer a 15-minute baseline questionnaire (see “Study Measures” 
below) that will include the following: demographics, self -reported health status, baseline EOL 
care preferences, CPR and i ntubation preferences, and a questionnaire assessing patients’ 
knowledge of EOL care  options.  
 
Randomization  
 
After enrollment and completion of the baseline questionnaires, participants will be randomized  
in 1:1 fashion without any stratification  to either the control group (verbal narrative alone) or the 
intervention group (video decision support tool) using a random computed generated list, with 
assignments concealed in numbered envelops.  
 
The Intervent ion Arm  
 
Our group, the VIDEO Consortium (Video Images of Disease for Ethical Outcomes), has 
developed several video decision support tools to assist patients with advance care planning.38,39,[ADDRESS_1161199] previously developed a five -minute advance care planning video for patients with 
advanced cancer45, which has been adapted for this study.  
 
We convened a panel of clinicians with exp ertise in hepatology, critical care, palliative care, 
medical ethics, and decision -making at our institution to develop a verbal narrative introducing the 
patient to advance care planning, a 3 -part goals of care framework (life -prolonging care, limited 
medical care, and comfort care), and a description of medical procedures such as CPR and 
intubation that will outline the process, risks, and likelihood of successful resuscitation in patients 
with ESLD. This panel drafted and edit this narrative in an iterat ive process, which serves as the 
verbal script for our video decision support tool and the verbal narrative for our control group 
(Appendix C). These experts also offered feedback about the representation of medical 
interventions, such as what care in the ICU is like and what CPR and intubation look like.  
 
We designed the video to provide non -medical trained individuals a general understanding of the 
types of medical care patients may receive at the EOL and a description of medical interventions 
such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ICU admission, CPR, and intubation. T he video begins by [CONTACT_836409]’s personal goals and perspectives by [CONTACT_836410]. The physician narrator then

Patients with End -Stage Liver Disease  
Version 9: February 6, 2020                       7 
 introduces a framewor k for choices of medical care at the EOL including: 1) life -prolonging care; 
2) limited  medical care; and 3) comfort care. The visual images illustrating life -prolonging care 
include interventions that are available in a modern -day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836392], me chanical 
ventilation, and treatment in the ICU. Scenes include an ICU with a ventilated patient being tended 
to by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_46175], a simulated code conducted with clinicians illustrating chest 
compressions, CPR and intubation, and the administratio n of medications through a central venous 
catheter. For the second option, limited  medical care, the narrator explains the goal of care is to 
pursue treatment for medical conditions, but avoid intensive medical interventions at the EOL. 
This type of care w ould include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], intravenous medications, and antibiotics, but not 
CPR or ICU care. Visual images include a patient getting medicine via a peripheral venous 
catheter, scenes from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_836393], and a patient wearing a nasal cannula to r eceive 
oxygen and breathing treatments. For the third option, comfort care, the narrator describes the goal 
of care as relieving symptoms and utilizing medical care that would only be used to provide 
comfort. Visual images include a patient on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836394], a 
patient with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_836395], and an attendant assisting a patient 
with self -care. All three sequences of video images accompanying the narration attempt to help 
the viewer imagine the experience and likely outcomes of receiving these medical interventions at 
the EOL . The video was filmed and edited by [CONTACT_836411] a candid realism in the style known as cinema verité . All pat ients 
included in the video (or their proxies) gave consent to be filmed.  
 
Immediately after completing the baseline assessment and randomization, patients assigned to the 
video intervention arm will view the [ADDRESS_1161200]

The Control Arm  
 
Immediately after completing the baseline assessment and randomization, patients assigned to the 
verbal narrative control arm will listen to the same description of the 3 goals of care used in the 
video arm read out loud by [CONTACT_21118] (Appendix C). We will use standardized procedures to 
minimize interaction between the RA and patients during the interview. Specifically, the RA will 
not be permitted to comment or answer questions while the patients listen to the verbal narrative. 
Patients will be inst ructed to ask their physicians any questions they may have about goals of care.  
 
Study Measures

Patients with End -Stage Liver Disease  
Version 9: February 6, 2020                       8 
 We will administer the following study measures at baseline prior to randomization, and 
immediately after the video or verbal narrative in the intervention an d control group, respectively 
according to the timeline displayed in Table 1 :  
• Demographics: Patients will complete a demographic questionnaire at baseline detailing 
their age, sex, race/ethnicity, religion, relationship status, educational level, living 
situation, employment status , and self -reported health status ( “Relatively healthy”, 
“Relatively healthy and terminally ill”, “Seriously ill and not terminally ill”, “Seriously 
ill and terminally ill” )46 (Appendix D)  
• EOL Care Preferences: Patients will report their EOL care  preferences as follows: life -
prolonging care, limited medical care, comfort care, or unsure.  (Appendix E)  
• CPR Preferences: Patients will report their CPR preferences as follows: “Yes, attempt 
CPR”, “No, do not attempt CPR”, or “Not sure .” (Appendix E)  
• Intubation Preferences: Patients will report their intubation preferences as follows: “Yes, 
attempt intubation”, “No, do not attempt intubation”, or “Not sure .” (Appendix E)  
• Knowledge Questionnaire: We will assess patients’ knowledge of goals of care as in 
previous studies using 5 true/false questions and 1 multiple choice question, each worth 1 
point, for a summary score of 0 to 6 (higher score reflects greater knowledge)45,47,48 
(Appendix F)  
• Acceptability of the Video: For the video intervention arm alone, we will administer 3 -
items assessing patients’ comfort with watching the video, whether they find the video 
helpful in their understanding of the EOL care  options, and whether they would 
recommend it to others.49 (Appendix G)  
 
We will also obtain the following important covariates and outcomes:  
• Disease -related varia bles: We wi ll collect variables from the EH R at the time of 
enrollment, including the etiology of ESLD, presence of clinically -evident 
decompensating events (ascites, esophageal variceal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, or 
multiple), Model of End -Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD -Na) score, reason for  
transplant ineligibility, and clinical comorbidities using the modified Charlson 
Comorbidity Index.50   
• Code Status Documentation in the EMR:  The RA will review the EHR  to collect whether 
clinicians’ documented patients’ code status in the EMR (yes : documented, no : not 
documented) 3 months after study enrollment.

We will collect and enter all patient data electronically using Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap). The REDCap Survey is a tool for building and managing online surveys. Vanderbilt 
University, in collaboration with a consortium of institutional partners, has developed this software 
and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and cl inical trial 
data. Our research team has extensive experience using REDCap and will create and design the 
surveys in a web browser, with institutional information technology support. The REDCap Survey 
system offers secure, HIPAA compliant, web -based applic ations that provide an intuitive interface 
for participants to enter data, with real -time validation rules at the time of entry.  
 
Participants will use tablet computers to complete questionnaires in clinic. If any participants 
refuse or are unable to complete the questionnaires on the computer, they will be permitted to use 
hard-copy paper versions. In addition, the patient data collected from the electronic health record 
will be abstracted throughout the study and directly inputted into REDCap.  
 
Study Outcomes  
• Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is feasibility. The proposed video  intervention 
will be deemed feasible if at least 60% of eligible patients are enrolled in the study . The 
60% feasibility cut -off is commonly used in behavioral intervent ion studies.51-53 
• Secondary Outcomes: The secondary outcomes will include patients’ comfort/satisfaction 
with the video, patients’ stated post -intervention EOL care  preferences categorized as four 
options: Life -prolonging care, limited medical care, comfort care, or unsure; individual 
preferences for CPR an d intubation before and after intervention in the verbal narrative and 
video groups; and change in knowledge scores after receiving the verbal narrative or video  
 
Sample Size Calculation  
 
We will randomize up to [ADDRESS_1161202] size and adequately 
power future randomi zed trials. This is a commonly utilized study design for pi[INVESTIGATOR_836396]. While the feasibility of the intervention can be assessed u sing a single -
arm design, preliminary efficacy is better assessed utilizing a control group as we are proposing in 
this trial.

Version 9: February 6, 2020                       10 
  
Analysis Plan  
 
We will report baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of all study participants using 
means and proportions to describe continuous and categorical variables, respectively.  Because 
this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will use conservative (alpha = 0.05) and liberal (alpha = 0.2 0) critical 
values to assess statistical significance between the two arms in this pi [INVESTIGATOR_799].    
 
Aim 1: The primary endpoint of the proposed study is feasibility. The proposed video intervention 
will be deemed feasibl e if at least 60% (95% CI +/ - 13.6%) of eligible patients are enrolled in the 
study and complete at least 60% of the intervention sessions. The proposed video intervention will 
be deemed acceptable if at least 75% of patients randomized to the intervention arm  report 
satisfaction and comfo rt with the video.   
 
Aim 2: Changes in knowledge scores from before and after the intervention will be compared 
between the two groups using two -sample t -tests.  
 
Aim 3: Post-intervention EOL care  preferences (life -prolonging care, limited medical care, and 
comfort care), CPR preferences, and intubation preferences will be compared between the two 
groups using Fisher’s exact tests. The change in CPR and intubation preferences before and after 
the intervention within each group will be compared using McNemar tests.  
 
Aim 4: Code status documentation will be compared between the two groups using Fisher’s exact 
tests.

Introduction  
 
Research staff member: My name [CONTACT_832] (state name) and I am a working on a project about what 
people prefer when receiving medical care at the end of lif e. The goal of this project is to 
understand what people think and what they like better when getting medical care for advanced 
liver disease. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have advanced liver 
disease. Taking part in the project is strictly up to you. You can decide to not answer any of the 
questions if you wish, and can stop the interview at any time. You may also see an educational 
video during this survey, and you can stop the video at any time. Taking part in this project will 
have no bearing on your current care. This interview will last about a half hour.  Does this sound 
like a project yo u would like to participate in?  
 
If YES: Research staff member will obtain written consent and administer the Short Portable 
Mental Status Questionnaire

 APPENDIX C : Verbal Narrative Transcript  
I'd like to talk about choices for medical care when patients are very sick and in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. I will 
explain  [ADDRESS_1161208] very different ideas about what they want.  
There are three basic types of medical care for people who are very sick. These are life prolonging 
care, limited medical care,  and comfort care. Here is more to know:  
Life prolonging care.   
The first option is life prolonging care.  
The goal of this type of care is to “prolong life,” meaning that doctors will do everything they can 
to keep you alive. This can include trying cardio pulmonary resuscitation (or CPR) to restart your 
heart after it stopped beating. To do this, the doctor presses hard on your chest and uses a device 
to give your heart an electric shock.  
If you want the doctor to try CPR, you must also agree to be on a ve ntilator (or breathing machine) 
if needed. When getting a ventilator, the doctor puts a tube down your throat. One end of the tube 
goes into your lungs and the other connects to a machine that pushes air into them. You cannot eat 
or talk while on a ventila tor. You likely will also need such strong medicines that you must stay in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Intensive Care Unit (or ICU).  
With life prolonging care, you agree to CPR and a ventilator in hopes for a longer life. But for 
most patients with advanced liver dise ase, CPR does not work. CPR also will not cure your liver 
disease or get you back to the level of health you had before your heart stopped.  
Limited medical care.  
The second option is limited medical care.  
This is when people agree to just certain kinds of medical care. For instance, with limited medical 
care you might get medicine for treatable problems like fluid in the abdomen or infections around 
the stomach area . You might be admitted into the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836402]. But with limited medical care, you do not want doctors to try 
CPR or put you on a breathing machine --even if that means that without those treatments, you 
might  die.  
Comfort care .  
The third option is comfort care.

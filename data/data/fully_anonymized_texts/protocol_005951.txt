1.0     PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is an open -label  phase  II study  of the pan-class  I selective  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)  
inhibitor  Buparlisib  in patients  with metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  which  has progressed  despi[INVESTIGATOR_334896].  The purpose  of the study  design  is to evaluate  the 
efficacy  and safety  of Buparlisib  in advanced,  refractory  disease  using  2 month  progression  free 
survival  as a primary  endpoint.  Buparlisib  will be administered  orally  once daily. Intra-patient  
dose reduction  may be required  depending  on the type and severity  of individual  toxicity  
encountered.  Re-staging  imaging  studies  will be performed  after every  two cycles  of treatment  
(one cycle=4  weeks).  Patients  may continue  on study  as long as they are tolerating  therapy  and in 
the absence of disease progression.

3.0     BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Buparlisib  
NVP -Buparlisib  (Buparlisib)  is an oral pan-class  I phosphatidylinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)  inhibitor  
belonging  to the 2, 6-dimorpholino  pyrimidine  derivative  family.  The eight  members  of the PI3K  
family  have  been  classified  into three  classes  and class  I PI3Ks  are key players  in the PI3K -PDK1 - 
Akt pathway  that regulates  cell proliferation,  growth,  survival  and apoptosis.  In many  tumors  the 
PI3K  signaling  pathway  is constitutively  activated.  This is thought  to be acritical  step in mediating  
the transforming  potential  and growth  stimulating  activity  of various  oncogenes  (ErbB2,  EGFR,  
Ras, Src, etc.) contributing  to the onset  and growth  of solid  tumors  as well as hematological  
tumors.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_413436]  signaling  (“pathway  addicted”,  Weinstein  and Joe (2008))  as a result  of mutations  of the 
PIK3CA  gene  itself  or of regulators  of PI3K  (e.g. PTEN,  HER2).  As a consequence,  pathway  
mutated  tumors  are particularly  sensitive to PI3K pathway  inhibition.  
 
The superfamily  of PI3 kinases  is characterized  by [CONTACT_334943].  Currently,  8 members  of this family  are known,  belonging  to 
three  classes  (I-III). At the structural  level,  the enzyme  PI3K  is composed  of a 110 kDa catalytic  
subunit  and an 85 kDa adaptor  subunit.  PI3K  signaling  regulates  diverse  cellular  functions,  
including  protein  synthesis  and glucose  metabolism,  cell survival  and growth,  proliferation,  
cellular   resilience   and  repair,   cell  migration,   and  angiogenesis   (Katso,   et  al  2001).   PI3K   is

Amended:  12/17/13  Page  7 of 61  
 negatively  regulated  at the level  of PIP 3 by [CONTACT_334944],  such as the phosphatase  
and tensin  homolog ue PTEN  and the inositol  5′ phosphatase -[ADDRESS_413437]  is modulated  by [CONTACT_334945],  including  
hormones  (estrogen,  thyroid  hormones),  vitamins,  integrins,  intracellular  calcium  and the Ras- 
dependent  MAPK pathway.  
 
Constitutive  activation  of PI3K  signaling  is deemed  to be a critical  step in mediating  the 
transforming  potential  of oncogenes  and tumor  suppressors,  and in many  tumors  the PI3K  pathway  
is constitutively  activated.  Moreover,  preliminary  data suggest  that activation  of the PI3K  pathway  
may be a predictor  of poor prognostic  outcome  in many  cancers.  Several  lines of evidence  suggest  
that inhibition  of the PI3K  signaling  pathway  might  provide  benefit  for the treatment  of many  
cancers  including  solid  tumors  (breast  cancer,  prostate  cancer,  glioblastoma  multiforme,  colon  
cancer,  lung cancer  etc.) and tumors  of the hematopoetic  system  (Kim  1994,  Ram  1996,  Ma 2000,  
Fry 2001,  Roymans  2001,  Bachman  2004,  Broderick  2004,  Samuels  2004,  Ohgaki  2005,  Zeng  
2006).  
The molecular  changes  leading  to constitutive  activation  of the PI3K  pathway  are diverse  and fall 
into four categories:  (1): Gain -of-function  mutations  of oncogenes  encoding  positive  regulators  of 
PI3K  (HER2,  EGFR,  ras, c-src), including  oncogenes  coding  for components  of PI3K  itself  
(PIK3CA , which  encodes  for the p110α  catalytic  subunit,  or PIK3R1 , the gene coding  for the p85 
adaptor  subunit)  (2): Loss-of function  mutations  or deletions  affecting  negative  regulators  of PI3K  
such as PTEN (Chow  2006, Cully  2006) (3): Mutations  of genes encoding  downstream effectors  of 
the PI3K  signaling  cascade  (e.g. PDK1 , AKT/PKB , RPS6KB1 ) (4): Mutation  of the tumor  
suppressor  p53 (i.e. that regulates  PI3K signaling  through repression  of PIK3CA ). 
3.[ADDRESS_413438]  class  I PI3K (p110α, -β, -δ and -γ), Class  III (Vps34),  the class  IV 
related  PI3K mTOR , or PI4Kβ  was assessed using  either  a luciferase luminescence  (class  I or III 
PI3Ks  and PI4Kβ)  or a TR-FRET assay (Class IV mTOR).  The IC50  in these  assays  is outlined  
below  in Figure  1-1: 
Figure  1-1      Inhibitory activities  (IC 50) of Buparlisib  against  other PI3K or related kinases  
 
 
Buparlisib  significantly  inhibits  p110α  and the most  common  p110α  mutations  (H1047R,  E545 K, 
and E542K),  p110β,  p110δ  and p110γ  but not the related  proteins  Vps34,  mTOR  or PI4Kβ.  Hence  
Buparlisib  is classified  as a pure pan-class  I PI3K  inhibitor.  Enzymatic  characterization  of the 
inhibitory  properties  of the compound  revealed  that Buparlisib  is a mixed  inhibitor  of PI3Kα  with 
a strong  competitive  component  (largest  on Vmax).  The cocrystal  X-ray structure  of Buparlisib  

MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

IRB#:  11-060 A(8) 
Amended:  12/17/[ADDRESS_413439]  from  PI3K  
upstream  input  (Kwiatkowski  2003).  When  exposed  to TSC1  null mouse  embryonic  fibroblasts  
(MEFs),  Buparlisib  reduced  the S235/236P -RPS6  levels  with an IC50  of [ADDRESS_413440]  mechanisms  of action  (BCR -Abl inhibitor  STI571,  mTORC1  
allosteric  inhibitor  RAD001),  Buparlisib  is able to decrease  the phosphorylation  status  of various  
either  direct  ([COMPANY_004]3β,  FKHRL1/FOXO3a)  or indirect  downstream  Akt effectors  (p70S6K,  through  
mTOR)  in the PTEN  null U87MG  cell line as efficiently  as prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_334897]3K  inhibitors  such as 
LY294002  and Wortmannin.  
 
Forkhead  transcription  factors  (such  as FKHRL1)  are re-located  from  the nucleus  to the cytosol  
upon  phosphorylation  by [CONTACT_334946]. Treatment  of U2OS  cells stably  expressing  GFP-FKHRL1  chimera  
with Buparlisib  produced  a strong  nuclear  localization  of the fluorescence  signal,  in agreement  
with the reduction  of the phosphorylated  FKHRL1  levels.  Signaling  pathways  from  membrane  
receptors  to nuclear  transcription  factors  involve  many  different  players  such as kinases  or 
molecular  adaptors.  To test whether  Buparlisib  does influence  other  signaling  molecules  outside  of 
the PI3K  pathway,  induction  of various  pathways  (mitogenic  with EGF  and PDGF,  stress  
pathways  with anisomycin,  and interleukin  pathways  with IL-4) were  interrogated  in the presence  
of the compound.  In all cases,  Buparlisib  showed  specific  PI3K  pathway  attenuation  as 
demonstrated  by [CONTACT_334947] S473P -Akt levels,  without  affecting  the non-PI3K  driven  
readouts  such as activated  receptors  (EGFR,  PDGFR),  MAPK  kinases  (ERK,  JNK and p38) or Jak 
cytosolic  tyrosine  kinases  responsible  for Stat transcription  factor  phosphorylation.  
 
3.3.1  Preclinical  Safety  
Safety  pharmacology  studies  in rats revealed  no effects  on neuronal  (behavior)  or respi[INVESTIGATOR_334898].  Cardiac  safety  studies,  conducted  in vitro and in vivo,  did not indicate  a prominent  
electrophysiological  risk. In the isolated  rabbit  heart,  effects  pointing  towards  a shortened  
repolarization  were  seen only at 10 μM. Buparlisib  inhibited  hERG  channel  activity  significantly  
at concentrations  ≥ 100 μM (IC50:  190 μM).  The only effect  considered  relevant  was a trend  
towards  an increase  in systolic  and diastolic  blood  pressure,  observed  in two dog telemetry  studies,  
in the absence  of an electrophysiologic  effect.  
 
Repeated  dose studies  of up to 4 weeks  of duration  were  performed  in rats and dogs.  In rats, 
clinical  pathologic  changes  as well as histopathologic  findings  were  identified  the lymphatic  
system.  Findings  included  decreases  in lymphocyte  counts  in the peripheral  blood,  decreases  in 
germinal  center  development  in different  lymph  nodes,  and lymphocytolysis  in the thymus.  In 
dogs,  similar  findings  were  made.  In both species,  erythropoiesis  was affecte d, as evidenced  by 
[CONTACT_334948],  accompanied  by [CONTACT_334949]. The 
pancreas  was affected  by [CONTACT_334950],  particularly  in dogs,  where  acinar  cell toxicity  
was seen in the exocrine  pancreas.  In addition,  in one of the four recovery  animals  minimal  acinar  
cell atrophy  was observed  after a four week  treatment -free period.  In rats, in the 4-week  study,  no 
pancreatic  toxicity  was observed  (however,  in the 2-week  dose range -finding  study,  at higher  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

Amended:  12/17/13  Page  9 of 61  
 doses,  there  were  histopathologic  findings  of the endocrine  as well as the exocrine  pancreas).  
Insulin/glucose  homeostasis  was impacted  in various  species  (mice,  rats, dogs),  as expected  from  
the mode  of action  of Buparlisib.  However,  in both rats and dogs,  at the doses  used in the 4-week  
studies,  these  effects  were  minimal.  
 
In mice  treated  at high doses  (30 or 60 mg/kg/day),  a clear  induction  of insulin  
resistance/insensitivity  was observed,  without  clear  influence  of the dose or the time point  of 
testing.  Histopathologically,  the pancreas  and the liver showed  changes  which  are in concordance  
with this activity.  
 
After  up to 2 weeks  of treatment  with doses  of 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg/day,  dose- and time-dependent  
fluctuations  of neurotransmitters  were  observed  in brain  tissue  but not in plasma  or cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_334899].  However,  in two follow -up studies,  where  effects  of an analogue  compound  lacking  tubulin  
interaction,  or the effect  fo brain  sampling  times  were  investigated,  this effect  was not confirmed  
under  comparable  buparlisib  treatment  conditions.  Given  the disparate  results  between  studies,  the 
effects  of buparlisib  on glutamate,  glutamine,  GABA,  serotonin,  5HIAA,  dopamine,  or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_334900],  plasma,  or cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_334901].  Both  in vitro  and in vivo,  Buparlisib  
elicited  a genotoxic  potential.  While  no evidence  for a direct  DNA  interaction  was found  in an 
Ames  test and two chromosome  aberration  tests in vitro,  a potential  for genotoxicity  was 
concluded  based  on the observation  of an aneugenic  potential,  seen in this latter  experiment.  In 
line with this result,  Buparlisib  treatment  resulted  in an elevated  frequency  of micronucleated  
polychromatic  erythrocytes  in the bone  marrow of rats.  
Male  reproductive  organs  and associated  tissues  were  found  to be targets  of toxicity  in both rats 
and dogs.  Changes  included  minimal to slight  germ  cell depletion,  formation  of spermatic  giant  
cells and abnormal  spermatids,  and cellular  debris  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_334902].  Testicular  toxicity  did 
not fully  reverse  after the 4-week  treatment -free period  in rats although  a clear  trend  towards  
recovery  was seen.  In individual  female  rats, minimal  to slight  cyst formation  occurred  in the 
Graafian  follicles;  in addition,  an increased  incidence  of diestrus  stage  of the estrous  cycle  was 
seen. In dogs,  there was no effect  on female  reproductive  organs.  
 
Data  indicate  the absence  of a relevant  potential  for phototoxicity  with Buparlisib.  
 
In conclusion,  the majority  of the observed  effects  were  related  to the pharmacological  activity  of 
Buparlisib  as an inhibitor  of PI3K,  such as a potential  influence  on glucose/insulin  homeostasis  
and the risk of increased blood  pressure.  Main target  organs  of toxic  effects  were  bone  marrow  and 
lymphoid  tissue,  pancreas,  and male  as well as to a lesser  extent,  female  reproductive  organs.  
Furthermore,  neurotransmitter  fluctuations  were  seen in the brains  of rats, not visible  in plasma  or 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_155456].

3.3.2  Pharmacodynamics  
 
Buparlisib  inhibits  wild-type PI3Kα  (IC50:  35 nM),  with at least 50-fold selectivity  toward  protein  
kinases.  The compound  is equipotent  against  somatic  PI3Kα  mutations  (H1047R -, E542K - and 
E545K -p110α)  and is active  against  the other  three  PI3K  paralogs  (PI3Kβ,  -γ, -δ; 108 to 348 nM

IRB PROTOCOL

Amended:  12/17/13  Page  10 of 61  
 range).  Buparlisib  does not significantly  inhibit  the related  kinases  mTOR  and Vps34,  nor does it 
inhibit  other receptors  and ion channels  profiled  (IC50  >10 μM).  
 
Buparlisib  reduces  the phosphorylation  of the direct  downstream  effector  Akt in mechanistic  and 
relevant  tumor  cell lines (IC50:  93 nM for S473P -Akt in Rat1 -p110α  cells).  This biological  
activity  correlates  with inhibition  of various  Akt downstream  signaling  pathway  components,  and 
with its anti-proliferative  activity  against  a variety  of tumor  cell lines.  Our data suggest  that 
response  to Buparlisib  in breast  cancer  cell lines is associated  with HER  amplification  and/or  
PIK3CA  mutation.  The role of PTEN  loss-of-function  as a predictor  of response  seems  to be less 
clear.  
 
Buparlisib  demonstrated  significant  tumor  growth  inhibition  in tumor  xenografts  of a variety  of 
cancer  types  in mice  and rats, including  several  models  of breast  cancer.  In particular,  Buparlisib  
showed  high anti-tumor  activity  and synergism  when  combined  with trastuzumab  in the Her2 - 
amplified  breast  cancer  model  BT474  (as well as in the Her2 -amplified  gastric  model  NCI-N87).  
In vivo PK/PD  analyses  of tumor  tissues  showed  a good  correlation  between  exposure,  PI3K  
pathway  blockade  (S473P -Akt levels)  and anti-tumor  activity.  
 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_413441]  a low potential  for covalent  binding  to protein.  Buparlisib  is neither  a substrate  
for nor an inhibitor  of P-glycoprotein  (MDR -1) or Multidrug  Resistance  Related  Protein,  MRP2.  
The compound  is also not an inhibitor  of Breast Cancer  Resistance  Protein  (BCRP).  
 
With  respect  to potential  drug-drug interactions,  at 100 mg qd Buparlisib  is a weak  reversible  
inhibitor  of CYP3A4  (Ki 13.6 µM, I/Ki < 1). Buparlisib  also weakly  inhibited  the CYP2C  family  
(2C8,  2C9 and 2C19)  with IC50 values  ranging  from  35-65 µM (34-59 µM unbound).  Buparlisib  
shows  no apparent  time-dependent  inhibition  of CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2D6  or CYP3A4/5.  
Hepatic  oxidative  metabolism  of Buparlisib  was found  to be predominantly  mediated  by [CONTACT_097]3A4  
(>80%),  with only minor  contributions  of CYP1A1.  Hence,  Buparlisib  is a sensitive  CYP3A4  
substrate  and there  is potential  for drug-drug interactions  with co-medications  that are inhibitors  or 
inducers  of CYP3A4.  Direct  glucuronidation  via UGT1A4  is implied  as well in buparlisib  
metabolism  but until now its contribution  was not quantified  in vitro.  However,  direct  
glucuronides  (CNP320)  were  observed  in urine  in the hADME trial  up to  10%.  
 
Based  on the anticipated  large  contribution  of CYP3A4  in the metabolism  of buparlisib,  a drug- 
drug interaction  trial was conducted  with ritonavir  (strong  mechanism -based  inhibitor)  to evaluate  
the impact  of ritonavir  on a single  30 mg oral dose of buparlisib  (CBKM120C2111).  The co- 
administration  of 100 mg bid ritonavir  resulted  in a 73% increase  on geometric  mean  values  of 
AUCinf  and a 19% increase  on geometric -mean  ratio of the Cmax  after a single  30 mg dose of 
buparlisib.  There  was no significant  change  in the time to reach  maximum  concentration.  The 
mean  elimination  half-life of buparlisib  increased  from  53.3 hours  to 71.6 hours  and its mean

 apparent  clearance  decreased  from  5.37 L/h to 3.27 L/h as a consequence  of the effect  of ritonavir  
on CYP3A4  enzyme.  These  outcomes  showed  that ritonavir  had a limited  effect  on the maximum  
concentration  and caused  only a mild increase  in the exposure  of buparlisib.  When  translating  the 
results  of the study  to clinical  practice,  these  data could  support  a less restrictive  approach  in the 
concomitant  use of moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  with buparlisib.  
 
An additional  study  was conducted  testing  the impact  of repeat  dose of [ADDRESS_413442]  of dexamethasone  at high dose on CYP3A4  and consequently  on buparlisib  exposure.  
Overall,  buparlisib  PK is marginally  impacted  by [CONTACT_334951] 4 mg daily  dexamethasone.  The 
gMean  ratio for Cmax  and AUC  were  respectively  1.09 and 0.90.  This observation  is very likely  
explained  by [CONTACT_334952] a 4 mg dose of dexamethasone  on CYP3A4.  A 
single 50  mg oral dose of buparlisib  (D1 and 8) along  with dexamethasone  4 mg daily  orally  for 11 
days (followed  by 4 tapering  days)  was generally  safe and well-tolerated  in healthy volunteers.  
 
It is possible  that Buparlisib  may activate  PXR  in vivo and induce  CYP3A4  at concentrations  ≥ 50 
μM; however,  the absence  of time-dependent  changes  in pharmacokinetics  of buparlisib  in the 
relevant  therapeutic  dose range  in humans  suggests  that this may not be relevant  in vivo.  Finally,  
experiments  show  a potential  for buparlisib  to induce  UGT1A1  at concentrations  between  0.5 and 
100 uM. The mean  maximum  free concentration  calculated  at steady  state for the 100 mg qd dose 
in the study  [CBKM120X2101]  was 0.671  uM (Cmax,  tot=4.20  uM).  Therefore  a potential  
induction  of UGT1A1  cannot  be formally  excluded;  however,  the clinical  relevance  of observed  
activation  of UGT1A1  activity  is unclear.  
 
 
3.4 Clinical experience  
3.4.1  Buparlisib  Pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacokinetic  data observed  so far showed  that Buparlisib  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_334903]  (Cmax) ranging  between  0.[ADDRESS_413443] dose 
(tmax). The median  tmax at the MTD  dose (100 mg daily)  was about  1 hour.  After  reaching  Cmax, 
Buparlisib  plasma  concentrations  decreased  in a bi-exponential  manner.  Apparent  total body  
clearance  from  plasma  (CL/F)  was low at ~5.0 L/h, indicating  that Buparlisib  is a low clearance  
drug.  Buparlisib  accumulated  ~3-fold in achieving  steady -state,  consistent  with an effective  half- 
life of ~[ADDRESS_413444] variability  in Cmax and AUC  differed at each dose level  
but was relatively  low and generally  around  40%.  Doses  of 50 mg/day  and above  led to steady - 
state drug exposure  (AUC 0-24) > 10,000  ng*h/mL,  a target  efficacious  exposure  level  estimated  
preclinically.  
 
Due to the difficulty  of obtaining  fresh  tumor  tissue  during  treatment,  pharmacodynamic  
measurements  were  limited  to surrogate  tissues  such as skin and blood.  The parameters  assessed  
have  been  selected  for their relevance  to PI3K/mTOR  signaling  modulation:  phosphorylated  S6 
ribosomal  protein  in the skin (S6 is a well-known  downstream  target  of the PI3K/mTOR  pathway)  
and C-peptide  and glucose  levels  in the blood  (PI3K/mTOR  signaling  has a critical  role in glucose  
metabolism).  A formal  analysis  of these  assessments  is currently  ongoing.  Consistent  suppression  
of S6 activation  in skin was evident  at the highest  doses  tested  (100 and 150mg /day)  with 30 to 
80% decrease  from  baseline  levels.  Occasional  increases  in C-peptide  have been  seen at all doses,  
while  hyperglycemia  was one of the DLTs,  suggesting  potential  impairment  of glucose  transport

effect  of buparlisib  and has been commonly  observed  in patients  treated  with buparlisib  with an 
incidence  ranged  between  17.6%  and 58.3%.  The highest  rate of hyperglycemia  has been  observed  in 
trials  conducted  in patients  with controlled  diabetes  mellitus  and in patients  with brain  metastases.

in 432 patients.  Also,  688 patients  are enrolled  in ongoing  blinded  phase  III studies.  The 5 remaining  
patients  were  enrolled  but did not receive  a dose of buparlisib  at the time of the cut-off (1 patient  in 
[CBKM120E2101]  study  and 4 patients  in [CBKM120X2107]  study).  
 
In pharmacology  studies,  [ADDRESS_413447]  been enrolled  including  77 healthy  volunteers  who received  
one/two  doses  buparlisib  as single  agent  or in combination.  Forty -six out of 77 healthy  volunteers  were  
enrolled  in three  completed  studies:  four healthy  volunteers  received  one 100 mg dose in 
[CBKM120C2102],  27 healthy  volunteers  received  two single  doses  of 50 mg in [CBKM120C2106]  
and 15 healthy  volunteers  received  two single  doses  of 30 mg [CBKM120C2111].  Also,  18 hepatically  
impaired  subjects  and 13 healthy  volunteers  received  a single  30 mg dose of buparlisib  in the 
[CBKM120C2104]  study.  Eighteen  healthy  volunteers  received  three  single  doses  of 50 mg buparlisib  
with three different formulations  in [CBKM120C2110]  a relative bioavailability  study.  
 
As of  [ADDRESS_413448] completed  recruitment.  
Single Agent  
In Phase  I single  agent  trials,  a total of eleven  dose limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  were  observed,  nine in 
CBKM120X2101  in Caucasian  population  study,  one in CBKM120X1101  in Japanese  population  
study  and one in CBKM120Z21101  in Chinese  population  study.  The maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  
was determined  to be 100 mg/day  buparlisib  in Caucasian,  Japanese,  and Chinese  patient  population.  
The recommended  phase  II dose (RP2D)  was confirmed  at 100 mg daily  for Caucasian  and for

 Japanese population  and is under  evaluation  in Chinese population.  
 
Moreover,  buparlisib  single  agent  at 100 mg daily  has been explored  in 2 open -label  phase  II studies  
conducted  in patients  with advanced  endometrial  carcinoma  (CBKM120C2201)  and squamous  cell 
advanced  NSCLC  (CBKM120D2201).  The limited  anti-tumor  activity  observed  has been considered  as 
insufficient to  warrant further  investigation  as single agent in  these two  indications.  
 
The pharmacokinetic  data reveals  that buparlisib  single  agent  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_334904] a median  time to reach  maximum concentration  (Tmax)  between  0.5 and 3 hours  at 
steady -state.  The variability  in exposure  and maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  at steady -state 
for the maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  of 100 mg qd is moderate:  33% and 28% respectively.  
Buparlisib  accumulated  in a linear  fashion  (~3-fold)  and reached  steady -state after 8 days of treatment.  
At steady -state the median  accumulation  half-life was esteimated  between  35.7 hours  and 58.5 hours,  
calculated  based  on an accumulation  ratio between  3 and 4-fold. 
 
Combinations  
 
Buparlisib  is currently  tested  in several  combinations  together  with trastuzumab  (CBKM120X2107)  
and paclitaxel  alone,  with paclitaxel  and trastuzumab  (CBEZ235A2118)  with the MEK  inhibitor  
[COMPANY_004]1120212  in the CBKM120B2101  trial with temozolomide  and radiotherapy  (BKM120E2101)  
study,  with abiraterone  in BEZ235D2101  study,  LDE2225  in LDE225X2114  study,  with STI571  in 
CSTI571X2101  study,  with MEK162  in CMEK162X2101  study,  with INC424  in CINC424A2104  
study.  
 
Currently  three  phase  III trials  are running  in patients  with metastatic  breast  cancer  with buparlisib  at 
[ADDRESS_413449] of the proton  pump  inhibitors.  
 
In Phase  I combination  trials,  one DLT  was observed  in CBKM120X2107  and the MTD  and 
recommended  phase  II dose (RP2D)  was determined  as 100 mg/day  of buparlisib  in combination  with 
weekly  trastuzumab.  
 
In CBKM120B2101  trial, 22 DLTs  were  observed  in 19 patients  (buparlisib  combined  with 
[COMPANY_004]1120121).  The MTD  was defined  at 70 mg/day  in combination  with 1.5 mg/day  of [COMPANY_004]1120212,  
and the RP2D  was defined  at 60 mg/day  in combination  with 1.5 mg/day  of [COMPANY_004]1120212.  
 
Eight  DLTs were  observed  in six patients  in the dual  combination  treatment  arms  in the BEZ235A2118  
study,  and the MTD  was defined  at 100 mg/day  in combination  with weekly  paclitaxel  80 mg/m2  for 
cycles  of 28 days.  Four DLTs  were  observed  in seven  patients  in the triple  combination  
(paclitaxel/trastuzumab/BKM120)  treatment  arms  in the BEZ235A2118  study,  and the MTD  has not 
yet been determined.  Two DLTs  were  reported  in patients  treated  with temozolomide  (TMZ)  and

[CONTACT_129743]  50%.  The exposures  were  partially  restored  in the triple  combination  with trastuzumab  even 
though  the Cmax  remained  low. 
 
In [COMPANY_004]1120212  trial, the recommended  dose for the MTD  established  at 70 mg and the recommended  
dose at 60 mg with 1.5 mg [COMPANY_004]1120212.  The predicted  exposure  for the 100 mg dose,  based  on the 60 
mg dose exposure  was 29% lower  than the ones observed  at [ADDRESS_413451] in man trial when  
they would  be comparable  for the 70 mg daily  dose.  For both doses,  the predicted  Cmax  remained  
lower  than the ones observed  with 100 mg daily.  As of 15-Sep-13, there  were  eleven  cases  (twenty -two 
events)  with a fatal outcome reported  with a suspected  relationship  with buparlisib.  
 
 
 
In the single  agent  CBKM120Z2102  study,  1 DLT  consisting  of grade  3 depression  was noted  at 80 
mg/day.  In CBKM120B210  combination  therapy  with [COMPANY_004]1120212,  22 DLTs  were  noted  in 18 
patients  including  grade  3 stomatitis  (1) and grade  3 pneumonitis  (1).

There  is evidence  indicating  that the modulation  of  AKT/[COMPANY_004]3  signaling  pathway  may play an 
important  role in the behavior  regulation.  Psychiatric  side effects  events  have  been  reported  in patients  
treated  with buparlisib  and are still under  investigation.  The current  data do not allow  the identification  
of any sign or symptom  which  could  predict  patient  susceptibility  to buparlisib  induced  psychiatric  
disorders.

photosensitivity  reactions,  activated  PTT prolongation,  hepatitis,  colitis,  and encephalitis.  One case of 
suicide  was reported  in a patient  with advanced  lung cancer.  Three  cases  of posterior  reversible  
encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES)  were  reported  in patients  taking  buparlisib  in clinical  trials.  With  
regards  to PRES,  patients  experiencing  severe  headache,  change  in behavior,  or reason  to believe  their 
blood  pressure  has increased  should  inform  investigators  immediately.  The written  patient  information  
contains  this information.  
 
As of 15 Sep 13, there  were  twenty -two events  (in eleven  cases)  with a suspected  relationship  with 
buparlisib  and with a fatal outcome.   See IB for details.

PIK3CA , the gene  encoding  for the catalytic  subunit  of PI3K,  have  been  detected  in up to 25% of 
urothelial  carcinoma  samples  (Platt  2009).  Deletions  and mutations  of PTEN,  a phosphatase  
protein  which  negatively  regulates  the activation  of PI3K,  are also documented  to occur  in a 
significant  number  of cases  (Platt  2009).   Akt itself  can possess  activating  mutations,  leading  to

 upregulation  of multiple  downstream  proteins  involved  in cell cycle  progression  and inhibition  of 
apoptosis  (Askham  2010).  Other  downstream  alterations  lead to erroneous  pathway  stimulation,  
including  mutational  inactivation  of TSC-1, which  results  in constitutive  activation  of the mTOR  
pathway  (Platt  2009).  Furthermore,  amplification  of pathway  stimulating  molecules  and deletion  
of inhibitory  proteins  are alternative  mechanisms  of pathway  activation  which  are also observed.  
Mutations  of upstream  receptor  tyrosine  kinases,  such as FGFR3,  are known  to occur  in up to 70% 
of superficial  bladder  cancers  and approximately  20% of invasive,  high grade  disease  (Kompi[INVESTIGATOR_3694]  
2009).  The plenitude  of aberrations  of the PI3K -Akt pathway  speaks  to the significant  role that 
this pathway  plays  in bladder  cancer  development  and progression  as well as to the potential  for 
deriving  clinical  efficacy  from  inhibition  of pathway  mediators.  At Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  
Cancer  Center  (MSKCC),  we have sequenced  137 high-grade  bladder  cancers  for mutations  within  
PIK3CA  (Iyer  2010).  Seventeen  (12%)  samples  were  found  to possess  point  mutations.  Other  
sequenced  genes  included  TP53 , HRAS , and BRAF , none  of which  contained  as high a frequency  
of alterations.  Mutations  within  the tyrosine  kinase  receptor  gene  FGFR3  were  detected  in 16 
(12%)  samples  with three  samples  containing  both PIK3CA  and FGFR3  mutations.  These  results  
demonstrate  that mutations  within  the PIK3CA  gene  as well as PI3K  pathway  stimulating  
molecules  such as FGFR3  represent  a significant  proportion  of the alterations  in this set of high- 
grade  bladder  tumors  and that inhibitors  of this pathway  may have  a clinical  impact  in patients  
with urothelial  carcinoma.  
3.5.[ADDRESS_413459]  previously  received  
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  in the perioperative  setting.  Given  this heterogeneity  in prior  exposure  to 
chemotherapy,  the definition  of “second -line”  or “third -line”  chemotherapy  has not been  well 
characterized.  As a result,  we have  designed  the eligibility  for this protocol  based  on the number  of 
prior  chemotherapeutic  agents  patients  have  received  rather  than the number  of “lines”  of therapy  
that have  been  administer ed. Second -line chemotherapy  trials  have  typi[INVESTIGATOR_334906]  1 or ≥ 1 prior regimen(s).  Clinical  trials at MSKCC  have  included  a maximum  
of 4 prior  drugs  because  patients  are treated  with multiple  agents  in the community  before  referral.  
There  are no available  data demonstrating  that the response  proportion  in the relapsed  setting  is 
linked  to the number  of prior  regimens;  for example,  sunitinib  was identified  as an active  agent  in 
an MSKCC  phase  II trial of patients  with metastatic  urothelial  cancer  who have  received  a 
maximum  of 4 prior  drugs  (Gallagher  2010).  This prior  treatment  inclusion  criterion  will serve  to 
enhance  accrual  and likely  ultimately  provide  a more  homogenous  patient  population  (e.g.,  most  
patients  will have  been  exposed  to a platinum  agent,  gemcitabine,  and a taxane  at some  point  in 
their treatment  history).  Furthermore,  we do not anticipate  the response  to this targeted  agent  to be 
closely  linked  to the number  of prior  cytotoxic  agents  administered.  If Buparlisib  demonstrates  
activity  in this second -line trial, future  trials  will include  an evaluation  of the combination  of 
Buparlisib  with chemotherapy  in the first- and second -line settings.  
 
3.5.4  Rationale  for a PFS Endpoint  
 
Pertinent  to discovering  new drugs  active  in urothelial  cancers  is the concept  that identifying  
clinical  benefit  should  not be limited  to response.  Some  of the newer  "targeted  therapy"  agents  
approved  by [CONTACT_334953] -free survival  
(PFS)  and not response  rate (e.g.,  sorafenib  in  renal   cell carcinoma   with  a response  rate of

 approximately  10% but a major  impact  in PFS and, eventually,  an improvement  in survival).  This 
being  said, the median  progression -free survival  for bladder  cancer  patients  treated  with 
chemotherapy  is modest  at only 2-3 months  and response  rates  are in the 10-20% range.  In a 
second -line trial of weekly  paclitaxel  in 31 patients  with progressive  urothelial  cancer,  the median  
time to progression  was 2.2 months.  In an ECOG  trial evaluating  the epothilone  analog  BMS - 
247550  in patients  with relapsed  urothelial  cancer,  the median  progression -free survival  was 2.7 
months  (95%  CI, 1.8, 4.1) (Vaughn  2002;  Dreicer  2007).  In a recently  reported  phase  [ADDRESS_413460] supportive  care,  the PFS for patients  treated  
with vinflunine  was 3.0 months  (95%  CI, 2.1, 4.0) (Bellmunt  2009).  Novel  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_334907].  
 
 
3.5.4  Rationale  for Expansion  Cohort  
PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway  alterations  have  been  genetically  characterized  in a panel  of [ADDRESS_413461]  activation  within  PIK3CA,  PTEN,  AKT1,  or TSC1.  Additionally,  FGFR3  amplifications  
and hotspot  activating  mutations  were  found  in 15% of samples,  the majority  of which  were  
mutually  exclusive  from  alterations  within  other  members  of the pathway.  These  results  indicate  
that PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway  activation  is a common  event  in UC with the mechanism  of 
activation  including  truncation  of tumor  suppressors  such as TSC1  and PTEN  as well as 
amplification  and/or  mutation  of oncogenes  such as PIK3CA,  FGFR3,  and AKT1.  Preliminary  
genetic  analysis  of tumor  samples  from  [ADDRESS_413462]  a tumor  with loss of TP53  and CDKN1A  but no 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway  alterations.  These  data strongly  suggests  that in order  to maximize  the 
efficacy  of Buparlisib,  patients  whose  tumors  contain  known  activating  alterations  within  the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signaling  pathway  should  selectively  be enrolled  onto study.  Based  upon  the 
genetic  data from  the Phase  II cohort,  e an expansion  cohort  has been  created  which  comprises  
selective  enrollment  of patients  with tumors  harbor  activating  PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway  
alterations.  Routine  prospective  genetic  screening  of patients  with both locally  advanced  and 
metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  is currently  being  performed  in all bladder -specific  medical  
oncology  clinics  at MSKCC.  Patients  are enrolled  onto either  the GU tissue  collection  protocol  
(IRB  #89-076) or the  institutional  protocol  (IRB#  12-245),  which  allow  for genetic  analysis  
through  Next  Generation  sequencing  using  the standardized  MiSeq  assay  as well as the IMPACT  
assay.  Patients  can also opt for commercial  mutational  analysis  through  Foundation  One.  Patients  
with progressive,  metastatic  UC whose  tumors  possess  alterations  predicted  to upregulate  
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activity  will be considered  for enrollment  onto the expansion  cohort.  
 
 
 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is an open -label  phase  II study  of the pan-class  I selective  PI3K  inhibitor  Buparlisib  in 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:  11-060 A(8) 
Amended:  12/17/13  Page  19 of 61  
 patients  with metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  which  has progressed  despi[INVESTIGATOR_334908].  The purpose  of the study  design  is to evaluate  the efficacy  and safety  of 
Buparlisib  in advanced,  refractory  disease  using  2 month  progression  free survival  as a primary  
endpoint.  
 
In the Phase  II study, the planned sample  size will be 35  patients.  A two stage study design  will be 
utilized  with a PFS rate at 8 weeks  of less than 60% considered  not promising  while  a PFS rate at  8 
weeks  of 80% or greater  will be considered  promising.  In stage  I of the trial, [ADDRESS_413463]  a negative  result.  If 9 or 
more  are progression -free at two months,  enrollment  will be extended  to accrue  a total of 35 
patients.  If 24 or more  are progression -free after their two month  scan (i.e., after stage  2), the 
treatment  will be considered  effective and worthy  of further  testing.  
 
In the Expansion  Cohort,  the planned  sample  size will be 21 patients  with genetic  alterations  
upregulating  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway.  A one-stage  study  design  will be utilized  with a PFS 
rate at 8 weeks  of less than 60% considered  not promising  while  a PFS rate at 8 weeks of 85% or  
greater  will be considered  promising.  If [ADDRESS_413464] a negative result.  If 16 or more  are 
progression -free at two months,  the treatment  will be considered  effective and worthy  of further  
testing.  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Buparlisib  will be administered  at a dose of 100 mg orally  once  daily  (two 50 mg capsules)  
continuously.  Intra-patient  dose reduction  may be required  depending  on the type and severity  of 
the individual  toxicity  encountered.  Re-staging  imaging  studies  will be performed  after every  two 
cycles  of treatment  (one cycle  = 4 weeks).  Patients  may continue  on study  as long as they are 
tolerating  therapy  and are free of disease  progression.  
 
 
5.0     THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1 Investigational  Drug  Description  
NVP -Buparlisib  (Buparlisib)  is an oral pan-class  I phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)  inhibitor  
belonging  to the 2, 6-dimorpholino  pyrimidine  derivative  family.  
 
The drug product is a hard gelatin  capsule  for oral administration  (10 mg, and 50  mg). Both  dosage  
strengths  have  the same  qualitative  composition  which  consists  of dry powder  blends  made  using  
standard  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_334909]:  mannitol,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  crospovidone,  
colloidal  silicon  dioxide,  and magnesium  stearate.  The 10-mg capsules  use a Size 1 or Size 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_334910].  The 50 mg capsules  use a Size 1 capsule  shell  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_334911].  
 
5.2 2 Drug Dispensing/Administration  
Administration  will be performed  on an outpatient basis.  Buparlisib  will be dispensed  as capsules  at the

5.3 3 Storage  and Stability  
Based  on the available stability  data,  Buparlisib  capsules  are not to be stored  above 25⁰C.  The 
capsules  are packaged in  high density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  with induction  seals  and child  
resistant  caps.   The shelf -life period  and storage conditions will  be continually  assessed  based on  
accelerated  and long-term stability  data.

lot numbers  of each drug received,  including  the number  of bottles  dispensed  to each patient,  the 
dates  drug was dispensed,  and the daily  dose of Buparlisib  the patient  received.  The prescribed  
dose should  also be recorded  in the patient’s  medical records.  
 
At the conclusion  of the study,  all unused  Buparlisib  capsules  will be returned  to [COMPANY_001]  for 
destruction.

MSKCC.  Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  
team,  the protocol  investigator,  or the research  team.  If the investigator  is a member  of the 
treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patients’  medical  records  for suitable  research  study  
participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.  Potential  
subjects  contact[CONTACT_253604]/research  staff of 
the study.  The patient’s  initial  conversation  with the investigator/research  staff and portions  of the 
patient’s  MSKCC  medical  records  will be used to confirm  that the patient  is eligible  for study  
participation.  
 
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
The following  will be completed  within  14 days  prior  to initiation  of treatment  (unless  otherwise  
indicated):  
 
• Vital  signs  
Vital  sign assessment  consists  of height,  pulse,  blood  pressure,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844], temperature  
and weight.  
• Physical  examination  
Physical  examination  will be performed  which  must  comprise  a total body  examination  
(general  appearance,  skin,  neck,  including  thyroid,  eyes,  ears, nose,  throat,  lungs,  heart,  
abdomen,  back,  lymph  nodes,  extremities  and basic  nervous  system),  including  a skin rash 
assessment.  
• Performance  status  
Performance  status will be assessed  at screening  and per the visit schedule using the  
Karnofsky  performance  status.  
• Pregnancy  Test 
A serum  pregnancy test (β-HCG)  is required  for all women  of child -bearing  potential  
(WOCBP)  at screening,  within  [ADDRESS_413481] dose of Buparlisib.  
• Hematology  
Hematology  includes  the following  parameters:  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  consisting  of 
red blood  cell (RBCs),  a total white  blood  cell count  (WBC)  with differential  (total  
neutrophil  count  including  bands,  lymphocyte,  monocyte,  eosinophil,  and basophil  counts);  
hemoglobin  (Hgb);  and platelet count.  
• Coagulation Profile  
The coagulation  profile  includes  proth rombin  time (PT) or INR,  and activated  partial  
thromboplastin  time (PTT).  
• Serum  Chemistry

lipoprotein  (LDL),  and triglycerides)  
o Phosphorus  
o Uric acid 
o Lactic  dehydrogenase (LDH)  
Because  accurate  serum  glucose  and lipid measurements  are required,  patients  should  be 
fasting  at the time of the blood sampling.  
• Screening  tests 
The additional  screening  tests include:  
o Magnesium  
o Amylase  and lipase  
o Gamma  glutamyl  transpeptidase  (GGT)  
 
• Urinalysis  
Urinalysis  includes  macroscopic  (protein,  glucose,  ketones,  blood,  and specific  gravity).  A 
microscopic  (WBC/hpf,  RBC/hpf,  and any additional  findings)  exam  need  only be 
performed  if the urinalysis  result is abnormal.  
This must  be supplemented  with laboratory  quantification  of any potentially  relevant  
abnormalities.  
• Neuropsychiatric  assessments  
Patient  self-rating  mood  questionnaires  for anxiety  and depression  (PHQ -9, GAD -7) will 
be conducted  during  screening.  Patients  must  be below  the cutoff  scores  in either  of these  
questionnaires  to be eligible  for the trial (see Exclusion  Criteria  for further  details).  Please  
see sections  10.0 and 11.1 for more  information  regarding  neuropsychiatric  assessments  
during treatment.

A standard  [ADDRESS_413482]  be 
recorded.  
• ECHO/MUGA  
An echocardiogram  or MUGA  will be performed  at screening  to assess  eligibility  
• Chest  X-ray 
A CT  of chest may  be performed  instead  if clinically  relevant.  
• Radiological  tumor  assessment  
Baseline abdominal and  pelvic CT scan and/or  MRI  of the abdomen  and pelvis for abdominal  
or pelvic indicator  lesions  
• Bone  Scan  
In patients  with osseous lesions,  bone  X-rays and/or  bone  scans sho uld be obtained.

 9.1 Buparlisib  Administration  
The study  drug Buparlisib  will be self-administered  (by [CONTACT_28624]).  The investigator  
will instruct  the patient  to take the study  drug exactly  as specified  in the protocol.  Buparlisib  will 
be administered  orally  on a continuous  once  daily  dosing  schedule  of 100 mg (two  50  mg 
capsules)  continuously  from  study  day [ADDRESS_413483]  (morning  meal)  at approximately  the same  time each day. Buparlisib  should  be 
taken  with a glass  of water  and consumed  over as short  a time as possible.  Patients  should  swallow  
the capsules  as a whole  and not chew  or crush  them.  Patients  should  continue  to fast for [ADDRESS_413484]  
be noted as  an adverse  event.  
If the patient  forgets  to take her/his  dose before  6:[ADDRESS_413485]. John’s  Wort,  Seville  oranges,  grapefruit  or grapefruit  juice,  
grapefruit  hybrids,  pummelos  and exotic  citrus  fruits  from  [ADDRESS_413486]  avoid  concomitant  intake  of strong  and moderate  CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_413487]  be 
recorded.  If a patient  requires  a Buparlisib  dose delay  of > [ADDRESS_413488]  be 
interrupted  because  of unacceptable toxicity,  drug dosing  will be interrupted  or modified  according  
to rules  described  in Table  2. Drug  may also be interrupted  per investigator’s  discretion   if 
clinically  warranted.  Toxicity  will be assessed  using  the NIH-NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  
for Adverse  Events,  version  4.0 (CTCAEv4.0,  http://ctep.cancer.gov/ protocol

Amended:  12/17/[ADDRESS_413489],  discovered  by 
[CONTACT_334956],  or detected  through  physical  examination,  laboratory  tests,   or  other  
means  will be collected,  recorded,  and followed  as appropriate.  
 
An adverse  event  is the appearance  or worsening  of any undesirable  sign,  symptom,  or medical  
condition  occurring  after starting  the study  drug even if the event  is not considered  to be related  to 
study  drug.  Medical  conditions/diseases  present  before  starting  study  drug are only considered  
adverse  events  if they worsen  after starting  study  drug.  Abnormal  laboratory  values  or test results  
constitute  adverse  events  only if they induce  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  are considered  clinically  
significant,  or require therapy.  
 
The occurrence  of adverse  events  should  be sought  by [CONTACT_105]-directive  questioning  of the patient  at 
each visit during  the study.  Adverse  events  also may be detected  when  they are volunteered  by [CONTACT_334957],  laboratory  test, or other  
assessments.  As far as possible,  each adverse  event  should be  evaluated  to determine:  
1. The severity  grade (mild,  moderate,  severe  or grade  1-4) 
2. Its relationship  to the study  drug (suspected/not suspected)  
3. Its duration  (start  and end dates or  if continuing  at final exam)  
4. Action  taken  (no action  taken;  study  drug dosage  adjusted/temporarily  interrupted;  study  
drug permanently  discontinued  due to this adverse  event;  concomitant  medication  taken;  
non-drug therapy  given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
5. Whether  it constitutes a serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  
 
All adverse  events  should  be treated  appropriately.  Such  treatment  may include  chang es in study  
drug treatment  including  possible  interruption  or discontinuation,  starting  or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334913],  changes  in the frequency  or nature  of assessments,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or any other  
medically  required  intervention.  Once  an adverse  event  is detected,  it should  be followed  until its 
resolution,  and assessment  should  be made  at each visit (or more  frequently,  if necessary)  of any 
changes  in severity,  the suspected  relationship  to the study  drug,  the interventions  required  to treat 
it, and  the outcome.  
 
Information  about  common  side effects  already  known  about  the investigational  drug can be found  
in the Investigators’  Brochure.  This information  should be included  in the patient  informed  consent  
and should be discussed  with the patient  during  the study as needed.  
 
Patients  whose  treatment  is interrupted  or permanently  discontinued  due to an adverse  event  or 
clinically  significant  laboratory  value,  must  be followed  as outlined  in Table  2, at least once  a 
week  for [ADDRESS_413490]. If a patient  requires  a dose delay  of > 21 days from  the previous  
dose,  then the patient  should  be discontinued  from  the study.  If the patient  requires  more  than 2 
dose reductions,  the patient  should  be discontinued  from  the study  (i.e., patients  cannot  be treated  
below  dose level  -2). All patients  must  be followed  for adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  
for [ADDRESS_413491]  be reported  to [COMPANY_001]  as 
detailed  in section  17.2.

 9.5.1  Drugs  that are prohibited  
• Other  investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_334917].  
• Anticancer  therapy  (chemotherapy,  biologic,  or radiation  therapy)  other  than the study  
treatment  must  not be administered  to patients  while  they are on the study.  If such agents  
are required  for a patient then the patient  must  be discontinued  from  the study.  
• In vitro metabolism  studies  suggest  that oxidative  metabolism  of Buparlisib  is 
predominantly  mediated  by [CONTACT_097]3A4  (fm>0.9),  with only minor  contributions  of CYP1A1.  
As Buparlisib  is a sensitive  CYP3A4  substrate,  co-administration  of Buparlisib  with strong  
and moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and CYP3A4  inducers  (which  are predicted  to reduce  
systemic  exposure  to Buparlisib  and thereby  [CONTACT_334961])  is prohibited.  
• Therapeutic  doses  of warfarin  sodium  (Coumadin®)  or any other  coumarin -derivative  
anticoagulants  are not permitted.  
• Herbal  preparations/medications  are not allowed  throughout  the study.  These  herbal  
medications  include,  but are not limited  to St. John’s  wort,  Kava,  ephedra  (ma huang),  
gingko  biloba,  dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119]  (DHEA),  yohimbe,  saw palmetto,  and ginseng.  
Patients  should  stop using  these herbal  medications  [ADDRESS_413517] dose of study drug.  
• Hormonal  contraceptives  may be affected  by [CONTACT_9058]  P450  interactions,  and are 
therefore  not considered  effective  in this study.  
• If a patient  requires  the concomitant  use of any medication  included  in Table  5.4 entitled  
“List  of Prohibited  QT prolonging  drugs”  (i.e., drugs  that are generally  accepted  by [CONTACT_111861].org  Advisory  Board  of the Arizona  CERT  to have  a risk of causing  Torsades  des 
de Pointes),  study  treatment  administration  must  be interrupted  as long as the patient  
requires  therapy  with the QT prolonging agent.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_413518]  that Buparlisib  is a weak,  reversible  inhibitor  of 
CYP3A4/5  (Ki=13.6  μM, [I]/Ki=  0.4 where  [I] is the average  Cmax at steady -state following  100 
mg daily  dose)  and of CYP2C8/2C9/2C19  (IC 50=34 μM, [I]/IC 50=0.15).  Note  that with the data 
available,  we are unable  to confirm  whether  such interactions  will occur  in patients.  Therefore,  
investigators,  at their discretion,  may administer  concomitant  medications  known  to be 
metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and CYP2C19.  Patients  receiving  such 
medications  must  be carefully  monitored  for potentiation  of toxicity  due to any individual  
concomitant  medications,  and may require  dose titration  or reduction  of the drug substrate.  See 
Appendix  A for a full list of drugs  that are prohibited  and drugs  that must  be used with caution.  
Caution  is particularly  advised  when  Buparlisib  is co-administered  with:  
• Drugs  which  are substrates  for CYP3A4,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  or CYP2C19  and which  have  a 
narrow  therapeutic index.  
• Oral anti-diabetics  which  are metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C8  or CYP2C9  can possibly  result  in 
hypoglycemia.  Patients  who develop  diabetes  mellitus  during  the study  should  be treated  
according  to the American  Diabetes  Association  guidelines.  It is recommended  that treatment  
start with metformin.  
• Concomitant  treatment  with corticosteroids  and Buparlisib  should  be avoided,  whenever  
possible,  during  this study.   A short  duration  (< 2 weeks)  of systemic  corticosteroids  is allowed

corticosteroids  is known  to induce  CYP3A  enzymes,  thereby  [CONTACT_334962]-therapeutic levels.  
• If a patient,  after study  enrollment,  requires  the concomitant  use of any medication  which  may 
cause  QT prolongation  and/or  Torsades  de Pointes  (Table  5.3), then the investigators,  at their 
discretion,  may co-administer  such medications.  Patients  receiving  such medications  must  be 
monitored.  
• Unless  otherwise  indicated,  investigators  should  use their clinical  discretion  if any other  
concomitant  medications  known  to be metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C 19 and/or  
CYP3A4/5  need  to be co-administered  with Buparlisib.  Patients  should  be carefully  monitored  
for signs of  possible  toxicity  due to any individual  concomitant  medications.  
• Please  refer to a list of known  medications  that are substrates,  inhibitors,  and inducers  
(provided  in Appendix  A) of CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and/or  CYP3A4/5  isoenzymes  as 
well as QT prolonging  drugs and carefully  consider  their co-administration  with Buparlisib.

neutrophil  count  including  bands,  lymphocyte,  monocyte,  eosinophil,  and basophil  counts),  hemoglobin  (Hgb),  and platelet  count.  This  should  be performed  on D1 and D15 of cycle  1 
and cycle  2 and day 1 of all subsequent  cycles.  
 
7. Serum Chemistry:  Patients  must  be fasting  overnight  for at least  8 hours  prior to blood  sampling.  These  tests should  be performed  on D1 and  D15 of cycle  1 and cycle 2, and day 1 
of all  subsequent  cycles.  C1D1  assessments  may be performed  up to 72 hours  prior  to the scheduled  visit.  In patients with  serum triglycerides  ≥ 500 mg/dL,  urine amylase needs  to be 
tested  as well upon  receipt  of the chemistry  panel  results.  
Serum  Chemistry  includes:  
o Comp  with conjugated  bilirubin  (urea or blood  urea  nitrogen  (BUN),  creatinine,  sodium,  potassium,  calcium,  glucose,  albumin,  total protein,  total bilirubin  (direct and  indirect),  
alkaline  phosphatase  (fractionated  if alkaline  phosphatase  level is  grade  2 or higher),  AST (SGOT),  ALT (SGPT )) 
o Lipid  Panel  (total  cholesterol,  high density lipoprotein  (HDL),  low density lipoprotein  (LDL)  and triglycerides)  
o Lactic  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  
o Phosphorus  
o Uric  acid 
 
8. Screening  tests should  be performed  ≤14 days prior  to treatment  start.  These  tests include:  
o Magnesium  
o Amylase,  lipase,  and GGT  
 
9. Coagulation - PT or INR and PTT C1D1  assessments  may be performed  up to 72 hours  prior to the scheduled  visit.  Additional  assessments  will be performed  on Day 1 of Cycle  2 
and repeated  every  even  cycle  (≤ 72 hours  prior  to the scheduled  visit).  A repeat  coagulation  profile panel  is required  at the time of study  treatment  discontinuation.   Patients  entering  
the study  while  receiving  anticoagulation  therapy  or those  who are initiated  on anticoagulation  therapy while on study  should  have  their coagulation  profile performed  at every  visit.

16. For all patients  enrolling  to the Phase II  portion,  pre-treatment  tumor  tissue  specimens will  be analyzed  using  immunohistochemistry  for PTEN expression  levels.   Mutation  
testing  may also be performed  on samples.  
• Pretreatment  tumor  tissue  specimens will  be analyzed  to detect  markers  of activation  of the PI3K -Akt pathway  as well as additional  alterations  that may impact  upon  
sensitivity  to Buparlisib.   Levels  of PTEN  expression  will be measured  utilizing  immunohistochemistry.  All tumors will be classified  based  upon  level of  PTEN  expression.  
If normal  DNA is required,  patients  may be asked  to provide peripheral  blood or a saliva sample  during  study  participation for comparison  with the tumor  tissue.   DNA  
extracted  from  samples   may be sequenced  to detect multiple  alterations  in both  the PI3K/Akt  pathway  in additional  genes that  may condition  response  to Buparlisib.  Other  
sequencing  methods  may also be used  to screen  tumor  and germline  DNA  for commonly  occurring  mutations  in genes within  the PI3K -Akt pathway,  including  AKT , 
PIK3CA , and FGFR3 .  Extracted  DNA will be sequenced  to detect  potential  mechanisms  of resistance  to Buparlisib.  
 
Patients  enrolling  in the Expansion  Cohort  must  have  prior mutational  testing  demonstrating  alterations  predicted  to activate  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway..

 11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Risks  are possible side effects  of study  medication  or another  medicine,  and those related  to any of 
the study procedures (e.g.  taking blood,  biopsy, imaging,  etc). 
Based  on information  from patients  already  treated  with Buparlisib  alone or in combination  with 
other medicines,  the most  frequently  reported  side effects  (in more  than 20% of patients)  include,  but 
may not be limited  to: decreased  appetite,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  pain,  constipation,  
feeling  weak  or tired,  rash with or without itching,  inflammation  and pain  in the mouth  and other  
mucosal  areas,  mood  disorders  (such  as depression,  anxiety or irritability),  shortness  of breath,  cough,  
and changes  in blood tests such as  increase  in blood  sugar, alteration  in liver tests,  decrease  in red 
blood cell counts,  change s in white  blood  cells counts,  longer time  for blood clotting  and change in  
levels  of some  electrolytes  (e.g. potassium,  sodium).  
Less frequent  side effects  (in more  than  5% of  patients) include:  indigestion  and disturbance  of taste,  
weight  loss, fever,  headache,  dizziness,  confusion,  change in  blood pressure,  pain in joints  and 
extremities,  swelling,  sleep  disturbances,  urinary  tract infection,  changes in blood tests for  kidney and 
pancreas  function.  
Uncommon  events (less than 5% of  patients) that  may nevertheless be medically  important  include:  
skin infection,  allergic reactions,  eye effects  (such  as blurred  vision,  conjunctivitis),  lung infection/  
inflammation.  A few cases reported  visual hallucinations,  seizures  and alterations  in nerve  
functioning  (mainly  in combination  with paclitaxel).  One case was reported  in a patient  with 
advanced lung cancer  committing  suicide.  
Rare  cases  of encephalopathy  have been described,  including  PRES (posterior  reversible  
encephalopathy  syndrome).

mood  stabilizers  (2nd generation  antipsychotics  such as olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_334919])  and 
antidepressants  may be applied  as per the investigator’s  discretion  and following  consultation  with a 
psychiatrist.  Buparlisib  dose will be omitted  for any patient  with mood  alterations  requiring  mood  
stabilizers  until their mood  alteration  has resolved  to < Grade  1. A log will be maintained  of all 
patients  who are discontinued  from  this trial based  on questionnaire responses  during  study.  
11.2.1  Management  of mood  alteration  
 
Patient  self-rating  mood  questionnaires  PHQ -9 (depression)  and GAD -7 (anxiety)  will be used:  
• To support assessment  of eligibility  at Screening  
• To monitor  for newly  occurring  or worsening  mood  alterations  during  the study  
 
Patient  self-rating  mood  questionnaires  for anxiety  and depression  (PHQ -9, GAD -7) will be applied  
at: 
• Screening  
• Days  1 and 15 of  Cycle  1 
• Days  1 and 15 of  Cycle  2 
• Day 1 of Cycle  3 and subsequent  cycles  (only  for patients  who have  not shown  mood  
alterations  during  the first cycle;  patients  who did should  continue  to fill out the 
questionnaire  on an every  other week  basis).  
• End of Study treatment  
• Additional  assessments  may be done  according  to the clinical  judgment  of the 
Investigator.  
• Patients  who experience  ≥ grade  [ADDRESS_413527]  until 
resolved  ≤ grade  1 or baseline  (for anxiety).  Questionnaire  responses  will be checked  
by [CONTACT_334966]  1 or baseline  (for 
anxiety).  
 
The PHQ -9 and GAD -7 in the protocol  appendix  or in the MSKCC  Medical  Records  Forms  may be 
used.  All questionnaires  will be reviewed  by a research  staff member.  The following  grading  system

 At screening,  a patient  as judged  by [CONTACT_334967]-off score  of ≥ 10 in the 
PHQ -9 or a cut-off of ≥ 15 in the GAD -7 mood  scale,  respectively,  will be excluded from  the study.  
 
During  the study,  patients  who meet  the cut-off score  of ≥ 10 (≥ CTCAE  grade  2 mood  alteration)  in 
either  questionnaire  must  see a psychiatrist  for diagnosis  and determination  of most  appropriate  
medical  treatment.  For anxiety,  this applies  only if status  has worsened  from  baseline.  Patients  who 
experience  ≥ grade [ADDRESS_413528]  until resolved  ≤ grade  1 or baseline  (for anxiety).  
Questionnaire  responses  will be checked  by [CONTACT_334968]  1 or baseline  (for anxiety).  Please  see Table  2 for further  details  on changes  in drug dosing  in 
response  to symptoms.  If an investigator  feels that a patient  requires  a dose reduction  and/or  dose 
delay  other  than those  specified  herein,  this may be allowed  after communication  with the Principle  
Investigator,  and would  not be considered  a protocol  violation.  
 
11.3 Hyperglycemia  
 
In preclinical  studies,  insulin/glucose  homeostasis  was impacted  in various  species  (mice,  rats, dogs),  
as expected  from  the mode  of action  of Buparlisib.  In both rats and dogs,  at the doses  used in the 4- 
week  studies,  these  effects  were  minimal.  However,  in mice  treated  at high doses  (30 or 60 
mg/kg/day)  a clear  induction  of insulin  resistance/insensitivity  was observed,  without  clear  influence  
of the dose or the time point  of testing.  Histopathologically,  pancreas  and liver showed  changes  
which  are in concordance  with this activity.  
 
Grade  4 Hyperglycemia  was also observed  in an ongoing  Phase  Ia study  of Buparlisib  in patients  
with solid  tumors  (CBuparlisibX2101).  Therefore,  no patients  with uncontrolled  diabetes  mellitus  
will be enrolled  in this study.  In all patients,  fasting  plasma  glucose  will obtained  at screen ing and 
will be monitored  throughout  the trial. For the treatment  of glucose  disturbances  occurring  under  
Buparlisib  treatment  investigators  are advised  to adhere  to the protocol  guidelines  outlined  in table2.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_413529] of the trial. For 
the treatment  of acute cardiac events  occurring  under  Buparlisib  treatment  investigators are advised  
to adhere  to the protocol guidelines.  Vital  signs,  including  pulse  rate and blood  pressure,  will closely  
be followed  during the early  clinical studies.  
 
11.4.1  Management  of Cardiac  events  
 
At screening,  a 12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG)  and an ECHO/MUGA  will be performed  at the  
Screening  Visit to assess eligibility  and at the  end of treatment.  Repeat  ECGs  will be performed  at the

 beginning of  every cycle and ECHO/MUGA after every  third  cycle.  Please  refer to Table  [ADDRESS_413530] dose of Buparlisib  at 100m g which  resolved  in 7 days after antibiotic  therapy  and 
discontinuation  of the  study  treatment  due to fatigue.  In the Japanese  study  BuparlisibX1101  one case 
of Pneumonitis  occurred  in a patient  given  100 mg one month  after the start of study  medication  with 
Buparlisib.  The patient  experienced  Pneumonitis  with fatal outcome  which  was concomitant  to 
progression  of underlying  malignancy  including  the progression  of existing  and the appearance  of 
new lesions  in combination  with increasing  pleural  effusion  (please  see Investigator’s  Brochure  for 
more  details).  
 
All patients  participating  in clinical  trials  administering  Buparlisib  will be routinely  asked  about  the 
occurrence  of adverse  events  which  could  include  new or changed  pulmonary  symptoms  (consistent  
with lung abnormalities).  CT scans  and pulmonary  function  test should  be done,  as clinically  
indicated,  or if there  are symptoms  that indicate  that the patient  has developed  pneumonitis.  In case 
of a documented  pneumonitis,  the guidelines  (including  dose modifications)  in Table  [ADDRESS_413531]  is highly  recommended  for any pneumonitis  case 
identified  during  the study.  
 
11.6 Management  of Liver Toxicities  
Monitoring  of liver function  tests will be performed  at: 
• Screening  
• Days  1 and 15 of  cycles  1 and 2  
• More  frequently  if clinically  indicated  and in patients  with borderline  acceptable  AST,  ALT,  
and/or bilirubin  values  at screening  
 
From  Cycle 3 onwards,  liver function  tests will be performed  monthly.  In case of any occurrence  of 
ALT/  AST/  bilirubin  increase  ≥ grade  2, the liver function  tests must  be monitored  weekly  or more  
frequently  if clinically  indicated  until  resolved to  ≤ grade  1. 
In case of any occurrence  of ALT/  AST/  bilirubin  increase  ≥ grade  3, the liver function  tests must  be 
monitored  weekly  or more  frequently  if clinically  indicated  until  resolved  to ≤ grade  1; thereafter,  
the monitoring  should  be continued  every  other  week  or more  frequently  if clinically  indicated  until  
the end of treatment  with study  medication.  
 
Patients   who  discontinued   study  treatment   should   be  monitored   weekly   or  more   frequently   if

interactions,  and are  therefore  not considered  effective  for this study.  
• Women  are considered  post-menopausal  and not of child  bearing  potential  if they  have  had 12 
months  of natural  (spontaneous)  amenorrhea  with an appropriate  clinical  profile  (e.g. age

serum  FSH levels  > 40 mIU/mL  and estradiol  < 20 pg/mL  or have  had surgical  bilateral  
oophorectomy  (with  or without  hysterectomy)  at least six weeks  ago. In the case of 
oophorectomy  alone,  only when  the reproductive  status  of the woman  has been  confirmed  by 
[CONTACT_334969].  
• Women  of child -bearing  potential,  defined  as all women  physiologically  capable  of becoming  
pregnant,  must  use highly  effective  contraception  during  the study  and for 12 weeks  after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].  Highly  effective contraception  is defined  as either:  
o True  abstinence:  When  this is in line with the preferred  and usual  lifestyle  of the 
subject.  Periodic  abstinence  (e.g.,  calendar,  ovulation,  symptothermal,  post-ovulation  
methods)  and withdrawal  are not acceptable  methods  of contraception.  
o Sterilization:  Have  had surgical  bilateral  oophorectomy  (with  or without  
hysterectomy)  or tubal  ligation  at least six weeks  ago. In case of oophorectomy  alone,  
only when  the reproductive  status  of the woman  has been  confirmed  by [CONTACT_334970].  
o Male  partner  sterilization  (with  the appropriate  post-vasectomy  documentation  of the 
absence  of sperm  in the ejaculate).  For female  subjects  on the study,  the vasectomized  
male  partner  should be the sole partner  for that patient.  
o Use of a combination  of any two of the following:  
▪ Placement  of an intrauterine  device (IUD)  or intrauterine  system  (IUS)  
▪ Barrier  methods  of contraception:  Condom  or Occlusive  cap (diaphragm  or 
cervical/vault  caps)  with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal  suppository  
o Oral contraception  as well as injected  or implanted  hormonal  methods  are not allowed  
as Buparlisib  potentially  decreases  the effectiveness  of hormonal  contraceptives.  
o Fertile  males,  defined  as all males  physiologically  capable  of conceiving  offspring  
must  use condoms  during  treatment  and for an additional  12 weeks  after study  drug 
discontinuation  and should  not father a child during this period.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the international  criteria  by [CONTACT_334971]  (RECIST)  Committee  [JNCI , 92(3):205 -216, 2000;  
EJC,  45(2):228 -247, 2009].  Changes  in the largest  diameter  (uni-dimensional  measurement)  are used 
in the RECIST  v1.1 criteria.  Note:  lesions  are either  measurable  or non-measurable  using  the criteria  
provided below:  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:  11-060 A(8) 
Amended:  12/17/13  Page  44 of 61  
  
12.1 Definitions  
Measurable lesions:  lesions  that can be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  with longest  
diameter  ≥ [ADDRESS_413533] scan (irrespective  of scanner  type)  or MRI  (no 
less than double  the slice thickness  and a minimum of 10mm). Malignant lymph  nodes must  be [ADDRESS_413534] or MRI,  can be considered  as 
measurable  lesions  if the soft  tissue  component  otherwise  meets  the definition  of measurability  
previously  described.  Blastic  bone lesions  are unmeasurable.  Tumors  that are situated  in a previously  
irradiated  area are measurable  only if unequivocal growth  can be documented.  
 
Non-measurable  lesions:  all other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  small  lesions  (longest  
diameter  < 20 mm with conventional  techniques  or < [ADDRESS_413535] scan)  are considered  
non-measurable  disease.  Leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  
cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  abdominal  masses/abdominal  organomegaly  (not 
followed  by [CONTACT_462])  are all non-measurable.  
 
Target  lesions:  all measurable  lesions  – up to a maximum  of two lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  in 
total,  representative  of all involved  organs  – should  be identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  and 
measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with the 
longest  diameter)  and their suitability  for accurate  repeated  measurements  (either  by [CONTACT_334972]).  A sum of the longest  diameter  (LD)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  
and reported  as the baseline  sum LD. The baseline  sum LD will be used as reference  by [CONTACT_334973].  
Non-target  lesions:  all other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and 
should  also be recorded  at baseline. Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence  
or absence  of each should  be noted throughout  follow -up. 
 
12.2 Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable  Disease  
All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation.  The same  method  of assessment  
and the same  technique  should  be used to characterize  each identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  
and during follow -up. 
12.3 Response  Criteria  
 
12.3.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to 
<10 mm. 
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  taking  
as reference  the baseline  sum LD. 
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  taking  
as reference  the smallest  sum LD recorded  since  the treatment  started  
or the appearance  of one or more  new lesions.  In addition  to the 
relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:  11-060 A(8) 
Amended:  12/17/[ADDRESS_413536] 5 mm. 
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  
to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum LD since  the 
treatment  started.  
 
 
12.3.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and 
normalization  of tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  
nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (< 10 
mm short axis).  
Incomplete  Response/Stable  Disease  (SD):  Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  
or/and  maintenance  of tumor  marker  level  above  the 
normal  limits.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or  
unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  
lesions.  
 
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_413537] response  recorded  from  the start of the treatment  until disease  
progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for PD the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the 
treatment  started).  In general,  the patient's  best response  assignment  will depend  on the achievement  
of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria.  
 
 
Target  lesions  Non-Target  Lesions  New  Lesions  Overall  Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete  response/SD  No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No PD

12.3.4  Confirmation  of Response  
There  will be no repeat  imaging  studies  done  solely  for the purpose  of confirming  response.  Patients

IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:  11-060 A(8) 
Amended:  12/17/[ADDRESS_413538]  follow -up imaging  studies  as outlined  in the protocol  and responses  that are confirmed  on 
follow -up scans  will be noted.  
 
12.3.5  Duration  of Overall  Response/Progression  Free  Survival  
The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time that measurement  criteria  are met for CR 
or PR (whichever  status  is recorded  first)  until the first date that recurrence  or PD is objectively  
documented,  taking  as reference  for PD the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment   
started.  
 
Progression  Free Survival  will be calculated  from  the start of treatment  until progressive  disease  or 
death.  Patients  who die before  documented  progression  will be considered  failures  at their time of 
death.  If the patient  did not progress  or die, the patient  will be censored  on the date of last follow -up. 
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL FROM  STUDY  
In the absence  of treatment  delays  due to adverse  event(s),  treatment  may continue until one of the 
following  criteria  applies:  
 
▪ Disease progression  
▪ Intercurrent  illness  that prevents  further administration  of treatment  
▪ Unacceptable adverse  events  
▪ Dose  delay  of > 21 days from  the previous dose 
▪ Patient  decides to withdraw from  the study  
▪ General or specific  changes  in the patient’s  condition  render  the patient  unacceptable  for 
further  treatment  in the judgment  of the investigator  
▪ Inability  of subject to  comply  with study requirements  
If at any time the patient is found  to be ineligible for  the protocol  as designated  in the inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria  detailed  in Section  6.0 (i.e., a  change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be removed  
from  the study.

experience  a median  PFS of 2-3 months  (Vaughn  2002;  Dreicer  2007;  Gallagher  2008).  Thus,  the 
primary  endpoint  of this study  will be the proportion  of patients  who are progression -free after eight  
weeks  on-study.   Kaplan -Meier  analysis  of PFS will  be performed.  
 
Patients  will not be considered  evaluable  for the primary  objective  (PFS  rate at 8 weeks)  if they 
receive  < one cycle  of protocol  therapy  and are discontinued  from  protocol  treatment  for either  rapid  
clinical  deterioration  related  to progression  of disease,  withdrawal  of consent,  or adverse  events  
unrelated  to Buparlisib.  These  patients  will be replaced.  They  will still be evaluable  for toxicity  
assessment.  
 
To establish  the safety  and toxicity  of Buparlisib,  the frequency  of toxicity  will be tabulated  
according  to the NCI Common  Toxicity Criteria,  version 4.0.

 A minimax  Simon  two stage  study  design  will be utilized  with a PFS rate at 8 weeks  of <60%  
considered  not promising  while  a PFS rate of 80% or greater  is considered  promising.  In stage  I of 
the trial, [ADDRESS_413540]  a negative  result.  If 9 or more  are progression -free at two months,  enrollment  will 
be extended  to accrue  a total of 35 patients.  If 26 or more  are progression -free after their two month  
scan (i.e., after stage  2), the treatment  will be considered  effective and worthy  of further  testing.  
 
 
For the purposes  of this study,  the Type  I (false  acceptance  of a non-promising  therapy)  and Type  II 
(false  rejection  of a promising  therapy)  error  rates have  been  set at 0.05 and 0.20,  respectively.  This 
statistical  design  would  effectively  discriminate  between  two-month  PFS rates  of <60%  and >80%  
and yields  80% probability  of a positive  result  if the true two-month  PFS rate is >80%.  It yields  95% 
probability  of a negative  result  if the true two-month  PFS rate is <60%.  The probability  of early  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334920] 65%.  
 
The secondary  endpoint  of response  rate will be estimated  as the proportion  of patients  meeting  the 
criteria  outlined  above  for a complete  response  or partial  response.  This proportion  will be reported  
along with its binomial  confidence  interval.  
 
An accrual  rate of 2-[ADDRESS_413541].  
Patient  samples  will be sequenced  for mutations  in PTEN  and PIK3CA  as well as for reduced  or 
absent  PTEN  expression.  Patients  will be categorized  on the basis  of PTEN  expression  levels  into 
three  categories:  no expression,  low expression,  or high expression.  PTEN  levels  and PTEN  and 
PIK3CA  mutation  status  (present/absent)  will be correlated  with PFS using  a log rank test, and with 
response  to treatment  (complete  response/partial  response  versus  no response)  using  Fisher’s  exact  
test. 
 
For the Expansion Cohort:  
 
A one-arm study design  will be utilized  with a PFS rate at 8 weeks  of < 60% considered  not 
promising  while a PFS rate  of 85% or greater is considered  promising.  21 evaluable  patients  whose  
tumors  harbor genetic  alterations  predicted  to upregulate  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway will be 
accrued  to this cohort.  If 16 or  more  patients  are progression -free at two months,  the treatment  will be 
considered  effective  and worthy  of further  testing.  
The secondary  endpoint  of response  rate will be estimated  as the proportion  of patients  meeting  the 
criteria  outlined  above  for a complete  response  or partial  response.  This proportion  will be reported  
along with its binomial  confidence  interval.  
 
An accrual  rate of 1-2 patients  per month  is anticipated  with an expected  accrual  time of 
approximately  10-20 months  for this study.

procedures will  be established  at the time  of protocol activation.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
17.1.1  Risks  of treatment  and provisions  for preventing  adverse  events  
 
Potential  risks to human  subjects  include  drug related  toxicity,  pain and discomfort  associated  with 
Buparlisib  side effects,  phlebotomy,  and possible  psychological  discomfort  from  the stresses  
associated  with obtaining  imaging  studies  (e.g.,  CT scan).  The side effects  and potential  toxicities  of 
Buparlisib  are listed  in section  11. All efforts  will be made  to avoid  any complication  by [CONTACT_334974]’  symptoms,  providing  appropriate  management,  and monitoring  blood  tests.  If an 
adverse  medical  event  occurs,  the patient  will first contact  [CONTACT_334975].  At nights  and weekends,  there  is an oncology  physician  on call at all times.  Patients  may 
either  call or come  directly  to the urgent  care center  at Memorial  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (or to their local  
emergency  room)  to be seen.  Patients  suffering  serious  adverse  reactions  must  be carefully  followed  
and all follow -up information  recorded.  
Safety assessments  will consist  of monitoring  and recording  all adverse  events  and serious  adverse  
events,  the regular  monitoring  of hematology,  blood  chemistry  and urine  values,  regular  
measurement  of vital signs  and the performance  of physical  examinations.  These  assessments  
should  be performed  within  ±2 days  of the scheduled  day of assessment  except  for adverse  events  
that will be evaluated  continuously  through  the study.  
 
 
17.1.2  Alternatives/Options  for treatment  
 
Patients  can elect to receive  conventional  chemotherapeutics  such as paclitaxel  or pemetrexed  for their 
metastatic  urothelial  cancer.  However,  there  is no FDA -approved  drug in this setting.  Patients  can also 
elect to receive  best supportive  care or to participate  in another  clinical  trial. Participation  in a clinical  
trial is  voluntary.

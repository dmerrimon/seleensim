1.1 Disease Background
The keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) is a benign odontogenic neoplasm that has 
destructive and infiltrative behavior [1]. KCOT can occur as part of nevoid basal cell 
carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS)  or as a sporadic case. KCOTs are the most prominent 
feature of NBCCS and they are present in 65-100% of cases [2]. Four to five percent of 
KCOT patients have NBCCS [3]. Although KCOTs are benign, they tend to be aggressive, 
with local invasion of bony structures, extensive growth, and potential for substantial 
disfigurement  [4]. This condition has a high recurrence  rate and it is estimated that after 
initial treatment  with various procedures recurrence  ranges from 2.5% to 62.5%[ 5];[6]. 
The only therapeutic option  for patients  affected by [CONTACT_440591];  often  multiple surgeries are required.  Thus, the 
management of patients  with KCOT has challenged and frustrated both patients and 
providers[6]. 
Research findings  suggest that mutations in PTCH1 are frequent in both sporadic KCOT 
(29%) and NBCCS-associated KCOT (approximately 88%). Thus PTCH1  gene  mutations  
may play a significant  role in the pathogenesis  of NBCCS  and the related  sporadic 
tumors   [7]. In this study, we plan to test GDC-0449 (Vismodegib)  as novel  treatment in 
two groups  of patients: NBCCS-associated KCOT and sporadic KCOT cohort. The 
inclusion of this two-group cohort is based on the evidence that mutations of the 
hedgehog (Hh) pathway are present  in both groups  and consequently  all patients 
affected by  [CONTACT_440592] a systemic Hh pathway antagonist. 
We hypothesize that an inhibitor of the sonic Hh can be an important therapeutic 
advancement in the treatment of KCOT. This study proposes  to test GDC-0449 
(Vismodegib) for treating patients  with KCOT. This drug has the potential to reverse 
KCOT proliferation.  GDC-[ADDRESS_558759], which  is 
involved in tumorigenesis, thus providing a strong rationale for its use in the treatment of 
a variety  of cancers. Phase I clinical trials in patients  with advanced basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC)  and medulloblastoma (MB)  highlighted an objective  response to GDC-
0449. Reported side effects  were  minor, with only one grade  [ADDRESS_558760] recently been  completed[8] . 
Because of its low toxicity and specificity for the Hh pathway, this drug has potential  
Page [ADDRESS_558761] 2016advantages compared with conventional chemotherapy, and may also be used in 
combination treatments. 
On 30 January 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) approved  
ERIVEDGE® (vismodegib) capsules for the treatment of adults  with metastatic basal 
cell carcinoma (mBCC),  or with locally advanced basal  cell carcinoma (laBCC) that has 
recurred following  surgery or who are not candidates  for surgery, and who are not 
candidates for radiation. On 12 July 2013,  vismodegib  was approved for the treatment 
of adult patients with symptomatic metastatic basal  cell carcinoma and locally advanced 
basal cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy  based  on a conditional 
marketing authorization from the  European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Recently it was reported that GDC-0449 was effective in treating  recurrent KCOTs in a 
single patient [9]. The patient was a 55-year-old  man with NBCCS. In addition to having 
multiple BCCs over a [ADDRESS_558762] oral bioavailability and potent anti-tumor activity in 
a variety  of primary human tumor xenografts and tumor  cell line xenograft models (see 
the Vismodegib Investigator’s Brochure and  the U.S. package insert for further details).

Phase I Study  SHH3925g - Safety  and Pharmacokinetics Assessment
A Phase  I, company-sponsored clinical  trial (SHH3925g) assessed  the safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of vismodegib and responses of metastatic BCC (mBCC) or 
locally advanced BCC (aBCC) to the drug [10]. Thirty-three patients with mBCC or 
locally aBCC  received oral vismodegib  at one of three doses: 17 patients  received  150 
mg per day, 15 patients received 270 mg per day, and 1 patient received 540 mg per 
day (median duration  of treatment was 9.8 months). Of the 33 patients, 18 had an 
objective response to vismodegib, according to assessment on imaging (7 patients),  
physical examination  (10 patients), or both (1 patient). Of the patients who had a 
response (see Table 1), 2 had complete responses (CRs) and 16 had partial responses 
(PRs). The other 15 patients had either stable  disease (11 patients) or progressive  
disease (4 patients). Eight Grade 3 adverse  events (AEs) that were deemed to be 
possibly related to the study drug were reported in 6 patients (see Table 2), including 
fatigue (4 AEs), hyponatremia (2 AEs),  muscle spasm (1 AE), and atrial  fibrillation  (1 
AE). One patient  withdrew from the study because of AEs.

Phase II Study ERIVANCE (SHH4476g) in Metastatic and Locally  Advanced Basal 
Cell Carcinoma
A multicenter, international,  two-cohort, nonrandomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], Phase II, company-
sponsored study (SHH4476g) enrolled patients  with mBCC and those  with locally aBCC 
who had inoperable disease or for whom surgery was inappropriate (because  of 
multiple recurrences and a low likelihood of surgical cure, or substantial  anticipated 
disfigurement) [11]. In 33 patients  with metastatic  BCC (see Table 3), the independently  
assessed response rate was 30% (95% confidence interval  [CI], 16 to 48; p=0.001). In 
63 patients with locally aBCC (see Table  4), the independently  assessed response rate 
was 43% (95% CI, 31 to 56; p<0.001), with complete responses  in 13 patients (21%). 
The median duration of response was 7.6 months in both cohorts at the time of data 
cutoff.  Muscle spasms, alopecia,  dysgeusia, weight loss, and fatigue occurred in more 
than 30% of patients, whereas serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 25% of 
patients. Seven deaths due to AEs were  reported and none  of the deaths were related 
to vismodegib.
Page [ADDRESS_558766] 2016Based on the results  of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], vismodegib was approved  on 30 January, 2012 
by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for the treatment  of adults with mBCC, 
or with locally aBCC that has recurred following surgery  or who are not candidates for 
surgery, and who are  not candidates for  radiation. [ 12].

Expanded Access Study (SHH4811g)  in Advanced BCC
An open-label, single-arm, multicenter, expanded  access study (SHH4811g) of an oral 
repeating dose of vismodegib  was conducted in patients with locally aBCC  or mBCC,  
who are otherwise without satisfactory treatment  options. Safety  of vismodegib  and 
objective response in patients with measurable disease (RECIST v1.0)  were assessed 
(Weiss G, et al. 2012).  The study  has been  completed following FDA approval and 
commercial availability of vismodegib.
Among 95 efficacy  evaluable patients (56 patients with locally aBCC and 39 patients 
with mBCC) at the time of final analysis data cutoff date of 23 April 2012  the observed 
objective response rates (see Table  7) were 46.4% (95%  CI, 33.0%,  60.3%) for patients 
with locally aBCC (n = 56) and 30.8%  (95% CI, 17.0%, 47.6%)  for patients with mBCC 
(n = 39). CR, PR, and stable disease  (SD) were observed in 10.7%, 35.7%, and 48.2%,  
respectively, of patients  with locally aBCC; no patients in this cohort exhibited 
progressive disease (PD) as best response. For patients with mBCC,  CR, PR, and SD 
rates observed were 5.1%, 25.6%, and 51.3%, respectively. In this cohort,  7.7% of 
patients exhibited PD as best response.  Among patients with locally aBCC  who 
responded the median  and mean  times to response were 2.6 months and 3.5 months,  
respectively; and among patients with mBCC who responded  the median and mean 
times to response were 2.6 months and 3.8  months, respectively.
As of the final analysis  data cutoff  date of 23 April 2012, 116 of 119 safety evaluable 
patients (97.5%) experienced  at least one adverse event (22 SAEs total,  see Table 8). 
Page [ADDRESS_558770] reported occurrences ( 20%) in 119 safety 
evaluable patients  were:  muscle  spasms (84 patients; 70.6%),  dysgeusia (84 patients; 
70.6%), alopecia  (69 patients; 58.0%), and diarrhea (30 patients; 25.2%).  Only one of 
22 SAEs (4.5%) was assessed as being  related to treatment with vismodegib:  a Grade

Phase II BCNS Study (SHH4685s) 
The anti–BCC efficacy of vismodegib was tested in a randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled, Investigator-sponsored  trial in Gorlin syndrome (BCNS) patients  
with surgically eligible BCCs [13-15].  Forty-one patients were randomized 2:1 to 
receive oral vismodegib (n=26) or placebo (n=15). After a mean follow  up of 8 months 
(range, 1 to 15 months), the per-patient rate of new surgically eligible  BCCs (SEBs) was 
lower with vismodegib than with placebo (2 vs. 29 cases per group per year, p<0.001), 
as was the size (percent change  from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter)  of 
existing clinically significant BCCs (–65% vs. –11%, p=0.003). In some patients,  all 
BCCs clinically  regressed.   No tumors progressed during treatment with vismodegib.  
Patients receiving  vismodegib routinely had Grade 1 or 2 AEs of loss of taste, muscle 
cramps, hair loss, and weight  loss.  Overall, 54% of patients (14 of 26) receiving  
vismodegib discontinued  drug treatment due to AEs.  At [ADDRESS_558773]'s target-gene expression in BCC cells by 90% (p<0.001) and 
diminished tumor-cell  proliferation, but apoptosis was not affected.  No residual BCC 
was detectable in 83% of biopsy samples  taken  from sites of clinically  regressed BCCs.  
At the second pre-specified interim analysis, a data safety  and monitoring board 
concluded that the pre-determined threshold  for a significant difference between the two 
groups had been reached (p<0.0113), and the treatment with placebo in this arm was 
terminated.  AEs reported  in   10% of patients are summarized in Table  9 See the 
Vismodegib Investigator’s  Brochure  and the U.S. package insert  for additional details  on 
nonclinical and clinical studies on vismodegib.

Phase II STEVIE (MO25616) Safety Study
Study MO25616 is an ongoing Phase  II open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter (ex-U.S.) 
study of vismodegib in patients  with locally  aBCC or mBCC who are otherwise without 
satisfactory treatment  options.   The primary objective is to assess the safety of 
vismodegib in patients with locally  aBCC or mBCC.  Secondary objectives are to assess 
the overall response  (according  to RECIST Version 1.1)  in those  patients with 
measurable disease as permitted by [CONTACT_440593], duration of response, PFS and overall 
survival (OS).
All patients receive 150 mg vismodegib  orally (PO)  daily (QD) until investigator-
assessed PD, unmanageable toxicities, or withdrawal from study (investigator/patient 
request) or termination by [CONTACT_16049]).

Results of an  interim  analysis, when a total of 501 patients  could  be followed for 1 year,  
are presented below.
As of the cutoff date of 6 November  2013,  safety data  were available for 500 patients 
(469 with locally aBCC and 31  with mBCC) with follow  up information for at least 
3 months after treatment.  Overall,  492 of 500 safety-evaluable patients (98.4%)  
experienced at least one AE.   The most frequently reported AEs,  regardless of 
relationship to  study drug,  in descending order  of frequency,  were:  muscle  spasms 
(63.2%), alopecia (61.0%), dysgeusia (53.8%), weight decreased (32.4%),  asthenia 
(28.2%), decreased  appetite (25.4%), and ageusia (22.4%).
As of 6 November 2013, 210 of  500 safety-evaluable patients (42.0%) experienced 
Grade 3−5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  Of 500 patients,  165 patients 
(33.0%) experienced a Grade 3 AE, 24  patients  (4.8%) experienced  a Grade  [ADDRESS_558776] 201621 patients (4.2%) experienced  a Grade [ADDRESS_558777] and myocardial infarction.
Of the 500 patients, 107 (21.4%)  experienced  SAEs.  The most common events were in 
the following system organ  classes:  infections and  infestations,  30 patients (6.0%); 
neoplasms (benign, malignant, and unspecified, including cysts  and polyps), 16 patients  
(3.2%); general disorders and administration site conditions, 12 patients  (2.4%);

patients.  The causes  of death  were  PD in 4 patients, AE in 20 patients,  and 5 patients 
with “other” as cause of death.   Most patient  deaths were  considered unrelated to 
treatment with vismodegib.  Two deaths  (cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiac  infarction) 
were assessed by [CONTACT_440594];  however, both patients  had 
significant risk factors and comorbidities.  Both  events were considered  by [CONTACT_440595]; therefore, an association could not be 
excluded.
As of 6 November 2013, 400 of  500 patients (80%) treated during Study MO25616 had 
discontinued study drug.  Reasons  for discontinuation of study  drug included: AE 
(178 patients, 35.6%);  progression of  disease  (70 patients, 14.0%); patient  request 
(62 patients, 12.4%);  death (10 patients,  2.8%);  investigator  request (14 patients, 2.8%); 
lost to follow-up (4 patients, 0.8%); and  other  (62 patients, 12.4%).
The majority of patients (98.2%)  in Study MO25616 (STEVIE)  experienced TEAEs.  The 
most common ( 20%) TEAEs included  muscle  spasm (63.2 %), alopecia (61.0%), 
dysgeusia (53.8%), weight decreased (32.4%), asthenia (28.2%),  decreased appetite 
(25.4%), and ageusia  (22.4%).   Twenty-four (4.8%) Grade 4  events  and 21 (4.2%)  
Grade 5 events  were  reported.  Two of  the deaths were considered related  to 
vismodegib treatment (cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_440569]).  There were 
107 (21.4%) patients who reported SAEs.  Common SAEs that were reported  in  1% of 
patients were pneumonia (1.8%,  n  9), general physical health deterioration  (1.4%, 
n  7), and dehydration (1.0%, n  5).
Interim results  of the STEVIE study  demonstrate that vismodegib is  generally well 
tolerated in a patient  population that is representative of patients treated in routine 
clinical practice, with  a safety profile  consistent with that previously observed  in other 
vismodegib studies.  Investigator-assessed  response rates  are consistent with those 
reported in the  ERIVANCE study  and confirm high rates of tumor control.
As the  trial is ongoing, efficacy  analyses  will be  presented at final analysis.
Page [ADDRESS_558779] 2016Phase II Operable Basal Cell  Carcinoma (SHH4812g) Study
The ability of  vismodegib to induce  complete  histological clearance (CHC) of BCC 
tumors, an important step in assessing the role of the drug in the setting of smaller 
resectable lesions, was  examined in  a single-arm, 3-cohort,  Phase II study (Sofen et al. 
2015).  Patients in the trial were required to have one clinically operable,  nodular BCC 
lesion on the scalp (0.5  2.0 cm maximum diameter)  or in the "cape" area (chest,  
shoulders, or upper  back; 1.0  3.0 cm maximum  diameter).  The nodular BCC required 
a positive biopsy that was limited to   25%  of the target  lesion.  After 12 weeks of oral 
vismodegib (150  mg QD), patients  were assessed clinically and then underwent 
excision of the target  tumor site for pathologic assessment of residual carcinoma,  
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-excision of the  tumor  site for margin assessment using standard Mohs 
techniques. 
Efficacy objectives for CHC were not met in this  study.  The CHC  rates were  42% 
(10/24) in Cohort 1, 16% (4/25) in Cohort 2, and 44%  (11/25) in Cohort 3; these 
clearance rates were not statistically significant  (p-values of 0.8463, 0.9668, and 
0.7878, respectively).   The low response rate in  Cohort 2  (4 [16%] of 25 patients) 
indicates a lack of durable response.  Investigator-assessed clinical response  (CR and 
PR) did not correlate with CHC.  Time to complete clinical clearance  in patients in 
Cohorts 1 (10 patients), 2 (9 patients),  and 3 (18 patients)  with investigator-assessed  
CR, the time to first CR was 59.5 days  (95% CI: 28.0  80.0 days), 84.0 days (95% CI:  
27.0  120.0 days), and  60.0 days (95% CI: 55.0  86.0 days), respectively.  
No new safety  signals were  noted  for patients in this study after dosing with vismodegib 
[ADDRESS_558780] patients during the  24-week follow-up  
period in Cohort 2.
Efficacy objectives for CHC were not met in this  study.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary  Objectives
The primary objectives of the  study  are:
a.To evaluate the efficacy  of GDC-0449 in reducing KCOT size (shrinkage)  in 
NBCCS-associated KCOT and sporadic KCOT patients  following 6 to 12 months 
of ingestion of 150 mg/day, up to [ADDRESS_558785]-
treatment follow-up.
b.To evaluate the safety of this  dose of GDC-0449 in these patients. 
Tumor response (reduction in tumor volume  and shrinkage) will be measured by 
[CONTACT_440598].
Time Frame: Efficacy will be assessed at 1 year and 2 years after the study medication 
is stopped.  Patients will undergo evaluation for 3 years (up to [ADDRESS_558786]-treatment follow-up). All patients will participate in the assessment 
of the safety and tolerability  of the study drug. Safety monitoring  will capture risks 
related to study  participation  and adverse  events related to the study drug.
Page [ADDRESS_558787] [ZIP_CODE].2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives  of the study  are:
a.To determine the time of response of a GDC-[ADDRESS_558788]  (i.e. 
tumor shrinkage) after administration  of the drug up to one year or until treatment  
is stopped; 
b.To assay germ line PTCH1 mutations before treatment with GDC-0449 in 
patients with NBCCS-associated KCOT; 
If tumor removal  is required, to assess tumor PTCH1 mutations before and after 
treatment with GDC-0449 in NBCCS-associated KCOT  and sporadic KCOT in order  to 
determine the correlation of tumor response and the presence of tumor  PTCH1 
mutation.
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
This is a single-center,  interventional, single-arm, open-label, two-cohort clinical trial. A 
total of 40 patients will be screened  in order  for 20 patients to be enrolled  (10 with 
NBCCS-associated KCOT and 10 with sporadic KCOT)  over a period of [ADDRESS_558789]-treatment  follow-up.  If a patient  is experiencing an ongoing adverse event 
at the time of the study  completion, he/she  will be followed-up until resolution  of the 
adverse event  or until the condition has stabilized. The same applies  to patients who 
are withdrawn from the study due to  adverse events.
It is estimated that it will take approximately 2 years to recruit 20 patients for the study 
(10 with  NBCCS-associated KCOT and 10  with sporadic KCOT).  
All patients will be assessed for safety  and efficacy  of the study  drug GDC-0449 
(Vismodegib).

questions the patient might have about  the study. A signed consent form documenting  
informed consent for eligible  subjects will be obtained  prior to the start of any study 
procedures.  Advertisements such as flyer and web ad will be used in this study for 
recruitment of subjects.  Web ad will be posted on NYU Bluestone website. All 
advertisements will be approved by [CONTACT_440600].  A doctoral  referral  letter will be sent out via email and/or mail to oral and 
maxillofacial surgeons, asking for referral  of eligible subjects who might be interested in 
the study.  A publically available directory will be used  to obtain the contact [CONTACT_440601].  A doctoral referral letter will be accompanied 
with the drug package  insert, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the study  flyer.
4.2 Study Treatment 
This is a single-center, interventional, single-arm, phase II, open-label, two-cohort 
clinical trial. A total of 40 patients will be screened in order  for 20 patients to be enrolled 
(10 with NBCCS-associated KCOT and 10 with sporadic KCOT)  over a period of 2 
years. Only patients with a diagnosis of recurrent (maxillary  or mandibular) sporadic 
KCOT or NBCCS-associated KCOT (single  or multiple) will be recruited. All patients  will 
receive 150 mg/day of GDC-0449 (Vismodegib) orally for 1 year.  All patients  will be 
assessed for safety  and efficacy of the study  drug GDC-0449 (Vismodegib).
This is a [ADDRESS_558798]-treatment follow-up.
The Sponsor  Investigator of the study  will ensure maintenance  of complete and 
accurate records of the receipt, dispensation, and disposal  or return of all Vismodegib  in 
accordance with 21 Code of Federal  Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 312.[ADDRESS_558799] 2016The recommended dose of Vismodegib is 150 mg taken QD PO until disease 
progression or until unacceptable toxicity. Vismodegib  may be taken with or without 
food. Swallow capsules whole. 
Do not open or crush capsules
If a dose of vismodegib is missed, do not make up  that dose;  resume dosing with 
the next scheduled dose.
Vismodegib  Dose  and Schedule  Modifications
Vismodegib dose modifications and  schedule modifications  during the study  are not 
recommended due to the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug (see Vismodegib  
Investigator Brochure v10, Section 5.9.3). Briefly, vismodegib’s pharmacokinetic profile 
is a result of high affinity, reversible binding to Alpha-1  acid Glycoprotein  (AAG) and 
binding to albumin, in addition  to solubility limited absorption and slow metabolic 
elimination properties[24]. Initiation of less frequent administration  schedules than 
the approved dose and schedule of vismodegib of 150 mg orally once  daily,(i.e. 150 
mg three times weekly [TIW]  or 150  mg once weekly  dosing), was associated with 
marked decrease  in the pharmacologically active unbound  fraction.
Unbound steady-state vismodegib concentrations were 60% and 85% lower for the TIW 
and QW dose groups, respectively, relative  to the QD dose group [25, 26].  Such 
decreases may be associated with loss of vismodegib activity  based on findings from 
nonclinical models. Integrated PK/pharmacodynamic modeling of vismodegib in 
xenograft models has revealed  a steep relationship between  pathway modulation (GLI1  
inhibition) and anti-tumor effect,  suggesting that even small  reductions in exposure 
could lead to dramatic loss in vismodegib activity (see Vismodegib Investigator’s 
Brochure v10, Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Dose  reduction  of vismodegib  is not permitted  as there  is only a 150-mg  capsule  
strength  available.  Capsules  should  not be opened  or crushed.  If a treatment  
interruption  occurs,  and it is determined  that vismodegib  will be re-started,  the original  
dose  will be maintained
Vismodegib Overdosage
There is no information on overdosage in humans. In clinical trials, ERIVEDGE  capsule 
was administered at 540 mg QD PO; exposure did not increase  between  [ADDRESS_558800] gelatin capsule  formulation  for oral 
administration. The capsule fill consists  of vismodegib and the following excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
Page [ADDRESS_558801] 2016microcrystalline cellulose PH101,  lactose monohydrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone  
K29/32, sodium starch glycolate, talc, magnesium stearate, and purified water. All of 
these excipi[INVESTIGATOR_440570] (USP/NF-EP) grade. The capsule shell consists  of 
gelatin, red iron oxide, black iron oxide, and titanium dioxide. A compendial-grade  black 
printing ink may be used.
Vismodegib capsules should  be stored  in the recommended storage conditions 
at15°C−30°C Information on the shelf life of the  capsules is  provided on the label.  
Vismodegib Packaging and Labeling 
Genentech, Inc., the manufacture of ERIVEDGE®, will label and package  the study drug 
on behalf of  the Sponsor Investigator  for this  clinical research study.   
Please refer  to the Master Label  Certification  from Genentech, Inc. for detailed 
information about labeling and packaging for the study drug.
Preparation and Administration of Study Drug
Study drug  will be supplied by [CONTACT_8229], Inc in labeled  75cc HDPE bottle.  Each bottle  
will contain [ADDRESS_558802] until the next visit. 
Dispensing records will document  quantities received and quantities  dispensed, lot 
number (if applicable), date dispensed, patient identifier  number, and initials of the 
person dispensing the study drugs.  Subjects  will bring back  the study drug bottle  with 
any unused study drug at each study  visits to monitor their compliance.
Drug Accountability
Receipt of Drug Supplies
Upon receipt of the of the study treatment supplies, an inventory  must be performed  and 
a drug receipt log filled out and signed  by [CONTACT_17247].  It is 
important that the designated study staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains 
all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable study  drug in a 
given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in the study files.  The 
investigator must notify study  sponsor of any damaged or unusable  study treatments 
that were supplied  to the  investigator’s  site.
Storage
Page [ADDRESS_558803] 2016The boxes containing the study drug will be stored at room temperature under secured  
conditions with limited  access. The study  drug will be stored  in room #236 in Bluestone 
Center for Clinical  Research.  Room #[ADDRESS_558804] swipe access secure room 
with approximately 50 square feet of space  and approximately  15 linear feet of 
countertop space for processing medication  orders. Room #236 contains two security 
cameras which are under 24 hour surveillance by [CONTACT_440602]’s security 
team.
Dispensing of Study  Drug
Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document drug assigned, drug 
consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged  on the drug 
reconciliation form, and signed and dated  by [CONTACT_415856].
Return or  Destruction of Study  Drug
At the completion  of the study,  there  will be a final reconciliation  of drug shipped, drug 
consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged  on the drug 
reconciliation form, signed and dated.   Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, 
resolved, and documented prior to return  or destruction of unused  study  drug.   Drug 
destroyed on site  will be documented in the  study files.
4.3 Concomitant and Excluded Therapy 
Drugs that Inhibit or Induce Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 
Vismodegib elimination involves multiple  pathways. Vismodegib  is predominantly 
excreted as an unchanged drug. Several minor  metabolites are produced by [CONTACT_440603]. Although  vismodegib is a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4  in vitro, 
CYP inhibition is not predicted to alter vismodegib systemic exposure  since  similar 
steady-state plasma  vismodegib  concentrations were observed in patients  in clinical 
trials concomitantly treated with CYP3A4  inducers (i.e., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], modafinil, and 
phenobarbital) and those concomitantly  treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., 
erythromycin, and fluconazole). 
Drugs that Inhibit Drug Transport  Systems  
In vitro studies indicate  that vismodegib is a substrate  of the efflux transporter P-
glycoprotein (P-gp).  When ERIVEDGE is coadministered with drugs that inhibit P-gp 
(e.g. clarithromycin,  erythromycin, azithromycin),  systemic exposure  of vismodegib and 
incidence ofAEs  of ERIVEDGE may be  increased. 
Drugs that Affect Gastric pH 
Drugs that alter the pH of the upper  gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g. proton pump 
inhibitors, H2-receptor  antagonists, antacids)  may alter the solubility  of vismodegib  and 
reduce its bioavailability. However, no formal clinical  study has been conducted to 
evaluate the effect of gastric pH altering agents on the systemic exposure of 
vismodegib. Increasing  the dose of ERIVEDGE when coadministered with such  agents  
Page [ADDRESS_558805] on efficacy of 
ERIVEDGE is unknown.
Effects of Vismodegib  on Other  Drugs
Results of a drug-drug interaction study  conducted in cancer patients  demonstrated that 
the systemic exposure of rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) or oral contraceptives 
(ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) is not altered when either drug is co-administered 
with vismodegib.
In vitro studies  indicate that vismodegib  is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19  
and the transporter  BCRP. Vismodegib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or 
CYP3A4/5 in human hepatocytes.
4.4 Study Assessments
Study assessments and procedures  for efficacy and safety are detailed in Appendix A.  
Patients’ screening information  will be recorded  on the  Screening and Enrollment Log.  
Clinical Laboratories and Vital  Signs
Safety evaluations  include clinical laboratory  assessments as set forth in the Schedule 
of Study  Assessments and Procedures  in Appendix A. Safety and tolerability will be 
measured by [CONTACT_20721], physical examination, complete  blood count,  vital signs,  
and oral cavity assessments.  Details of laboratory procedures are provided  in the 
laboratory manual for the study.  
Samples of blood will be taken  on selected visits (see Appendix A). 20 mL (inclusive)  of 
blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_440604]. Approximately 100 mL of 
blood will be drawn over the course  of the study (Screening through the completion of 
the Treatment Phase)  for clinical laboratory assessments. Patients consenting to have a 
blood sample drawn  for future DNA analysis will have an additional 7-[ADDRESS_558806] of the normal  ranges used by [CONTACT_440605] a  statement of accreditation  (or similar) for the laboratory.
Complete blood count,  serum pregnancy test, serum chemistry, coagulation time, and 
liver function will be assessed  and include  the following  measures: white blood count, 
hemoglobin, platelets, glucose, uric acid,  calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, alkaline phosphatase,  albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT),  aspartate 
transaminase (AST),  BUN and creatinine.
Female patients of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test. A pregnancy 
test will be performed by [CONTACT_440606] a dipstick. All laboratory results will 
be reviewed and the reports signed by [CONTACT_2413]. 
Page [ADDRESS_558807] be dealt with and followed up 
as clinically  appropriate. All laboratory results  considered to represent an adverse event 
(AE) must be documented  in the case  report form (CRF). Repeat samples will be taken  
if required for clinical follow  up or because the sample is lost or damaged. Any abnormal  
end of treatment clinical laboratory  result of clinical significance must be repeated  at 
regular intervals until it returns  to normal, or until an investigator is satisfied that the 
abnormality is not related to  the drug and needs  no further  investigation. 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart  rate and temperature)  will be obtained for safety  
monitoring.
Optional Blood Sample for Future Genetic Testing
If a subject agrees  to provide a blood  sample  for future genetic testing, an additional 
blood sample will be collected at Baseline  and also at one year visit if subject has new 
tumor.  Human DNA will be extracted  from the blood and stored  at the Bluestone Center 
for Clinical Research for up to 10 years  to be used for DNA sequencing as part of a 
future study related to KCOT. PCR amplification of exons encoding the open reading  
frame of genes associated with KCOT will be carried out using nested primers prior to 
sequencing PCR products in both the sense and antisense  directions.  Identified 
mutations will be confirmed by [CONTACT_440607].  The 
genetic testing will not include tests  that can identify patients’ risks for other conditions. 
Only users authorized by [CONTACT_440608]. The stored  samples will be labeled  with the subject 
code, diagnosis and/or location of the sample.  The linking key between subject code  
and subject identity will be maintained by [CONTACT_978].  The subject may withdraw their 
samples from storage and future use  by [CONTACT_1541] a  written request to the PI.
Oral Cavity  Assessment, Head & Neck,  & Physical Exam
At the scheduled time points, according  to the Schedule of Study Assessments and 
Procedures in Appendix A, study  personnel will perform a comprehensive oral exam 
consisting of an evaluation of oral hard and soft tissue structures for each patient.  Oral 
hard tissue assessments  will be performed with a dental mirror on the teeth and bony 
structures.  Oral soft tissues will be performed  by [CONTACT_440609]’s mouth and 
pharynx, including  lips, tongue, floor of the mouth, palate, gingiva, alveolar mucosa,  
buccal mucosa, oropharynx, tonsils, uvula, and salivary glands using  palpation 
techniques and  visualization.  
A complete  extraoral physical exam of the head and neck  regions will also be noted by 
[CONTACT_440610]-manual palpation. This assessment will be performed  during the 
baseline visit  and the treatment and post-treatment phase of the study. 
In addition to the oral hard tissue assessments, extraoral  and head  and neck  
examinations, a complete physical  exam  will be done during the baseline and treatment 
Page [ADDRESS_558808] 2016phase of the study. This exam  will include the examination  of the cardiovascular,  
pulmonary, abdomen and nervous  system.
Dermatologic Assessments
A thorough skin examination will be performed by a study investigator for NBCCS-
associated KCOT  patients at different time points (see Appendix A for more details). 
The purpose of this exam will be to identify any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352]. Patients with 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440571] a dermatologist as per standard of care.  
Photographs of the lesions will be taken  and all findings will be recorded on the relevant  
CRF. Follow-up visits with a dermatologist will be conducted for patients  with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440572].  All findings by a dermatologist will be kept with the 
study records.
Any abnormal findings will be documented.   Any abnormalities noted  at the Baseline  
visit, may be reason to exclude  a patient  from the study.  At the time of the first study 
drug administration or post-dose, should an adverse event be reported, the investigator 
will determine which safety  assessments  should be performed.  All findings will be 
recorded on the respective CRF.  
Any clinically  significant signs or symptoms that are present at, or during the Baseline  
visit, and that worsen during or after study  drug administration, will be recorded as 
adverse events on the adverse  event  CRF. Non-significant clinical abnormalities will 
also be recorded on the relevant  CRF.
Photography
When applicable, any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440573]’s study chart.  Photographs  will 
only contain images of the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440574]. The patient’s face will not be visible in the 
photograph.
Panoramic Radiograph and Volumetric CT Scan
Tumor volume will be measured at baseline, and tumor response (reduction in tumor 
volume and recurrence) will be measured  during the treatment phase and post-
treatment phase  by [CONTACT_440611].  The use of 
Panoramic Radiograph and Volumetric  CT scan to measure  the tumor volume  are 
obtained for clinical  assessment purposes only. No additional scans  will be performed  
for research purposes. Disease progression during the treatment phase will be 
classified by [CONTACT_440612] 20%, with an absolute change greater than [ADDRESS_558809] 2016If the patient had a previous biopsy  performed, a tissue slide will be obtained for study 
purposes and confirmation of KCOT diagnosis.  If clinically indicated, an additional 
biopsy of the tumor  will be done  and if the patient agrees, the leftover tissue from the 
tumor biopsy will be stored for future genetic  analysis  related  to KCOT.  The storing of 
tumor for future genetic analysis  is optional and will be stored for 10 years.  These 
additional biopsies will be flash-frozen  in liquid nitrogen (LN2) and stored in LN2 at the 
Bluestone Center  for Clinical  Research. 
The future genetic  testing  will not include tests that can identify patients’ risks for other 
conditions. Only users authorized by [CONTACT_440613]. The stored samples  will be labeled with 
the subject code,  diagnosis and/or  location  of the sample. The linking  key between 
subject code  and subject identity will be maintained by [CONTACT_978].  The subject may 
withdraw their samples from storage  and future use by [CONTACT_1541] a written request to the 
PI.
Assessment of Gene Mutations  and Gene  Expression in Tumor Specimens: The 
additional fresh-frozen tumor specimens will be subjected  to gene mutation and gene 
expression analysis. If no additional fresh-frozen specimen  is obtained,  the initial biopsy 
samples, which are formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), will be used instead.  
FFPE tissue scraped from serially  cut slides  will be deparaffinized using  Envirene 
reagent (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa  Maria, CA, [LOCATION_003]) before  isolation  of RNA using  the 
[COMPANY_002] High Pure FFPE RNA Micro Kit ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics,  Indianapolis, IN). RNA will 
be extracted from fresh-frozen  tissue  using  the High Pure RNA Tissue Kit ([COMPANY_002] 
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). RNA will be reversed transcribed using  the High-Capacity  
cDNA Reverse  Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster  City, CA, [LOCATION_003])  with 
random primers. PCR will be carried  out using  the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix 
(Applied Biosystems), with the following  cycling  conditions: 50°C  for 2 min; 95°C  for 10 
min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for [ADDRESS_558810] 
will be normalized to the average cycling  threshold (Ct) of three  housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582]  
(GUSB, SDHA, and   UBC).
For gene mutation analysis, DNA will be extracted from the fresh-frozen or formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue  sections. PCR amplification of exons encoding  
the open reading  frame of genes associated with KCOT  will be carried  out using nested 
primers prior to sequencing PCR products in both the sense and antisense directions.   
Identified mutations will be confirmed by [CONTACT_440614]. 
Potential Risks to Participants 
Information on potential risks to patients  participating in this study  is as  follows:
•Oral Examinations/Head and Neck Examination:  
Page [ADDRESS_558811]/hygienist will perform the procedures. The risks from the 
oral examination include minor discomfort or minor pain during  the procedures.
•Biological Sample  Collection:  
Urine (if female  of child bearing potential)  will be collected. This collection processes 
minimal risk to the patient.  
•Blood Sampling Collection:
Peripheral blood  sampling will be performed by a trained phlebotomist,  nurse, dentist or 
physician utilizing standard venipuncture techniques.  Patients  may have some 
discomfort and/or bruising at the site of needle entry.  There is a very small risk of 
fainting.  Infection in the area of the needle  insertion is rare.  Preventive  measures will 
be used during sample  collection  to reduce  the risk of these rare side  effects.
•GDC-0449  Administration: 
Vismodegib is a previously studied  drug.  Our knowledge of adverse events related to 
vismodegib results from clinical  trials. Adverse  reactions and the associated incidence 
related to vismodegib are documented. Participants will be closely  monitored  for 
previously-reported and unrecognized adverse  events. Tumor  growth in participants on 
the drug is possible; however,  participants  will be monitored with both clinical  and 
radiographic examination to identify such growth. Participants  on vismodegib might 
avoid surgery  and the morbidity  (i.e., loss of bone and teeth) associated  with surgery.
GDC-0449 (Vismodegib) capsule  is a Hh pathway inhibitor  indicated  for the treatment of 
adults with metastatic  basal cell carcinoma, or with locally  advanced basal cell 
carcinoma that has recurred  following surgery  or who are not candidates for radiation.  
The most common adverse  reactions  (incidence ≥ 10%) are muscle  spasms,  alopecia,  
dysgeusia, weight  loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased  appetite,  constipation, 
arthralgias, vomiting  and ageusia. In clinical  trials, a total of 3 of 10 pre-menopausal 
women developed amenorrhea while  receiving  GDC-0449. Treatment-emergent Grade  
3 laboratory abnormalities  observed in clinical trials were  hyponatremia in 6 patients 
(4%), hypokalemia in  2 patients (1%), and  azotemia  in 3 patients (2%).
The safety  and efficacy of vismodegib in pediatric patients  has not been  established. 
Studies in animals indicate that oral Hh pathway inhibitors  pose a substantial risk of 
developmental defects  during the post-natal period, which includes irreversible  effects 
on growing teeth or bones and male  reproductive organs. The occurrence of premature  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_440575]  (SAEs)  reported in an Investigator Sponsored 
Trial (IST)  of pediatric patients  receiving  vismodegib therapy. In some  cases, fusion 
progressed after drug  discontinuation.
In this study,  the safety and efficacy  of oral GDC-0449 in the management of NBCCS-
associated KCOT and sporadic KCOT will be examined. The recommended  dose is 
150mg taken  orally once daily until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. 
The capsule has a pi[INVESTIGATOR_440576] a grey opaque cap with “150 mg” printed on 
the capsule body and “Vismo” printed on the capsule cap in black ink. It can be taken  
Page [ADDRESS_558812] agree not to donate  blood or blood products during the study 
and for 24 months  after discontinuation  of vismodegib.
If a patient experiences unacceptable drug toxicity, he/she  will be allowed a treatment 
break lasting for at least one month, up to three months.  If the patient  is unable to 
resume treatment after an 3 month  treatment break, he/she will be discontinued from 
the study.
A potential risk of treatment of KCOT with vismodegib is disease  progression, i.e. tumor 
growth. Participants will be closely  monitored  with clinical  and radiographic examination  
for evidence of disease progression.  The natural history of KCOTs is that the tumors  
grow and expand slowly relative to the proposed  examination  schedule. Therefore, it is 
highly unlikely that unanticipated growth in participants on vismodegib would be 
encountered.
The potential benefit of treatment of KCOT with vismodegib  is decreased tumor 
recurrence and reduced surgical  morbidity. Currently the management of KCOT  is 
surgical. The surgical  options include:   1. resection, 2. enucleation with or without 
treatment of the bony cavity using  tissue fixatives or liquid nitrogen,  or 3. surgical 
decompression. The morbidity of surgical  resection and enucleation involves the loss of 
bone and teeth. In some cases the sensory nerve in the proximity  of the tumor is 
removed leaving the patient with paresthetia or anesthesia in the distribution  of the face 
or tongue.  Replacement of bone  and teeth is extremely difficult and in many cases not 
possible. Decompression involves placement of a drain  into the tumor cavity followed by 
[CONTACT_440615] a day for 12 to 24 months. Often after this 
treatment eventual  removal of the tumor is required. A potential  benefit for participants 
treated with vismodegib is that they might  avoid the morbidity associated  with the 
above-described surgery. 
4.4.1 Phase  1: Screening  
Potential patients (10 with NBCCS-associated KCOT and 10 with sporadic KCOT, 
males and females,  ≥18 years) will be recruited from the Department of Oral and 
Maxillofacial Surgery  at NYU  College  of Dentistry, NYU Langone  Medical Center and 
Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as all these institutions  represent major  referral sources for head  and 
neck pathology. Patients will also be recruited from other private and academic oral and 
maxillofacial surgery practices both in the [LOCATION_001] area and other  parts of the country 
Page [ADDRESS_558813] 2016by [CONTACT_6018].   Investigator will present this study during society  meetings so that other 
surgeons can refer  KCOT  patients to this  study.  
Before a patient’s participation in the study,  the investigator will be responsible  for 
obtaining written  ICF from the patient,  after adequate explanation of the aims,  methods, 
anticipated benefits  and potential risks of the study and before any protocol specific 
screening procedure is performed or the study drug is administered. The patient will be 
given ample time to consider the information provided and ask questions  before giving 
written consent.
The acquisition of informed consent will be thoroughly documented in the patient’s chart 
and the informed consent form with be personally signed  and dated by [CONTACT_440616]. A patient will be 
considered enrolled in the study, once  the informed  consent  form is signed. The original 
informed consent will be retained and a copy will be provided to the patient. The same 
process will be followed  for the consenting for optional future genetic testing on blood 
and on the  tumor.  
4.4.2 Baseline Visit
The following procedures will be performed at Baseline visit (study  procedures and 
assessments during  the baseline  visit can be conducted  over several visits until all

slides confirming the KCOT diagnosis will be obtained.  For patients  with 
multiple KCOTs associated with NBCCS, the pathology report and slides 
associated with each of the lesions  will be obtained. If a patient has a lesion 
that is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_440577], but no biopsy, then a biopsy  will be performed  
as a standard  of care. If a patient has multiple KCOTs associated with 
Page [ADDRESS_558816] 2016NBCCS but there is no biopsy of any of the lesions, then a biopsy  will be 
performed on selected lesions.

Retention and compliance will be evaluated as the proportion of completers  at the four 
primary time points: after [ADDRESS_558836] of GDC-0449 will be evaluated (at a significance level of 5% and controlling 
the false discovery rate) using Wilcoxon signed rank tests to compare the mean  KCOT  
volume at baseline to those  acquired  at 6, 12, 24,[ADDRESS_558837]  population for this analysis. As a primary intention  to treat (ITT)  analysis, we 
will analyze data from all randomized subjects  who complete  Phase 1.  For these 
analyses, Phase 1 values will be substituted  for missing observations.  Should  more 
than 20% of the data be missing at any observation  interval, analysis  of that interval  will 
be abandoned. Deviations from this plan,  for example, emergent interest  in the analysis  
of the all-treated or protocol-compliant subjects, will be transparently  pursued  and 
reported. 
iii. Treatment of missing data. Two secondary effectiveness  analyses  will either carry 
the last observation  forward into missing  cells, or use maximum  likelihood estimates of 
those values. We expect  the best estimate of efficacy is likely to lie within the limits set 
by [CONTACT_440623] (ITT) and liberal (LOCF, ML) treatments  of missing data.
iv. Secondary Endpoints
Secondary analysis will quantify  the proportion of patients achieving minimal  clinically 
significant changes in their tumors and comparing that to a theoretical expectation of 
5% improvement  with a Fisher exact  test, and the effect of the PTCH1 mutation on 
tumor volume reduction will be assessed with an independent samples t-test. These 
analyses will use the same population as  the primary endpoint.
All analyses will be done  using  IBM SPSS Version 21.
Page [ADDRESS_558838] 2016v. Sample size determination. Twenty  subjects will be recruited. Analysis  of the primary 
endpoint is capable of detecting  changes  in tumor volume  in the Wilcoxon tests of 
approximately 1.0 and .68 SD, assuming  a 2-tailed type 1 error of 5% and power of 80% 
and then assuming either n=10 (separate analysis of the NBCSS-associated and 
sporadic cohorts)  or n=20 (combined analysis of both cohorts), respectively (G*Power, 
v3.1).
c. Safety Analysis
All safety-related interventions, events, and findings will be summarized by [CONTACT_440624].  An adverse event will be considered  treatment 
emergent if the onset  date and time occur on or after the recorded  clock time of the 
administration of study  drug. Adverse events will be coded to preferred  terms and 
system organ classes  according  to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA®). The severity of each  adverse event will be determined from the World 
Health Organization  (WHO) Toxicity Criteria or by [CONTACT_440625].  In addition, 
all adverse events  will be assessed  as to whether the onset of the event was related to 
the study drug or not and they will be followed to final resolution. Other safety  
assessments include vital signs,  oral cavity examinations, and complete blood  count. In 
the unlikely  event  that treatment is associated  with increasing tumor size, tumor  area, 
determined from panoramic  radiographs acquired at each visit, will be compared to 
baseline.
4.[ADDRESS_558839] of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events  (SAEs) per protocol.  This includes all events  of death, and any 
study specific issue of concern.
Adverse Events
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease  temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational  medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-
imposed intervention, regardless of attribution.
This includes the following:
 AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge  during the protocol-
specified AE reporting period, including signs  or symptoms associated with KCOT  that 
were not present prior  to the  AE reporting period.
 Complications that occur  as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).
If applicable, AEs that occur  prior to assignment of study treatment  associated  with 
medication washout, no treatment run-in,  or other protocol-mandated intervention.
Preexisting medical conditions (other  than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_440626]-specified AE reporting  period.
Serious Adverse Events
An AE should be classified as an SAE  if the  following criteria are met:
 It results in  death  (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads  to death).
 It is life threatening (i.e., the  AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject  
at immediate risk of death. It does  not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form,  might have caused  death.).
 It requires or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
 It results  in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption  of the subject’s ability  to conduct normal life functions).
 It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  in a neonate/infant  born to a mother 
exposed to the IMP.
 It is considered  a significant  medical event by [CONTACT_440627] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical  intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed  above).
Page [ADDRESS_558840] 2016Data Safety Monitoring Plan
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_440579].   Adverse events,  serious adverse events, unanticipated problems, and 
subject status  will be reviewed at least  annually after enrollment begins.   Both the 
investigator and Genentech,  Inc. reserve the right to terminate the study, if the 
incidence or severity of adverse  events  in this or other studies indicates  a potential  
health hazard to subjects.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange 
discontinuation procedures.  In terminating the study, both the investigator  and 
Genentech, Inc. will assure that adequate  consideration is given  to the protection  of the 
patients’ interests.  All patients  will undergo  an exit examination if the study is 
terminated prematurely.  Data safety monitoring summary will be submitted to the IRB 
at the time of annual continuation  review.    
5.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing AND Recording Safety 
Variables
The investigator is responsible for ensuring  that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study are collected  and reported to the FDA,  appropriate  IRB(s),  
and Genentech,  Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports). 
Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period  during  which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed 
consent is obtained and initiation of study  treatment and ends [ADDRESS_558841] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is 
earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to 
prior study treatment. All AEs occurring from the start of study  treatment through to 
study completion, whether  or not they are related to the study, will be recorded in the 
subject chart. 
Assessment of  Adverse Events
All AEs and SAEs  whether  volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_440628], or detected through physical  examination, laboratory test, or other 
means will be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_14215] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, 
suspected relationship to the  study  drug (see following guidance), and actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should 
apply the following general  guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible temporal  relationship between the onset  of the AE and 
administration of vismodegib, and the AE cannot be readily  explained by [CONTACT_423]’s  
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a 
known pattern of response to vismodegib; and/or the AE abates  or resolves upon 
Page [ADDRESS_558842] 2016discontinuation of vismodegib or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-
challenge
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other than vismodegib (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness,  or concomitant  medication); 
and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to vismodegib administration (e.g., 
cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_558843] dose of  vismodegib).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in 
the Package  Insert  or current  Investigator’s Brochure. 
Unexpected adverse  events are those not listed in the Package Insert or current 
Investigator’s Brochure or not identified.  This includes adverse  events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent  with the description in the Package  Insert or 
current Investigator’s Brochure.  For example, under this definition, hepatic  necrosis 
would be unexpected if the Package Insert or current Investigator’s  Brochure only 
referred to elevated hepatic  enzymes or hepatitis.
5.[ADDRESS_558844] evaluation timepoints should  be 
adopted. Examples of  non-directive  questions include: 
 “How have  you felt since your last clinical  visit?”
 “Have  you had any new or changed health problems  since you were last here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse  Events
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting  AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms  and abbreviations.
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting,  a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual  
signs and symptoms  (e.g.,  record  only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated  transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or  
symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome  at the 
time of reporting, it is acceptable to report  the information that is currently available.  If a 
diagnosis is subsequently  established, it should  be reported  as follow-up information.
b. Deaths
All deaths  that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting  period (see Section 5.2), 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate  parties. When  recording  a 
death, the event  or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should  be 
Page [ADDRESS_558845] 2016reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot  be 
ascertained at  the time of reporting, report  “Unexplained Death”.
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present  at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical 
condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported  as an AE or SAE only 
if the frequency, severity,  or character of the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important  to convey  the concept that the preexisting  
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672]  (e.g., “more frequent  
headaches”).
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440580]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical 
or surgical  procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure,  not 
the procedure itself,  should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440581], record the heart condition that 
necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440582]:
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440583]
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440584]
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440585].
e. Pregnancy
If a female  subject becomes  pregnant while  receiving  the study drug or within [ADDRESS_558846] receiving study drug (or within [ADDRESS_558847] dose of study  drug)  impregnates a female partner, then the female 
partner will be requested  to provide informed consented  to permit a report of the 
pregnancy to  be completed  and expeditiously submitted to Genentech.
Follow-up to obtain the outcome  of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether 
accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous,  should always be classified as serious, and 
expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital  anomaly/birth  defect in a 
child born  to a female  subject exposed to study drug  should be reported  as an SAE.
Additional information on any vismodegib-exposed pregnancy and infant will be 
requested by [CONTACT_440629] (i.e., after having received the 
initial report, at the end of  the second trimester, 2 weeks after the expected date  of 
delivery, and at  3, 6, and 12  months  of the infant’s life).
Page [ADDRESS_558848].  Genentech and the 
Sponsor will agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to 
exchange quaterly line listings  of cases received by [CONTACT_440630].  If discrepancies are 
identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies. 
The responsible individuals  for each party  shall handle the matter on a case-by-case  
basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive reconciliation  guidance 
documents within the “Activation Package.”
h. AEs of Special  Interest (AESIs)
There are no Adverse Events  of Special Interest (AESIs)for vismodegib.  
I. Instructions for Reporting Adverse  Events
Serious Adverse Events Reporting
Investigators must report all SAEs and AESIs to Genentech  within the timelines 
described below. The completed MedWatch/case report should be faxed  immediately  
upon completion to Genentech  Drug Safety at:
(650) 225- 4682 or
 (650) 225- 4630
 Relevant follow-up information should be submitted to Genentech Drug Safety as 
soon as it becomes available.
 Serious AE reports that are related  to vismodegib and AEs of Special Interest 
(regardless of causality)  will be transmitted to Genentech within  fifteen (15) calendar 
days of the  Awareness Date.
Non-Serious Adverse Events
Bluestone Center  for Clinical  Research  will forward a  copy of the Final Study  Report to 
[COMPANY_002] upon  completion of the Study.
Special Situations  Reports
In addition to SAEs, pregnancy reports, and  AESIs, the following  Special Situations 
Reports should be collected and  transmitted to [COMPANY_002] even in the absence of an 
Adverse Event within thirty (30) calendar days:
Data  related  to product  usage during pregnancy or  breastfeeding
Page [ADDRESS_558849] 2016Data  related  to overdose, abuse, misuse, inadvertent/erroneous administration, 
medication error  or occupational exposure, with or without association with an 
AE/SAE unless otherwise  specified in  the protocol
Lack  of therapeutic efficacy
Suspected Transmission of an Infectious Agent (STIAMP) by [CONTACT_5257]
–Any organism, virus, or infectious particle  (e.g., prion  protein transmitting  
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or  non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious  agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent  may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms  or laboratory findings  that indicate an 
infection in  a patient exposed to  a medicinal product.  This  term applies  only 
when a  contamination  of the study drug  is suspected.
MEDWATCH 3500a  REPORTING GUIDELINES
In addition  to completing appropriate patient  demographic and suspect medication 
information, the report should  include the following information  within the Event 
Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A  form:
 Protocol  description (and number, if assigned)
 Description  of event, severity, treatment,  and outcome if known
 Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics
 Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event  to each 
investigational product  and suspect medication.
Follow-up Information
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report  by [CONTACT_51756]:
 Adding  to the original MedWatch 3500A  report and submitting it as follow-up
 Adding  supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the 
original MedWatch 3500A form 
 Summarizing new information  and faxing  it with a cover letter  including patient 
identifiers (i.e. D.O.B.  initial,  patient  number), protocol  description and number, if 
assigned, brief adverse  event description, and notation that additional or follow-up 
information is being submitted (The patient  identifiers are important so that the new 
information is added  to the correct initial  report)
Occasionally Genentech may contact  [CONTACT_15483], 
clarification, or current status  of the patient  for whom an adverse event was reported. 
For questions regarding SAE reporting,  you may contact [CONTACT_440631].  Relevant follow-up 
information should be submitted  to Genentech  Drug Safety as soon as it becomes 
available and/or upon request.

and Accountability Act  of 1996  (HIPAA).
7.1.[ADDRESS_558854] (IRB)  
This protocol, any protocol amendments and any study related  materials  (such  as 
advertisements, patient information sheets,  or descriptions of the study used to obtain 
informed consent)  will be submitted to the IRB.  Approval from the IRB must be 
obtained before  starting the study  and documented in a letter to the investigator 
specifying the protocol  number, if applicable, protocol version, documents reviewed, 
and date on which the IRB granted the  approval.  
All unexpected  SAEs related to study  participation  will be reported to the IRB within 5 
business days.  
7.1.3 Informed Consent
Informed Consent for patients ≥ 18  years of  age:
For inclusion of patients [ADDRESS_558855] 2016any study-related procedures.  The investigator will utilize  an IRB-approved consent 
form.  
Each ICF will be signed and dated  by [CONTACT_440633].   By [CONTACT_12568], the patient agrees to complete all 
evaluations unless  the patient withdraws consent or is terminated from the study  for any 
reason.
As part of the informed consent,  the investigator will obtain  HIPAA compliant 
authorization from patients to use and disclose relevant protected health information  
(PHI) and permission for authorized representatives of Genentech Inc., or regulatory 
authorities including the FDA, to review in confidence any records identifying  patients in 
the clinical study.
Recruitment efforts may precede  obtaining informed consent; however, informed 
consent must be  obtained prior  to any  protocol specific procedures being performed.
The investigator  will communicate any new information on safety to patients who 
consent to participate in this study  in accordance  with IRB requirements.  The ICF will 
be updated,  if necessary. 
7.1.4 Confidentiality
The investigator will assure that patients’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that 
their identities will be protected from unauthorized parties.   Only patient initials  and an 
identification code  (i.e., not names)  will be recorded on any form submitted to the 
sponsor or IRB.  
The investigator agrees  that all information  received from Genentech,  Inc., including but 
not limited  to the Investigator’s  Brochure,  the study drug, and any other  study

to Genentech, Inc. or its representatives, or to regulatory or health authority inspectors.  
The investigator will retain all study documents for at least two years  after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) region (i.e., [LOCATION_002],  Europe,  or Japan), and until there are no pending  or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region.  If no application is filed or if the 
application is not approved for such  indication, the investigator  will retain all study  
documents for at least two years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory 
authorities have been notified.  
If no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, the 
investigator will retain all study documents for at least two years after the investigation  is 
discontinued and regulatory  authorities have been notified.  The investigator may retain 
documents longer if required by [CONTACT_440635],  Inc.
7.1.6 Case Report Forms 
The investigator  is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of information  
collected on the CRFs  for each  individual enrolled.  The investigator will review and 
approve all CRFs;  document the reason  that a patient withdraws from the study on the 
appropriate CRF and attempt to obtain  termination assessments;  and continue  follow-up  
to document the outcome of any adverse event.
Page [ADDRESS_558858] [ZIP_CODE].1.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability  of all used and 
unused study drug,  including acknowledgment of receipt  of each shipment of study 
products (quantity  and condition) and patient dispensing  records.  Dispensing records 
will document quantities received and quantities dispensed, lot number (if applicable), 
date dispensed, patient identifier number, and initials of the person dispensing the study 
drugs.

Page [ADDRESS_558862] one of the following criteria are defined as women of non-
childbearing potential:
 ≥ 50 years  old and naturally amenorrheic for  ≥ 1 year
 Permanent premature ovarian failure  confirmed by  [CONTACT_440638]
 Previous bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy or hysterectomy
 XY karyotype, Turner’s syndrome,  or uterine agenesis
Female patients who do not meet at least  one of the above  criteria  are defined as 
women of childbearing potential.
Additionally, the parent or guardian of young female patients who have not yet started 
menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun.  If a young female patient 
reaches menarche during the study, she is to be treated as a woman of childbearing 
potential from that time forward.
Acceptable contraception
Women of child-bearing potential must use two methods of acceptable contraception 
including one highly effective method  and a barrier method during Erivedge  therapy and 
for 9 months after the final  dose.
Acceptable forms of barrier contraception include the following:
 Latex, non-latex, or any other male condom (always used with  spermicide)
 Diaphragm (always used with  spermicide)
Acceptable forms of secondary contraception, when used with a barrier  method, include the 
following:
 Combination hormonal  contraceptives,  hormonal  patch, or hormonal intramuscular 
contraceptives (subcutaneous hormonal implant,  medroxyprogesterone acetate  depot)
 Tubal sterilization
Other acceptable forms include  the following:
 100% commitment to abstinence from sexual intercourse (for medical or personal  
reasons)
Page [ADDRESS_558863] 2016Unacceptable contraception
The following  are unacceptable forms of contraception:
IUD progesterone  T 
Progestin-only contraceptives
Female condom
Natural  family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding
Fertility awareness
Withdrawal
Cervical shield
Vaginal contraceptive ring
NOTE: Patients should be counseled  on the use of contraception before beginning 
treatment with vismodegib.  As appropriate, the treating physician should refer the 
subject to her gynecologist  or other  healthcare provider to ensure proper understanding  
of the use of her chosen contraceptive method.

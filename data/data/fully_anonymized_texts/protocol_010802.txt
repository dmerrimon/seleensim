What is the purpose of this form?  
This form will provide you with information about this research study. You do not have to be in the study if 
you do not want to. You should have all your questions answered before  you agree to be in this study.  
 
Please read this form carefully.  If you want to be in the study, you will need to sign this form. You will be given 
a signed copy of this form.   
 
Who is funding this study?  
This study is being carried out under the spons orship of [CONTACT_447947] at the University of Virginia Cancer 
Center.  Some financial support has been provided by [CONTACT_5343], the manufacturer of pazopanib.  
 
Why is this research being done?  
Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for cancer of the ovary, f allopi[INVESTIGATOR_447930]. A number of chemotherapy options exist for patients when their cancer grows despi[INVESTIGATOR_447931] (such as carboplatin or cisplatin). One of these 
chemoth erapy agents is gemcitabine.  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of an experimental drug called 
pazopanib when given in combination with gemcitabine  versus gemcitabine alone  for people with ovarian 
cancer, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916] c ancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has re -grown or not responded after prior 
treatment.

Gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin is approved for use by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced ova rian cancer that has relapsed at least six months after 
completion of therapy with carboplatin or cisplatin. Gemcitabine is also used as a single agent for cancer of 
the ovary, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_447932], although this is not an FDA -
approved treatment.  
 
Pazopanib is a different kind of chemotherapy drug. Pazopanib works by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_447933].  New blood vessel formation is required for tumor 
growth.  
 
Currently, Pazopanib is approved by [CONTACT_447935] (cancer of connective or supportive tissues such as bone, 
cartilage, fat, muscle…) but has not been approved for use in other cancer types.  Pazopanib alone or 
pazopanib + gemcitabine is NOT  approved by [CONTACT_447936], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], and 
primary peritoneal cancer. In other words, the combination of pazopanib and gemcitabine is  experimental .  
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have ovarian cancer, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351], or 
primary peritoneal cancer that has regrown or not responded after prior treatment.   
 
Up to 60 peop le will be in this study at UVA.  Approximately 150 people will take part in this study at other 
institutions in the [LOCATION_002].  
  
How long will this study take?  
You will be required to make weekly office visits while you are receiving study treatment.   
 
You will continue to take pazop anib + gemcitabine or gemcitabine alone as long as there is evidence that your 
tumor is not growing and you are not experiencing any unacceptable side effects.  
 
After you are finished taking  the chemotherapy drug(s), your doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow -
up exams every three months for the first two years, every six months for the next year and then yearly for 2 
years for a maximum of 5 years.   
 
Your participation in this study will , require an additional 30 minutes during your initial v isit with your doctor 
and an additional 30 minutes during the routine clinical visits you will be making as part of your cancer 
treatment.

What will happen if you are in the study?  
 
SCREENING (will take approximately 1 hour to complete )  
Visit 1 /Day [ADDRESS_569626] had some of them 
recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor.   
 
The following exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care  and will be done e ven if you do not 
join the study:   
 History and physical examination which may include pelvic exam.  You will also have your heart rate, 
blood pressure and temperature taken.  
 Chest imaging (X -ray or CT scan of the chest)  
 A left ventricular ejection fracti on (LVEF) test to measure your heart function if you have had prior 
therapy with a certain type of drug (anthracyclines)  
 ECG (tracing of heart waves) -Electrocardiogram to see the electrical activity of your heart.  
 CT-scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to measure detectable tumor  
 Review of medications and supplements you are currently taking .  If you agree to take part in this 
study, it is very important that you tell your study doctor before starting on this study about all of the 
medicines you are taki ng (over -the-counter medications, supplements, prescription medications, or 
illegal drugs) including any medicines you have taken within the past [ADDRESS_569627] your body handles other medic ines and this can 
increase the risk of side effects.  In addition, p lease talk with the study doctor before  you begin taking 
any new medications or sup plements during this study. Your study doctor will look at the medicines 
you are currently taking to make  sure you are allowed to take them on the study.   You may be asked to 
change some of the medicines you are taking.  If you need to take a medicine that is not allowed and it 
cannot be replaced with another medicine, you will not be asked to stop taking it;  however, you will 
not be able to take part in this study.  
 
The following exams, tests or procedures are not part of regular cancer care and will be done for research 
purposes:  
 A urinalysis (testing of urine) to check urine protein levels

Version: 01Feb 2017  
 
 
  A serum pregnancy  test if you are capable of becoming pregnant (this will be done within 14 days prior 
to receiving study treatment)  
 Blood tests to assess blood cell counts; liver and kidney function; blood mineral levels; blood clotting 
function and the CA -125 tumor marke r.    The amount of blood that will be drawn is approximately 2 
tablespoons.  Blood tests to assess thyroid for research purposes will be done on the blood taken as 
part of your routine cancer care. These tests will not require additional blood samples.  
 
If these tests show you are eligible, you will return to the clinic (within 28 days) to begin study treatment.  
 
RANDOMIZATION   
Visit 2/Day 1  
 
You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to [ADDRESS_569628] an equal 
chance of being assigned to one of the groups.  Neither you nor your doctor can choose which study 
treatment you are assigned.  Both you and your doctor will know which of the two groups you are assigned to.  
 
GROUP 1: Gemcitabine  given as intravenous (IV) infusio n (standard of care)  
 
GROUP 2: Pazopanib  (oral)  + Gemcitabine  (IV) (Experimental)  
 
Note:  Every 21-day period of time is called a cycle.   
 
Group 1  
Gemcitabine will be put into your vein over 30 minutes, weekly for 2 weeks (Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle) 
every 21 days  
 
Group2  
Gemcitabine will be put into your vein over 30 minutes, weekly for 2 weeks (Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle)

  History and physical examinations which may include a pelvic exam about once every three weeks.  
You will also have your heart rate, blood pressure and t emperature monitored at each study visit.  
 Blood tests to measure the CA -125 tumor marker blood level prior to each cycle of treatment.   
 Chest imaging (X -ray or CT scan of the chest) before the start of every other cycle (i.e. Cycle 2, 4, 6…). as 
needed  
 CT scan or MRI to measure tumor before the start of every other cycle (i.e. Cycle 2, 4, 6…)   
 Review of medications you are taking before starting each cycle.  
 If you are taking warfarin, your doctor will also check your blood clotting levels.  
 
The following wi ll be done for research purposes:  
 
 Blood tests to measure blood counts, electrolytes, blood mineral levels, and check liver and kidney 
function prior to each cycle of treatment (more often if your doctor(s) feels it is needed.)  
 
In addition, if you are ass igned to Group 2, the following tests and procedures will be done for research 
purposes:  
 Blood pressure will be monitored on  Day 15 of every cycle; you may do this at home and provide the 
results to the study doctor or study nurse. (Note blood pressure don e on other days will be performed 
per your regular cancer care).  
 An electrocardiogram will be done on Day 1 of cycle 2  
 Urine protein levels (UPC) will be examined by [CONTACT_19416] (testing of urine) before the start of every 
other cycle (i.e. Cycle 2, 4, 6…).   
 You will be given a patient medication calendar to complete throughout the study.  The patient 
medication calendar is a monthly calendar on which you are to record the number of tablet(s) you 
take each day. You will need to bring the calendar with you to  the doctor’s office before each cycle, 
along with any unused study medications and empty medication containers.  
 
FOLLOW UP:  
To monitor your well -being and the status of your cancer, you will undergo these tests and procedures that 
are part of regular can cer care every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year and then yearly 
for 2 years. The maximum follow up period is 5 years : 
 History and physical examination which may include pelvic examination CT or MRI scan, if previously 
detectable tumo r was monitored using these methods, as recommended by  [CONTACT_29591] . 
 CA-125 tumor marker blood level  as recommended by [CONTACT_29591].  
 Chest imaging (X-ray or CT scan of the chest) as recommended by [CONTACT_29591].

  Fatigue  
 Hair loss   Numbness or tingling in the hands and/or 
feet 
 
Less Likely  
 Flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, muscle 
aches, fever last ing 1 -2 days after 
gemcitabine treatments  
 Infection requiring treatment with 
medicines  
 Low platelets that could lead to bleeding  
 Nausea and vomiting  
 Diarrhea or constipation  
 Mouth sores may occur; you will be given 
treatment to make them more tolerable.  
Mouth sores improve over time.   Abnormalities in the blood tests that 
measure liver function  
 Fluid retention in the feet, legs, and weight 
gain  
 Kidney function abnormalities, with the 
appearance of protein or blood in the urine  
 Rash may occur, involving the body and/or 
legs.  
 Changes in taste, or a metallic taste  
 
Rare but serious  
 Confusion, hearing problems, heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms, high blood pressure, low blood 
pressure, blood clots in the legs or lungs, bowel obstruction, bleeding, severe in fections leading to 
death.  The relationship of these events to the administration of the chemotherapy drugs has not been 
proven, since all patients who have received these drugs have underlying cancer, which may cause 
some or all of these effects by [CONTACT_306931] f. 
 Rarely, severe lung damage has occurred in patients being treated with the combination of 
gemcitabine and docetaxel.  In most cases the lungs got better when the treatments were stopped.   
 Rarely, a condition affecting the blood and kidneys called hemol ytic uremic syndrome has occurred.  
When this happens the kidney damage can sometimes be permanent.  
 
Risks and side effects related to Pazopanib : 
As of 9 September 2016, about 5919 patients and healthy volunteers had received pazopanib (either as 
monothera py or in combination) out of more than [ADDRESS_569631].  If you experience one or more side 
effects, please speak with your study doctor.

Other Risks of Pazopanib  
One patient developed liver failu re and died shortly after beginning treatment with the combination of 
gemcitabine and pazopanib.  
 
Lung infection has been observed in 1 out of 1000 patients treated with pazopanib.  
 
Neutropenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (decrease in t he number of cells involved in 
blood clotting), and palmar -plantar erythrodysaethesia syndrome (hand -foot syndrome) were observed more 
frequently in patients of East Asian descent.  
 
Patients who carry a specific gene (HLA B*57:01 allele) have an increased chance of abnormal liver function 
(ALT elevations) due to Pazopanib.  
 
Studies in animals indicate that pazopanib may slow or stop bone growth.  There is a possibility that pazopanib 
may affect bone growth in children, adolescents and young adults who are still growing.  
 
Severe and fatal liver disease has occurred in patients treated with pazopanib and patients older than [ADDRESS_569632] liver injury that is not severe, your doctor 
may recommend you continue taking pazopanib and may ask you to stop taking other drugs which may cause 
liver injury.  Blood tests (about 1/[ADDRESS_569633]) for possible liver injury  will be repeat ed every 
week until they get better. These tests will be done per your clinical care.  
 
If your blood tests get worse, your doctor may tell you to stop taking pazopanib altogether.  If you have a liver 
injury from  pazopanib , it will usually heal when pazopa nib is stopped.  It is possible that a small number of 
people may continue to have liver injury after they stop taking pazopanib.   
 
If you are to have surgery, please speak with your doctor because pazopanib may affect wound healing.

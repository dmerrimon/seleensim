1.0  Introduction and Backgroun d 
 
 Infertility affects 10 -15% of all couples, with 1.5 million couples seeking 
medical assistance for infertility yearly (1). Infertility attributable to the male 
partner accounts for 30 -40% of all cases of infertility. The most common form of 
male infertility involves some type of impairment in spermatogenesis (2).  
Unfortunately, over 80% of men with infertility from impaired spermatogenesis 
do not have a medically treatable cause, such as a go nadotropin deficiency (3).  In 
men with idiopathic infertility, surgical sperm extraction from the testis coupled 
with in vitro  fertilization or intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection offers some hope 
of fertility; however, these procedures are invasive, expens ive, unsuccessful in 
30-40% of cases, and don’t address the underlying cause of infertility (4).   
Therefore, new approaches to the treatment of male infertility are sorely needed.  
 
 The essential role of vitamin A (retinol) in spermatogenesis has been long  
appreciated.  Vitamin A deficient male mice are sterile due to impaired 
spermatogenesis and supplementation of deficient mice with vitamin A restores 
fertility (5, 6).  Vitamin A is required for spermatogenesis as it is converted to 
retinoic acid in the s eminiferous tubules via the activity of testes -specific retinol 
and retinal dehydrogenases . Retinoic acid is known to mediate most of the effects 
of vitamin A in tissues.  In the testes, two retinoic acid receptors,  and , are 
present in both Sertoli cel ls and developi[INVESTIGATOR_729523] (7 -10), and targeted 
deletion of these receptors in mice results in male infertility (11 -13).  From this 
work, it is clear that retinoic acid plays several essential roles in spermatogenesis, 
including necessary functions in sp ermatogonial differentiation, spermatid 
adhesion to Sertoli cells and spermiation (14). Given the crucial role of retinoic 
acid in spermatogenesis, it seems quite possible that some men with “idiopathic” 
infertility have intratesticular concentrations of r etinoic acid below those 
necessary to initiate and/or maintain optimal spermatogenesis, but whether 
relative deficiencies of intratesticular retinoic acid contribute to male infertility in 
   
10 
 humans is unknown.   In theory, poor dietary intake of vitamin A cou ld lead to 
infertility; however, a nutritional cause of infertility seems improbable in the US.  
More likely, low intratesticular concentrations of retinoic acid could occur in 
infertile men either due to impaired retinoic acid biosynthesis from vitamin A or 
increased metabolism of retinoic acid to inactive metabolites within the testes.   
 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_743115], there has 
been relatively little work examining the role of retinoic acid on spermatogene sis in 
humans.  In this proposal, we will perform a clinical trial of retinoic acid administration to 
infertility patients to determine whether retinoic acid therapy improves sperm quality in 
infertile men.  Intriguingly, there is a suggestion that the adm inistration of retinoic acid to 
men may improve sperm production. During the development of 13 -cis retinoic acid 
(Accutane) for acne, three human studies examining the effect of oral administration of 13 -
cis-retinoic acid on sperm production in men were pe rformed to determine if 13 -cis 
retinoic acid was harmful to male fertility. Interestingly, men in these studies had increased 
sperm concentrations during treatment (see below), suggesting that 13 -cis retinoic acid 
administration enhanced spermatogenesis in  these normal men with acne (15 -17).  
 
 If the administration of retinoic acid were shown to improve spermatogenesis in some 
infertile  men, it would have tremendous significance for our current approach to the 
treatment of male infertility .  Because of its  widespread use in humans for over 25 years, 
13-cis retinoic acid is widely available in a generic formulation and could be quickly 
incorporated into male infertility treatment algorithms.  Ideally, retinoic acid therapy 
would increase an infertile man’s c hances of successfully fathering a pregnancy without 
the need for assisted reproductive technologies such as intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection 
and/or surgical methods of sperm extraction that are invasive for both the man and the 
woman, expensive and fail in many of cases.  
 
 Our group has completed the first ever study in humans to examine intratesticular 
retinoic acid concentrations.  With IRB approval, we enrolled 24 men having scrotal 
surgery in an observational study to examine the association between i ntratesticular 
   
11 
 retinoids and spermatogenesis. Interestingly, we observed that intratesticular 13 -cis 
retinoic acid is significantly lower in men with sub -normal sperm quality as compared to 
men with normal sperm quality as defined by [CONTACT_175546] ( 18) (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Intratesticular 13 -cis retinoic acid in 24 men expressed as median and interquartile ranges.  
13-cis-retinoic acid is significantly lower in men with sub -normal sperm quality as compared to men 
with normal sp erm analyses (p=0.04) (41).
This data suggests that lower intratesticular retinoic acid is associated with impaired 
spermatogenesis; however, it is unclear from this cross -sectional data if the low retinoic acid is a 
result of the infertility or a cause o f it.  Only an interventional trial of retinoic acid in infertile men 
will answer the question of the ability of retinoic acid to improve spermatogenesis in this 
population.

12 of 32  Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective :   
To determine the effect of 13 -cis retinoic a cid administration on total motile sperm count 
in men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia  
 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
o To determine the chance of pregnancy during treatment with [ADDRESS_1015998] lowe r than normal levels of intratesticular retinoic acid, suggesting that intratesticular 
retinoic acid deficiency is associated with infertility.  In this study, we aim to determine if 
retinoic acid therapy can improve sperm counts in men with low sperm coun ts.  The 
medication, 13 -cis retinoic acid is widely available and prescribed for the treatment of 
acne, suggesting  that serious adverse events , especially at the low doses to be tested  are 
unlikely.  
 
4. Compliance  
All aspects of this study will be performed a ccording to GCP and ICH guidelines, under an

[ADDRESS_1016005]-Admission Withdraw al Criteria  
Subjects may be discontinued prematurely for any of the following reasons:  
 Emergence of a severe condition(s) such that, in the judgment of the investigator, continuation 
in the trial would negatively impact the health of the subject.  
 Personal reasons ( e.g. withdrawn consent).  
 Subject lost to follow -up 
 
All subjects in a treatment arm may be discontinued prematurely if greater than 25% of the 
subjects in an arm are discontinued for the emergence of the same severe condition that requires 
individ ual subjects to be discontinued.   
 
14. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Data analysis and Interpretation of Results:  The primary endpoint is the count of total motile spermatozoa in 
the ejaculate at week [ADDRESS_1016006].  The change in the total motile sperm count 
from baseline (a secondary endpoint) will be performed with a Wilcoxon sign -rank test.  Linear regression will be 
performed to determine if significant relations hips between baseline (or delta) retinoic concentrations and changes 
in sperm quality are present using STATA Version 10.0 (College Park, TX, [LOCATION_003]).  For all comparisons, an alpha 
of 0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
14.1 Sample size consideration  
Inclusion  of 20 men per group will allow for an 80% power to detect a greater than a 20% difference for total 
motile sperm count at week 24 compared with placebo with a variance of 25% and allowing for a drop -out rate of 
10% at an alpha of 0.05.  
 
14.2 Efficacy  
Primary :  The primary efficacy outcome is increase in the count of total, motile sperm a fter 
twenty -four weeks of study treatment.

21 of 32 Secondary: The magnitude and changes between baseline and week [ADDRESS_1016007], clinic and time, using descriptive statistics.  Clinical chemistries and allied d ata will be 
examined for change over time.  
 
15. Adverse  Events  
Adverse Events (AE) should be carefully monitored and an AE form is included in the CRF. 
Serious adverse events (SAE) as defined below will have to be reported on the SAE form included 
as an appendix.  
 
All adverse experiences must be recorded  in the study event record of the subject’s CRF, and must 
include the following information (when applicable):  
 Specific condition or event  
 Indication of whether the condition was pre -existing or not and if yes, whether it has worsened 
in severity (includin g an increase in frequency)  
 Date of occurrence  
 Date of resolution  
 Relationship to study medication as evaluated by [CONTACT_093] (causality assessment). The 
investigator must enter their opi[INVESTIGATOR_729530].  
 Action taken (study medicat ion continued or not) and outcome  
 Seriousness according to the approved regulatory classification {i.e. any event that is  fatal, 
life-threatening, disabling, incapacitating, results in or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a medically 
significant event, e.g . an intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or any other serious 
criteria (cancer, congenital anomaly, overdose, other significant) is considered serious}.

22 of 32 When any serious adverse drug experience, regardless of causality, is encountered durin g 
this clinical trial at an investigator’s site, the investigator must notify the Study Monitor  by 
[CONTACT_729543]. This report must be submitted within 2 
calendar days from the time the investigator’s staff is notified of the event.  
 
All serious adverse events that are unexpected will be reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_743119] . All serious adverse events will be followed until fully 
characterized.  The investigator will collect and for ward to the FDA  via fax, all available 
supporting documentation (with subject name [CONTACT_191263]) for serious events, including at a 
minimum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729531] (where applicable). Additional 
supporting documentation that should be collected whenever possible, to verify the medical 
diagnosis, includes autopsy reports (where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, histology 
reports, and imaging reports.  
 
16. Ethical  Considerations  
16.[ADDRESS_1016008] (IRB). The appended Informed Consent (Appendix 2 and 
Appendix 3) will be translated and certified into  the language of the respondent as needed.  
 
Under this consent, the subject shall understand that he is authorizing access to medical records as 
required for monitors, auditors, IRBs and regulatory authorities. To expedite collection of 
supporting documentation in the event of a serious adverse event, the subj ect should also be asked 
to provide a release of medical records authorization at the enrollment visit.

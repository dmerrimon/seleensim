BACKGROUND  
 
Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) often restrict their activities to inpatient 
antimicrobial -prescribing. However, at least 40% of all antimicrobial exposure associated with 
an acute -care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584986] (i.e., post -discharge).1-
[ADDRESS_769113] -discharge antimicrobial use is often inappropriate. We 
used national data to show that 61% of fluoroquinolone treatment days were prescribed at 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]; manual chart reviews at 9 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584987] 40% of these post -discharge 
fluoroquinolone prescriptions were either unnecessary or sub- optimal.[ADDRESS_769114] 
found that 53- 79% of all post -discharge antimicrobials are either unnecessary or sub -optimal.5-[ADDRESS_769115] -discharge antimicrobials and ASPs frequently 
do not evaluate these prescriptions. A 2016 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) survey found 
that less than 50% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584988].8 
According to a 2016 survey in Michigan, only 17% of [ADDRESS_769116]-prescription audit -and-review (PPR) can reduce and improve inpatient antimicrobial use, 
but these studies did not measure the effect of PPR on post -discharge antimicrobial use.
10-[ADDRESS_769117] -discharge antimicrobial use, a potentially effective strategy may be 
a PPR process focused solely on prescriptions for patients who will soon be discharged. However, such a PPR intervention would require an innovative approach, as ASPs typi[INVESTIGATOR_584989]. 
 
METHODS  
 
Trial design:   
 
We will perform  a stepped- wedge cluster -randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of 
discharge- post-prescription audit -and-review (i.e. discharge -PPR) in safely reducing post -
discharge antimicrobial use.   
 There are ten sites taking part in this study. Based on the stepped wedge study design, 
randomization will be performed at the site- level with all eligible patients having access to the 
intervention once a site has entered the intervention phase. Each facility will begin in control status with one facility crossing into the intervention every two weeks following a 24- week 
baseline period. A simple randomization scheme using a random number generator will be used a priori to determine the order of implementation. Once cli nical rollout is complete, all sites will 
continue to perform the intervention for another 2.5- 3 months. No site will perform the 
intervention for longer than 6 months.

Participants: We will enroll up to 9 antimicrobial stewardship teams and their respective 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129372]  (n=10) . Note that one stewardship team covers two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
Inclusion criteria: An acute- care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584990]: A discharge- focused PPR process is already in place or will be implemented 
soon  
Method of recruitment: We will recruit sites through the Epi[CONTACT_26818]’s national conference calls 
and known professional contacts of the study PI.  
 
Interventions:  
 
Pre-intervention activities:  All sites must identify a site principal investigator (PI), i.e. a physician 
who preferably has experience with antimicrobial stewardship. Each site must also identify a 
study pharmacist. Ideally, the study pharmacist will already be part of stewardship activities.  
• Baseline survey of ASP activities : All participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584991].  
• Process development : Before the intervention, the pharmacist and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_83624] a 
process for identifying eligible patients for discharge- PPR audits; this process may 
include using information technology tools and collaborating with case managers or 
discharge coordinators.  
• Collaborative learning calls : Nine months before the intervention begins, the study 
coordinator will start organizing collaborative learning calls for the study PI (D. Livorsi) 
and the study personnel (site PI [INVESTIGATOR_584992]) at all participating sites. During these monthly calls, sites will share their experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a process to identify patients 
who will be discharged within 48 hours. In addition, participants will review the audit -and-
feedback literature and their own personal experience with stewardship to facilitate 
discussion about the optimal approach to discharge- PPR .
13-15  
Intervention activities:  
During the intervention, a study team member (either a physician or pharmacist) will perform 
discharge- PPR every weekday for patients on select medical services who are receiving an 
antimicrobial and whose discharge is anticipated within the next [ADDRESS_769118] will communicate all recommendations resulting from the audit to the primary  
prescribers. Site PIs and pharmacists will also participate in the collaborative learning calls 
every month during their sites’ intervention periods.

Further description of discharge- PPR process:  
• Content: Real -time f eedback on the selection, dose, and duration of antimicrobials 
prescribed at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
4 
 
 
• Delivery method:  Feedback will be preferably delivered in- person or by [CONTACT_756]. 
Electronic, asynchronous communication may also be used.  
 
• Unit of delivery: The feedback will be given to an inpatient provider directly caring for the 
patient who is receiving antimicrobials.  
 
• Deliverer: Feedback will be delivered by [CONTACT_584997].  
 
• Setting: The intervention w ill be delivered on the acute- care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584995] s are discharged.  
 
• Exposure quantity and duration: Feedback w ill be given during weekday working hours. 
 
• Time span:  2-6 months , depending on when a site is randomized to the intervention 
 
• Activities to increase compliance or adherence: Baseline education about duration of 
antimicrobial therapy for common infections treated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].  
 
Objectives:  
 
AIM 1: Evaluate whether discharge post -prescription audit -and-review (PPR) can safely reduce 
post-discharge antimicrobial use across participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
Hypothesis 1: The discharge audit -and-feedback intervention will reduce post -discharge 
antimicrobial use without adversely affecting patient safety. 
 
AIM 2: Through monthly collaborative learning calls with participating sites, determine barriers 
and facilitators encountered by [CONTACT_584998]- PPR process.  
 
Outcomes:   
 
We will use the RE -AIM framework (page 6) to assess our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Clinical ou tcomes are listed 
below . Data for all clinical outcomes will be extracted from the respective data systems of each 
participating site. All data will be submitted to the project PI [INVESTIGATOR_584996]. 
 Primary outcome  
The primary outcome will be post -discharge antimicrobial length of therapy ( LOT) per [ADDRESS_769119] . 
 
Secondary outcomes  
 Additional outcomes will include inpatient  antimicrobial use (inpatient L OT per 100 admissions), 
length of stay, and [ADDRESS_769120].  
 
5 
 
Process measures: Each day, the study pharmacist will record the number of patients  audited 
during discharge -PPR, the number of PPR recommendations communicated to providers, and 
the number of recommendations that were accepted.  
 
Implementation outcomes : We will use the RE -AIM framework to assess our intervention. 
Feasibility will be evaluated on 2 domains: 1) the development of a local process to identify 
patients who are on antimicrobials within 48 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and 2) the initiation of 
the discharge- PPR intervention. To further understand the implementation process, the study 
coordinator will take notes during the collaborative learning calls. We will also record these calls. We will perform a rapid template analysis to describe each site’s implementation process, 
including barriers and facilitators to successful implementation.
16 Through a weekly survey , we 
will also assess each site’s fidelity to the discharge- PPR process and the  cost (i.e. time) of the 
intervention. Through a post -intervention electronic survey, we will assess the acceptability  of 
discharge- PPR to frontline prescribers .  
 
Sample Size:    
We will calculate the average post -discharge LOT per 100 admissions every two weeks and will 
include 10 sites. For these power calculations, we assume: 1) an intra- cluster correlation of 
0.75; 2) an effect size of 10% from the baseline average post -discharge LOT per 100 admission 
of 135 ; 3) 100 discharges per site every two weeks; ; 4) a cluster -level standard deviation of 3.4; 
5) a Type I error rate of 5% , and 6) a constant treatment effect regardless of exposure time.  
Given these assumptions, under a stepped wedge study design with 1) each step lasting 2 
weeks (24 measurements/site over 48 weeks total); 2)  all [ADDRESS_769121] 
more than 90% power to determine a statistical difference when discharge -PPR is used.  
 
Blinding:  None  
 
Unit of Analysis : Each medical center  
 
Statistical Methods:  We will evaluate the effectiveness of implementing a discharge -focused 
process for post -prescription audit -and-review (PPR) via a generalized linear mixed model with 
identity link. The primary outcome will be post -discharge length of therapy  (LOT) per 100 
admissions. This model will include step and intervention indicators as fixed effects and a 
random intercept for cluster to account for facility -level factors. This model structure can provide 
proper weighting when cluster sizes vary and account for repeated measurements over time. 
Confounding variables (select covariates that may be associated with optimal antimicrobial  
prescribing) will be adjusted for statistically by [CONTACT_584999].

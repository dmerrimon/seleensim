BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT  
 
 
A. Introduction &  Rationale:  
 
Plaque -induced  gingivitis  is an inflammatory  disease  restricted  to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_360846]. It is estimated that 86% of US  population will be diagnosed with 
gingivitis at some point in their lives(Araujo et al. 2015; Eke, Wei, Borgnakke, Thornton - 
Evans, Zhang, Lu, McGuire, and Genco 2016b). The primary etiology of gingivitis, as well 
as most  periodontal  diseases,  are a bacte rial biofilm(Araujo  et al. 2015;  Chambrone  et al. 
2010). Although, not all individuals are equally susceptible to further tissue destruction, 
a prior history of gingivitis is required for patients to develop periodontitis(Page et al. 
1997; Lang, Schätzle, and Löe 2009a; Jürgensen et al.  2012).  
 
 
There is a consensus among the dental community that regular mechanical plaque 
control is enough for caries and periodontal disease prevention in most cases(Lang, 
Schätzle, and Löe 2009b). In the 1960’s, Löe et al. clearly demonstrated the   association  
3 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -DB-17-0313  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/17/2017   between  plaque  accumulation  and gingivitis;  furthermore,  upon  plaque  removal,  gingival 
health  was re-established(Löe,  Theilade,  and Jensen  1965).  However,  research  has shown 
that the average person brushes for 39 seconds each time(Macgregor and Rugg -Gunn 
1979). Even more, most patients are not effective in interdental plaque removal(Lang, 
Schätzle,  and Löe 2009b), hence the need for professional prophylaxis three to six times 
per year. With the premise that chemical agents are equally effective in preventing and 
reversing gingivitis, several studies investigated the efficacy of mouthwashes as plaque  
control agents in combination with mechanical regiments(Araujo et al. 2015). However, 
positive outcomes are often compromised by [CONTACT_360849](). 
Therefore, delivery of chemical agents by a chewing gum might be an effective method  
to increase compliance in those patients with limited motor skills, unable or unwilling to 
perform regular oral  hygiene.  
 
 
Cetylpyridium  Chloride  (CPC)  is a quaternary  ammonia  compound  and a monocationic 
surfactant  that is commonly  used  in mouthwashes  as an antiplaque  solution(Araujo  et al. 
2015). It can act as a detergent and has antiseptic properties, which are desirable 
characteristics of an ideal plaque control agent. Its ability to inhibit oral biofilm growth is 
due to the nonpolar region of the molec ule that penetrates the cell membrane of the 
bacteria, leading to an osmotic dysregulation, resulting in loss of cytoplasmatic content, 
therefore bacterial cell death. In mouthwashes, CPC presents with a good absorption in 
the oral tissues and is has an an ti-plaque, anti -calculus effect(Haps, Slot, and Berchier 
2008), but has a low substantivity in the oral cavity of only 3 to 5 hours, which makes   a

associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis.  
 
 
*Hypotheses: CPC based chewing gum in addition to tooth brushing will reduce 
plaque and gingivitis scores in adults si milarly to tooth brushing alone.  
*Specific aims: Aim 1: to test the clinical plaque -inhibiting capacity of CPC based 
chewing  gum,  with  mechanical  oral hygiene,  and placebo  as a control.  Aim 2: to evaluate 
the effects of using a CPC based chewing gum, with mechanical oral hygiene, to reduce 
gingivitis.  
 
 
B. Research design and  methods:

This study is a placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized crossover study to 
evaluate the plaque and g ingivitis reducing capacity of Cetylpyridium Chloride (CPC) 
based chewing gum.  
Study Population  
 
Test  group  will be composed  of up to 73 dental,  dental  hygiene  students,  faculty,  and 
staff,  who  will be recruited  from  the University  of [LOCATION_007]  Health  Science  Center  at Houston 
School  of Dentistry  (UTHealth  School  of Dentistry) . Those,  who  meet  the inclusion  criteria

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/17/2017   Plaque Index (PI)(Löe and Silness 1963) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI)(Lobene et 
al. 1989) and bleeding sites on probing (BOP) (Newbrun 1996) will be recorded at 
baseline  for all selected  subjects.  After  assessment,  subjects  will undergo  oral prophylaxis  
to bring  the plaque  levels  to zero.  After  oral prophylaxis  subjects  will be instructed  on the 
proper brushing technique (Modified Bass techniques) and will be given either the test 
chewing gum or placebo formulation. The chewing gums will be packaged in similar 
fashion labeled only as sample A and sample B to ensure proper blinding of the produ ct 
from  the subjects  and the examiner.  All chewing  gums  will be supplied  by [CONTACT_360850],  which  will be sponsoring  the current  study.  The test and control  chewing  gum 
will be dispensed to subjects along with a diary to record product usage and  daily oral 
hygiene  activity.  All the subjects  in both  the groups  will be given  a soft bristled  toothbrush 
and dental floss for use during the study. The study groups will be asked to refrain from 
all other  unassigned  forms  of oral hygiene  for the duration  of the study.  After  four  weeks, 
subjects will be recalled. GBI and PI [INVESTIGATOR_360847] 4 weeks using same

C. Outcomes:  
 
Primary outcome:  
 
The primary outcom e of interest in this study is the efficacy of the antiplaque chewing 
gum in reducing existing supragingival plaque and gingivitis will be assessed.  
Plaque Index - Plaque will be assessed using the Turesky Modification of the 
Quigley -Hein Plaque Index(Ture sky, Gilmore, and Glickman 1970), where a score of 0  to  
8 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -DB-17-0313

Scores  Criteria  
0 No plaque  
1 Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth  
2 A thin continuous band of plaque (up to one mm) at the cervical 
margin of the tooth  
[ADDRESS_449931] but less than two -thirds of the 
crown of the tooth  
5 Plaque covering two -thirds or more of the crown of the tooth  
 
 
Gingivitis  will be assessed  using  both  the Gingival  Index  (GI),  where  a score  of 0 to 
3 will be assigned to six teeth, representing six segments of jaws, at baseline and week 3 
of the study according to the following  criteria:  
Scores  Criteria  
0 Absence of inflammation.  
1 Mild inflammation - slight change in color and little change in 
texture.  
2 Moderate inflammation - moderate glazing, redness, edema, and 
hypertrophy. Bleeding on pressure.  
3 Severe inflammation - marked redness and hypertrophy. Tendency 
to spontaneous bleeding. Ulceration.

as described in Ainamo & Bay, 1975, where each of 4 gingival areas (disto -buccal, 
midbuccal, mid -lingual, and mesio -lingual) around each tooth will be light probed and 
scored from 0 to 2 as  follows:  
Scores  Criteria  
0 Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds  
1 Bleeding after 30 seconds  
2 Immediate bleeding  
 
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
 
Changes from baseline to post -baseline efficacy assessment will be recorded for 
all parameters.  
The antiplaque  chewing  gum  safety  will be evaluated;  the oral soft (OST)  and oral 
hard  tissues  (OHT)  will be examined.  Changes  from  baseline,  such  as soft tissue  erythema, 
ulceration, and sloughing, will be noted and assessments will be made by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_360848] b e attributable to the antiplaque chewing  gum.  
Objective observation of Discoloration of teeth will be recorded using a Vita 3D 
scale. Changes on baseline (day 1) and day 22 and will be annotated as none, slight to 
obvious.  
Study period:  
 
The study period will be comprised of two periods of 21 days with a washout 
period in between. In each 21 days’ period, there are three study visits: 1) Baseline  Day  
10 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -DB-17-0313  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/17/2017   1, 2) Day 11 (after ten days of use), and 3) Day 22 (after 21 days of use – completion of 
the study).  An additional  screening  visit will be required,  and may  or may  not be combined 
with baseline visit, according to patients’  preference.  
Statistical analysis : 
 
The Primary Aim is to evaluate the change in in the score of PI, GI, an d BOP 
averaged across the teeth between the CPC based chewing gum and the placebo gum at 
day 21. Assume there is no carryover effect and no interactions between patients, 
treatments,  and periods;  a paired  t-test is used  to compute  the sample  size.  To detec t an 
effect size for CPC based chewing gum on the changes in the three outcomes at day [ADDRESS_449932] correlation of 0.3 and a significance level of 
0.05,  the study  requires  62 participants  to achieve  80%  power  after  Bonferroni  correction 
for three  tests.  Considering  a dropout  rate of 15%,  we need  to recruit  [ADDRESS_449933] -baseline  efficacy  assessment  for day 21. Longitudinal  data  analysis  will be used  to 
analyze the data through day 0, 10, and 21, to see the pattern of the outcomes. 
Descriptive  statistics  will be provided  for safety  data.  All analyses  will be performed  in SAS 
9.4 (Cary, NC).

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/17/2017   D. Significance:  
 
The overall dental services expenses in 2014 in the [LOCATION_003] alone was 113.5 billion(Wall, 
Nasseh, and Vujicic 2014), with dental prophylaxis accounting to approximately one - 
quarter  of all dental  services  provided  by [CONTACT_360851](Eke,  Wei,  Borgn akke, 
Thornton -Evans, Zhang, Lu, McGuire, and Genco 2016a). In Europe, when periodontal 
therapy was the focus of the cost -benefit analysis, it was reported that the mean cost of 
periodontal therapy per tooth per year was € 2.1 (the US $ 2.23), and the aver age total 
cost per patient  for non-surgical  therapy  was reported  as € 6,450  (US $6,843.13)  with  3.[ADDRESS_449934] for surgical  therapy  per patient  (€ 23,000  - US 
$24,401.85) for the same period(Fardal and Grytten 2013). Furthermore, the authors 
emphasize that the cost of implant maintenance, due to high risk of peri -implantitis was 
significantly higher than the cost of maintaining a natural dentition(Watt and Peter sen 
2012). Analyzing the financial burden of a late periodontitis diagnosis alone would 
warrant  further  research  to identify  efficient  techniques  for early  detection  of periodontal 
disease,  more  effective  methods  of promotion  of periodontal  health,  as well as identifying 
preventive tools for gingivitis and plaque accumulation. As stated by [CONTACT_360852]: -Prevention is crucial to periodontal health(Page et al. 1997; Mariotti and Hefti 
2015;  Hasan  and Palmer) By [CONTACT_360853],  patients  will 
have access to discounted treatment options. Thus optimal oral health care will be the 
expected  outcome.

I. BACKGROUND SIGNIFICANCE  
TBI: Scope of the Problem:  Approximately 1.7 million traumatic brain injury (TBI) related 
emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and deaths occur each year in the US.1 Further, 
both military and civilian medical centers are confronted with an influx of TBI cases due to 
military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.2 Following TBI, individuals face physical, 
cognitive, emotional, and behavioral consequences that impair o verall functioning,  such as 
dependence upon others , inability to work , and problems with interpersonal  relationships. About 
1.1% of the US population is living with long -term disability as a result of TBI3 and one of every 
five individuals hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a TBI does not return to work one year later.[ADDRESS_319178] of TBI are substantial, rang ing from $60.4 billion4 to $[ADDRESS_319179] quality of life. Patients with moderate to severe TBI 
endure average healthcare costs 5.75 times greater than matched controls.6 In addition, rou ghly 
40% of TBI patients suffer from two or more psychiatric disorders,[ADDRESS_319180] of care is 3.4 
times greater for patients with moderate to severe TBI and psychiatric illness than patients with 
TBI and no psychiatric illness.6 
Depression after TBI : Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric 
illness in patients with TBI,8 often impeding the recovery process and resulting in long -term 
impairment in functioning.9 The prevalence of depression in TBI has ranged from 6% to 77% 
using clinical rating scales10 and from 17% to 61% using diagnostic criteria.[ADDRESS_319181] year after TBI (53.1% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_262525]),[ADDRESS_319182] significant treatment 
implications.   
Treatment of Depression in TBI:  Similar to  our understanding of the mechanisms of post -TBI 
depression, there is limited understanding about the efficacy of treatment. Further, there are no 
evidence -based guidelines for the treatment of MDD in patients with TBI. Standard treatments 
for depression i n patients with TBI and mood symptoms, such as p harmacological 
treatments,11,28,29,30,31 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),32,33,34,[ADDRESS_319183] the 
methodological rigor (i.e., randomized controlled trials, la rge samples, clear entry criteria) 
necessary to draw definitive conclusions on the efficacy of traditional treatment for MDD in 
patients with TBI, and clinicians are forced to rely on clinical judgment and recommendations 
used for other populations .44 Rely ing on guidelines developed for the general population is 
problematic given that patients with TBI and psychiatric problems may not respond as well as 
patients without TBI to traditional psychotherapeutic interventions as a result of TBI -specific 
impairmen ts (i.e., impaired cognition).[ADDRESS_319184], often indicating only 
partial symptom reduction and large variability.11,43 Moreover, none of the four studies that 
included cognitive behavioral interventions for depression in TBI and demonstrated some 
improvements in depressive symptoms32,33,34,35 were designed specifically to treat individuals 
with MDD. This is problematic because the efficacy of CBT for MDD following TBI cannot be 
concluded from studies of individuals with subthreshold symptoms, given that comparatively 
greater illness severity, i mpairment in functioning, number of recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and risk of 
relapse are often evident in individuals with MDD.49 Further, the intervention tested by [CONTACT_262568].34 was education -matched (not randomized controlled), designed to treat “emotional 
distress,” and included individuals with TBI as well as non -traumatic brain injuries (i.e., due to 
stroke, tumor, fall). Topolevec -Vranic et al.32 executed a study of internet -delivered CBT that 
was not controlled and Tiersky et al.33 examined a comprehensive treatment program that 
presents significant challenges to feasibility (i.e., cost, resources) and implementation. Finally, 
Bédard et al.[ADDRESS_319185] that minimally adapted CBT may be more helpful in treating MDD 
than a control group after 8 weeks, the study had 1) inconsistent findings ac ross primary and 
secondary measures, 2) a study design that included choice stratification and a biased usual care 
group, and 3) small, heterogenous sample (18 subjects completed in -person CBT). After 16 
weeks, the outcomes for the CBT group were similar t o the usual care group. Ashman et al. 52 
compared the efficacy of TBI -tailored CBT and supportive psychotherapy in a sample of 77 
individuals with depression and mild to severe TBI and found no differences in outcomes 
between interventions. Of note, the study was comprised of a heterogeneous sam ple in terms of 
1) TBI severity and 2) duration of time since injury (average > 10 years), and it demonstrated 
overall low response to treatment. Relatively long duration of time since injury may suggest a 
sample of participants with treatment resistant de pression who are likely to be qualitatively 
different from individuals who have experienced less time since TBI. In addition, the study 
utilized a very active comparison group and found no significant moderating variables, thus 
providing no clear explanati on about the lack of significant findings. Given the paucity of 
research and outstanding questions about the efficacy of an adapted CBT for MDD in individuals 
with TBI, further research is needed.50,52  
Adapting Cognitive Behavioral Treatment will Improve O utcomes:  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_262526], t here are a number of difficulties that distinguish 
depressed individuals with TBI from depressed individuals without TBI.[ADDRESS_319186] persistent cognitive 
problems after TBI include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory.56 Attention 
impairments among those with TBI are multifaceted but can include lowered vigilance, increased 
distractibility, slowed processing time, and impaired ability to attend  to various aspects of one’s 
environment.[ADDRESS_319187] reasoning, planning, conceptual flexibility, and 
organization.55,58 In addition, patien ts with moderate to severe TBIs often experience deficits in 
social cognition (e.g., emotion perception, cognitive empathy)[ADDRESS_319188] CBT for depre ssion involves 50 -minute weekly, individual psychotherapy sessions 
and assumes an adequate degree of cognitive functioning such that patients are able to 1) learn 
and apply new copi[INVESTIGATOR_262527], and 2) complete self -monitoring, skil ls 
practice, and follow through on experiments and activities between sessions.60,[ADDRESS_319189], low adherence rates and feedback 
from an online CBT study highlighted patients’ limitations with reading, comprehension and 
memory.32 Notably, the only randomized controlled trial of (standard) CBT for post -stroke 
depression, another condition wi th significant cognitive deficits, did not demonstrate superiority 
of CBT over the control group.[ADDRESS_319190] been beneficial in improving emotional well -being34 and 
reducin g anxiety in patients with TBI.63 (See Table 2 for adaptations).  
  
[ADDRESS_319191] CBT for depression,60 and adapts it by [CONTACT_262569] (e.g., problems with attention, memory, and 
executive function). The acceptability of the intervention will be examined  in op en study of [ADDRESS_319192] Performance as a Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) Site:  TBIMS is a 
longitudinal, multi -center study which investigates the course of recovery and outcomes 
following acute neurotrauma and inpatient rehabilitation. Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(SRH), our primary recruitment site, enrolled patients in the TB IMS National Database from 
January 1999 through 2007. SRH enrolled a total of 350 subjects into the TBIMS National 
Database during the 8.75 -year period, averaging 40 subjects per year (exceeding the national 
benchmark of 35 per year). Between January 2002 and September 2007, following expansion of 
the SRH Brain Injury Unit, the Spaulding TBIMS enrolled 279 subjects into the database, 
averaging 49 cases per year. After the TBIMS inclusion criteria were expanded to include those 
injured within 72 hours (previ ously 24 hours), during the period between January 2006 and 
September 2007, 100 subjects were enrolled for an average of 57 annually. As a TBIMS 
National Database Follow -up Center (2007 -2011), [ADDRESS_319193] TBI continuum of care was awarded the model systems again from 
2012 -2017.  
TBIMS Secondary Data Analysis:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_262528] a measure of depression (PHQ -9) one ( n=3,182), two ( n=3,142), five ( n=2,792), 
ten (n=1,598), fifteen ( n=372), and twenty ( n=214) years following their injur y.13 After one year, 
28.1% of patients endorsed the presence of [ADDRESS_319194] 2 weeks (score of ≥1 on the PHQ -9), with at least one symptom being depressed 
mood or anhedonia, which was used to indicate the li kely presence of MDD. Prevalence of MDD 
remained relatively stable two (27.8%), five (26.9%), ten (26.3%), fifteen (26.3%), and twenty 
(24.8%) years post injury. In comparison, only 6.6% of the US population will experience MDD 
in a given year,[ADDRESS_319195] sustained 
moderate -severe TBIs. One year following TBI, individuals with depression demonstrate 
elevated rates of suicidal ideation (31.2%) and suicide attempts (3.5%), which persist after two 
years (suicidal ideation 21.1%, suicide attempts 2.4%). Thus, there is a critical need for effective 
treatment of MDD in this population.  
 
INNOVATION  
  
5 
 There are no evidence -based guidelines for the treatment of MDD in patients with TBI. Review 
of pharmacological  studies provides some suggested treatment strategies; however, the majority 
of depressed patients prefer psychotherapy,[ADDRESS_319196] that it could be 
beneficial for pati ents with TBI. However, Beck initially conceptualized cognitive therapy as a 
treatment for depressed individuals in the general population. Since its inception, CBT has been 
adapted for a variety of psychiatric conditions (i.e., suicide, phobias, and perso nality disorders)[ADDRESS_319197] even been developed for depressed 
patients with multiple sclerosis,70 Parkinson’s Dis ease,71 and Alzheimer’s Disease.72 Yet, CBT 
for depression has not been adequately adapted for individuals with TBI who are faced with a 
multitude of specific challenges (i.e., problems with attention and concentration, memory, and 
executive functioning). The proposed research is innovative, in that it demonstrates the first, 
necessary step in developi[INVESTIGATOR_262529] a cognitive behavioral intervention 
for MDD that has been adapted  for individuals with moderate to severe TBI.  Eventual findin gs 
may be used to inform the development of guidelines for depression treatment and inform 
changes in the standard of care in this population.  
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Aim 1: Manual Development.  To develop a structured, cognitive behavioral treatment manual 
for depression adapted for individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury ( CBT -
TBI), as well as evaluate its acceptability and tolerability in an open 12 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (N=10).  
Hypothesis 1a : Participants will report high satisfaction with and acceptability for CBT-TBI 
per clinical interview and  Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262530] – Revised (STTS -R). 
Hypothesis 1b : Subject adherence to the protocol, including clinician -rated, self -report, and 
neuropsychological battery, will be high (at least 80% will complete all sessions).  
 
Aim 2: To evaluate the acceptability and tolerability of, and adherence to, CBT -TBI in a 
randomized waitlist -controlled, 12 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (N=40).  
Hypothesis 2a : Participants will report high satisfaction with and acceptability for the revised 
CBT-TBI per clinical interview and  STTS -R. 
Hypothesis 2b : Eighty percent of subjects receiving CBT-TBI will complete the study.  
 
EXPLORATORY AIM  
 
Aim 3: To evaluate the potential efficacy of CBT -TBI for depression in the randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_2284] (N=40) and possible moderators and mediators  of outcome.  
Hypothesis 3a : CBT-TBI will result in a greater decrease in IDS -C scores after 12 weeks 
(primary outcome) compared to waitlist control.  
  
6 
 Hypothesis 3b :  CBT-TBI will produce an increase in copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], adaptive thinking, positive 
self-appraisal, social functioning, and activity level compared to waitlist control, and these 
factors will mediate depressive outcomes.  
Hypothesis 3c : Degree of cognitive impa irment at baseline will moderate response to 
treatment.

Recruitment : Subjects will be recruited through a number of sources. Spau lding Rehabilitation 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SRH) will be the main recruitment site.  
 
Outpatient Clinics  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_262533] (Mel Glenn, MD) to support recruitment of depressed  patients from the 
TBI outpatient program. The outpatient clinic screens approximately [ADDRESS_319200] that more than half of those 
patients experience notable depressive symptoms . We will collaborate with the manager and 
director of outpatient clinics in order to recruit through advertisements,  clinicians (physiatrists, 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], social workers, psychologists) , and direct mailings . 
One strategy includes study staff review of SRH outpatient clinic schedules and Electronic 
Health Records of current patients in order to identify patients who may be eligible. When 
potentially eligible subjects are identified via chart review, we will either 1) approach the 
treating physician about their potential eligibility and then mail an IRB -approved letter signed by 
[CONTACT_262572] 2) we will mail them a letter directly from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262534]. . Clinical staff will obtain v erbal consent for interested patients to be contact[CONTACT_262573]. When possible, a member of our study 
staff may be on site to share more information about our study with interested patients in person.  
Finally, we will utilize the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) to identify potential subjects 
across MGB based on key inclusion criteria ( e.g., ICD codes indicative of moderate to severe 
TBI, ICD codes for depressive disorders, age 18 and over ) and mail them  research invitations , 
unless they have opted out  (in accordance with July 2021 revised MGB policy) . 
 
 
SRH Inpatient Units  
Subjects will be recruited from the inpatient brain injury rehabilitation units at Spaulding 
Rehabilitation Network facilities. Electronic Health Records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_262574] -eligible subjects and relevant inclusion/exclu sion criteria. Clinical staff will 
obtain verbal consent for interested patients [or surrogates for inpatient]  to be contact[CONTACT_262573]. When possible, a member of our study 
staff may be on site to shar e more information about our study with interested patients in person.  
 
We will plan to attend the Outpatient Brain Injury Advisory Group (OBIAG), the TBI Work 
Group and other arenas in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_262535]. Usin g 
population management tools, we will also ask providers for permission to send mailings to 
patients. We will concentrate our efforts at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], which is the hub 
of the Spaulding Rehabilitation Network (SRN), and is located in C harlestown, MA, which is a 
short distance from MGH and provides a free and easy shuttle service between the facilities. 
Some subjects will also be recruited from other outpatient clinics in the SRN, located throughout 
the greater [LOCATION_011] area and the state.  Recruitment efforts will expand outside SRN to other 
Partners and non -Partners institutions who treat patients with TBI.  
 
Some subjects will also be recruited from the pool of callers to the MGH Depression Clinical and 
Research Program who are interested in research. In addition, we will advertise the study through 
  
8 
 internal research listings distributed via e -mail and posted online by [CONTACT_9435], RSVP for Health (a 
registry run by [CONTACT_262575]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_262536] r esearch can receive information about research studies), a listing on ClinicalTrials.gov, 
and flyers posted on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved bulletin boards or in local health clinics. We will also 
speak with colleagues in the Department of Speech, Language, and Swall owing Disorders, who 
have occasionally sought CBT services from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262537]. We will also reach out to the Neurology Department at MGH. Finally, we will 
coordinate with other community organizations to recru it subjects who are not MGH patients, 
particularly the Brain Injury Association of [LOCATION_005] . We will utilize social media to 
advertise the study, including Twitter and online forums/groups specifically for individuals with 
traumatic brain injury.  Thes e strategies are intended to publicize the study to as large a group as 
possible of people who are interested in research, who suffer from the target conditions, and who 
are likely to be willing and able to come to MGH for the study.  
 
In collaboration with our colleagues at the VA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research 
Education and Clinical Center  (directed  by [CONTACT_262576], PhD), potentially eligible patients will 
be identified and referred from within the VA Healthcare System . Approva l for all recruitment 
through the VA will be obtained by [CONTACT_32084].  We will utilize Electronic Health Record chart 
review to identify potentially eligible subjects . 
 
Additional subjects will be recruited through our partnership with Community Rehab Care in 
Watertown, MA (Medical Director, Mel Glenn, MD, Spaulding Rehab). Staff at Community 
Rehab Care who are briefed on study protocol will gauge client interest in participation and 
encourage interested clients to contact [CONTACT_262577]. Study staff will then screen these participants for eligibility. Study 
clinicians may conduct study procedures (i.e. CBT Treatment, assessment visits) at Community 
Rehab Care in Watertown, MA in order t o minimize participant burden.  
 
Prospective subjects will participate in a brief telephone prescreen by a research coordinator, 
using the standard prescreening format used by [CONTACT_262578] -related 
questions, also IRB -approved. The sta ndard prescreen consists of questions about common 
psychiatric symptoms, comorbidities, psychiatric treatment, and demographic data that would be 
relevant to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, thus decreasing the likelihood that a patient who 
clearly does n ot meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., who has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_262538]) will be put to the inconvenience of coming for a screen. TBI -specific questions 
will relate to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study (e.g., degre e of severity, diagnosis 
and timing of TBI). If interested and deemed likely to be eligible, prospective participants will be 
scheduled for a screening visit in person at the DCRP office.  
 
IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
 
A total of up to 70 subjects who demonstrate clinically significant depressive symptoms and 
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) will be enrolled in the entire study . A Study 
Coordinator will determine possible subject eligibility by [CONTACT_262579] a DCRP 
clinician to determine eligibility. The screening visit, which is about 4-[ADDRESS_319201] 
  
9 
 of a meeting with a clinician for a structured diagnostic interview and assessment of depressive 
severity  and neuropsychiatric symptoms, the completion of self -report questionnaires, and 
neuropsychological testing. This visit may be split into two parts, with the neuropsychological 
assessment occurring during the  second part, in order to accommodate subjects’ potential 
limitations due to fatigue.  
 
In the first phase of recruitment, we will enroll [ADDRESS_319202] the newly 
developed manual in a nonrandomized, open trial. Based on objective and qu alitative feedback 
from participants, the CBT -TBI manual , which includes materials such as CBT homework and 
study diaries,  will then be revised.  
 
Once the CBT -TBI manual has been revised, we will enroll  up to 60 subjects  in the second phase 
of recruitment  with the goal of randomizing 40 participants. They will be enrolled using the same 
procedure as described in the open trial (N=10), but eligible participants will be randomly 
assigned in consecutive order to intervention  or waitlist control group. Given that history of pre -
injury MDD is the strongest predictor of post -TBI depression12 and the higher incidence of MDD 
in women than in men,[ADDRESS_319203] ructured diagnostic interviews and measures of depressi ve severity. DCRP 
clinicians will be included as study staff and be able to obtain informed consent.  
  
Procedures for obtaining informed consent :  
Informed consent will be obtained at the time of the screening visit, prior to the collection of any 
data for the study (such as questionnaires or diagnostic interview). Before meeting with the study 
clinician, subjects will receive a written copy of the c onsent form that includes an easy -to-read 
description of the protocol, risks and benefits, privacy concerns, and provisions for subjects who 
decide to discontinue the study. The Study Info sheet will be emailed or mailed to patients on a 
case-by-case basis  as a supplement to consent review, in order to help patients with cognitive 
impairments process the important information and help them better gauge their potential interest 
in the study. Subjects will be informed that they may voluntarily discontinue participation in the 
study at any time. Repetition of consent information can improve subject understanding,[ADDRESS_319204] to ask questions. The clinician will utilize the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego 
  
10 
 Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC)[ADDRESS_319205]’s c apacity for consent. All clinicians will be trained in the administration of this measure 
prior to beginning recruitment. The [ADDRESS_319206]’s understanding, appreciation, and reasoning about prot ocol elements that 
are critical to meaningful consent. The UBACC typi[INVESTIGATOR_262539] [ADDRESS_319207] obtains 2s on 
all of the items, he/she will sign/date the consent form along with the clinician. If the subject 
obtains 0s or 1s, the information on the items missed and specific questions will be repeated up 
to [ADDRESS_319208]’s assent.  
 In addition to consent for study participation, subjects will be asked to provide optional 
consent for audio /video tapi[INVESTIGATOR_262540]. The purpose of audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], measuring therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262541], will be explained. Subjects who decline consent to 
audio /video tape will be enrolled in the study and their sessions will not be recorded. Further, 
subjects will be presente d with information about between session contact (for those receiving 
the intervention), which will be delivered using telephone calls, text message, or email, 
depending on patient preference. Between session contact [CONTACT_14662] a variety of media will be 
used with the goal of increasing treatment adherence and engagement. On the consent form, 
subjects will be asked to list their preferred methods of communication and will be presented 
with pertinent information about the risks of the various methods of commu nication. This will be 
reviewed again at the time of the intervention by [CONTACT_38674][INVESTIGATOR_262542]/assent.  
 
Once the consent form has been signed and participants have provided the address at which they 
will be completing most CBT sessions, study staff will identify the contact [CONTACT_262580]. This 
information will be stored for quick access in the master log.  
 
V. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
The primary aim of this study is to develop a highly acceptable, manualized treatment ( CBT -
TBI) for MDD in patients with moderate to severe TBI. After developi[INVESTIGATOR_262543] (Phase 1), a 
nonrandomized trial (Phase 2) will be conducted to test its acceptability and tolerability. Based 
on objective and qualitative feedback from participants and input from mentors and consultants, 
the CBT -TBI manual will be revised (Phase 3). We will then pi[INVESTIGATOR_262544] (ID S-C30) after [ADDRESS_319209] control group in a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (Phase 4). Once the 
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_262545], the CBT -TBI manual will be finalized with additional 
feedback from subjects, men tors, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
 
  
11 
 For both phases of recruitment, the same  study  procedures will be used  (unless  procedures are  
modified in Phase 3 , which will then be submitted for IRB review ). The proposed study involves 
the following points of contact:  (1) Obtaining informed consent and  screen ing (may be broken up 
into multiple visits) , (2) biweekly clinician ass essments of depressive and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), (3) weekly self -report assessments of depressive symptoms for 
those receiving the intervention,  (4) 12 weekly individual CBT -TBI sessions for those 
randomized to the intervention,  (5) a comprehensive assessment  at week 12  (primary endpoint) , 
which includes the neuropsychological battery, and (6)  a 3-month follow -up asses sment for those 
who received the intervention (randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103] , phase 4 ). Assessment visits during the 12 
weeks of treatment may be completed by [CONTACT_648]. The week 12 visit can be split into two parts, 
with the neuropsychological assessment occurring du ring the second part, in order to 
accommodate subjects’ potential limitations due to fatigue .  
 
In the context of the COVID -19 pandemic, all in -person procedures will shift to virtual 
administration via Zoom videoconferencing and/or telephone. When clinical research is safe to 
resume in -person, select procedures may occur in office when they are unable to occur remotely. 
For example, participants who do not have access to a computer may go to the Depression 
Clinical and Research Program to complete c omputer -based neuropsychological testing (CNS 
Vital Signs) on a clinic computer.  Parking will be reimbursed per standard Depression Clinical 
and Research Program protocol if participants park in a designated MGH garage.

 Randomized Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (Phase 4): Individuals who are randomized to the wait -list control arm 
will be offered the opportunity to receive  12 weeks of  CBT -TBI after they complete the week 12 
visit. They will not receive additional compensation if they opt to receive the intervention . 
 
Study Intervention  
 
Study Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262551] : Clinicians at the DCRP, including [CONTACT_79783] , will administer 
the treatment protocol. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262552] a  master’s degree and will be 
supervised and trained by [CONTACT_6283]. Pedrelli and Fisher.  
 
Treatment Fidelity : Recommendations suggested by  [CONTACT_262583].[ADDRESS_319218]. 
Pedrelli and the PI.  Weekly supervision with study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262553].   
 
Content of the Treatment ( CBT -TBI):  
 
Introduction (Sessions 1 -2). A gradual introduction to treatment with strong emphasis on 
rapport building , given that participants will likely have cognitive deficits (and some might have 
deficits in social cognition or a degree of paranoia54). Emphasis on psychoeducat ion about 
depression after TBI, as  well as the CBT model.  
 
Behavioral Techniques (sessions 3 -4), including: 1) Symptom self-monitoring . 2) Introduction 
to behavioral activation  and identifying strategies to increase engagement with outside world. 
Increased  interactions with family and friends may create opportunities for positive social 
experiences and foster a sense of belonging in one’s environment, which may help to improve 
depression.110 3) Collaborative identification of SMART goals  (Specific, Measurabl e, 
Achievable, Realistic and Relevant, Time Limited) broken down into achievable components.111 
A problem solving  approach will be used to address possible barriers to achieving goals.112 4) 
Aspects of social skills training113 will be used to address interpersonal and communication 
difficulties.  
 
Cognitive Techniques (sessions 5 -7). The cognitive model will be illustrated with concrete 
examples reviewed multiple times. Strategies to identify cognitive distortions, challenge ne gative 
thoughts, and develop rational responses will be reviewed and simple thought records will be 
used. Cognitive restructuring  will help patients challenge negative beliefs that maintain their 
depression and develop more realistic, adaptive ways of thin king.94 We will elicit patients’ 
automatic thoughts about their injury. For example, catastrophizing and demoralization about 
current inadequacies are often observed in depressed stroke patients who frequently compare 
current functioning with pre -stroke le vel of functioning.[ADDRESS_319219] to life after their injury, while learning to 
identify their values. Research has shown that increased sense of meaning in life is associa ted 
with lower levels of depression.115 
 
Combining Techniques/Copi[INVESTIGATOR_206517] (sessions 8 -11). Focus on integrating concepts via 
practice, repetition, and specific techniques: 1) Behavioral chain analysis  to promote the 
relationship between one’s thoughts, fe elings, and behaviors. Facilitates conceptualization of 
target problems, identifies gaps in skills, provides opportunity for discussion of adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_25146], and facilitates engagement in treatment.116 2) Identification of behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_262554] 
 
21 
 respond impulsively, such as habit reversal centering on a competing response (e.g., fold your 
hands together and squeeze them so you can’t use them) or stimulu s control strategies (e.g. play 
a musical instrument, reminder notes) which are often useful for patients with impulse control 
disorders.[ADDRESS_319220] can help minimize the 
psychological effects of stressful event s that contribute to depression.118,119 3) Behavioral 
experiments  as a vehicle for new learning and belief appraisal,120 particularly when addressing 
difficulties with adjustment and changes in identity.121 
 
Summary, Review, and Relapse Prevention (session 12) : Summary of progress, with emphasis 
on recognizing and responding to signs of relapse. Discussions about further tre atment planning, 
when applicable.  Some assistance with referrals for further treatment may be provided. No 
follow up care will be provided at the DCRP.  
 
Strategies for Tailoring the Treatment  include: 1) between session check -ins (via phone, text 
message, or email) to monitor progress on goals, provide homework reminders, troubleshoot 
barriers, 2) flexible length of weekly sessions (60 min or less), 3) focus on 1 -2 key concepts per 
session, emphasizing repetition and checks for understanding, 4) written ses sion summaries, 5) 
therapeutic use of baseline neuropsychological assessment, 6) use of patient workbook, 7) 
external memory compensations (i.e., calendar, notebook), and 8) inclusion of support person, if 
applicable  (see details in Table  2).

VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Preliminary analyses will describe the participants’ sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics. Comparisons will be made using Mann -Whitney or chi -square tests to determine 
if the randomization provided a balanced sample and if patients who dropped out differ from 
those who did not. All analyses will be conducted using the SPSS and/or Stata statistical 
packages.  
 
Aim 1 (Manual Development and Acceptability and Tolerability in Open T rial): We will use 
descriptive statistics to report the number of intervention sessions attended (we expect > 80%), 
number of assessment sessions attended (we expect > 80%), number of study completers (we 
expect >80%), and rate of satisfaction with treatme nt (total STTS -R score).  
 
Aim 2 (Acceptability, Tolerability, and Adherence in Randomized Trial):  We will use 
descriptive statistics to report the number of intervention sessions attended (we expect > 80%), 
number of participants recruited per month (we ex pect 3/mo), randomization rate (number 
randomized/number consented; we expect about 67% of those consented will be randomized), 
number of assessment sessions attended (we expect > 80%), retention (number of study 
completers/number randomized; we expect >80 %), and rate of satisfaction with treatment (total 
STTS -R score).  
 
EXPLORATORY AIM  
 
 
23 
 Aim 3 (To evaluate the potential efficacy of CBT -TBI for depression in the randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_2284] (N=40) and possible moderators and mediators  of outcome):   
 
Hypothesis 3a: CBT-TBI will result in a greater decrease in IDS -C scores after 12 weeks 
(primary outcome) compared to waitlist control. Response over 12 weeks defined by 50% or 
greater decrease on IDS-C total; remission ≤[ADDRESS_319222] the interven tion’s efficacy. Relevant 
potential covariates  (e.g., caregiver presence) will also be examined. The percent of responders 
and remitters in each group will be computed in order to estimate an effect size for the R01. 
Although I will test for statistical si gnificance, the primary aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_262557]’s effect size to conduct a larger, more adequately powered R01 study, as is 
outlined in NIH guidelines for developi[INVESTIGATOR_262558]128. Given that some prior 
studies utilizing CBT in patients with TBI suggest large effect sizes for reducing emotional 
distress and depressive symptoms,32,[ADDRESS_319223] similar findings.  
 
Hypothesis 3b:  CBT-TBI will produce an increase in copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], adaptive thinking, positive  
self-appraisal, social functioning and activity level compared to waitlist control, and these 
factors will mediate depressive outcomes. To evaluate the indirect effect of CBT -TBI to 
depression (IDS -C) through copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], adaptive thinking, positive self -appraisal, social 
functioning, and activity level, we will employ an SPSS macro (PROCESS) to test the 
significance of the indirect effect with a bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_262559].[ADDRESS_319224] effects, as the assumption of normality for 
the sampling distribution is not required and power is improved.130  
 
Hypothesis 3c: Degree of cogn itive impairment at baseline will moderate response to treatment. 
We will run a  hierarchical  regression model. The main predictor variables  (CBT -TBI, cognitive 
impairment) will be mean centered based on previous research.[ADDRESS_319225] of  cognitive impairment  on the relationship 
between  CBT -TBI and depression  after entering the covariates (i.e., caregiver presence). To 
examine the moderation hypotheses, we will empl oy an SPSS macro (MODPROBE) to test 
whether there is a significant interaction.[ADDRESS_319226], but can include a 
worsening of psychiatric symptoms as well as psychological discomfort associated with 
discussion of one’s difficulties. Patients will be given telephone numbers of the doctors involved 
in the study if they would like t o talk about any discomforts. Second, answering detailed 
questionnaires and completing neuropsychological testing may create a mild degree of 
inconvenience for the subjects, and attending  individual sessions plus rater assessments may be 
seen as time -consuming and inconvenient. For study visits involving assessments and not 
 
[ADDRESS_319227] provided compensation for subjects’ time, commensurate with hourly 
compensation for non -treatment studies being conducted at the DCRP. Third, a general risk 
associated with treatment for depression includes the risk that depression may not respond to 
treatment. Subjects will be informed of all of the aforementioned risks  during the consent 
process . 
 
VIII.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
It is possible that the participants may not receive any direct benefit other than a detailed 
psychiatric evaluation. However, it is hoped that the intervention could provide relief from 
depressive symptoms and improve the level of functi oning exhibited in some participating 
patients with TBI and MDD.  
 
Subjects participating in this study may experience individual benefits from receiving the 
intervention. The intervention, which will be conducted by a master’s or doctoral -level  clinician, 
will be provided to the participants at no charge.  Subjects will r eceive $40 for completion of the 
entire screen visit and $30  each for completion of the endpoint and 3 month follow up visits. If 
patients do not complete the entire screen visit due to ineligibility, they will receive $[ADDRESS_319228] of transportation.  If patients complete the entire screen, but are deemed ineligible after 
the visit based on their medical records, the patient will receive $[ADDRESS_319229] the option of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_262560] 3 
activity tracker (valued at $ 150 retail) or Fitbit Charge 4 (valued at $130 retail) for their personal 
use. This compensation was chosen after consultation with the director of the Depression 
Clinical and Research Program (DCRP) to be consistent with the compensation for non -
treatment studies at the DCRP.  
 
Benefits to future patients, researchers and clinicians could include the development of m ore 
effective treatment for major depressive disorder experienced by [CONTACT_262584] 
a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.  
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Data Safety  
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_262561] (AEs) and Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) experienced by [CONTACT_262585].  “ Serious adverse events are events that result in any of 
the following outcomes: death; a li fe threatening experience; inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening , or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.” SAEs will be discussed with  [CONTACT_262590]’s primary mentor and co -mentors.  
 Notification will be sent to t he IRB by [CONTACT_648], email or a fax transmittal of the report within 
24 hours of the SAE’s occurrence. The sponsor will be notified according to its regulations 
 
[ADDRESS_319230]’s medical history and current conditions, 
and all relevant laboratory data.  This information will be expeditiously reviewed and the 
possible relevance of the SAE to the study intervention will be assessed.   
 
Data Monitoring  
 All data will be entered  into REDCap  directly by [CONTACT_262586] v ia computer or 
tablet.  Use of REDCap  will likely  minimize missing study data and allow for immediate follow 
up on missing items, which is likely to be especially pertinent to the study population, many of 
whom will experience problems with attention and concentration.  
 To insure the usability of self -report data, the research coordinator will review all self -report 
measures to insure their completeness. The PI (or, in rare cases, her designee) will review all 
self-report assessment forms and clinician -administered instruments within one week of their 
completion to assure that they are being completed correctly.  Any errors in completion will be 
reviewed to determine if directions or procedures for the assessments need to be altered.  In this 
case, permission from the IRB will be requested to change any pr ocedure. The intervention 
sessions are also audiotaped and a random selection rated for competence and adherence to the 
protocol.  This will also insure the usability of the data.  
 In addition, a data safety monitoring board will be assembled prior to the start of the study. 
This will consist of at least three staff -level investigators, independent of the current group of 
mentors; one will have expertise clinical interventions with individuals who have sustained a 
traumatic brain injury; the second will hav e expertise in clinical trial design; the third will serve 
as a statistical consultant. The DSMB will meet at least quarterly per year to review study 
progress, address any difficulties with recruitment, and address any safety related matters that 
may aris e. Details of the logistics of the DSMB are as follows:  
a. Unblinded Reporting – Safety information for this study will be reported to the DSMB in an 
unblinded manner.  
b. Range of Safety Reporting to the DSMB – It is considered necessary for the purpose of 
monitoring the safety of the study that the DSMB review not only adverse even ts (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs), but other data that may reflect differences in safety between 
treatment groups. This includes treatment retention rates and reasons for drop -out. 
c. Serious Adverse Events – Expedited review will occur for all ev ents meeting the FDA 
definition of SAEs – 
i.e., any fatal event, immediately life -threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling 
event, event requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congenital anomaly. This 
also includes any ev ent that a study investigator or the DSMB judges to impose a significant 
hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. For purposes of this study, all SAEs will be 
required to be reported to the DSMB, regardless of any judgment of their relatedness  to the study 
intervention. All relevant information will be reported to the DSMB for each SAE including 
information about the event and its outcome, concomitant medications, the subject’s medical 
history and current conditions, and all relevant laboratory  data. Notification by e -mail, and FAX 
transmittal of all related study forms shall be made to the DSMB within 2 days of the occurrence 
of any SAE. Information will be reviewed and a determination made of whether there was any 
possible relevance to the stu dy intervention. Additional reporting to local IRBs will be done 
 
26 
 within 24 hours of the SAE. Reporting to the NIH will be made according to their respective 
regulations governing SAE reporting.  
d. Non-Serious Adverse Events – At periodic intervals (quarter ly during the course of the study 
and then again at its completion), the DSMB will be provided with un -blinded summaries of the 
numbers and rates of adverse events by [CONTACT_1570]. These reports will include types of 
events, severity, and treatment phas e. 
Data on individual non -serious adverse events is not expected to be needed for this review.  
e. Other Safety -Related Reports – At twelve -month intervals throughout the course of the 
study, the DSMB will also receive unblinded summary reports of treatment  retention and reasons 
for drop -out, by [CONTACT_70917].  
f. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] – If at any time during the course of the study, the DSMB judges that 
risk to subjects outweighs the potential benefits, the DSMB shall have the discretion and 
responsibility to recommend that the study be terminated.  
 
Digital Monitoring Device Data Collection:  
Phase I: Data collected from the current study will not be sent to research collaborators outside 
of Partners.  
Phase II: Partners investigators will not se nd research data outside of Partners. Use of Fitbit 
necessitates collection of digital monitoring device (DMD) data through the Fitbit application. 
Study staff will set up deidentified accounts for all participants in the Fitbit group. Account set 
up requi res entries in fields for first and last name, and we will use “Participant” in the first name 
[CONTACT_262588] a de-identified component of the participant’s last name [CONTACT_262589]. Account 
set up also requires entry of approximate height and weight (s elf-reported by [CONTACT_2299]) and 
birthday. To deidentify birth dates, we will standardize approximate birthdays as the first day of 
the month and year of the participant’s birth. Participant DMD data will be processed securely 
though the Fitbit data co llection company, Fitabase. Fitabase does not store identifiable data and 
all data synced from the Fitbit is uploaded through encrypted server communication and stored in 
a highly secure infrastructure.  
Zoom Videoconferencing for Completion of Virtual Proc edures:  
A Partners Enterprise Zoom account will be used for all study visits. Zoom links will be 
provided directly to study participants before treatment or assessment sessions. The waiting 
room will be enabled, and the meeting will be locked once all part icipants have entered. 
Participants will be provided with written guidelines and recommendations for all 
videoconferencing sessions (e.g., use in a private, secure area).

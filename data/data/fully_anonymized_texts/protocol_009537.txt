Version 3;  Date 8/31/[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_1094743] compression (MESCC) is a relatively rare but 
serious complication of cancer occurring in approximately 5% of diagnosed patients (and 
can be the presenting symptom in up to 20% of undiagnosed cases).  It is a medical 
emergency, which if not addressed, can lead to permanent neurologic deficits including 
paraplegia.  Although patients with this presentation often do poorly (median survival is 
estimated at between 3-6 months), there are prognostic indicators of improved outcomes 
including the preservation of ambulation ability, radiosensitive tumor histology, low 
systemic extent of disease, and single involved region of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [1].  
Prompt diagnosis  and treatment using a multidisciplinary approach has now 
become the standard of care.  Diagnosis is aided by [CONTACT_26243][INVESTIGATOR_793907], with the most common including back pain, motor deficits, sensory 
deficits and autonomic dysfunction.  Approximately 60% of patients remain ambulatory at 
presentation [2].  Diagnosis is confirmed radiographically with MRI being the current 
method of choice (sensitivity and specificity of up to approximately 93% and 98% 
respectively) [3].  
First line  therapy for MESCC begins with corticosteroids to reduce edema and 
provide cytoreductive effects on some sensitive histologies [4].  Until recently, the 
standard of care for patients was conventional fractionated radiotherapy delivered on an 
emergent basis.  However, a prospective randomized study in 2005 by [CONTACT_793936] a subset of patients followed by 
[CONTACT_793937] a number of benefits when compared to radiation therapy 
alone [5].  Patients preserved the ability to ambulate (84% vs. 57%, p=0.001) and more 
regained this ability (10 patients vs. 3 patients).  Furthermore, those patients undergoing 
surgery had improved survival times (median 126 days vs. 100 days, p=0.003).  The key 
conclusion from this study was that when used judiciously on a carefully selected cohort 
of patients, surgical decompression can provide a viable alternative to definitive 
radiotherapy.  These criteria include a non-radiosensitive or unknown primary histology, 
single area of compression, symptoms present no longer than 48 hours, or relapsed or 
progression of disease while receiving radiotherapy [1].  It is estimated that 10-15% of 
patients are appropriate candidates for surgery [2].
For the  majority of patients that do not meet the aforementioned criteria or who are 
poor surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities or other factors, the correct 
treatment approach is an open question.  Definitive radiotherapy remains the standard of 
care with or without corticosteroids, however there has been no clear demonstration of 
the effectiveness of conventional treatment for improving neurologic function in patients 
with MESCC, among several tested dosing regimens [2].  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we plan to 
evaluate the use of staged high-dose radiotherapy for patients with MESCC, to determine 
if a treatment response can be observed within a short enough interval to improve 
symptoms or provide additional radiotherapy safely.  We will utilize SBRT where possible 
as this technique has shown promise in providing disease and symptomatic control to 
date.

Version 3;  Date 8/31/[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_1094744] common treatment of MESCC [2].  There have been several randomized trials 
regarding the optimal dosing regimen in these patients, however none has been found to 
be significantly effective in improving functional outcomes.  
An early  example analyzed 276 patients with MESCC comparing two 
hypofractionated regimens; sequential single-fraction dosing (8 Gy x 2 on days 1 and 8) 
vs. a split-course regimen (5 Gy x 3, 4-day treatment break, followed by 3 Gy x 5). They 
found no difference in pain control or post-treatment motor function, with ambulation 
preserved in approximately 70% in both groups [6].  A larger retrospective comparison 
from the same year reviewed 1,[ADDRESS_1094745] regimens (8 Gy x 1, 
4 Gy x 5, 3 Gy x 10, 2.5 Gy x 15, and 2 Gy x 20), and also found no difference in functional 
outcomes, however noted that local control was improved in the longer courses.  Notably, 
a multivariate analysis identified several factors aside from the treatment regimen that 
influenced functional outcomes, including age, performance status, tumor histology, 
number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_50027], ambulatory status and interval to treatment [7].  
These results  were further corroborated by a non-randomized prospective trial 
including 265 patients with MESCC, comparing a short-course regimen (8 Gy x 1 or 4 Gy 
x 5) to a long-course (3 Gy x 10, 2.5 Gy x 15, or 2 Gy x 20).  The authors found that the 
radiation schedule had no significant impact on functional outcomes based on univariate 
analysis (performance status, tumor type, number of vertebrae involved, ambulatory 
status prior to treatment, and time to symptoms were all significant), though long-courses 
were associated with improved local control [8].  A systematic review and clinical practice 
guideline recently recommended that for non-surgical patients, those with poor prognoses 
should receive 8 Gy x 1, whereas those with more favorable prognoses should be treated 
with 3 Gy x 10 [4].  It should be reiterated that improvement of motor function was 
observed in only 28% of patients after shortcourse radiotherapy and in 29% of patients 
after longercourse radiotherapy, indicating neither is effective for this purpose.  Further 
progression of motor deficits was prevented in 56% and 55% of patients, respectively.
Most recently,  another prospective randomized trial comparing 10 Gy x 1 vs. 4 Gy 
x 5 for patients with MESCC again found both groups performed similarly without a noted 
improvement in neurologic outcomes [ASTRO 2014].  Improvement in mobility status was 
even less impressive, occurring in only 10.5% of patients on each arm while improvement 
in bladder control occurred in 2.6 to 10.5% of patients.  Although the 10 Gy arm was not 
inferior to the 20 Gy arm, this study again showed that conventional definitive 
radiotherapy had a poor vital and functional prognosis overall.
Currently 10 Gy  x 1 using conventional techniques remains an option based on 
existing clinical data.  However, there is clearly a need for a more effective treatment for 
patients with MESCC who cannot undergo surgery.

Version 3;  Date 8/31/[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_1094746] 10 years, the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has 
shown increasing promise in treating spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278].  A number of retrospective and 
prospective studies have demonstrated effective local and symptomatic control.
A small  retrospective series from Yamada et al initially demonstrated that 
stereotactic treatment or retreatment of paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_793908] 70 Gy could be achieved 
safely using non-invasive body frames.  35 patients underwent treatment with 90% 
reporting palliation of pain or parasthesias with local control rates of 75-81% [9].  Notably 
there were no cases of radiation induced myelopathy indicating high-dose per fraction 
was possible while respecting spi[INVESTIGATOR_793909].  A larger phase I-II study of spi[INVESTIGATOR_793910] 63 patients (74 metastatic lesions) with 27-30 Gy in 
3-6 fractions.  Similarly, they noted 1-year local control rates of 84% [10].  A much larger 
cohort of 500 patients were prospectively followed by [CONTACT_793938] 12.5 o 25 Gy.  Long-term pain control was consistent with previous 
findings of 86%, with local control reported at 90%.  Further, 84% of patients with a 
progressive deficit reported some clinical improvement [11].   
Although these  findings and others support the use of SBRT for local and 
symptomatic control for spi[INVESTIGATOR_158308], patients with MESCC present a unique 
problem of the tumor abutting the thecal sac and cord directly, potentially limiting its 
application while respecting constraints on the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522263].  In these cases, a 
therapeutic dose of16-24 Gy in 1-3 fractions often cannot safely be delivered.  
More recently,  a prospective clinical trial reported on the effectiveness of SBRT for 
patients with MESCC, as measured by [CONTACT_793939][INVESTIGATOR_793911].  They enrolled 62 patients with MESCC who were 
treated with 14-20 Gy in a single fraction.  The results demonstrated a 64% reduction of 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_793912] 2 months following treatment, with 80% of the patients also 
showing improvement in thecal sac patency.  Notably, however, 16% of these patients 
had neurologic progression (9/62 patients).  Of these 9 patients, 5 had decompressive 
surgery thereafter in which 2 showed necrosis, 2 died from intraoperative complications 
and 1 had tumor progression [12].  This trial indicated that a radiographic response can 
be observed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], however there is clearly a risk of neurological toxicity from delivering 
single doses of [ADDRESS_1094747] constraints ranging from 10-14 Gy for 
single fraction SBRT treatments [10, 13, 14].  RTOG 0631, an ongoing prospective 
randomized trial which investigated the use of SBRT for palliation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278] 
(16 Gy SBRT vs. 8 Gy x 1 conventional), applied these constraints using 10 Gy to 10% 
of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (cross sectionally) to a maximum of 6mm above and below the target 
volume, and max dose of [ADDRESS_1094748] constraints.  We hypothesize that a single fraction of treatment 
may induce a short-interval radiographic response (within approximately 2-3 weeks), 
which can then be used to plan an additional treatment if needed.  The response may

Version 3;  Date 8/31/2016component and  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  If possible, CT myelogram should be obtained prior to 
simulation for accurate delineation of the true cord.  Special attention (and consideration 
of deformable registration) should be taken with image fusion when simulation CT and 
MRI images are taken in different imaging positions.
The gross  tumor volume (GTV) should include only the gross disease visible on 
pre-treatment imaging.  A 0-3mm margin expansion is allowed to clinical target volume 
(CTV), as well as a further 1-2 mm expansion to planning target volume (PTV).
For 3D treatment, the  target volume should also be delineated.  The treatment field 
can include a margin of 1-2 cm beyond the vertebral body(s) in any direction, based on 
the treating physician’s discretion, as long as more than or equal to 90% of the target

6.1  Primary Endpoint –  Radiographic Response
The primary  endpoint of this study is achieving radiographic response in the 
metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_158291].  
Radiographic response  will be achieving 3mm in shortest distance axially between 
the gross disease and spi[INVESTIGATOR_793920], between pre-treatment and interval imaging scans.
Radiographic response will also  be achieving a 10% reduction in epi[INVESTIGATOR_793921]-treatment and interval imaging scans.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_793922]. Thecal sac compression will be estimated using 
a method adapted from [12].  The thecal sac area at the level of compression is compared 
to the average value of thecal sacs measured at [ADDRESS_1094761] not 
directly involved in the patient’s clinical care.  This approach will preserve objectivity and 
mirrors an existing peer review process in place for all standard and stereotactic radiation 
treatments.  Collaboration with neuroradiology will also be encouraged during these 
assessments.
6.2  Secondary  Endpoints – NRPS, FACT-G, Ambulation
Secondary endpoints  include pain, quality of life and functional outcomes.
For evaluation  of pain relief, the Numerical Rating Pain Scale will be used, as done 
in RTOG 0631. The NRPS is a measure of pain on an 11-point scale (0-10) and has been 
validated previously on similar cohorts [16].
For quality  of life, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), v. 4.0, 
also will be collected (also utilized in RTOG 0631). The FACT-G is a commonly used tool 
measuring quality of life from 4 different perspectives (physical, social, emotional and 
functional) [17].  It is completed quickly, is accessible to those with varying educational 
backgrounds, and is available in many languages 
(http://www.facit.org/translation/translation_landing.aspx).
Functional outcomes  and ambulation will be assessed by [CONTACT_793944] (Appendix D) by [CONTACT_1963].

performed.  Estimates of the treatment effect and standard error on the number of 
subjects achieving >=3 mm distance will also be used to determine the sample size 
required for the larger scale study. Therefore, the size of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_793923], where precision 
is measured by [CONTACT_282451] 95% confidence interval.  
The treatment  effect will be estimated by p, the observed proportion of patients 
achieving at least [ADDRESS_1094763] confidence 
interval.  With 24 subjects and assuming an expected response rate p = 50% produces a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 58% (i.e. 21%<=p<=79% ). The 
width shows that the response rate will not be lower than 20%. Since this is a feasibility, 
study no power calculation is done.
Data regarding secondary  endpoints will be reported in a descriptive manner.

Version 3; Date 8/31/[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_1094765] of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in 
this study
 Who will have access to that information and why
 Who will use or disclose that information
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their 
PHI.
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.
9.2  Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial.
9.3  Case Report Forms
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the 
study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.

The Albert Einstein College  of Medicine/Albert Einstein Cancer Center Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) has the responsibility for ensuring data and safety 
monitoring along with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793925].  The primary functions of the AECC DSMC are as follows:
1.  To review  and ensure protocol compliance with dose escalation in phase I trials 
2. To review/assure  protocol compliance for all trials that have two-stage phase II 
designs, 
3. Reviewing  all internal and external serious adverse reports, investigator alerts, 
action letters, and other safety reports for trials being performed at AECC-affiliated 
institutions and; 
4. To implement  and to determine the adequacy of DSM plans of all approved 
protocols. 
 The  DSMC is an independent committee and meets on a monthly basis.  During its 
monthly meeting, the DSMC will review serious (grade 3 or higher) adverse events from 
this study.  In the event that the DSMC decides that a revision is warranted, the committee 
will immediately notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105].  The DSMC has the authority 
to close trials to patient accrual should the risk to patients be excessive or outweigh the 
potential benefits of the study.  All study suspensions and closures will be forwarded to 
the IRB/CCI and study sponsor from the DSMC.

Version 3; Date 8/31/201611.0  ADVERSE EVENTS
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
or clinical investigation subject and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of treatment.  During clinical trials, AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. 
AEs will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, regardless 
of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial intervention or medication. All AEs considered related to trial intervention or medication will be followed until resolution, even if this occurs post-trial.
11.1  Adverse Event Definitions
Adverse Event (AE):  any new, undesirable medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product-related.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes (CFR 312.32)
 Death
 Life-threatening adverse experience
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793926], transfusional support, disease staging/re-staging procedures, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious events
 Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
 Congenital anomaly / birth defect. 
The definition of SAE also includes important medical event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506].  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive 
IRB NUMBER: 2015-4957
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/15/2016
Version 3; Date 8/31/2016treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of treatment should be considered an important medical event.
The definition of “related” is that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or the study 
intervention caused the adverse experience.
Unexpected Adverse Event:  An AE that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure 
or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the 
investigator's brochure or package insert.
Life-threatening:  Any adverse experience that places the patient or subject, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
AEs will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Appendix B). A list of AEs that have occurred or might occur can be found in sections above.  
11.[ADDRESS_1094766] notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793927] a patient.  In general, SAEs assessed as clearly being due to disease progression, and not due to study drug(s), should be excluded from AE reporting.  Study-specific clinical outcomes of death because of disease progression are exempt from SAE reporting, unless the investigator deems them related to use of the study drug.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793928].
The following steps will be taken to report promptly and document accurately any SAE, 
even if it may not appear to be related to the study treatment:
 Report the SAE to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793929], telephone or fax 
within [ADDRESS_1094767] the SAE accurately on the AE page of the patient’s CRF.
 Using the standard IRB-SAE report form, submit all known patient information 
within 24 hours of SAE occurrence to the clinical trial office to submit to IRB and DSMB.  Date and sign each report before submission.  Include the following 
IRB NUMBER: 2015-4957

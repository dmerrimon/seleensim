  1-1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
A Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Multicenter Phase III Trial of Alpha 1 – 
Antitrypsin (AAT) Combined with Corticosteroids vs Corticosteroids Alone for the Treatment 
of High -Risk  Acute Graft -versus -Host Disease (GVHD) Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic 
Stem Cell Transplant  
 
Co-Chairs :  
 
Study Design:  This study is a phase II I, multicenter, double -blinded, 
randomized, placebo- controlled trial des igned to compare AAT 
and corticosteroids  (CS) to placebo and CS  as first  line therapy 
for patients with high- risk acute GVHD.  
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) on Day [ADDRESS_767397]- randomization between AAT and CS  versus placebo to 
match ( PTM ) and CS  in patients with high -risk acute GVHD. 
 Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives are to assess the following: 
1. Duration of response at 6- and 12-months post-randomization. 
2. Cumulative incidence of non- relapse mortality  (NRM) at 6- 
and 12-months post-randomization. 
3. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) at 
6- and 12-months post-randomization. 
4. GVHD-free survival at Day [ADDRESS_767398]-randomization. 
5. Proportions of CR, very good partial response (VGPR), PR, and treatment failure (TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and [ADDRESS_767399]-randomizations. 
6. Proportion of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 
and [ADDRESS_767400] -randomization who receive ruxolitinib or other 
second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583683]- line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM. 
7. Incidence of systemic infections  to assess safety . 
8. Incidence of A dverse Events (AEs)  at [ADDRESS_767401]-
randomization.

3. Blood ratios of T regulatory to T effector cells (Treg/Teff), Natural Killer (NK) cells and cellular immune  subsets at 
baseline and at Days 14, 28, and [ADDRESS_767403]- treatment initiation.  
5. Overall and organ -specific response rates comparison based 
on Minnesota (MN) risk groups (Revised Minnesota High vs Standard) and organ- specific response rates comparison 
based on biomarker-based risk groups.

Inclusion Criteria:  Patients meeting the eligibility  criteria should be enrolled as soon 
as possible after the start of CS, but no more than 72 hours afterwards.   
1. Patients experiencing their initial presentation of acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy after allogeneic transplant for any malignant or non-malignant indication. 
2. The clinical diagnosis of acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy with CS. Patients can be enrolled with only a clinically established diagnosis. Biopsy of involved organs with acute GVHD is encouraged but is not required and should not delay study entry. Enrollment/randomization includes commitment to continue steroids with PTM or AAT as specified in the protocol, as well as the required follow -up 
observations. If, according to institutional practice, the intention to treat is dependent upon biopsy results, the patient should not complete enrollment on the BMT CTN [ADDRESS_767405] meet one (either A or B) of following clinical features within 72 hours prior to enrollment:  
(A) High -risk by [CONTACT_583732] (any one 
below): 
Single organ involvement

OR:  
(B) Either of the below: 
1. Isolated stage [ADDRESS_767406] received systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of active GVHD except for a maximum of 72 hours of prior CS therapy prior to enrollment. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_583684] (such as budesonide and oral beclomethasone diproprionate) are allowed.  
6. Patients 12 years of age or older at time of enrollment.  
7. Ability to provide written informed consent from patient, 
parent or legal guardian, and assent if applicable. 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Patients with prior exogenous AAT exposure for GVHD prophylaxis.  
2. Relapsed, progressing or persistent malignancy 
3. Evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) requiring withdrawal of systemic immune suppression.  
4. Patients with acute GVHD developi[INVESTIGATOR_583685] a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for relapse / progression of disease. Patients with acute GVHD af ter 
planned donor lymphocyte infusion or planned T cell or NK cell add back are eligible.  
5. Patients with uncontrolled infections will be excluded. Infections are considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment, no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or  symptoms will not be interpreted as 
progressing infection.

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August [ADDRESS_767420] disease (GVHD)  is a frequent complication of allogeneic hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT) involving activation of donor T -lymphocytes against host tissues1. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583690], up to 30- 50% of HCT recip ients will experience acute 
GVHD of varying severity1-3. The syndrome of acute GVHD  involves multiple target organs, 
including the skin (presenting most  frequently as a maculopapular rash), intestinal tract 
(presenting as nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea), and liver (presenting as cholestatic liver injury 
with or without transam inase elevation).  
The mainstay of treatment of acute GVHD  is high dose corticosteroids (CS), typi[INVESTIGATOR_583691] 1- 2 mg/kg per day4. High dose CS have several 
shortcomings, including both limited efficacy as well as toxicity including infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], osteoporosis and osteonecrosis . Approximately 
50% of patients respond to CS, while only 30% have a durable response
5-7. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583692], no prospective study has demonstrated an advantage in response rate or survival for 
the addition of a second agent to CS  for the treatment of steroid naïve acute GVHD8-13. 
1.[ADDRESS_767421] been conducted in the Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Clin ical Trials Network (BMT CTN). The first, BMT CTN 0302, was a 
multicenter, randomized, four -arm phase II trial that was designed to identify the agent most 
promising for use in addition to CS  for the front -line therapy of acute GVHD8. Patients with a 
new diagnosis of acute GVHD were randomized to receive either etanercept, mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), denileukin diftitox, or pentostatin in additional to high dose CS . The proportion 
of Day 28 CR/PR was highest in the MMF arm at 60%. Thus, MMF was selected for a randomized 
phase III trial of MMF versus placebo in addition to CS for first -line therapy of acute GVHD  in 
the subsequent study, BMT CTN 080213. In BMT CTN 0802, MMF did not meet the primary 
endpoint of extending GVHD -free survival at D ay [ADDRESS_767422] therapy. Neither BMT CTN 0302 nor 0802 was risk-
stratified according to clinical or biomarker -based strategies (nor any such trial published to date).  
To that end, application of risk- adaptive approaches targeting patients who have a lower 
likelihood of responding to steroids alone and; accordingly, a high-risk for non- relapse mortality 
(NRM), may identify cohorts capable of benefiting from intensification of immune suppression. 
1.[ADDRESS_767423] been recently developed a nd refined. These strategies 
include models built upon initial clinical staging of acute GVHD  target organs (e .g., skin, 
intestinal tract, and liver) and ser um biomarker -based approaches. Both of these strategies hold 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-2 value in identifying patients who a re likely to respond well ( i.e., demonstrate a complete response 
[CR] or partial response [PR]) to CS and thus less likely to die due to complications of the 
transplant (NRM)14-16. 
1.3.1 Risk Stratification by [CONTACT_583736] 1990, Weisdorf et al. identified in multivariate analyses that 
overall stage score (sum of each acute GVHD  organ stage 0 -4, plus 
1 point for upper GI, for a maximum score of 13) was strongly 
associated with likelihood of CR17. Based upon this initial 
observation that single organ involvement was more likely to 
achieve a CR than multi -organ involvement, the GVHD Risk 
Score was subsequently developed by [CONTACT_583737]18. 
Multivar iate analysis of the outcomes of 864 consecutive patients 
from 1990- 2007 yielded the following high- risk organ stages:  skin 
stage 4, lower gastrointestinal stage 3/4, liver stage 3/4, or skin 
stage 3 plus lower gastrointestinal or liver stage > 2 GVHD.  
The GVHD Risk Score has recently been refined using data from multiple centers with a total of 1,723 patients used in modeling – 
the largest acute GVHD  cohort analyzed for their characteristics

19. Developed using clinical groupi[INVESTIGATOR_583693], this new Risk Score  
(http://z.umn.edu/MNAcuteGVHDRiskScore ) [referred to as 
Minnesota (MN) Risk Scores] can classify patients into high- risk 
(HR) or standard risk at the o nset of acute GVHD  symptoms. In 
this model, 84% of patients are classified as standard risk, defined as single organ involvement (stage 1- 3 skin or stage 1- 2 GI) or two 
organ involvement (stage 1- 3 skin plus stage 1 GI; or stage 1- 3 
skin plus stage 1- 4 liv er), with a Day 2 8 CR/PR rate of 69% 
(Figure 1-1).  All others are considered HR, wi th a Day 28 CR/PR 
rate of 43%. This model can be used in real time at the time of acute GVHD  diagnosis, making it practical for stra tification in 
clinical trials. Similarly, this model predi cted for 6 -month NRM 
(Standard risk 22% vs High risk 44%, p-0.001).  
1.3.[ADDRESS_767424] published 
approximately a decade ago
20, 21. The University of Michigan group has significantly expanded 
the proteomic profiling of patients with acute GVHD  in recent years by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a 3- level risk 
stratification system, Ann Arbor 1 (AA1) low -risk acute GVHD, Ann Arbor 2 (AA2) 
intermediate -risk acute GVHD , and Ann Arbor 3 (AA3) high- risk acute GVHD . The Ann Arbor 
score is based upon serum or plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor -1 (TNFR1), 
regenerating islet -derived 3 -alpha (REG3α), and suppres sion of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) measured 
at diagnosis of GVHD, regardless of clinical severity (grades I -IV). Each Ann Arbor score 
corresponds to a distinct risk of six- month NRM, such that AA1 GVHD has <  10% NRM, AA2 
GVHD ~25% NRM, and AA3 GVHD has >  40% N RM. The scoring algorithm was validated in  Figure 1-1 Comparison of

 Version 5.0, August [ADDRESS_767425] majority of differences in NRM. Patients with AA1 demonstrate 81% CR/PR at D ay 28 and AA2 patients demonstra te 68% CR/PR at D ay 28 ( Figure 1-1 and 
Figure 1-2). In contrast, high risk AA3 pat ients demonstrate 46% CR/PR at D ay 28. Furthermore, 
treatment responses for patients with AA3 GVHD are significantly less likely to be durable compared to AA1 and AA2 patients with only 21% of AA3 patients remaining in a CR without a flare at six months from diagnosis compared to 47% of AA1/2 patients (p  < 0.001). Importantly, 
similar proportions of patients are assigned to each Ann Arbor score in each of the three standard groupi[INVESTIGATOR_583694] (I vs II vs III/IV). Thus, approximately 20% of all newly diagnosed GVHD cases have a high- risk biomarker profile and have lower likelihood of response 
to primary treatment and experience high NRM even when the clinical presentation is not severe, such as a < 50% skin rash (grade 1 acute GVHD ). Further, patients who present with a limited 
skin rash yet have a high -risk biomarker panel (AA3) have been shown to have high NRM due to 
subsequent development of ste roid-refractory lower GI GVHD. As such, the biomarker panel 
appears to identify patients who have or will develop high risk lower GI GVHD. More recently, 
the same group has validated these results using two of the original three biomarkers (ST2 and REG3α)
22. While promisin g to date, biomarker -based risk stratification has heretofore not been 
prospectively validated for determining eligibility in the context of a large multi- center GVHD 
treatment trial.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_767426] of Lower GI GVHD on NRM: Further R efinement of the R evised Minnes ota 
Prognostic 
As confirmed by [CONTACT_583738], isolated acute GVHD  of the skin is generally not 
life-threatening with the majority of patients responding to topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic steroids. 
On the other end of the spectrum, patients who19, 23 experience advanced stage 3 -4 acute GVHD  
of liver (peak total serum bilirubin > 6 mg/dL) have poor outcomes but represent only 2% of the current transplant population
19, 24. While the incidence of severe gastro intestinal GVHD 
(stage 3- 4, or peak diarrheal volumes over 1.5 liters per day) has also decreased during the past 
decade, treatment remains unsuccessful in most cases, and the gastrointestinal tract is involved in virtually all fatal cases of acute GVHD
24. Accordingly, reducing acute GVHD mortality is 
contingent upon improving responses in patients with lower GI GVHD.  
Two distinct phenotypes of gut GVHD can be identified—upper gut (limited to stage 1) and mid-lower gut —that differ in presentation, natural history, response to therapy, and risk of 
mortality. The upper gut phenotype generally does not  progress to the mid -lower gut phenotype 
and has been shown not to impact NRM
25, 26. In contrast, the mid -lower gut phenotype of GVHD 
presents with se cretory, protein- rich diarrhea27, 28. In severe cases, the entire small intestine and 
colon are edematous and inflamed, with diarrheal volumes in excess of 1.[ADDRESS_767427] initial therapy remains prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day, with addition of other immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583695]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583696], outcomes are poor in the approximately 50% of patients who do not  respond to 
high dose CS due to a high likelihood for treatment resistanc e to additional lines of immune 
suppression, infection, and considerable NRM. While de novo development of stage 3- 4 lower

  1-4 GI GVHD clearly represents high risk acute GVHD , only a small percent (8%) of patients present 
with this stage, with the vast majority developi[INVESTIGATOR_583697] (termed steroid -refractory)19. Taking this into 
consideration, targeting any patient who presents with diarrhea (regardless of volume) for clinical 
trials wou ld be one strategy to reduce GI GVHD -related mortality. Unfortunately, amongst 
patients who present with any lower GI tract involvement, a sizable fraction may do well with a steroid -alone approach, thereby [CONTACT_583739] a meaningful effect  of 
investigational therapy.  
Recently, a database of 309 consecutive patients with GI GVHD was analyzed from The University of [LOCATION_007], MD Anderson Cancer Center between the years of 2009-2012
29. 
Roughly half of the patients presented with isolated upper GI GVHD with minimal (<  500 cc in 
24 hours) stool output. An analysis of all the remaining patients with stage 1 or higher lower GI GVHD (either isolated or combined with another organ) is shown in Table [ADDRESS_767428] a higher D ay 28 response rate with 
roughly 3/[ADDRESS_767429] -line therapy. Similar results were seen for patients 
enrolled onto two  consecutive acute GVHD trials within the Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN 0302 and 0802 trials) with a 75% Day [ADDRESS_767430]-line therapy for those presenting with i solated stage 1 lower GI GVHD ( Table 1 -1). 
However,  from these datasets, patients with isolated lower GI stage [ADDRESS_767431] a Day 28 response rate of 50- 57% and despi[INVESTIGATOR_583698] “standard risk” per the 
Minnesota Clinical Staging system define a population at risk for treatment resistanc e who may 
potentially benefit f rom a high- risk treatment protocol.  Importantly, combining these subsets of 
GI GVHD with the Minnesota HR groups would increase study eligible patients from roughly 15% to 25-30%.

1.4 Study Hypothesis and Design 
Identification and novel treatment strategies for patients at risk for steroid resistance remains a 
major unmet clinical need. In this context it is hypothesized that administration of additional 
immune suppression capable of increasing response rates without toxicity will limit further progression of GVHD and improve outcomes. Reflective of the above advancements in risk 
stratification for patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD, we propose enrolling patients with newly -diagnosed Minnesota HR, isolated lower GI Stage 2 or Lower GI stage 1 plus any skin 
onto a prospective, double -blind, randomized, phase III trial of prednisone at a dose of 
2 mg/kg/day (or methylprednisolone- equivalent) plus α
1- Antitrypsin (AAT) or placebo. 
Our hypothesis is that the addition of the AAT, Zemaira®, a therapy with a demonstrated safety 
record as well as pre -clinical and clinical data in the setting of acute GVHD , will improve Day [ADDRESS_767432] improved long- term 
outcomes (survival and NRM) when compared to non- responders and serves as a validated 
primary endpoint for acute GVHD  trials.

 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-6 1.5 Alpha  1-Antitrypsin (AAT) 
Alpha 1-A ntitrypsin (AAT) is a naturally occurring 52- kDa circulating protease inhibitor 
produced by [CONTACT_583740]. Serum AAT concentrations in healthy 
individuals range from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/ml and can increase twofold during inflammation, coinciding with AAT’s role as an acute phase reactant
30. Congenital deficiency in AAT results in emphysema 
and cirrhosis of the liver31, 32. In addition, AAT deficiency has been associated with the 
development of various autoimmune diseases including necrotizing panniculitis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and glomerulonephritis
33. AAT is licensed for long- term 
augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with severe hereditary deficiency of AAT with clinically evident emphysema. Consistent safety of the investigational product when administered intravenously ( IV) for AAT deficiency has been observed in more than [ADDRESS_767433] in this therapy across various inflammatory and immune -mediated conditions. 
1.5.1 Alpha  1-Antitrypsin (AAT) as an I mmunomodulatory  
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated AAT to not only possess the ability to inhibit serine proteases, such as elastase and proteinase- 3, but also exert anti -inflammatory and tissue 
protective effects independen t of protease inhibition. AAT appears to effectively interfere with 
inflammatory responses and protect from cell death in a large number of in vivo  and in vitro  
experimental models reviewed in Table 1 -2 and Table 1-3. A noteworthy example includes the 
blockade of inflammatory cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
34. 
Specifically, AAT decreases the production of important inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF -α) and IL -1β, two prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_583699]. 
AAT also lowers the levels of chemokines IL -8 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) -1, two 
major cytokines important in the traf ficking of inflammatory cells. While the activity of 
proinflammatory cytokines appears to consistently diminish in the presence of AAT, the release of anti -inflammatory mediators increases. For example, the endogenous inhibitor of IL -[ADDRESS_767434], responses of purified T -lymphocytes are consistently unaffected37, 38, 40- 43, allowing 
for a variety of responses to concanavalin A and anti -CD3/CD28 stimulation to persist. 
This cell-specific discretion, together with the ability to protect tissues from injury, sets AAT in 
a unique niche among modulators of the immune system and distinguishes it fr om classic 
immunosuppressants.

cytokines and suppression of anti -inflammatory cytokines; indirectly altering the in vivo ratios of 
donor effector T -cells (Teff) to donor regulatory T -cells (Tregs); interference with activation of 
dendritic cells; and suppression of the development of GVHD42, 63, 64. In three independent 
laboratories using several different murine models of GVHD, administration of AAT improved 
survival and GVHD -severity scores when compared to mice treated with control, human albumin. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583701], AAT exposure did not impact T -cell function ( either Tcon or Treg) 
in vitro and in minimal residual disease (leukemia) models, AAT exposure did not appear to 
inhibit the graft -versus- leukemic effect. The impact of AAT on T -cell ratios was determined to 
result from the suppression of pro- inflammatory c ytokine secretion, namely, TNF -α, IL-1β and

1.5.3 Safety and Efficacy of AAT in Patients with Steroid -Refractory  Acute GVHD  
An investigator -initiated phase 2 open- label study with Zemaira® was conducted in 
40 steroid -refractory acute GVHD  patients (median age 50 years, range 18- 70) at a dose of 
60 mg/kg twice weekly for [ADDRESS_767440] of the patients had lower GI GVHD; all stage 
3 or 4, while a quarter had live r-involvement (all stage 3/4). The overall response rate and 
complete response rate by [CONTACT_2006] 28 was 65% and 35%, respectively, and included responses in all GVHD target organs. At Day 60, responses were sustained in 73% of patients without intervening immunosuppression. Organ -specific responses w ere seen in skin, GI and liver. Importantly, 50% 
of patients with steroid -resistant lowe r GI GVHD achieved a D ay 28 CR. The treatment was well 
tolerated, with no infusion reactions or drug -related Grade 3/[ADDRESS_767441] infusion of AAT with 5/7 of these patients having progressive acute GVHD , 1 patient dying from gram negative sepsis and 1 patient from interstitial pneumonia 
syndrome. 6-month overall survival was 45% [95% confidence interval (CI), 32 -63%]. 
In a second study, an open- label phase 1/2 clinical trial of Glassia® (Baxalta/Kamada) for 
steroid -refractory acute GVHD  was undertaken in [ADDRESS_767442]

Day 28. Responding patients (CR/PR) will continue to receive a once weekly dose of 120 mg/kg 
through D ay 56.  As is detailed below, there is a strong rationale for studying this dose in adults 
and adolescents for this disease population. 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August [ADDRESS_767444] abundant, endogenous serine protease inhibitor in the circulation 30, 68, 69. 
Serum  AAT concentrations in healthy individuals range from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/mL and levels have 
been shown to further increase in inflammatory states 30, 70. Similar to C -react ive protein (CRP), 
AAT is a known acute -phase reactant whose serum levels rise in response to injury, inflammation, 
or infection71. High levels of AAT are commonly seen in various physiologic or disease states 
including: patients with colorectal cancer (mean 206 mg/dL, range 459 mg/dL), pregnancy (mean 
427 mg/dL; range 316–582 mg/dL), and pregnancy in diabetic women (mean, 786 mg/dL; range 523-1255 mg/dL) 
72-74. 
1.6.[ADDRESS_767445] shown that administration of AAT both 
reduces the development of, as well, as provides effective  therapy for established GVHD. 
These models implicate a reduction of inflammatory cytokines and an induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines as being integral to AAT’s efficacy
42, 63, 64. Addit ional models 
suggest that AAT’s effect on cytokines may occur in a dose -response fashion. For example, in a 
human pulmonary cell culture model simulating ischemia - reperfusion processes in lung 
transplantation, AAT significantly inhibited cell death and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose- dependent fashion in vitro , with maximal cell viability observed at concentration of 
5mg/ml
75. In addition, ex vivo assays performed on fresh whole blood from adult subjects with 
new-onset type 1 diabetes, AAT suppressed expression of IL -6 and IL -1β dose -dependently, with 
> 50% inhibition achieved in the range of 2.5 -5 mg/mL AAT76. Based on the totality of the 
evidence available, it is hypothesized that targeting AAT peak levels above the normal range or ≥ 2.5 mg/mL should down- regulate inflammatory cytokines and therefore provide pr otection 
against cytokine- mediated damage.  
1.6.[ADDRESS_767446] Setting  
Clearance of AAT as a result of stool losses has been used as a diagnostic tool in patients with protein- losing enteropathies including inflammatory bowel disease and GI  malignancies
77. 
Not surprisingly, patients with lower GI GVHD (also a protein- losing enteropathy) have been 
found to have increased clearance (via stool losses) of AAT. The first report detailing the measurement of levels of AAT in stool in allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_583703] 1983 where it was demonstrated that patients receiving conditioning chemotherapy for transplant experience increased clearance of AAT as a result of higher (than normal) stool concentrations of AAT
78. Serial measurements of stool AAT showed that patients who did not go 
on to develop GI GVHD had a return to baseline levels whereas those who developed lower GI GVHD had a marked and persistent increased clearance of AAT. These finds were subsequently reproduced in two additional reports with one demonstrating that stool AAT levels at the time of GI GVHD onset could serve as an independent - predictor of GVHD response to therapy
79, 80. 
Based on these reports, accounting for increased stool losses of AAT in patients with lower GI GVHD requires consideration when dosing this agent for this study population. 
In additional support for a higher dosing regimen of AAT, a  prospective analysis by [CONTACT_583743][INVESTIGATOR_840], with average donor endogenous AAT levels of approximately 4 mg/mL reported to result in no incidence of GVHD
64. Further, in an 
open- label, single -center, phase 1/2 study of AAT in 12 heavily- treated patients with 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August [ADDRESS_767447], an overall response rate of 66%, and complete 
response rate of 33% w as seen67. In this study, a cumulative weekly dose of 270 mg /kg/week was 
shown to be safe. Based on PK measurements, t he authors concluded that higher plasma levels 
for AAT via more extended/repeated courses of AAT and a longer maintenance regimen (beyond 
15 days as was used in this study) may be necessary to allow for  complete suppression of GVHD. 
In contrast, a second study of AAT for patients with newly diagnosed, steroid- refractory acute 
GVHD, AAT dosed at 60  mg/kg twice weekly resulted in a 65% overall response  rate at Day  2866. 
In this study, although AAT trough levels increased relative to study entry AAT levels, these trough levels were still with in the normal range at 4 weeks (2.15 mg/mL) suggesting that 
60 mg/kg twice weekly (120 mg total weekly dose) did not reach the optimal levels reflected in 
the above cited pre- clinical models.  
1.6.[ADDRESS_767448] been explored in several published 
studies of its use in type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ), where doses of either 180 mg/kg/week  or up to 
90 mg/kg/week were administered with no concerning adverse events (AEs) reported (Gottlieb et al
81 (AAT  product not specified), 2014; Rachmiel et al82 (Glassia®), 2016; Brener et al83 
(Glassia®), 2018; Weir et al84 (Aralast NP®), 2018). In these studies, AAT  therapy was report ed 
to be safe and well tolerated in children (Rachmiel et al82, 2016), including out to 5 years of 
surveillance (Brener et al83, 2018), and no safety differences were reported between adult and 
pediatric patients (Gottlieb et al81, 2014; Weir et al84, 2018).  Presently , there is no data on the use 
of AAT  treatment in acute GVH D or emphysema conditions in pediatri c populations. A s an 
endogenous protein with proposed weight- based  dosing and without evidence of differential 
pharmacokinetics between adults and children where studied, no differential safety profile is anticipated with its use in treatment of aGVHD.  Due to these co nsiderations, a stepwise plan was 
developed by [CONTACT_583744] (approved by [CONTACT_8415])  whereby  [CONTACT_583745] 
[ADDRESS_767449] that targeting a level above the upper limit of normal values  may provide the 
optimal regulation of T cells and cytokines to ameliorate GVHD symptoms. This target level of AAT is likely to provide sustain ed AAT levels, thereby [CONTACT_583746]-inflammatory cytokines.  
A PK model of 1000 subjects has been used to simulate a variety of AAT doses and dose regimens, with the intent to identify those which result in mean AAT peak level estimates around or above the upper limit of normal, i .e., ≥ 2.5 mg/mL . The simulated concentration –time profiles 
generated using AATD PK estimates was validated with data in GVHD patients from the literature an d multiple doses were modeled. 
Based on this simulation, the dose of 120 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks achieved median trough levels above the upper limit of normal ( ULN) and provided sufficient separation in median AAT 
levels when compared with a dose 60 mg/kg twice weekly. In addition, this dosing regimen shows 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-14 that >  50% of the simulated GVHD subjects at this dose regimen achieve serum AAT levels above 
normal physiologic levels  almost immediately after initiation of treatment, and levels are 
maintained  throughout the 28-day treatment  period. The cumulative weekly dose 
(240 mg/kg/week) is similar to the dose regimen of 270 mg/kg/week shown to be safe in 
Marcondes et al trial67.  
1.6.6 Ruxolitinib for the T reatment of S teroid -Refractory Acute GVHD  
The Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways play an important role in immune -cell activation and tissue inflammation during acute 
GVHD.  Ruxolitinib is an oral selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that reduces the incidence 
and severity of GVHD in vivo while preserving graft -versus -leukemia effects in preclinical 
models.  Recently, ruxolitinib was granted FDA approval in the [LOCATION_002] for patients 12 years and older who develop steroid- refracto ry or  dependent acute GVHD grade II -IV based on the 
results of a prospective phase 2 trial (REACH1).  At a protocol -specified dose of 10mg twice 
daily, 54.9% of the 36 enrolled patients achieved a response on Day 28 without additional therapy. 
Simultaneous ly, an open- label, phase 3 trial (based on the same study criteria) was performed 
outside of the [LOCATION_002] with patients randomized to ruxolit inib 10mg twice daily versus best 
available therapy (BAT).  The results on this study were recently published and showed a higher Day 28 and D ay 56 response rate in the ruxolitinib arm when compared to BAT (62% vs. 39%; 
odds ratio, 2.64; 95% C.I. 1.43 to 3.94; P< 0.001) and (40% vs. 22%; odds ratio 2.38; 95% C.I. 1.43 to 3.94; P< 0.001) , respectively .  Adverse events were not significantly different between 
the study arms with thrombocytopenia, anemia and  CMV infection being most common.   
The availability of an  FDA -approved agent for patients enrolled onto this trial may affect  the 
frequency and timing of use of next -line therapy.  Importantly, while the results of the RE ACH [ADDRESS_767450] the option to stay on AAT/PTM when next- line therapy with ruxolitinib is 
initiated. These patients will be followed for secondary endpoints (while being considered a failure for the primary endpoint).  Importantly, the wealth of experience with AAT outside of the study indication would suggest that AAT is unlikely to have drug interaction with ruxolitinib nor contribute additional safety concerns.

be used to determine the dose for all infusions  (i.e., dose adjustments for changes in weight 
during the treatment period will not be made). 
Patients that are non -responders or progress will be considered to be steroid- refractory (SR) and 
may start next -line therapy as described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. Ruxolitinib  is recommended for next-
line therapy as it is an FDA -approved treatment for SR -GVHD.   
Responding patients (CR/PR) at Day 28, compared to maximum GVHD organ staging within 
72 hours prior to enrollment, that are receiving study drug alone , or study drug plus ruxolitinib, 
should continue to receive treatment at a dose of 120 mg/kg (actual weight) on Days 35, 42, 49, and 56 ( Table 2 -1). Patients who are not  in CR/PR at Day 28 will not continue to receive study 
drug. Responding patients  at Day 28  who progress after Day 28 may continue to receive weekly 
doses through Day 56. 
Patients that receive next -line therapy other than ruxolitinib may not continue receiving study 
drug unless approval is granted by [CONTACT_16520] 1705 Protocol Chairs.

2.5.2 Corticosteroids (CS)  
[IP_ADDRESS] CS Dosing and Taper  
All patients enrolled on this trial must  receive CS at a minimum dose of prednisone 
2 mg/kg/day PO (or methylprednisolone 1.6 mg/kg/day IV) divided into [ADDRESS_767467] enrollment . For patients that weigh over 
100 kg, maximal starting dose of prednisone will be 200 mg (or methylprednisolone -equivalent ). 
For calculation of subsequent CS  doses/kg on subsequent measures, the modified starting weight 
of 100 kg will be used. For patients less than 100 kg, dosing of steroids may follow institutional 
practices (with respect to actual versus adjusted weight). Daily dose per kg is based on the weight of the patient at time of enrollment. 
For responding patients with evidence of improvement  in signs and symptoms of acute GVHD  
after treatment initiation, a suggested CS  taper is provided below or may follow institutional 
practice. However, taper must not start sooner than [ADDRESS_767468] not be tapered to less than 0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone- equivalent  (or 0.2 mg/kg/day

2.5.3 Supportive Care  
[IP_ADDRESS] GVHD Prophylaxis Medications 
Non-investigational medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, m ycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF ), sirolimu s (if used as GVHD prophylaxis prior to the development of acute GVHD ) may 
be continued, resumed , or increased to  therapeutic doses per provider discretion, and 
adjusted /discontinued as necessary for renal, central nervous system (CNS) or other toxicity using 
institutional management guidelines . Resumption of a GVHD prophylaxis agent is not considered 
the addition of a next- line agent. Changing prophylactic agents within a drug class or to similar 
agents due to toxicity would not represent new therapy or treatment failure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_583707]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_583708], topi[INVESTIGATOR_22777], oral 
beclomethasone or budesonide, topi[INVESTIGATOR_583709] , and ophthalmic glucocorticoids, is not 
considered as secondary systemic therapy.  
Ancillary/supportive care measures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti -motility agents for 
diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging or prevent hepatic transplant complications is 
also allowed according to institutional guideline s. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Acute GVHD Progression or Non -response 
Acute GVHD Progression  (see Section 3.1.1 Response Definition for Progression ): 
A patient can not be declared as having progression  in acute GVHD  before [ADDRESS_767469] 2 doses of AAT/PTM before  being 
declared as having acute GVHD progression (and starting next- line therapy).  Patients  receiving 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2 -10 ruxolitinib are encouraged to continue study drug (AAT/PTM), however, study treatment may be 
discontinued at the discretion of the treat ing physician.  
Acute GVHD No Response  (see Sect ion 3.1.1 Response Definitions for No Response ): 
An additional line of therapy (for non-response) must not be started before Day 7. A patient should 
receive at least 3 doses of study drug ( AAT/PTM ) before starting next line therapy for 
non- response.  
Ruxolitinib is recommended for next -line therapy as it is an FDA -approved treatment for 
SR-GVHD. Patients receiving ruxolitinib  are encouraged to continue study drug (AAT/PTM) to 
determine if the continuation of AAT can improve outcomes. Patients that are non -responders 
and receive next -line therapy other than ruxolitinib may not continue study drug (AAT or PTM) 
unless approval is granted by [CONTACT_16520] [ADDRESS_767470] be discontinued. Table 2-3 Timeline for Declaring Patient as having Acute GVHD  Progression or No

[IP_ADDRESS] Acute GVHD Flare  
A flare is defined as any progression of acute GVHD after an initial r esponse ( i.e., earlier CR or 
PR) that requires re -escalation of steroid dosing, or initiation of additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_110845]. 
If acute GVHD flares  during taper of CS , the dose of steroids may be increased at the discretion 
of the treating physician as long as this increase is to less than 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
(or methylprednis olone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day). Doses  otherwise above these parameters  will 
be considered as  a “new agent” and the patient will be scored as a failure. Other Supportive Care 
Guidelines 
In addition to prescribed study drug plus CS, all patients should receive the following per 
institutional practice : 
• Transfusion support  
• Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes viruses, Pneumocystis jiroveci, ba cterial and 
fungal infections. 
• Routine CMV antigenemia /viral load testing by [CONTACT_583754] -based  methods 
(with preemptive therapy in patien ts who develop a positive assay). CMV testing is 
recommended weekly through at least Day [ADDRESS_767471] CMV 
is allowed.

blinded to the study treatment  except for  the investigational pharmacy staff involved in study drug 
preparation . In addition, CSL’s Clinical Trial Supply team, CSL’s IRT team, and the Suvoda IRT 
team and system  are unblinded. Unblinding of the study drug should only be considered for 
participant safety contingent upon knowing the blinded study drug assignment. In situations that satisfy these criteria, the Investigator may break the blind per the processes laid out in the BMT CTN [ADDRESS_767473] include an explanation of why the study medication was unblinded. If possible, CSL Behring should be consulted prior to unblinding of the study 
drug. The Sponsor may break the treatment code for participants who experience a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), to  determine if the individual case or a group of 
cases requires expedited regulatory reporting.

3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an overall (complete or partial) 
response to acute GVHD treatment at D ay [ADDRESS_767477] -randomization, compared to maximum GVHD 
organ staging within 72 hours prior to enrollment. Patients without a Day 28 response assessment will be considered failures. Acute GVHD will be graded and assessed for response based on Harris 
(Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium [ MAGIC ]) Criteria  (refer to  APPENDIX C ). 
3.1.1 Response D efinitions  
Response definitions are listed below:  
1. Complete Response (CR) is defined as a score of 0 for the GVHD staging in all evaluable 
organs.  
2. Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with GVHD symptoms without progression in others. 
a. Very good partial response (VGPR) is defined as a quantitative and functional response that closely approximates CR. Patients must have all of the  following 
clinical features. i.e. , (1) no rash or rash involving <  25% of body surface area 
(BSA ) without bullae (residual faint erythema and hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_583710]), (2) serum bilirubin <  2mg/dl or <  25% of baseline at enrollment and 
(3) ability to tolerate food or enteral feedings with predominantly formed stool 
(no overt GI bleeding or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_583711]). 
3. Mixed response (MR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs with deterioration 
in another organ manifesting symptoms of GVHD or development of symptoms of GVHD 
in a new organ. 
4. No Response (NR) is defined as absence of any improvement or progression as defined.  
5. Progression is defined as deterioration in at least one organ without any improvement in others.  
Patients who receive next- line systemic GVHD therapy  (or escalation of steroids to 
≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) before Day 28 
will be classified as NR. Responses categorized as  NR, MR and progression will be treated as  
a failure for the primary endpoint.  
3.2 Secondary Endpoints   
3.2.1 Duration of Response (DOR)  
The duration of response (DOR) is defined as time from the Day 28 response (CR or PR) to any of the following events: re currence/progression of acute GVHD, new systemic salvage therapy for 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3-2 acute GVHD, re- escalation of steroids to greater or equal to 2.5 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent, 
or death from any cause. Patient s without any of these events will censored at last follow up. DOR 
will be evaluated at 6- and 12-months post-randomization. 
3.2.2 Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)  
An event for non- relapse mortality (NRM) is death without prior evidence of relapse/progression 
of the primary disease, where relapse/progression is treated as a competing risk. The  cumulative 
incidence of NRM at [ADDRESS_767478]-randomization w ill be evaluated .  
3.2.3 Overall Survival (OS) and Progression -Free S urvival (P FS)  
Overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival ( PFS) will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_767479] -randomization. An e vent for OS is death from any cause , while an event for PFS 
is death from any cause or relapse/progression of the primary disease. 3.2.4 GVHD -Free S urvival 
Patients alive, free of active acute or chronic GVHD , and without other systemic agents 
(or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or met hylprednisolone equivalent of 
2 mg/kg/day]) added for treatment of GVHD  will be considered successes for this endpoint. 
The proportion of participants with GVHD -free survival at Day [ADDRESS_767480]- randomization will be 
evaluated .  
3.2.5 Proportion of R esponse  
The proportion of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF)  
will be described at D ays 7, 14, 21, 28, [ADDRESS_767481] of patients with NR, MR, progression or initiation of additional systemic ( next- line) 
GVHD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
[or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) . Death from any cause will also be considered 
a TF.  
3.2.6 Proportion of Response ( Next -Line Therapy)  
The proportions of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF) 
at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and [ADDRESS_767482] -randomization for patients  who receive ruxolitinib or other 
next- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583704] -line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_767483] dose of study drug (AAT or PTM ) will be described . 
Infections developi[INVESTIGATOR_583712], date of onset, and 
severity.

 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3-3 3.2.8 Adverse Events  
The incidence of  Grade 3 -5 treatment- emergent adverse events  (per Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE ] Version 5.0)  that occur from randomization until [ADDRESS_767484] dose of study drug (AAT or PTM ) will be described .  
3.2.[ADDRESS_767485]-randomization, where death is treated as a competing risk. Chronic GVHD is defined per 
National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Consensus Criteria (see APPENDIX C ). Diagnosis of chronic 
GVHD of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe) is considered an event for this endpoint.  
Organ  involvement and maximum severity  will also be described at 6 and 12 months. 
3.2.10 Disease Relapse  
The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression of the primary disease will be evaluated at 6- and 
12-months post-randomization, with death prior to relapse/progression treated as a competing risk.  
Malignancy relapse is defined as follows :  
Relapse is defined by [CONTACT_583757] ( MDS ) consistent with pre -transplant features, or radiologic evidence 
of lymphoma, documented or not by [CONTACT_9256].  Progression of disease applies to patients with 
lymphoproliferative diseases (lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) not in remission prior 
to transplantation. The event is defined as increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of 
new sites of disease, documented or not by [CONTACT_9256].  
Acute leukemia – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is:  
- Reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the peripheral blood; or,  
- > 5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to another cause ( e.g., bone marrow 
regeneration) 
- The development of extra medullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_583713] (MDS)  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Satisfying criteria for evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (blasts greater than 20%), OR  
- Reappearance of pre -transplant morphological abnormalities detected in bone marrow 
specimens combined with a decrease in PB chimerism; OR  
- Reappearance of pre -transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase by 
[CONTACT_583758] a positive test by [CONTACT_583759], regardless of the number of metaphases 
analyzed  
- For patients with:  
o Less than 5% blasts: greater or equal to 50% increase in blasts to greater or equal to 5% blasts confirmed by [CONTACT_4133]  
o 5%-10% blasts:   greater or equal to 50% increase to greater or equal to 10% blasts 
confirmed by [CONTACT_583760] 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3 -4 Lymphoproliferativ e Diseases  – Relapse or progression will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, 
even if other l esions are decreasing in size.  Increased fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG) uptake in 
a previously unaffected site will only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by [CONTACT_583761]. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic confirmation.  
- A
t least a 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the product diameters of any previously 
involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions ( e.g., splenic or 
hepatic nodules). To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.[ADDRESS_767486] increase by > 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or 
more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
- L esions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359] -avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (<  1.[ADDRESS_767487]). 
- In addition to the criteria above, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) who 
present in complete remission prior to transplantation may fulfill the relapse definition if 
there is reappearance of circulating malignant cells that are phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_180840].  
For other diseases not listed probable or definitive evidence of progression must be documented by [CONTACT_9256], imaging, or peripheral blood findings that are diagnostic or otherwise consistent with that disease state.  
*Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapsed malignancy, including the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy , or donor lymphocyte infusion, will be 
considered evidence of relapse/progression regardless of whether the criteria described above were met.  
Non-malignant Diseases:   
Non-malignant diseases will be considered to have a transplant status of persistent/active disease. 
Graft failures will be considered recurrence.  
3.[ADDRESS_767488] prior to infusion and 30 min (+ /- 15 min) post -end of  infusion on Day 0, and on 
Days  16, 28, and [ADDRESS_767489]- infusion measurements are limited to 
subjects receiving a dose of AAT/PTM . AAT  levels  will be measured only prior to infusion on 
Days [ADDRESS_767490]- initiation of treatment (or at 
treatment discontinuation  (TD) if prior to Day 28)  at a subset of centers for a  limited cohort of

3.3.4 Inflammatory Cytokines and GVHD Biomarkers  
Serum  levels of IL -1β, IL -6, IL -10, TNFα, amphiregulin ( AREG) , HS, ST2 , and REG3α will be 
evaluated at baseline and at Day s 8, 28, and [ADDRESS_767492] -initiation  of treatment  (or at treatment 
discontinuation (TD)  if prior to Day 56) . Remaining samples will be retained for analysis of 
additional relevant cytokines, DAMPs and GVHD biomarkers. 3.3.5 Overall and Organ -Specific Response Rates by [CONTACT_583735]-B ased Risk Classifications  
The proportions of patients with an overall response (complete or partial) at Day [ADDRESS_767493]- randomization will be described by [CONTACT_583762] (high or standard risk) 
and by [CONTACT_583763] (1, 2, or 3). Additionally, the response rate of each GVHD target organ will be described at Day [ADDRESS_767494]-randomization by [CONTACT_326367]

4 PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION 
4.1 Approaching Patients, Eligibility Screening and Obtaining Consent  
Patients with previously untreated, acute GVHD meeting eligibility criteria will be approached as 
soon as possible after diagnosis. Patients willing to participate in the trial will sign a NMDP 
IRB-approved consent or assent form , and eligibility for enrol lment will be further evaluated.  
4.2 Enrollment  and Randomization 
Patients will be  (1) enrolled  using the BMT CTN Advantage eClinical system and then 
(2) randomized in the Suvoda Inte ractive  Response Technology ( IRT) system . The IRT system 
will also provide the study drug supply management. Patients will be randomized to AAT  versus 
PTM  in a 1:1 ratio. The following procedures shall be followed: 
Patients must be enrolled in Advantage eClinical prior to randomization in the Suv oda IRT 
System.  
1. An authorized user at the clinical center completes the initial screening by [CONTACT_334234], eligibility  information (consent date, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and 
patient’s weight on the Enrollment Form  in Advantage eClini cal. 
2. If the patient is eligible, “successful enrollment’ is displayed along with a patient study 
ID# number and patient’s weight.  Information regarding participant’s log- in information 
for the ePRO system is  also included. The coordinator should print two copi[INVESTIGATOR_583714]:  one for the patient’s chart and one for the study participant. 
3. Immediately after  the patient is succes sfully enrolled / deemed  eligible in Advantage 
eClinical, the authorized user must  register the pat ient in the Suvoda  IRT system  for 
randomization to occur . The user enters the Patient ID# assigned in eClinical, 
demographics (year of birth, age, and sex) and  weight at time of enrollment.  
4. The Suvoda  IRT system will determine the patient’s randomization assignment and 
automatically email the site’s investigational pharmacist on record with the following information: Patient ID #, Visit # and the specific kits to be used to prepare the patient’s assign ed treatment.  
5. A visit schedule based on enrollment date is displayed in Advantage eClinical for printing. 
If a connection is interrupted during an enrollment session  in Advantage eClinical , the process is 
completely canceled and logged. A backup manual enr ollment system will also be available to 
provide for short -term system failure or unavailability.  If the  Suvoda IRT system is interrupted or 
down, the Suvoda Help Desk must be notified.  
A patient is considered on the study once randomization in the IRT system is complete .  
Patient must begin study drug (AAT or PTM) within 12 hours of enrollment  in Advantage 
eClinical.

  4-7 4.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse event (AE) reporting is  summarized below  with the specific requirements described 
under Section 4.4.4.  
4.4.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical in vestigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An adverse event ( AE) therefore is  any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether related or not related to the IMP/PTM 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
An adverse event can be Anticipated or Unanticipated 
• Anticipated adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting 
from the underlying disease, the HCT, or acute GVHD and not related to study drug. 
Investigator should refer to the anticipated event list (see Appendix E) to assess whether or not an event  is anticipated. Anticipated events will be collected in the data capture 
system through calendar -driven forms (Toxicity, GVHD, etc.) and event -driven forms 
(Death, Infection, etc.).  Events that meet serious criteria should be reported as detailed in 
Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Unanticipated adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity, or frequency from 
information in the current anticipated event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unanticipated events would also include those that have not been previously described as a result of the underlying disease requiring HCT, the HCT or acute GVHD. 
The following are anticipated adverse events  and do NOT require reporting as an AE/SAE : 
• Disease progression of primary malignancy 
• GVHD and symptoms of  GVHD (these are recorded in acute and chronic GVHD eCRFs)  
• Infections 
• Graft failure  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example: 
o Plann ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583715] e-existing conditions, which have not  worsene d 
(e.g., HCT)  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786] (e.g., cosmetic surger y) 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a diagnostic procedure where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254787] 
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (e.g., chemotherapy) 
o Overdose of  AAT or any concomitant thera py that does not result in any adverse signs 
or symptoms.  (An overdose is a dose higher than the dose established in the 
protocol.  For this study, the protocol dose is 120 mg/kg.  There is a 5% variance that 
is allowed due to the rounding permitted in the preparation of the IMP. Therefore, an 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-8 AAT dose ≥1.06% of 120 mg/kg (i.e., 126 mg/kg) that does not result in any adverse 
signs or symptoms would not require reporting as an AE/SAE.) 
 
Laboratory findings do NOT need to be reported as  AEs in the following case s: 
• Laboratory parameters already  beyond the reference range at  screenin g, unless a further 
increase / decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pr e-existing conditio n. 
• Abnormal hematological laboratory parameters considered anticipated due to 
myelo ablative conditioning regimen or other permitted chemotherapy trea tments are not 
considered AEs.  
• An abnormal laboratory  value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analys is, preferab ly 
in the same laboratory  (i.e., the previous result could be marked as not valid and should 
not necessarily  be reported as an AE).  
Serious Adverse Event:  A serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by [INVESTIGATOR_11826] 21 CFR 312.32, is any 
adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes, regardless of causality, anticipation,  
and/or expectedness:  
• Results in death 
• Is life -threatening.  Life-threatening means t hat the person was at immediate risk of death 
from t he reaction as it occurred, i.e. , it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  or 
• Is an important medical event  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is also 
appropriate in situations other than those listed above. For example, important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583716] (e.g., suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product is considered a 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-9 Serious Adverse Event). Any event is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it is associated with 
clinical signs or sy mptoms judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to have a significant clinical impact.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_767511] categorize the severity of each SAE according to the Na tional Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE Version 5.0. 
CTCAE guidelines can be referenced at the following website: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.pdf. For any term that is not specifically listed in the CTCAE scale, intensity will 
be assigned a grade of one through five using the following CTCAE guidelines: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; min imal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111];  disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
4.4.[ADDRESS_767512] 
The relationship of each reported event to the study therapy will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]; after careful consideration of all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the SAE, temporal relationship to any study therapy interventions and dechallenge or rechallenge according to the following guidelines: 
• P
ossibly, Probably, or Definitely Related:  there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
therapy caused the event. A relationship of possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational product is considered related  for the purposes of regulatory authority 
reporting. 
• Unlikely, or Not Related:  T here is no reasonable possibility that the investigational 
product caused the event. An unlikely or not related relationship to the investigational product is considered not related  for the purposes of regulatory authority reporting.  
4.4.4 Required Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All non- serious adverse events will be reported from randomization until [ADDRESS_767513] 
dose of study drug (AAT/PTM). Some anticipated non -serious events will be collected on 
calendar -driven forms or event -driven forms (Infection, GVHD, Graft Failure, Readmission/ 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and Progression/Relapse).

  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-10 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
All SAEs will be reported from randomization until [ADDRESS_767514] dose of study drug 
(AAT/PTM). In  addition, any SAE assessed as related to the investigational product that occurs 
after the [ADDRESS_767515] dose of study drug through the study defined follow up ([ADDRESS_767516] enrollment) are 
required to be reported  through the expedited AE reporting system in Advantage 
eClinical . Additionally, any grade [ADDRESS_767517] of the MOP definition of unexpected.  
All reported SAEs are to be f ollowed up until resolved, the Investigator judges an event as no 
longer clinically significant, or until the event stabilize s/becomes chronic to the extent that the 
event can be fully characterized.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting syste m via 
electronic data c apture. L ife-threatening and fatal SAEs must be reported within [ADDRESS_767518] be reported within 1 business day of knowledge of the event. Events entered in the EDC will be reported using NCI’s CTCAE Version 5.0. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive reports of all unanticipated/ unexpected SAEs 
upon review by [CONTACT_583768]. Summary reports for all reported 
SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_583769]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
The Sponsor has a list of events classified as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). 
These include ‘anaphylactic infusional  reaction ’ and ‘ suspected transmission of a viral agent via 
a medicinal product. ’ Both events must be reported through the expedited AE reporting system 
via Advantage eClinical and must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event even if it does not meet serious criter ia. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicity Reporting 
Toxicities are a subset of anticipated adverse events determined to be from the underlying disease pr
ocess, HCT, GVHD prophylaxis, or corticosteroid use, and generally are not considered to be 
related to the study product. The  toxicities listed in  APPENDIX E  w ere pre-determined by [CONTACT_50781].  
Once the participant has reached [ADDRESS_767519] dose of study drug, toxicities listed in APPENDIX E  should be reported at the specified time points on the Toxicity CRF. If an event 
listed is determined to be serious and related to AAT, it  should be reported via the expedited 
reporting process on the AE/SAE case report form (CRF).

   5-1 CHAPTER 5  
5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1 Study Design  
This study is a phase III, multicenter, double -blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled trial 
designed to compare AAT and corticosteroids ( CS) to placebo -to-match ( PTM ) and CS as 
first-line therapy for patients with high- risk acute GVHD.  
The study consists of an interim analysis for futility and a 12-month analysis at the end of the 
study. An additional analysis  will be conduc ted after  all randomized patients  in the study complete 
[ADDRESS_767522] completed the Day  28 primary endpoint visit by [CONTACT_583734] .   
The target enrollment is 136 patients from approximately 25 centers with 68  patients assigned to 
each arm.  
5.1.1 Accrual  
It is estimated that an accrual period of 36 months ( assuming a steady state of 4 patients per month  
after ramp up) will be necessary to enroll the target sample size. Accrual wi ll be reported by [CONTACT_545], 
ethnicity, gender, and age.  
5.1.2 Randomization 
Following enrollment, patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_583771] 
a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of random sizes for the two treatment arms.  
Treatment practices differ considerably by [CONTACT_272624]. This includes the time to declare a patient refractory to steroids and potentially initiate next- line therapy. The variability by [CONTACT_583772] (adolescent  vs adult), GHVD 
risk or disease. Additionally, the pathobiology of GVHD in both adolescent and adult and in malignant and non- malignant disease patient populations are similar. Therefore, since the 
presentation of GVHD and the anticipated response to trea tment are expected to be similar, center 
was prioritized as the primary stratification variable.  
5.1.3 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an overall (complete or partial) 
response to acute GVHD treatment at Day [ADDRESS_767523] -randomization. Patients without a Day 28 
response assessment will be considered failures. Acute GVHD will be graded and assessed for response based on Harris  Criteria (refer to  APPENDIX C ). Patients who receive  next-line 
systemic GVHD therapy (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) before Day 28 will be classified as NR. Responses categorized as NR, MR and progression will be treated as a failure for the primary endpoint. The primary analysis will be performed using the intent -to-treat principle. Therefore, 
all randomized patients will be in cluded in the primary analyses.

  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-2 5.1.4 Primary Hypothesis 
The primary null hypothesis is that the odds ratio for response (CR/PR) at Day 28 between the 
treatment groups, adjusted for center, is equal to 1 versus the alternative hypothesis that the odds 
ratio is greater than 1  (AAT+CS versus PTM +CS). Therefore, an odds ratio greater than one 
means the response rate is higher in the AAT+CS group compared with the PTM+CS group. This null hypothesis will be tested using a one-sided significance level of 2.5%.  
5.[ADDRESS_767524] 
the odds ratio for response between the groups, adjusted for center and GVHD risk (Group A vs Group B; see Section 2.4.1, #3) as describ ed in Section 5.6. We approximate the sample size and 
power requirem ents for this study based on a two -sample Z test of response rates. H istorical 
control data indicates  that the overall response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 for high risk acute GVHD 
is approximately 50%. We further anticipate that the treatment will increase res ponse rate to 75%. 
We planned a single boundary (nonbinding futility) design for testing a one -sided hypothesis with 
one interim analysis for futility, when 56% of the information is evaluable (76 patients or 38 per arm) , and a 12-month analysis using a design based on the Gamma  family spending function with 
parameter  γ = -8. Therefore, a sample size of 136 patients ( 68 per arm) is required to sufficiently 
maintain a one -sided type I error of 2.5% while providing 86% statistical power for a one -sided 
test to detect an effect size of 25%. All statistical a nalyses will be done using SAS Version 9.[ADDRESS_767525] of an interim analysis for futility after 56% of the patients  (n=76)  are 
evaluable, at a time coincident with a regularly scheduled meeting of the NHLBI -appointed 
DSMB , and a 12-month analysis after accrual and follow up for the primary endpoint is complete. 
An additional  analysis  will be conducted after all the randomized patien ts in the study complete 
[ADDRESS_767526] completed the Day  28 primary endpoint visit by [CONTACT_583773] . The details for this  6-month analys is, including the data to be included, will be 
specified in the statistical analysis plan .   
Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN’s Manual of Procedures. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment. Toxicity, adverse events, and other safety endpoints will be monitored regularly and reported to the DSMB at each meeting.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_767527] randomization prior to the time of the interim 
analyses will be u sed to compute this statistic. Therefore, if the response rate in the placebo group 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, [ADDRESS_767528] 0.034 or higher than the AAT group, the DSMB will make a recommendation regarding 
termination or  continuation of the trial. 
Non-binding futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] —maintaining type I error control even if not followed

8. This boundary corresponds to a conditional power of 8.9% under the alternative. This would 
also correspond approximately to an effect size (on a difference in response rates scale) less than 
-0.034 ( Figure 5-1) or a Z statistic less than -0.[ADDRESS_767529] 
statistic of -0.31 or smaller at the interim analysis, there is only an  8.9% chance that the study 
would be statistically significant at the 12-month analysis , under the alternative hypothesis.

[IP_ADDRESS] Stratified Mixed Effects Logistic Simulation  
We simulated a stratified randomized block design using blocks of size 6, based on the distribution of patients observed in each center of the BMT CTN [ADDRESS_767533] deviations 0.05, 0.6 and 1.0. Additionally, we estimated that 35% of the patients will be classified as “high risk”; a covariate that we adjust for in all the simulations done  
Simulation results indicate that in the absence of a  random effect (i .e., when the standard deviation 
of the random effect is close to zero) our statistical power is at least 94.2 % to detect an odds ratio 
of 3. Further, when the random effect is present (std. dev. of 0.6 and 1.0) statistical power is at least 92.9% and 90.1% to  detect an odds ratio of 3  as shown in Table 5 -3. We also obtain statistical 
power ranging from 20.8% to 25.5% when the odds ratio is 1.[ADDRESS_767534] Size Power (%)

The BMT CTN 1705 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will elaborate further on the contents of the 
6-month report. 5.3.4 Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed 
pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order  that the DSMB can be advised. 
Policies  and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_583719] a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review. 
Safety monitoring will be based on Day 56 NRM. The proportion of NRM based on historical 
controls is estimated to be 20% versus an alternative hypothesis of 40%. This outcome will be 
monitored up to [ADDRESS_767536] (SPRT) for binary data resulting in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.293 and an upper intercept of 2.679 with nominal type I and type II error  rates 
of, 0.065 and 0.10, respectively.  
This sequential testing procedure conserv es type I error at 5% across all the monthly 
examinations . The SPRT c an be represented graphically. At each monthly examination, the 
number of evaluable patients is plotted against the cumulative sum of the endpoint of interest . 
The continuation region of the SPRT is defined  by [CONTACT_110893]. Only the upper boundary 
will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive Day [ADDRESS_767537] be observed to trigger review.

5.3.5 Safety Analysis 
The reporting of serious adverse events  is described in detail in S ectio n [IP_ADDRESS]. All reported 
serious adverse events potentially associated with study drug will be carefully examined with 
respect to the severity and relationship to study drug. The type  and severity of adverse events will 
be described.  
5.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease, time from steroid initiation to randomization, acute GVHD grade at enrollment , MN classification, graft 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, [ADDRESS_767540] been randomized. Analyses for 
the primary and secondary endpoints will use the primary analysis population. 
5.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations 
The safety analysis population in this study will comprise of all patients “as treated” in the study. 
This population will be used for the analysis of safety data. The “as treated” population consists of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they received for the analysis of safety data using the “as treated” population. For most subjects this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Subjects who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment received. Any subject who receives the incorrect study medication for one cycle but receives the correct 
treatment for all other cycles will be analyzed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the subject is incorrectly dosed. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_767541] minimal missing data (<  5%) for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints based 
on the past experience with a large phase III aGVHD treatment trial (BMT CTN protocol #0802 . 
All secondary and exploratory analyses will use a two-sided significance level of 5%. 
5.6 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 , compared to maximum GVHD organ staging within 
72 hours prior to enrollment, is expected to be different by [CONTACT_583774] (Group A vs 
Group B ; see Section 2.4.1, #3) . Therefore, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with the 
response rate (CR/PR) at Day [ADDRESS_767542] and cente r-specific random effects. A one- sided significance level of 
2.5% will be used. T he response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 will be estimated using frequencies in 
each group along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
We plan on conducting two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. 
First,  using the above generalized linear mixed model we will adjust for GVHD risk, age 
(adolescent vs adults) and disease (malignant vs non- malignant)  all as main effects, in addition to 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, [ADDRESS_767543] 
analysis in addition to the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) 
biomarker score. These two models will be compared to the primary analysis model in order to assess the impact on the main effect estimate.  
5.[ADDRESS_767544]-randomization in the cohort of 
patients who achieve a Day  28 response. There will be a primary and secondary analyses of DOR. 
In the primary analysis, DOR is defined as the time from Day 28 response to progression, new salvage therapy for acute GVHD, death from any cause, or re -escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg 
prednisone or equivalent. Patients without any of these events will censored at last follow up. For the secondary analysis, DOR will be defined as time from Day [ADDRESS_767545]-randomization will be estimated using the 
cumulative incidence function, treating relapse as a competing risk. The cumulative incidence 
curves for non- relapse mortality will be compared between the treatment groups using Gray’s 
test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model with mixed effects will be used to compare the 
cause specific hazards of NRM between treatment groups adjusting for GVHD risk with 
center -specific log -normal frailties.  
5.7.3 Overall Survival and Progression -Free Survival 
Progression- free survival (P FS) at 6- and 12-months post-randomization will be estimated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method, treating death or relapse of malignancy as events in patients with 
malignancies. Overall Survival (OS) at [ADDRESS_767546].  A Cox proportional hazards regression model with mixed effects will be used to 
compare PFS and OS between treatment groups adjusting for GVHD risk with center -specific 
log-normal frailties.  
5.7.4 GVH D-Free Survival  
The proportion of patients surviving at Day 56 after randomization without acute or chronic GVHD and without other systemic agents (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day] ) added for treatment of GVHD  
will be evaluated . Provided there is no censoring prior to 56 days, this endpoint we will be 
computed as a binary outcome and summarized using frequencies/proportions. GVHD- Free 
survival will be compared by [CONTACT_583775] -specific random 
effects using a generalized linear mixed model. Additionally, treatment groups will be compared using difference in proportions, relative risk and an odds ratio estimate along with corresponding 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-9 confidence interval s. Censoring before 56 days is highly unlikely; and should this occur we 
anticipate this will be minimal.  
5.7.5 Proportion of Response  
The proportions of patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) (including 
subset with “Very Good Partial Response” [VGPR]), and Treatment Failure (TF)  at Days 7, 14, 
21, 28, [ADDRESS_767547] or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  
5.7.6 Proportion of Response ( Next -Line Therapy)  
The proportions of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure 
(TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and [ADDRESS_767548] -randomization who receive ruxolitinib or other 
next- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583704] -line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM 
will be described and compared between the treatment groups, to evaluate any differences in safety and efficacy, using the chi- square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The proportion 
of AE/SAE will be described in these patient populations. 
5.7.[ADDRESS_767549] serious (grade 2 or 3) infection will be described using the cumulative incidence function 
and compared between treatment groups using Gray’s test, with death treated as a competing risk. 
5.7.8 Adverse Events  
Frequencies of grade 3-5 adverse events (per CTCAE V ersion 5.0) that occur from randomization 
through [ADDRESS_767550]- randomization using 
the cumulative incidence m ethod, treating death prior to chronic GVHD as a competing risk. 
Diagnosis of chronic GVHD of any severity ( mild, moderate, or severe) per NIH Consensus 
Criteria (see APPENDIX C ) is considered an event for this endpoint. Cumulative incidence will 
be compared between treatment groups using Gray’s test. Cause specific hazard for chronic 
GVHD will be compared by [CONTACT_22058] t adjusting for GVHD risk and center -specific random 
effects using a generalized linear mixed model. 5.7.[ADDRESS_767551]- randomization using the cumulative 
incidence function with death as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence will be compared

Candidates for the study will be identified as described  in Chapter 4 of the protocol. The Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee at each transplant center will contact [CONTACT_180891], provide the patient with information about the purpose of the study, and obtain consent or assent . The BMT 
CTN DCC  will provide a template of the consent and assent form s to each center.  Each center 
will customize the templates according to their local requirements and submit for review by [CONTACT_583778] d. Each center must provide 
evidence of IRB approval to the DCC. 
2. Confidentiality  
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_583779] a patient 
identifier code.  The code relaying the patient’s identity with the ID code will b e kept separately 
at the center.  The ID code will be generated by [CONTACT_583780]. 3. Participation of Adolescents  
The protocol was  amended  (v4.0), after  DSMB review and approval, to include a dolescents ages 
12 - 17.99 after 40 adult patients were enrolled onto the trial and completed the D ay 56 follow -up 
assessment for safety . 
4. Participation of Women and Minorities Women, ethnic minorities, and other populations will be included in this study. Accrual of women 
and minorities at each center will be monitored to determine whether their rates of enrollment are reflective of the distribution of potentially eligible women  and minorities expected from data 
reported to the CIBMTR and from published data on incidence of high risk acute GVHD  in these 
groups. Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those expected and asked 
to develop appropriate recrui tment reports.

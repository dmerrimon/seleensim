Protocol Test Abstract: 
This study involves comparison of the performance of two SpHb s ensors in subjects that undergo a hemodilution 
procedure.  The sensors performance will be assessed by [CONTACT_914184] a laboratory hematology analyzer. Blood samples will be collected from healthy 
volunteers who undergo a hemodilution procedure wherein blood i s repeatedly sampled as the concentration of 
hemoglobin is reduced by [CONTACT_914185] e volunteer in a controlled manner.

 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
 This document is a protocol for a clinical research study spons ored by [CONTACT_138479]. The study will be 
conducted in compliance with all stipulations of this protocol,  the conditions of IRB approval, 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR 
Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part 812,  ISO-[ZIP_CODE], and Inter national Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH GCP). 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Appr oval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by 
[CONTACT_3484].  In ad dition, all changes to the consent form will be IRB-
approved; a determination will be made regarding whether a new consent needs to be obtained from participants 
who provided consent, using a previously approved consent form.  
1. PURPOSE 
The objective of this study is to compare the noninvasive hemog lobin (SpHb) performance of the Masimo Rainbow 
INVSENSOR00001 sensor against a control sensor.  Data using the  noninvasive devices will be collected from healthy 
volunteers undergoing a hemodilution procedure. 
This is a nonrandomized single arm study wherein all subjects a re enrolled into the experimental arm and receive 
both the INVSENSOR00001 sensor and the control sensor simultane ously on different fingers.  Hemodilution will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_914186] a controlled man ner to reduce the subject’s blood concentration of 
hemoglobin to obtain noninvasive hemoglobin readings SpHb at va rious levels.  Reference blood samples will be 
repeatedly collected from the subject and analyzed using a stan dard laboratory hematology analyzer.  The 
performance of the sensors will be calculated using arithmetic root mean square (ARMS) analysis of the SpHb values 
and the reference blood values.   
Outcome Measure: Comparison of INVSENSOR00001 and control SpHb sensor by [CONTACT_914187] (SpHb) of 
the pulse oximeter sensors to the hemoglobin value obtained fro m a reference blood sample and calculating the 
ARMS value. 
2. BACKGROUND 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies. These devices have applications in the operating 
room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency transport v ehicles, as well as physician’s offices. 
A blood sample gives the best measure of hemoglobin as well as other blood solutes but is difficult to measure 
continuously and without skin puncture and risk of infection.  Masimo SET and Masimo Rainbow technology allows 
real-time, non-invasive monitoring of hemoglobin (and other blo od solutes) in patients and has the potential to 
improve clinical outcomes while reducing the cost of care and r isks to both patients and clinicians associated with 
venipuncture. 
2.1. TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND 
Pulse oximetry is governed by [CONTACT_371330]: 
x Oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) and deoxyhemoglobin (non-oxyge nated blood) differ in their absorption 
of red and infrared light (spectrophotometry).  
x The amount of arterial blood in tissue changes with arterial pu lses (photoplethysmography). Therefore, the 
amount of light absorbed by [CONTACT_914188].

 x More generally, Masimo Pulse CO-Oximeters use a multi-wavelengt h sensor to distinguish between not only 
oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood, but also blood with ca rbon monoxide, oxidized blood and blood 
plasma. The CO-Oximeter utilizes a sensor with various light-emitting d iodes (LEDs) that pass light through 
the site to a photodiode (detector). See figure below.  
 
 
 
x Signal data is obtained by [CONTACT_531613] a capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996] (for example, a 
fingertip, a hand, a foot) and measuring changes in light absor ption during the blood pulsatile cycle. The 
detector receives the light, converts it into an electrical sig nal. Once the oximeter receives the signal from 
the sensor, it utilizes Masimo Rainbow signal extraction techno logy for calculation of the patient’s 
hemoglobin level. 
2.2. STUDY DEVICES 
Investigational sensor: INVSENSOR00001 
The noninvasive, investigational INVSENSOR00001 sensor is a mod ified version of the control SpHb 
disposable sensor.  It has been modified with minor hardware an d software adjustments that do not pose 
increased risk to study subjects.  The sensor has undergone ris k assessment prior to use in human subjects 
to safeguard subject safety and well-being. Refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure for more details on the 
investigational device.

7.3.11.  Subjects may be offered a snack (e.g., granola bar) and/or beve rage (e.g., water, juice) due 
to the amount of time their involvement in this study may take.   
7.4. PROCEDURES 
7.4.1.  Standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-type monitors will be placed on the subject, including ECG and blood 
pressure, for safety monitoring by [CONTACT_131459].  The procedur e will be stopped if there is 
any evidence of volunteer stress or distress.  These signs incl ude but are not limited to a rise 
or fall in mean arterial blood pressure of more than 30% from b aseline, a rise in heart rate 
to more than [ADDRESS_1284527] discom fort, GI distress, urinary 
discomfort or feelings of a bloated bladder, or alternation of mental status. Blood samples 
are also monitored for hemoglobin and/or blood oxygenation leve ls for subject safety.  
7.4.2.  A peripheral venous line will be placed in the volunteer’s hand  or arm. One or more venous 
sampling catheters will be used during the study for the remova l of blood and 
administration of fluids. 
7.4.3.  Local anesthetics such as lidocaine, ethyl chloride spray, or P ain Ease skin refrigerant spray 
may be used in the event that an IV is placed to numb the site.  Subjects will be given the 
option to have lidocaine or numbing spray be used during IV pla cement for the purpose of 
making catheter placement more comfortable for the subjects. 
7.4.4.  After intravenous access is established, one or more intra-arte rial catheter(s) (arterial line or 
A-line) will be placed in the radial artery of the volunteer’s wrist. The A-line is placed to 
facilitate continuous blood pressure measurement for subject sa fety monitoring, to enable 
repeated removal of blood aliquots for reference hemoglobin val ues, to allow for 
determination of arterial blood gases (ABG), Hgb, Hct, as well as other non-infectious blood 
solutes.

 7.4.5.  After arterial access is established, optical sensors for the n oninvasive measurement(s) will 
be placed on the subject’s fingers.  Up to three test and three  control sensors will be placed 
on the subject’s fingers and connected to the data collection s ystem.   
7.4.6.  Upon successful placement of the sensors and the volunteer’s in dication that they are 
comfortable, a baseline set of blood samples will be obtained. 
7.4.7.  One unit of blood, up to approximately 500cc (if required), wil l be drawn from the volunteer 
through the arterial line or through the venous site. This bloo d will not be re-infused and 
will be discarded. 
7.4.8.  Following removal of blood, the volunteer will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_914180] (such as 
Ringers Lactate or Isolyte), to compensate for the decrease in intravascular volume and 
further reduce the hemoglobin concentration.   
7.4.9.  Volunteers will receive a maximum of 40 mL/kg of intravenous fl uid with no more than a 
maximum volume of [ADDRESS_1284528] may be up to  approximately 620cc.  
This amount includes the unit of blood from section 7.4.7 (if r equired) and the blood 
samples from section 7.4.10.  
7.4.12.  Subjects will be given supplemental oxygen through a nasal cann ula, mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_914181]. This is to simulate the high oxygen environments during 
surgeries and test our sensors performance during oxygen admini stration.  
7.4.13.  Subjects may be warmed for their comfort with the use of a blan ket, heating pads, or hot 
water bottles. 
7.4.14.  The hemodilution procedure will continue until the subject’s fl uid limits have been reached 
based on their weight, or the target hemoglobin value has been reached. 
7.4.15.  The sensors/devices used in this study may be placed and remove d by [CONTACT_914190]. 
7.4.16.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sensors/devices, IV(s) and the arterial line(s) will be 
removed and the volunteer will be allowed to leave after medica l personnel determine it is 
safe to do so. 
7.4.17.  At the end of the hemodilution procedure, if the last arterial blood draw hemoglobin value 
is below 8.0 g/dL, then the subject’s hemoglobin level will be monitored using an FDA 
cleared pulse oximeter. Subjects who have a hemoglobin level be low 8.0 g/dL must remain 
in the study area for observation and meet a minimum rise in he moglobin of 0.5 g/dL prior 
to leaving the study area, or until medical staff determines it  is safe to do so. If medical staff 
finds it is not safe to do so, the subject will be referred to an urgent care facility.  
7.4.18.  All volunteers will be encouraged to remain in the study area u ntil they feel fit to leave. 
Subjects should feel safe and able before returning to work dir ectly after participation in the

 12.3. Return or Destruction of Study Device 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconcili ation of study devices and sensors shipped, 
devices/sensors used, and devices/sensors remaining.  This reco nciliation will be logged on the device accountability 
log.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, a nd documented prior to return or destruction of 
unused study devices.  Devices destroyed on site will only be u pon written instruction from the sponsor and will be 
documented in the study files. 
13. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
13.1. Benefits: There would be no other benefit to the subject.  Othe r possible benefits would be to 
society as a whole. Evaluation of the accuracy of this new devi ce could enable healthcare workers to 
more appropriately treat potentially life threatening condition s. 
13.2. Device Risks: The noninvasive devices used in this study are si milar in technology and design to 
some commercially available pulse oximeters and other non-invas ive devices and hence have the 
same risks.  Pulse oximeters and other non-invasive devices are  commonly used and are considered 
to be minimal risk.  There is an extremely small risk of damage  to the subject’s fingers, or other 
locations where sensors are placed, from the device including t emporary skin irritation or 
discomfort associated with exposure to the sensor as well as po tential temporary mechanical 
irritation or discomfort. There is a remote, yet possible, risk  of a burn from the sensor. In the case of 
a sensor burn there is the potential for permanent skin damage (scar/discoloration). 
13.3. Venous Cannulation Risks: bleeding, swelling, infection, infilt ration of fluids/ blood into area 
surrounding IV, bruising, hematoma, damage to the blood vessel and surrounding nerves or tissue. 
13.4. Arterial Cannulation risks: bleeding, infection, he matoma, dama ge to the blood vessel and 
surrounding nerves, tendons or tissue; loss of feeling in hand and/or arm and even the loss of hand 
due to rare complications of the study. 
13.5. Risks Associated with Removal of Blood: Removal of blood is gen erally considered to be safe in most 
patients and exceptionally safe in healthy volunteers (i.e. blo od donation).  The risk of removing 
blood includes the risks obtaining venous access.  Additionally , there is the risk of hypotension, 
tachycardia, anemia, dizziness and loss of consciousness.  All subjects will be maintained in a 
reclined position throughout the study and a physician will be available to continually monitor the 
vital signs.  
13.6. Blood Draw risks: discomfort is generally associated with needl e puncture. The most common 
complications associated with blood draws and capi[INVESTIGATOR_531608].  All blood 
draws will be performed by [CONTACT_5944]. An ACLS certifi ed physician will be in attendance 
throughout the entire procedure, and the study will be complete d under their general supervision.  
Other anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but ar e not limited to: Vaso vagal (passing 
out), infiltrated IV, lightheadedness, feeling flush/ warm, fee ling nauseated, throwing up, seizures, 
sudden drop in blood pressure/ sudden increase in blood pressur e, sudden drop in heart rate/ 
sudden increase in heart rate, tingling sensation of face/arms and/or sweating, and mouth dryness. 
These anticipated adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.7. Risk From Hemodilution: Hemodilution has been used successfully  as a technique to reduce 
perioperative blood loss during surgery.  Hemodilution is gener ally considered to be safe in most 
patients and exceptionally safe in healthy volunteers.  In surg ery, the chief benefit of hemodilution 
is the reduction of blood losses when whole blood is shed perio peratively at lower hematocrit levels 
after hemodilution is completed.  In our controlled clinical la b, withdrawal and blood loss will be 
limited to samples required for laboratory analysis; hemodiluti on will be used principally to lower

respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], hypertension, edema, infection and electro lyte abnormalities.  Isotonic fluids will 
be administered.  A physician will be immediately available tho rough out the procedure and vital 
signs will be continually monitored.   
13.8. Risk From Oxygen Administration:  There are no risks associated  with high oxygen/oxygen 
administration for less than [ADDRESS_1284534] any cardiac conditions, COPD 
or any other lung diseases.  Subjects’ answers on the health qu estionnaire will help the medical staff 
decide if they can safely participate in this study; subjects a re encouraged to let the study staff know 
if they have any concerns. 
13.9. Risk from Inflicted Knowledge: The risk of inflicted medical kn owledge to volunteers is negligible 
since we deidentify all associated sample information including  those relevant to our clinical and 
engineering parameter studies. The monitoring and test results are not examined for diagnostic 
purposes and do not reflect an attempt to ascertain any subject 's medical condition. The attending 
physician's role during this study is to ensure the safety of t he subject during the study. Subjects are 
informed that these are not diagnostic tools, if observations a re made using FDA cleared devices we 
will refer them to their primary care physician. 
13.10.  Risk From Loss of Confidentiality: Masimo upholds the highest s tandards to protect hard and 
electronic data however a complete promise for confidentiality cannot be guaranteed due to 
unforeseeable events. 
13.11.  Risk From Additional Testing: 
13.11.1.During the conduct of the study, it is possible, but no t likely, that someone could become 
exposed to the sample of blood drawn from the subject through a n inadvertent needle stick 
or by [CONTACT_138496]. In such circumstances, it will be important to the exposed 
individual to know whether the blood to which he or she was exp osed contained Hepatitis B 
virus (HBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or Hepatitis C  virus (HCV) and additional 
testing of the sample will be performed. 
13.11.2.Within the consent subjects will agree to permit the co mpany to test the blood sample (or 
samples) by [CONTACT_44210]. The test results will be maint ained as confidential and will 
only be used by [CONTACT_914195].  
13.11.3.In the case that Masimo needs to contact a subject rega rding additional testing they will be 
contact[CONTACT_426] a Masimo employee and medical personnel can be ava ilable for further 
counsel if requested.  
13.11.4.The cost for the initial testing and compensation for t heir time/travel to the testing facility 
will be the only things paid for by [CONTACT_108573]. 
13.12.  Lidocaine (injection) Risks:  Insertion of the Lidocaine may be  discomforting and can feel like a slight 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_531609] a warm/burning sensation. Other anticipated ad verse events that may occur, 
include but are not limited to: Flushing or redness of the skin , itching skin, small red or purple spots 
on the skin, unusually warm skin, bruising, bleeding at the app lication site, swelling. These adverse 
events are expected to be temporary. 
13.13.  Although not common, it is also possible to have an allergic re action to injectable lidocaine. Subjects 
should not take part in this study if they are allergic to lido caine injection or other types of numbing 
medicine, or if they have a heart rhythm disorder such as Wolff -Parkinson-White Syndrome or

13.14.  Ethyl Chloride (Lidocaine Spray): Ethyl Chloride is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] a nesthetic which is used to prevent pain 
by [CONTACT_138498]. Although unlikely, the anticipated adverse  events that may occur, include but 
are not limited to: changes in skin color (i.e. Flushing or red ness of the skin), delayed wound healing, 
rash, itching and swelling.  These adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
14. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 
The physician and nurse present during the study will be ACLS c ertified and will respond to any medical 
emergency involving a volunteer with the ACLS approved protocol  for intervention.  A crash cart is on site 
and full emergency services are within [ADDRESS_1284536] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].

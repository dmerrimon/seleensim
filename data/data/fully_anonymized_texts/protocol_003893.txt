 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHE MA 
 
Immuno-PET with radiolabeled antibody 89Zr-J591 will assess quantitatively the tumor vasculature- 
specific express ion of the prostate-specific antigen (PSMA) in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme. 
Glioblastoma is a cerebral neoplasm with a uniformly poor prognosis—a disease for which targets 
for new treatments are constantly sought. One such target might be prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA), which is e xpressed in prostate carcinoma and, more importantly in this context, in 
the endothelium of vessels in most malignant solid tumors including glioblastoma [1]. The purpose of 
this experiment is to assess the binding of 89Zr-J591 in patients (n=10) with glioblastoma multiforme. 
An asses sment of binding will ascertain whether this target is expressed at adequate levels for 
susta ined radionuclide or  antibody-drug conjugate targeting directed towards the vessels or cells 
within the perivascular niche.

3.0 BACKGROU ND AND RATIONALE 
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common ca ncer arising from the brain. It is also the most 
aggress ive sub type (WHO grade  IV) among gliomas, a  collection of tumors including 
oligodendrogliomas  and astrocytomas. Malignant gliomas  are diffusely infiltrative and hence a ll 
locally directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_331094]. Even with 
maximum treatment at initial diagnosis, malignant gliomas  have a dismal prognosis with estimated 5- 
year survival rates of 10% [2]. Standard management is maximal surgical resection followed by 
[CONTACT_331110] 75 mg/m2 and followed by 
[CONTACT_331111]  150-200 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5 for a total of 6 
cycles. However, GBMs are relentlessly progressive, and median survival with this treatment is only 
14 months [2]. 
 
The treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas  represents a therapeutic challenge. The treatment 
options at recurrence remain currently limited [3]. There are currently few salvage treatment options 
that have cons istently shown efficacy for recurrent GBMs [4]. A review of 225 GBM patients with 
recurrent GBM enrolled in 8 previous phase II studies, in which none of the treatments were 
considered particularly effective, showed a 6  month PFS of 15% for GBM [5]. Systemic 
administration of the DNA alkylator BCNU results in a 6mPFS (6 month progression free survival) 
rate of only 17.5% for recurrent GBM. Glioblastomas are highly hypoxic tumors with strong 
endogenous express ion of HIF-1a and of VEGF and its receptors and a consequently vigorous 
angiogenic phenotype. Anti-angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_331095] (bevacizumab)  and tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors of the VEGF receptor (e.g. Enzastau rin, SU11248) are already demons trating an important 
impact in glioblastoma treatment. Bevacizumab  was appro ved by  [CONTACT_331112] a landmark Phase II trial [4, 6]. Tumor vascular 
targeting, exploiting the phenotypic and genotypic variations of tumor (versus  normal) vessels, is 
another p otentially valuable anti-angiogenic approach for glioblastoma. 
 
The endothelium of malignant brain tumors is a particularly attractive target for vascular-targeted 
radio-immunotherapy, because: 
 
1.  Glioblastomas are highly vascular, 
2.  Radiation-resistant glioma stem cells appear to reside, at least in part, in a perivascular niche 
susta ined largely by [CONTACT_147021] [7] 
3.  Endothelium can be exposed to radiolabeled antibody much more readily than can  the tumor 
substance, which is p rotected  by [CONTACT_33428]-brain barrier.

J591 is an  anti-PSMA antibody that binds with high affinity to the external domain of PSMA. There 
has been extensive clinical experience at  Weill-Cornell and at MSKCC with the naked antibody and 
with 177lutetium-labeled antibody in the treatment of prostate cancer and, more recently, in the 
vascular-targeted therapy of a variety of other solid tumors. We are in the early stages of designing a 
radio-immunotherapy trial with radiolabeled J5 91as an anti-angiogenic agent for glioblastoma but 
before procee ding we desire to demonstrate physiologic binding of J591 to the tumor vessels. 89Zr- 
J591 PET has  been us ed safely in patients with prostate cancer both primary disease and  metastatic 
castration resistant disease [11]. Our plan is to demonstrate binding of J591 with 89Zr-J591 PET and 
also optimize 89Zr-J591 PET in glioblastoma patients for the possibility of measuring response to 
radiolabeled J5 91 and other anti-angiogenic agents. 
 
J591  
 
The J591 mAb is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed  at the extracellular domain of human 
PSMA [12]. J591 was de rived from murine J591 using Biovation’s (Biovation, Aberdeen, Scotland, 
[LOCATION_006]) de-immunization technology in which individual ami no acids in predicted B a nd T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_331096], thereby [CONTACT_331113]-mAb 
antibody response in humans. This results in a potentially non-immunogenic antibody, which might 
be administered to patients on multiple occas ions over long periods without inducing an immune 
response (see Clinical Experience). Furthermore, the humanized mAb additionally has been 
engineered to possess the effect of inducing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC ) with 
human immune effector cells. J591 is produc ed from NS0 cells by [CONTACT_309814] (Lonza Biologics, Slough, 
[LOCATION_006]). The molecular weight of J591 is approximately 147,000 D altons as determined by [CONTACT_331114] (MALDI-TOF). The naked antibody is formulated in a 
50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, containing 100 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM EDTA at a 
nominal concentration of 5 mg/mL

DFO-J591  
 
In order to radiolabel J591 with + emitting radionuclides such as 89Zr, the J591 antibody molecule is 
first conjugated to a macrocyclic chelating agent, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- N, N’, N’’, N’’’- 
tetraacetic acid (DFO) by [CONTACT_331115]. The DFO conjugated antibody is formulated in 0.3 M 
ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 at a nominal concentration of 8 mg/mL. 
 
Radiolab eled J591 
 
The DFO-J591 antibody molecule is labeled with radio-metal 89Zr in 1.0 M ammonium acetate buffer 
at pH 7.0. The radiolabeled J5 91 complex is then purified us ing size-exclusion co lumn 
chromatography. To avoid the effects of auto-radiolysis on the antibody, reaction time is minimized 
and the radiolabeled antibody prepara tions are formulated in phos phate buffered sa line co ntaining 
not more than 1% human serum albumin (HSA). All reagents used in the conjugation and purification 
of J591 are made with pyrogen-free water. Radiolabeled J5 91 is pe riodically tested  for sterility and 
pyrogenicity. 
 
Anti-PSMA Monoclonal Antibodies 
 
The PSMA gene has  been cloned, sequenced, and mapped to chromos ome 11 [13]. PSMA is 
anchored to the cell membrane. Initial validation of PSMA as an  in vivo  target has been borne out by 
[CONTACT_331116] 7E11/CYT-356 marketed as Pro staScint (Capromab) [14-17]. Molecular 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], however, indicates  that capromab  targets a portion of the PSMA molecule that is within the 
cell’s interior and not exposed on  the outer cell surface [10, 18]. In living cells, this internal b inding 
site is n ot accessible to antibody. Successful imaging with cap romab relates to targeting of 
dead/dying cells within tumor sites. It has been noted that a mAb to the extracellular domain of 
PSMA would provide benefits including improved localization in p atients and enhanced imaging and 
therapy. At Weill Medical College, Liu et al have reported the development of 4 IgG mAb to the 
external d omain of PSMA (PSMAext) [19]. These antibodies to PSMAext demonstrate high affinity 
binding to PCa cells in tissue cu lture, on tissue  sections, and in a nimal models in vivo . Furthermore, 
unlike capromab, these mAb can b ind to viable cells because the target-binding site is present on 
the exterior of the ce ll. In in vitro and in vivo animal models of prostate cancer, for which these 
antibodies were developed, 177Lu -J591 has demonstrated su bstantial anti-tumor activity. In these 
studies, immune-deficient ‘nude’ mice are implanted intramuscularly with PSMA-express ing human 
prostate cancer cells [18]. Cancers are allowed to ‘estab lish’ for a period of approximately 2 weeks 
during which time the cancer develops a blood supply allowing further growth. At the time of 
treatment initiation, the cancer implants average 1.0 cm in diameter (or approximately 5% of the 
animal’s body weight. Results demonstrate that 177Lu -J591 induces an average of >90%  tumor 
reduction comp ared to control-treated mice (saline or  non-radioactive antibody or 177Lu -irrelevant

antibody). A portion of the animals showed complete disappearance of tumor. These studies also 
demonstrate significant improvement in survival of the 177Lu -J591-treated animals, with a large 
propo rtion of cured  animals. Cancers not expressing PSMA do n ot respond to treatment 
demonstrating the specificity of the treatment. Animals treated with multiple, low doses of 177Lu - 
J591, rather than single, larger doses of 177Lu -J591, appear to have better tumor reduction 
responses, better survival, and less toxicity. 
 
Prior studies/Preliminary results 
 
The first step in evaluating this hypothesis in human su bject will be to evaluate 89Zr-J591 bio- 
distribution, dosimetry and tumor binding in patients with glioblastomas. 
 
CLINICAL EXPER IENCE: 
 
111Indium J591- (Cornell protocol 1099-905) 
 
Fourteen patients were entered in a Phase [ADDRESS_409425] dose level, 
developed an a naphylactic reaction ass ociated with a too rapid infusion rate, 
and he received only a single dos e. He recovered promptly and completely 
but, due to the reaction, was not given further doses. The infusion rate has 
since b een limited to 5 mg/minute. Another patient received only a single dose 
due to rapid disease progression and loss of protocol eligibility. The remaining 
12 patients, who received total doses ranging from 62.5 mg/m2 to 500  mg/m2, 
demonstrated the following Grade 1 to 3 (CTCAE) hematological adverse 
events: neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, leukocytopenia, hemoglobinemia, and 
thrombocytopenia. 
 
Observed Adverse Events 
 
All of these hematological toxicities were transient in nature and returned to 
baseline levels during the cou rse of the study. Imaging studies, done in all 
patients, demonstrated excellent antibody targeting to tumor sites without 
significant targeting to normal tissue s ites. Results demonstrated no clinical or 
laboratory evidence of immunogenicity of the J591 antibody.

immunogenicity of the 
humanized antibody (HAHA ) 
as well as the preliminary 
therapeutic efficacy. Patients 
received an initial dose of

111In-DFO-J591-GS (20 mg, 5mC i) for pharmacokinetic and bio-distribution determinations, followed 
one-week later, with a dose of 90Y-DFO-J591-GS (20 mg). The dose schedule was se lected  to allow 
multiple imaging sessions prior to 111In decay as well as cl earance  of the J591 from the initial dose 
prior to delivering the 2nd dose. T he 90Y dose was se lected  based on prior published experience with 
other antibodies. The first dose utilizes 4-5 mCi of 111In and allows imaging for approximately one 
week. Eligible sub jects were hormone-refractory with progressing prostate ca ncer. Twenty-nine 
subjects were entered at the following dose levels: 5, 10, 15, 17.5 and  20 mCi/m2.  Patients were 
eligible for up to three re-treatments if platelet and neutrophil recovery were sati sfactory.  Four 
patients were re-treated. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen at 20  mCi/m2 with two patients experiencing 
thromboc ytopenia with non-life threatening bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_331097]. The 
17.5 mCi/m2 dose level was de termined to be the maximum tolerated dose.  No re-treated patients 
experienced d ose-limiting toxicity.  Non-hematologic toxicity was not d ose-limiting. Among the 29 
patients receiving 111In-DFO-J591-GS, 19 patients had bone lesions and 13  patients had soft tissue 
lesions. 17 of 19 (89%) patients with bone  lesions and 9 of 13 (69%) with soft tissue lesions were 
accurately targeted resulting in an overall targeting se nsitivity of 26 of 
32 (81%). Two patients treated at the 20 mCi/m2 dose level exhibited 85% and 70% declines in 
PSA lasting 8 and 8.6 months prior to returning to pre-treatment values. In add ition, these two 
patients had objective measurab le disease responses with 90%  and 40% decrease in the size of 
pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Both patients were hormone-refractory with lymph 
node -only disease and had not received pri or chemotherapy. The second patient was re-treated 
with 90Y-DFO-J591-GS on day  119. An additional 6 patients experienced PSA stabilization by [CONTACT_5875]

J591. Patients received 10 mg/m2 J591 with doses of 177Lu ranging from 10 mCi/m2 - 75 mCi/m2. 
Several p atients were re-treated. Of the 3 patients at the 75 mCi/m2 dose level, one experienced 
dose-limiting (grade 4) thromboc ytopenia while the remaining 2 p atients experienced grade 3 
thrombocytopenia. All 3 of these patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia, one of which was dose - 
limiting neutropenia of 6 days duration. As 2 of 3 patients at this dose level experienced DLT, no 
additional patients were entered at this dose. At the pri or dose level of 70mCi/m2, 6 patients were 
entered. 2 patients had transient grade 4 neutropenia not meeting the definition of DLT; 1 of these 
patients had grade 4  thrombocytopenia. As there was on ly 1 DLT in these 6 patients, the 70 mCi/m2 
dose level was de termined to be the MTD. Among the 35 patients receiving 177Lu -J591, 30 (86%) 
had metastatic disease detected on screening imaging studies. Specifically, 21 (60%) patients had 
bone -only metastases, 6 (17%) had soft tissue-only metastases and 3 (9%) had both bone and soft 
tissue d isease. In all of these 30  patients, known sites of metastatic disease were successfully

PSA declines lasting 3+ to 8 months, and 
16 patients had PSA stabilization (< 25% 
increase  from baseline) of ≥ 28 days. The 
median duration of PSA stabilization was 60  days with a range of 28-601+ days. 
Observed Adverse Events 
The observed adverse events of this therapeutic protocol were predicted by [CONTACT_331117]. 
Please note: these prior studies were therapeutic and diagnostic nuclides like 89Zr are unlikely to 
have a similar effect on the bone marrow and with toxicity.

Localized Prostate (Cornell pr otocol [PHONE_6903]): The objectives of this trial were to study the 
targeting, dosimetry, toxicity, pharmacokinetics 
and the immunogenicity of the humanized 
antibody 89Zr-J591under IND 115521. A total of 
eleven patients received an initial dose of 89Zr- 
J591 (20 mg, 5mCi) for pharmacokinetic and bio- 
distribution determinations. Patients were imaged 
5-6 days after injection with all patients 
undergoing whole body  PET and a limited scan  of 
the pelvis. Eleven Patients were injected and 
scanned. None of the patients experiences any 
adverse effects. Imaging studies, done in all 
patients, demonstrated excellent antibody 
targeting to tumor sites without significant 
targeting to normal tissue site s. Results 
demonstrated no clinical or  laboratory evidence of 
immunogenicity of the J591 antibody. Results of

This study is not designed to confirm the imaging accuracy of 89Zr-J591 and thus, a truth 
standard has not been defined for the purpose of data ana lyses. Efficacy studies with an 
appropri ate sample size to allow for the assessment of imaging accu racy against a truth 
standard will be co nducted in the future as a Phase II study. At that time, more refined 
eligibility criteria are  likely to be applied to study candidates. 
 
4.2 Inter vention 
 
The intervention is the administration of an injection of 18-19mg of unchelated J591 to reach 
the total a dministered dose of antibody (IND11407) followed by 5 mCi (+/- 10%) of 89Zr-J591 
(1 to 2 mg) . After administration of the experimental tracer, the patient will undergo a Brain 
PET/CT scan  [ADDRESS_409429] injection and 3-8 days. The 48 hour scan  is strongly 
suggested, but optional.

5.0 DIAGNO STIC AGENTS 
 
89Zr-J591  
 
J591 is a  humanized antibody that targets the external  domain of PSMA, and has  been studied as 
therapy as an  unconjugated (“cold”) antibody, and labeled with Yttrium-90, and Lutetium-177. 
Several e xperiments have sho wn that J591 is an excellent means of targeting the tumor 
neovasculature, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme. This protocol will extend these studies into 
the realm of imaging for diagnostic and, ultimately, potential therapeutic applications. The radio- 
antibody 89Zr-J591 has characteristics that have the potential to outperform other radiotracers in use 
for glioblastoma multiforme by [CONTACT_331119]-specific angiogenesis. 
 
1.  The antigen target, PSMA, is uniquely expressed  in the tumor neovasculature for multiple 
solid tumors, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (Chang S, et al. Cancer Res, 1999). 
2.  The long half-life of the 89Zr makes it possible to image at late times after injection, when 
background activity has cleared from blood and  soft-tissue. 
3.  89Zr is a Pos itron emitter, and PET imaging has much h igher sensitivity and resolution 
characteristics compared to conventional nuclear medicine imaging procedures, such  as 
SPEC T. 
 
We will use Z irconium-89, a positron-emitting radionuclide, labeled to J591. The final drug product is 
89Zr-J591 in human serum albumin/ saline, sterile filtered in a sterile vial, sealed with rubber septa 
and closed with aluminum stopper. 89Zr is chelated by [CONTACT_331120]-J591 conjugate. Human 
serum a lbumin is USP grade and has b een adequately tested  for HBV, HCV, and HIV-1. No other 
materials of animal origin are used in the manufacture of 89Zr-J591. Manufacture of first DFO-J591 
and then 89Zr-J591 is performed by  [CONTACT_309833] & Molecular Imaging Probes core facility at 
MSKCC . J591 is provided und er IND# [ADDRESS_409430]. Neil Bander of Cornell, which we are cross- 
referencing for information regarding its chemistry, manufacturing and co ntrols. Cold antibody will be 
administered separately according to the IND.

Radiation Dosimetry 
 
Method  and Analysis: 
 
Normal-organ radiation absorbed dos es and the effective dose  for 89Zr-DFO-J591 in human were 
estim ated based on based on MSKCC clinical study of 89Zr-DFO-J591 in 10 patients: dosimetry 
estim ates by  [INVESTIGATOR_207145] O'Donoghue using the formalism of the Medical Internal Radionuclide Dosimetry 
(MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear medicine (SNM). 
 
Assumi ng a [ADDRESS_409436] scan  is to be 
performed, for 2-3 time points the predicted human radiation dosimetry for 89Zr-DFO-J591, total normal- 
organ absorbed doses and effective dose are tabulated below. 
 
The human normal-organ radiation doses thus derived were found to be comparab le to those of other 
commonly used diagnostic radiotracers. In the radiation dos imetry analysis, the critical organ was 
determined to be the kidneys, receiving a dose-equivalent of 1.97 rem/mCi. In the trial propos ed, a 5 
mCi injected-dose of 89Zr-DFO-J591 is to be administered initially. If needed to get adequate PET 
images, the radioactive compou nd dose  could be increase d. Based upon  the pred icted human 
dosimetry, even with an a dministered dose as high as 12  mCi, the total a bsorbed dose  to the kidneys 
should be less than 28 rem.

AUTORADIOGR APHY: 
 
The major components of our quantitative autoradiography system include a digital cryostatic 
microtome (MICROM 500M) and our recently installed state-of the-art GE Typhoon 700 0IPphosphor 
plate autoradiography system capable of spatial resolution as low as 25  μm. Following acquisition of 
autoradiographic images, sections may then be stained with either histo- or immuno-histochemical 
(IHC) techniques, and scanned digital images acquired at  very high resolution (< 1 m/pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]). All image 
sets will then be registered us ing a comb ination of mutual information and external  fiduciary markers 
placed on the sections. These techniques have previously been us ed at MSKCC in a similar mamnner 
to study 124I-A33 uptake and sub-tumoral distribution. 
 
Infusion rea ctions 
 
Infusion reactions with J591 are generally mild if they occur at all. In the even of fever, rigors, shortness 
of breath, or other evidence of infusion reaction, patients may receive diphenhydramine 25  mg IV and 
Tylenol 650 mg as felt to be clinically appropri ate by [CONTACT_1963].  This has been the accepted 
protocol since MSKCC IRB 11-126 for the injection of 89Zr-J591. 
 
 
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION D URING TREATMENT/INT ERVENTION  
 
Primary Outcomes  
 
Positive lesions on 89Zr-J591 PET will be d efined as those with higher activity than adjacent or contra 
lateral background  that is deemed  not to be physiologic. The gold standard of positive will consist of 
lesion identified on co nventional imaging, (CT/MRI, bone scan) consistent with metastatic disease. 
Antibody scan will be read blinded from clinical history and conventional imaging modalities. Two 
different readers will visually analyze the sca ns, SUV max will be d etermined, and the results will be 
merged when the data are complete. A combined list will be generated that will then contain 
individual SUVmax measurements. 
 
Laboratory Safety Assessments: Hematology and blood chemistry assessme nts (CBC, serum 
BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT, total b ilirubin, alkaline phos phatase, albumin, and blood glucose levels)

11.0 TOXICITIE S/SIDE EFFECTS  
 
Risks 
 
89Zr-J591  PET/CT Scans 
 
As part of this scan  there is radiation delivered from the 89Zr and from the low dose CT scan  that are 
performed as part of the CT for attenuation co rrection and co-registration. There is a  low theoretical 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a cancer at some point later in life as a result of the radiation exposure received in 
this study. This risk is particularly low for adults given the fact that the radiation from the scans will 
be over several weeks. Participants should not father a baby  [CONTACT_56035]. Acceptable birth 
control methods include abstinence, double barrier method, surgically sterilized patient or partner. 
 
J591  
 
Potential risks associated with J591 a re allergic reactions, characterized by [CONTACT_411], ch ills, and 
some times rashes or hives. Less likely shortness of breath can occur. Rare allergic reactions can 
present  as infection, shock or death or swelling of the throat. Allergic reactions such  as these have

Amended: [ADDRESS_409447]. Such reactions are usually addressed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_331104], administering steroids, acetaminophen and/or 
diphenhydramine, and restarting the drug at a slower rate if the reaction is not severe. 
 
There is a  very small risk of infection. This could cause itching or redness at the area on  the patient’s 
arm where the IV was placed. 
 
 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THE RAPEUTIC  RESPONS E/OUTCOME  ASSES SMENT 
 
Positive lesions on 89Zr-J591 will be d efined visually as a focus of accumulation of radioactivity that 
is deemed  to not be p hysiologic and is higher than adjacent or contra lateral background. Antibody 
scan will be read blinded from clinical history and conventional imaging modalities. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_409448] inform the investigator immediately. In addition, the investigator has the right to terminate 
participation of any patient at any time if it is deemed in the patient’s best interest. The reason a nd 
circumstances for premature discontinuation will be d ocume nted in the patient’s medical records. 
Possible examples for reasons of premature study withdrawal include withdrawal of consent, SAE or 
intolerable AE, or any other medical illness at investigator’s discretion. 
 
For patients who are  enrolled without prior histological co nfirmation of glioblastoma, if the surgery is 
found not to meet histological criteria for glioblastoma, the patient will be removed from the study 
and replaced until [ADDRESS_409449] set the unit of analysis is patient and 
the only planned ana lysis is to present the number of patients with any  uptake (a binary variable as 
defined in Sections 10 and 12) at each time point along with a 95% exact co nfidence interval. If, for 
example, [ADDRESS_409450] multiple lesions a lesion-based a nalysis with 
necessary corrections for the intra-patient correlation will be us ed. These analyses w ill be performed 
separately for each scan (time point). While it is also of interest to comp are the uptake across time 
points using generalized estim ating equations, this will be d one with the understanding that 
statistical power will be limited.

16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The data and safety monitoring (DSM) plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_331125] 2001. The plans address  the policies set forth by [CONTACT_331126], which can  be found at  http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials. The DSM 
plans at MSKCC were estab lished and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The 
MSKCC DSM plans can be  found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/[ZIP_CODE].cfm. 
 
There are several d ifferent mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety, 
and quality. There are institu tional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on  clinical research quality assurance) and dep artmental procedures for quality 
control, and there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) for Phase I a nd II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the MSKCC Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol  will be ass essed  for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of  protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sp onsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be a ddressed, 
and the monitoring procedures will be estab lished at the time of protocol  activation. 
 
For this protocol, we will use the following patient safety monitoring plan and monitoring for 
adverse events, in terms of the test performed and their timing relative to injection (see Table 
1 and 2).  Patient will be o bserved closely during infusion and vital signs will be o btained pre- 
and pos t-injection of radiotracer. 
 
Safety reviews will be p erformed by [CONTACT_331127]-DSMC with yearly review by [CONTACT_1201].

 17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
This study will be co nducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidelines estab lished by [CONTACT_147622], and the eth ical standards set forth in the Declaration of 
Helsinki 2004 (available at:  www.laakariliitto.fi/e/ethics/helsinki.html). 
 
This protocol does not have therapeutic intent a nd does n ot offer patients therapeutic benefit. This 
will be c learly conveyed to patients when communicating the potential toxicities/side effects of 
participating in this trial. Participation in the trial is voluntary and there will be no  financial benefit (or 
burden) for the patients. Participants will not be charged for 89Zr-J591 radiotracer and PET sca ns, 
and research testing on  resected tumor tissue. 
 
17.1 Privacy 
 
MSKCC’ s Privacy Office may allow the use  and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a comp leted and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be comp leted by  [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_331106] (IRB/PB). 
 
17.2 Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) Repor ting 
 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event 
• An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to cond uct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in deat h, be life threatening, or 
require hosp italization may be co nsidered serious when, based u pon medical judgmen t, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a planned procedure/disease treatment is not considered an 
SAE. 
 
 
SAE reporting is required as soon as the participant signs consent.  SAE reporting is 
required for 30-days after the participant’s last investigational treatment or intervention. Any 
events that occur after the 30-day period and that are at least possibly related to protocol 
treatment must be reported. 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calendar days of the event. 
The IRB requires a Clinical Research Database (CRDB ) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office as  follows:

 Clinical Study to evaluate effectiveness and safety of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75983] (UGIB) 
Brief Title: DETECT-1 Study 
Version: 4. [ADDRESS_82637] an Upper Gastrointestinal B leed (UGIB). 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75984] 4 
hours of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75985]. The investigators performing the EGD were blinded to the 
results provided by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_75986].   
 Subjects were  monitored for Capsule passage during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An X -ray was taken before  
discharge if Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75987]. As required, subjects were provided 
with a Capsule Retrieval Kit and were instructed to monitor their stools. A follow -up visit was 
performed within 7 days of Capsule administration. If Capsule passage was confirmed (either via return of the Capsule or photographic evidence of passage) the subject was exited from the study. 
Otherwise, the subject was required to return f or another visit between Day [ADDRESS_82638] site staff immediately in the case of any discomfort and/or abdominal pain.  
 
The complete final (Rev. 04) clinical protocol can be found in Appendix  16.1. 
7.[ADDRESS_82639]-1 study was designed as a prospective single -arm cohort study  with the aim of 
evaluating safety and effectiveness of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75988] (and accuracy) of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75989]; EGD. The Sensitivity and Specificity  endpoints  were compared with 
prespecified performance goals of 75% and 60% respectively .  
 The performance goals (PG) were developed based on a literature review of capsule endoscopy  
(CE) as the CE device represents the best comparator for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75990]. In a meta -analysis  performed by [CONTACT_76018] [12], sensitivity 
among 5 studies evaluating CE for diagnosing UGIB ranged from 62% to 100% with a pooled 
sensitivity of 78% (lower 95% CI of 58%). Within this same meta- analysis, t he specificity was 
documented to range from 64% to 100% with a pooled specificity of 74.8% (lower 95% CI of 68%).  
Of the two endpoints/performance goals, sensitivity was seen as the more important characteristic and therefore the PG was set higher for sensitivity than it was for specificity and on par with values 
observed for CE. Although the specificity for the PG in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75991],  the lower value is justified on the following 
basis:  
• The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75992],  providing a “reading at the moment”; therefore , it is 
very possible that when the EGD wa s performed hours after the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75993], that

Page 23 of 309bleeding may no longer be present, which may present as a “false positive” for the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75994].  
•Since the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75995], ther e
m
ay be remnants of blood in the stomach even if there is no active bleeding, providing a
f
alse positive response.
•The risks associated with a false positive is minimal in that once the confirmation EGD is
performed the patient’s treatment pathway would be reaffirmed within hours of th e
P
illSense procedure.
The appr
opriateness of the study design and suitability of the PG values were reviewed with and 
accepted by  [CONTACT_76019] a pre -submission Q210522.  
7.3 Study Objectives  
The study objectives  are the following:  
•to demonstrate the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75996].
•to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),  and
negat
ive predictive value (NPV) of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75997] a clinical
environment.
•to show that the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75998] a timely manner.

participate in the trial at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice to his future medical care 
by [CONTACT_76020].  
The 
investigator also had the right to withdraw patients from the study for any legitimate reason, 
such as patient non- compliance with study procedures.  
I
f a subject  decided to withdraw from the study, or if a subject  was withdrawn from the treatment 
or study, the date of and the reason for discontinuation was  recorded on the electronic case report 
form (eCRF). All efforts were made to complete the end of treatment (EOT) evaluations at a time agreed by [CONTACT_76021], and observations/assessments were recorded as thoroughly as possible.  
A
ll patients were to be followed until it was determined that the capsule had passed via 
photographic evidence provided by [CONTACT_76022] a confirmatory x -ray performed within 21 
days (about 3 weeks)  to confirm capsule passage, as necessary . Reasons for not evaluating a 
subject  through the follow -up period included:  
1. Subjec t Lost to Follow -Up: Unable to locate the subject  despi[INVESTIGATOR_76000] .
2.Subject Withdrawal: The subject  requested to terminate his/her involvement in the study.
To the extent possible, an exit interview was conducted with each subject  to determine if
the capsule had passed and to assess the subject ’s specific reason(s) for study
withdrawal.

The SELECTION Study Study Design Single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_105369] a decision support tool (DST) for elective induction of labor (IOL).  Primary Objective/Purpose The goal of the proposed study is to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_71047] a patient-centered DST to help women and providers work together in making informed, shared decisions regarding whether or not to opt for elective IOL at 39 weeks gestation   Secondary Objective(s)/Purposes This study will provide the information needed to plan a randomized trial of the DST for support of the equitable offer of induction of labor.   Research Intervention(s)  Exposure to the decision support tool ClinicalTrials.gov NCT # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Study Population Nulliparous people with singleton, vertex pregnancies at 36-[ADDRESS_116971] a medical indication for induction of labor Sample Size 60  Study Duration for individual subjects Approximately 2 months  Study Specific Abbreviations/ Definitions  DST: decision support tool IOL: induction of labor  CD: cesarean delivery    
SELECTION Study Protocol………………           -5-  16 May 2023  2.0 Background and Objective  The ARRIVE trial, a large multicenter study published in 2018, compared expectant management to induction of labor at 39 weeks absent medical indication and found that induction was associated with a decrease in CDs, preeclampsia/gestational hypertension, as well as in the need for neonatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], without a statistically significant difference in adverse perinatal outcomes. Subsequently, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) issued statements that it was reasonable to offer elective induction of labor to low risk, nulliparous pregnant people (the population studied in the trial and the population who will be eligible for the current study). A study based on birth certificate data published in 2022 showed that the offer of elective induction of labor has been integrated into clinical practice.  However, how, when, and to whom this option is offered is unclear. While the improvement in maternal and neonatal outcomes observed in this trial are compelling, little is known about how patients and providers view the routine offer of elective IOL at 39 weeks, which is a significant change in practice. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to support the equitable offer of elective induction of labor to all eligible people, and to support pregnant people in making an informed choice that is concordant with their values. Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most common inpatient surgery in the US, accounting for nearly one third of births annually. Reducing the CD rate has been targeted as an important public health goal; however, achieving this goal has proven challenging. In parallel, delivery at 39 weeks has been suggested as optimal for the neonate, but controversy about the relationship between induction of labor (IOL) and CD has limited enthusiasm for utilizing IOL as a means of achieving delivery at this gestational age. Finally, the appropriateness of the intervening in pregnancy without a clear medical indication is highly controversial. Given the current professional American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidance that: “Based on the findings demonstrated in this trial (ARRIVE), it is reasonable for obstetricians and health-care facilities to offer elective induction of labor to low-risk nulliparous women at 39 weeks gestation.”, potential complexity of discussions about elective IOL at 39 weeks and the significant population of women who likely will be presented with this option, a decision support tool (DST) may help to improve the efficiency of shared decision making and ensure incorporation of informed patient preferences around this offer.

We also will investigate relationships within and between measurement domains (e.g.

In addition, we will describe the trajectories of participant responses across time.    As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there are no hypotheses to be tested; therefore formal sample size calculations are not appropriate.    4.[ADDRESS_116973] been tested in NIH-funded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials among English- or Spanish-speaking pregnant women (R01HD078748, R01HD04968). The design process we have used to develop our DSTs follows the standards put forward by [CONTACT_105378] (IPDAS) Collaboration, using a systematic development process based on the IPDAS quality checklist.  We utilize a patient-centered approach, which always begins by [CONTACT_105379], desires, and behaviors of the target population. We rely on published, validated literature for the information included in the decision support tools and utilize an iterative process to obtain input from patients and health care providers regarding their views on informational and decision-support needs. Using this patient-centered design approach, our designers work with researchers, providers, and patients to leverage the expertise of all parties in ways that exceed standard expectations for the engagement of these parties in research. This approach allows us to better connect with the people who are the center of our research, and enables quick and effective transformation of data into actionable ideas/tools. In developi[INVESTIGATOR_105371], we began by [CONTACT_105380] 39 weeks gestation. We interviewed pregnant and postpartum women, to determine what they know and feel about elective IOL at 39 weeks and how they would view being presented with a choice between this intervention versus expectant management. We also interviewed providers (obstetricians, midwives, prenatal nurses and labor and delivery nurses) to obtain their thoughts on elective IOL at [ADDRESS_116974] begins with the statement “Your health care providers can tell you a lot about these two approaches and the advantages of each, but YOU are the expert about what is important to you” and aims to 
SELECTION Study Protocol………………           -7-  16 May 2023  present balanced information to support the user in making an informed, values concordant choice between the two options. It presents information on elective IOL at 39 weeks versus expectant management, including information regarding the processes and potential outcomes of each approach to delivery, and incorporating values clarification exercises as well as a summary statement that women can use in discussing this option with their providers. We then pretested the tool in pregnant and postpartum women and reviewed it with providers to obtain their feedback on the content and presentation, iteratively using that process to improve the prototype.  4.0 Study Population Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria This study will include 60 pregnant people at two sites. Eligibility criteria will include nulliparity, singleton pregnancy, no contraindication to vaginal delivery, no medical indication for IOL, age 18 years or older and an ability to speak English (as study materials are only available in English at this time). Exclusion criteria will include people not planning a vaginal delivery, eople who have had a baby [CONTACT_105381], people with a medical indication for induction of labor at the time of enrollment, people younger than 18 Participant Withdrawal People who experience a pregnancy loss (stillbirth) will not be contact[CONTACT_105382].  This is expected to be an extremely rare event in this low risk population.  People may also request to be withdrawn from the study if they no longer want to participate.  5.[ADDRESS_116975] used successfully in prior studies of pregnant people. We will ensure that all necessary human subjects’ reviews and approvals are obtained prior to implementation at any recruitment site.    Potentially eligible participants will be identified by [CONTACT_105383]. At all sites, both academic and “private” practices are associated with an academic health system, and as such, with IRB approval, study staff is able to remain HIPAA-compliant when they pre-screen patients.  At USF, eligible people will receive a letter describing the study, signed by a leadership representative of their OB practice (as many patients do not have a single provider they see for prenatal care, but rather see a team of providers).  A stamped return “opt in/out” card will be included, which the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_105372]. The site-specific interviewer’s telephone number also will be included for each recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s use if they prefer to use this method of communication. Respondents who check “opt in” will be called/contact[CONTACT_105384].  Those who opt out will not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  A study staff member will come to a subsequent visit at which time the clinical staff will ask the participant if they would be willing to discuss the study and assess their eligibility and interest in participating. The “opt out” mechanism has been shown to yield a more diverse group of participants than the “opt in” approach, and, in our many studies of diverse populations, has been highly effective in recruiting participants for 
SELECTION Study Protocol………………           -8-  16 May 2023  studies that require conducting face-to-face interviews with pregnant people at specific gestational ages.    At OSU, eligible people will receive a brochure detailing the study.  Those who are eligible and interested will be contact[CONTACT_105385].   Participants will be identified starting at 32-34 weeks with the goal of scheduling the initial study visit between 36+0 and 38+0 weeks gestation to allow time to view and consider the information in the decision tool prior to making a decision regarding whether to proceed with an elective induction at 39+0 to 39+6 weeks gestation.  5.0 Study Procedures The procedures and/or interventions conducted as part of this research are low risk, educational interventions.  Elective induction, or induction of labor absent medical indication is an evidence-based aspect of routine pregnancy care that has been endorsed by [CONTACT_105386] 2018. In clinical practice, the way that this option is offered is currently highly variable and driven by [CONTACT_105387]’s preferences and goals. The intervention in this study will be the viewing of standardized information about elective induction of labor prior to making their decision about this option with their provider.  Questionnaires will be utilized to understand the impact of the educational intervention on decision quality and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We will prospectively enroll 60 nulliparous people (approximately 30 at USF and 30 at the Ohio State University) planning vaginal delivery with singleton, vertex pregnancies at 36-[ADDRESS_116976] telephone interviews a few days later but before 39+[ADDRESS_116977]’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. A study eligibility checklist will be completed prior to any study procedures. Parental consent will be obtained to review the medical records of the infants.  Assent is not appropriate given the clinical scenario (review of infant medical records). • Participation will consist of one face-to-face enrollment interview and two follow-up telephone interviews, along with permission to access the patient’s medical chart. Patient-reported data will be collected at 4 time points: at the beginning of the enrollment interview, prior to DST viewing (T1); at the conclusion of that interview, post DST viewing (T2); during a telephone interview at 38-39 weeks gestation, by [CONTACT_105388]………………           -9-  [ADDRESS_116978] – or will be close to having been made (T3); and during second telephone interview 2-4 weeks postpartum (T4). • Participants will initially view the DST on a tablet during the enrollment interview.  At the conclusion of the interview, they will be provided with a unique link so that they can revisit the DST content from their personal phone, tablet, or computer if desired. • During the enrollment interview (T1), we will administer a sociodemographic questionnaire and assess the participant’s health literacy level using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) measure.  We also will ask a series of questions related to her inclination to undergo elective IOL at 39 weeks, her attitudes and beliefs about this intervention, her desire for shared decision making in this context, and her feedback regarding the decision tool.  • Attitudes and beliefs (T1, T2, and T3) will be assessed by [CONTACT_1601] a series of statements for which participants will be asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree. To measure decisional conflict (T2 and T3), we will use O'Connor's Decisional Conflict Scale, a measure that assesses patients' uncertainty in making a health-related decision, factors that contribute to this uncertainty; and whether they feel their decision making was effective).  To measure DST satisfaction (T2, T3, and 2-4 weeks postpartum (T4)), we will use an adapted version of a 3-item intervention-satisfaction scale that we have previously used based on a measure developed by [CONTACT_105389]. We will use the SDM-9 to measure shared decision making (T3 and T4). During T4, we also will administer the 6-item Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised Indicator (BSS-RI), which measures stress and emotional response to labor and birth, as well as the Labor Agentry Scale, which measures expectations and experiences of personal control during childbirth and was one of the outcomes measured in the ARRIVE trial.  We will include an open-ended question asking what else, if anything, the pregnant person would have wanted to know at the time she made her decision. Outcomes obtained via chart review after delivery will include uptake of elective IOL at 39 weeks, delivery mode undergone (vaginal or cesarean), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (prior to and after delivery), and clinical outcomes (gestational age at delivery, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and maternal and neonatal outcomes).  • During the initial face-to-face visit, we will ask participants their preferences for scheduling phone follow up interviews so we can streamline the process as much as possible.  Follow up questionnaires can be completed independently via RedCap survey T1: Prior to DST viewing T2: Post DST viewing T3: 38-39 weeks gestation T4:2-4 weeks postpartum • Sociodemographics, health literacy • IOL inclination • IOL attitudes  • Desire for shared decision making • Provider preferences and social norms • IOL inclination • IOL attitudes  • Decisional conflict • DST impact and satisfaction • IOL inclination • IOL attitudes  • Desire for shared decision making • Provider preferences and social norms • Decisional conflict • Shared decision making • DST impact and satisfaction • Shared decision making • DST impact and satisfaction  • Birth Satisfaction Scale • Labor Agentry Scale • Things you wish you had known (open ended)

Clinical outcomes will be obtained via chart review after delivery. • Subject Costs and Compensation: The face-to-face interview will take approximately one hour (participants will be remunerated with $40); telephone interviews will take 15 minutes ($20 each).  6.[ADDRESS_116979] to consider outcomes that they may find distressing (e.g., pregnancy complications).  It is possible that these topi[INVESTIGATOR_105373].  While this has not been a problem in our prior studies of potentially anxiety-provoking decision tools (including tools used by [CONTACT_105390] a serious disorder or that they will experience a pregnancy loss and be unable to give birth in the future) it is important that we carefully consider how we will minimize the likelihood of this problem and how we will assist our participants if their participation does result in some anxiety. First, all participants will be informed, prior to participation, that they are free to terminate their participation at any time or to decline to answer any questions or participate in any part of the study.  During the consent process, we will ensure that the participant understands this principle and they feel free to exercise their option at any time.  Participants will have access to their obstetric providers to discuss their concerns as well as to the clinician investigators at each site.   Additionally, participants will be informed that if they develop any feelings of anxiety at any time during their participation, they should contact [CONTACT_3476] (they will be provided with an access number).  These participants will be contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_116980] the participant and discuss their clinical situation.  If necessary, the physician will meet with the participant in person at their clinical office or the office of the participant’s primary obstetric provider (wherever the participant feels most comfortable).   If a participant's symptoms require more intensive intervention, this will be arranged by [CONTACT_15370]-investigator to ensure that the participant will receive all necessary care to address whatever symptoms might occur.  The physician-investigator who becomes involved with any participant over any anxiety symptoms will continue to monitor the patient (either by [CONTACT_48052]) until all symptoms have abated.   Each contact [CONTACT_105391].  In sum, we have an extensive support infrastructure for the management of mental health issues that arise in the course of study participation.  As noted, we have conducted similar studies in the past and have not had problems with anxiety, but we are fully prepared to deal with this possibility at any time should it occur.

Participants will be consistently reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g. country of origin/ immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any point.  Participants also will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by [CONTACT_28224].  7.[ADDRESS_116982] protected computer files in the office of the study coordinator at each site.  Used consent forms will also be locked in a filing cabinet in the office of the study coordinator.  Confidentiality of all study-related records will be maintained in accordance with State and Federal laws. Three databases will be maintained for the study: 1 and 2) Site specific “participant tracking” databases will contain all identifying information that will permit locating participants for their interviews, ensuring that interviews are completed on time, and performing chart reviews. It will include demographic information for all patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria or who decline participation, along with their reasons for refusal (to permit comparisons between those who do and do not enter the study). 2) A single“study data” database will contain all project-related data used for the analyses. Participants will be identified only by a code number in the study database. Obstetric clinic schedules will be reviewed to screen for eligibility, so that only subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be approached.  We will keep the minimum information necessary (Name, MR#, appointment date and time) in the recruitment database so that we know who has an appointment and can make sure recruitment materials are available when they are in clinic.  People who decline will be marked as declining so that they are not approached again. Records reviewed will only be from people who are actively receiving prenatal care and scheduled for appointments within the [ADDRESS_116983] identities. Datasets used for analysis will be de-identified.  As per the USF 
SELECTION Study Protocol………………           -12-  16 May 2023  guidelines, records will be maintained for 5 years after the study is complete and at that time we will destroy records linking participants’ names to study ID numbers.  Participant identities will not be revealed in any publication that may result from the proposed study.    8.[ADDRESS_116984] on decision quality, we believe that the use of this tool would result in a more individualized, patient-centered approach to this emerging decision in obstetrics, resulting in improved decision quality, quality of care, concordance between patient and provider expectations, and health outcomes, including a reduction in the cesarean delivery rate and improvements in maternal and neonatal outcomes.   9.0 IRB approval, safety monitoring and adverse event reporting IRB Approval This is a single site IRB study; USF is the responsible IRB and there is a reliance agreement in place with OSU.  The overall consent form as well as the OSU site specific addendum as well as all of the study materials have been reviewed as per the single site IRB protocol.  Amendments or modifications will be reviewed by [CONTACT_105392].  The Contact [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_105374]. These reports will include the total number of participants enrolled in the study, the number of participants who completed the study, all changes in the research activity, and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others.   Informed Consent: Written informed consent will be obtained from each study participant prior to enrollment using an approved informed consent form in accordance with all applicable regulations. A copy of her signed informed consent form will be offered to the participant.  Safety Monitoring and Clinical Data Review Research coordinators will report all participant complaints to the investigative team.  These will be discussed during research team and investigator calls.

This is a single arm prospective clinical trial to collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_105376] a future study of the impact of the Elective IOL DST, the intervention of interest, on induction rates, cesarean delivery rates, decision quality and resource use. The primary goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_105377], to assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining study participants in anticipation of future effectiveness and implementation studies, and to finalize outcome and other measures. The descriptive analyses planned include cross-sectional analyses, which will consist of profiles of the sample, including examination of means and proportions, measures of variability, and confidence intervals around these statistics. We also will investigate relationships within and between measurement domains (e.g. demographics, outcomes), although these will only be exploratory in nature. In addition, we will describe the trajectories of participant responses across time.

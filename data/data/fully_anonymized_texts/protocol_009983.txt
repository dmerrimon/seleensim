Protocol Title:   A Phase 2 Multi- Center, Open Label Study to Assess the Safety, Efficacy and 
Pharmacodynamics of IMG -7289 in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia  
Protocol No:   IMG- 7289- CTP -201  
Sites :  Approximately 25 sites in Australia, Italy, [LOCATION_013], New Zealand, [LOCATION_006] and US with 
additional sites and countries as needed.  
Study Objectives:   
Hypothesis : IMG -7289 is a safe and tolerable orally available agent when administered to 
patients with essential thrombocythemia; inhibition of LSD1 by [CONTACT_374734] -7289 will reduce both the 
number of megakaryocytes and their capacity to secrete growth factors and inflammatory 
cytokines to the clinical benefit of patients with ET.     
Primary Obje ctives:   To evaluate in ET  patients the effect of IMG -7289 on:  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Reduction of platelet counts to ≤ 400  k/μL (400 x 109/L) in the absence of new 
thromboembolic events 
Investigational Drug: The active drug substance is identified as IMG -7289(bomedemstat) .  
IMG- 7289 is an irreversible inhibitor of LSD1. The chemical name [CONTACT_832]: N -[(2S)-5-{[(1 R, 2S)-2-(4-
fluorophenyl) cyclopropyl]amino} -1-(4- methylpi[INVESTIGATOR_9482] -1-yl)-1-oxopentan -2-yl]-4-(1H-1,2,3 -
triazol -1-yl)benzamide, bis -tosylate salt.

Page 11 of 88  IMG -7289 will be supplied as capsules in multiple strengths. These strengths, based on IMG -7289 
free base, i.e., the active substance, m ay include: 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg. Capsule 
strengths provided may change throughout the duration of the study. Such details will be 
included via updates to the Pharmacy Manual.  
Study Population: Approximately [ADDRESS_515679] therapy  (failure is the 
equivalent of inadequate response or intolerance) . 
Methodology:  This is a Phase 2 multi- center, open -label study evaluating th e safety, efficacy and 
pharmacodynamics of IMG -7289 administered orally once daily in patients with essential 
thrombocythemia (ET).  
Preclinical testing of LSD1 inhibition in mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasm induced apoptosis in mutant stem/proge nitor cells, reduced inflammatory cytokines, reduced spleen 
length and weight, decreased bone marrow fibrosis  if present , and reduced extramedullary 
hematopoiesis. Additionally, LSD1 inhibition with IMG -7289 was shown in a Jak2
V617F mouse 
model of ET/polyc ythemia vera (PV) to selectively decrease the number of malignant 
megakaryocytes as well as reduc e elevated platelets, red cells and granulocytes ( Jutzi et al. , 
2018 ). To date, IMG -[ADDRESS_515680] received IMG -7289 to date.  Using all available 
information  in conjunction with the therapeutic goal for the treatment of ET, the starting d ose of 
IMG -7289 of 0.6 mg/kg QD has been selected .  Refer to Section 3.[ADDRESS_515681]  (SAB ) will perform reviews at least quarterly of 
safety parameters and pharmacodynamic markers to draw conclusions around the safety and pharmacodynam ic effect of IMG -7289. The SAB  will also review patient dose titrations and may 
recommend adjustments.  
Study Conduct:   This study consists of two treatment periods: the Initial Treatment Period (ITP), 
followed by [CONTACT_374736] (ATP). In the ITP, patients will be treated daily for 169 days. The ATP offers treatment to qualifying patients for an additional 169 days.  
During the ITP, patients will initially return for study assessments every other week (bi -weekly) 
for the first 12 weeks (ITP Days 15, 29, 43, 57, 71  and 85) and then monthly for 12 weeks (ITP 
Days 113, 141 and 169). It is anticipated that by [CONTACT_10585] 12 (Day 85)  the great majority of patients 
will have achieved a stable dose. For safety purposes, bi -weekly visits may continue at the PI’s 
discretion post Day 85 if necessary. On Day 169, bone marrow sampling is also required. 
Additionally,  at the Day 1 69 visit a ‘qualification’ assessment will be made to determine whether 
the patient is deriving clinical benefit  (defined as not meeting “progressive disease” criteria as 
per Appendix 16.5 ) and safely tolerating IMG -7289. For the patients who qualify for entry into

Imago BioSciences,  Inc.  Protocol IMG -7289- CTP -201  
IMG- 7289    09Sep2020   
Page 12 of 88  the ATP, transition should occur without interruption in dosing. Patients not deriving clinical 
benefit will discontinue IM G-7289 and undergo End of Treatment (EoT), pre -End of Study (pre -
EoS) and End of Study (EoS) visits.  
In the ATP, treatment may continue for an additional 169 days in those patients deriving clinical benefit, as determined by [CONTACT_079]. Qualifying patients will return for study assessments monthly (ATP Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141 and 169). It is anticipated that patients continuing in the ATP will have already achieved a stable dose, with every other week visits no longer necessary. For saf ety purposes, every other week visits may continue at the PI’s 
discretion, if necessary. On Day 169 of every other ATP (i.e., ATP 2, ATP 4, etc.), the equivalent of 
yearly, bone marrow sampling is also required. A t the Day 169 visit, a ‘qualification’ assessment 
will be made to determine whether the patient is continuing to derive clinical benefit. Such patients thereby [CONTACT_374737]- entry into the ATP, which is iterative; patients may continue to 
receive IMG -7289 for as long as they continue to qualify.  
Patients will be followed closely throughout the study for both Adverse Events (AEs) and signs of 
toxicity by [CONTACT_408856]. Pharmacodynamic effects will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_408857], and requisite bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99193]. Throughout dosing, transfusions may be administered if needed in accordance with standard institutional guidelines.  
IMG -7289 Dosing:   Through the use of dose titration, the dose of IMG -7289 will be adjusted for  
each patient to that dose that provides sufficient exposure to safely inhibit thrombopoiesis for a fraction of the dosing cycle (designated as the D
pi). 
Initial Treatment Period (ITP) : 
All patients will be treated daily, for up to 169 days of dosing. Treatment will begin on Day 1 at the starting dose  (D
s) of 0.6 mg/kg QD.  Details on the selection and rationale for the starting 
dose and dosing schedule can be found in  Sections 3.6.[ADDRESS_515682] of the patient.  Up- titrations will be made in increments of 
0.2 mg/kg/d, and down -titrations in decrements of 0.1 or 0.15 mg/kg/d.

GUIDELINES:  These guidelines are for use by [CONTACT_737], study staff and patient to 
safeguard patient safety while maintaining data integrity.  
1. In general, supportive care (transfusions, administration of anti- fungals, etc.) should be 
maintained in accordance with institutional policy.   
2. Patients taking medications with  the potential to induce or inhibit CYP 3A4 or CYP 2D6 should 
be monitored closely for potenti al effects of co- administration; particular attention should be 
given to anti -infectives in the azole  class.  
3. Cessation of IMG -7289 is invariably associated with a rebound in thrombopoiesis  and platelet 
counts may easily exceed the  baseline value . When IMG -7289 is discontinued, the platelet count  
should be monitored closely  and an alternative cytoreductive therapy to lower platelets should 
commence within 24 -48 h ours. 
Management of Study Toxicities:   Adverse event intensity will be evaluated using the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5, published 27 November 2017. Please refer to Section 8.2  for additional detail on management of 
study toxicities, including reduction of the starting dose based on dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ). 
Definitions : 
Hematologic Toxicity: Hematologic values outside of the normal reference range are inherent features of MPNs and are expected effects of many therapeutic attempts to manage these diseases. The effects of IMG -7289 on normal myeloid hematopoiesis observed in  non- clinical and 
clinical studies are expected; these are pharmacodynamic effects of LSD1 inhibition by [CONTACT_374734] -7289, 
thus are not regarded as adverse. These events, with the exceptions below, will not be considered DLTs.

Page 19 of 88  Dose limiting toxicity (DLT): Any one  of the following AEs that occurs through Day 7 of the Initial 
Treatment Period and is considered by [CONTACT_110515], probably or definitely 
related to IMG -7289 : 
• Any Grade 2 or above t hrombocytopenia associated with  clinically significant 
bleeding*  
• Any Grade 3 or above thrombocytopenia ; 
• Any Grade 4 or 5 non- hematologic  adverse event;  
• Any Grade 3 or above non -hematologic  adverse event with failure to recover to Grade 
2 within 7 days of drug cessation, with the following  exceptions:  
o nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that responds to standard medical care  
o aesthenia lasting less than 14  days  
• Any Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality unrelated to the underlying malignancy  (for 
example,  hyperkalemia is related to thrombocytosis  and would therefore n ot qualify 
as DLT ) and persisting greater than 24  hours.  
*Clinically significant bleeding is defined as an event that is life -threatening, cannot be controlled and/or 
results in hemodynamic instability.  
Patients who experience a DLT may have their dose adj usted downward if the Medical Monitor 
and Principal Investigator (PI) deem  it safe for the patient to continue on IMG -7289.  Any patient 
that experiences DLT that results in discontinuation of IMG -[ADDRESS_515689] the Imago medical monitor to discuss IMG -7289 dose modifications for th e 
management of clinically significant changes in platelets, neutrophil counts, or other hematologic parameters.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
IMG -7289 will be discontinued in the event of the following:  
• Post DLT, the Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_374684] -7289.  
• Post  dose  reduction  due to DLT,  the patient  fails  to demonstrate  significant  improvement  
within  21 days.  
• Post temporary interruption of IMG -7289 due to platelet counts below 50 k /μL (50 x  109/L), 
the patient's platelet counts don’t return to > 150 k/μL (150 x 109/L) within 21  days.

3.1 Background on the Disease to be Treated  
The BCR -ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a family of related neoplastic 
disorders of bone marrow.  The three main chronic BCR -ABL1 -negative MPNs are poly cythe mia vera 
(PV), essential thrombo cythe mia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).  The cardi nal clinical 
features of these disorders are increased red cell mass in PV, increased platelet count in ET, and bone 
marrow fibrosis in PMF.  The MPNs are clonal disorders arising most frequently from acquired 
(somatic) mutations in a multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell, resulting in abnormalities 
in red cell, granulocyte and platelet production often in association with marrow fibrosis and 
extramedullary hematopoiesis and, in some cases evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  
ET is an indolen t hematologic cancer characterized by [CONTACT_408859], thrombocytosis, 
elevated cytokines, an increased rate of thrombosis and bleeding and the potential to develop 
myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia ( Vannucchi et al. , 2017 ). Transformation to post -ET 
myelofibrosis and post -ET acute leukemia occurs at a rate of 4 –11% and 2.1 –5.3% at 15 years, 
respectively ( Cerquozzi and Tefferi, 2015 ).  Risk factors for poor survival include age over 60, 
leukocytosis, and a prior history of thr ombosis ( Barbui et al ., 2012 ).  Indications for pharmacologic 
treatment in ET include extreme thrombocytosis, elderly age, JAK2V617F  mutational status, and history 
of thrombosis or presence of cardiovascular risk factors ( Rumi et al ., 2017 ).  There are no specific 
treatments for ET.  Treatments principally manage symptoms but do not alter the natural history of 
the disease ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_174105] 201 7).  Standard first -line pharmacologic treatment to reduce thrombocytosis is 
hydroxyurea (HU)  which has a low incidence of acute toxicity but is regarded by [CONTACT_408860].  
However, approximately 20 -25% of ET patients will be resistant or intolerant of HU per ELN criteria 
and treatment with HU has been demonstrated to worsen symptom burden ( Sever et al., 2014; Geyer 
et al.,  2015 ). Low -dose pegylated interferon -α2a early in the course of the disease reduces 
splenomegaly and can produce molecular remissions but is associated with cytopenias and neurotoxocities and is not approved for this indication in many countries (Kiladjian et al ., 2008) .   
Thus, there remains unmet need  for therapeutic interventions that reduce thrombocytosis and 
improve symptom burden  in patients with ET.  
3.2 Background on the Drug Target  
LSD1, also known as KDM1A, is an enzyme that  removes mono - and dimethyl groups from histone 
(H) H3 at critical lysines (K), K4 and K9
 (Shi et al. , 2004 ).  Methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K9 is 
a post -translational modification associated with changes in the  confirmation of chromatin 
(Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011 ; Beisel and Paro, 2011 ).  Chromatin is collecti ve term for the 
associati on of nuclear macromolecules consisting of DNA, protein scaffolding, enzymes enhancing 
transcription and synthesis of RNA (Kornberg, 1974) .  The DNA and its protein scaffold of histones 
form a n ordered complex called the nucleosome.   Each nucleosome is composed of two copi[INVESTIGATOR_408846], H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, forming an octamer around which DNA is 
wrapped.  The rates of gene transc ription are heavily influenced by [CONTACT_408861]

Kouzarides, 2011; Beisel and Paro, 2011) . 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408847], the DNA bases such as cytosine or RNA, changes that do not alter the actual DNA seq uence 
(Bird, 2002) .  Enzymes that modify these substrates by [CONTACT_374747][INVESTIGATOR_374690].  Histone and nucleic acid modifications provide binding 
sites for proteins and components of the transcriptiona l machinery that affect transcriptional gene 
silencing or activation  (Kouzarides, 2007) .  Histone modifications include acetylation (Ac), 
methylation (Me), phosphorylation (Ph) and ubiquitination (Ub).  By [CONTACT_408862], L SD1 is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_374691].  The primary therapeutic effects of 
LSD1 inhibition in the treatment of essential thrombocythemia come from the down regulation of 
megakaryopo iesis and thrombopoiesis, functions that require LSD1 activity.   
LSD1 is localized to specific sites in the genome through the agencies of proteins that bind DNA 
directly, generally transcription factors (TFs)  (Whyte  et al. , 2012 ; Whyte  et al. , 2013 ).  Many TFs, both 
activat ors such as V- Myb Avian Myeloblastosis Viral Oncogene Homolog (MYB) and steroid hormone 
receptors, as well as repressors such as growth factor independence 1 transcription repressor (GFI1) and RE -1 silencing transcription factor (REST), recruit LSD1 to spe cific genomic locations (Metzger  
et al. , 2005 ; Saleque et al. , 2007 ; Lin et al. , 2010 ).  LSD1 is part of a larger protein complex, containing, 
e.g., Co -RE-1 silencing transcription factor (CoREST) or nucleosome remodeling and histone 
deacetylase (NuRD), which dictates the cell-  and site -specific chromatin remodeling
 (Lee et al. , 2005 ; 
Foster  et al. , 2010 ).  These complexes may also include DNA methytransferase 1 (DNMT1) and 
histone deacetylases 1, 2 and 3 (HDAC1, 2, and 3) activities all of which contribute to maintaining or 
modifying the epi[INVESTIGATOR_408848] (Shi et al. , 2005 ; Orkin and Hochedlinger, 
2011 ).  Thus, an important property of LSD1 beyond its own enzymatic activity is its function as a 
scaffold for other proteins and epi[INVESTIGATOR_374693] -recruited to genomic sites.  Likewise, 
LSD1 bound to specific sites precludes the binding of other factors that may influence transcription.  
LSD1 is unique among the many histone demethylases in that it coordinates flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to oxidatively remove one or two methyl groups, in the process producing H
2O2 
and formaldehyde.   As such , FAD is an essential co -factor for LSD1 activity (Shi et al. , 2004 ).  The 
other 34 histone lysine demethylases, collective ly termed the Jumonji demethylases, employ an iron -
dependent mechanism to remove methyl groups from histone lysines ( Klose  et al. , 2006 ).  
LSD1  is an essential gene; loss of LSD1 activity leads to early embryonic leth ality (Wang  et al. , 2009 ; 
Foster  et al. , 2010 ).  The protein is also needed for regulating the balance between self -renewal and 
proliferation (Wang  et al. , 2007 ).  A conditional in vivo  LSD1  knockdown (KD) using a doxycycline -
inducible short hairpin LSD1  (shLSD1 ) established LSD1 as a central regulator of hem atopoietic stem 
cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells ( Sprussel  et al. , 2012 ). An inducible LSD1  KD resulted in profound 
but reversible thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia and anemia; monocyte numbers were increased  as 
mono poiesis does not require LSD1 activity .  LSD1  KD for 27 days led to an increase in circulating 
multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and HSCs with a concomitant down -regulation of chemokine (C -X-C 
motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) without affecting the size of the quiescent long -term HSC pool (Sprussel  et 
al., 2012 ).

IMG -7289    09Sep 2020   
Page 22 of 88  LSD1 plays a key role in regulating the progression from pluripotency to terminal differentiation and 
balancing self- renewal and proliferation ( Adamo  et al. , 2011 ; Wang et al. , 2007; Whyte  et al. , 2012 ).   
LSD1 is recruited to “high confidence” promoters and super -enhancers of genes essential for normal 
development by [CONTACT_941] “master” transcription factors octamer -binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), 
SRY (sex determining r egion Y) -box 2  (SOX2), Nanog and the co -activator Mediator.  Though not 
essential for maintenance of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state, as part of the NuRD complex, LSD1 
“decommissions” enhancers of genes maintaining the pluripotency program allowing ESC  to 
differentiate.  LSD1 is essential for the complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program as 
cells transition to more differentiated cell states (Whyte  et al. , 2012 ).  The role LSD1 plays in ESC s is 
phenomenologically similar to the essential role LSD1 plays during myeloid hem atopoiesis, in which 
enhanc ers active in HSCs generating a stem- cell gene expression signature [CONTACT_374804] 
“decommissioned”, allowing commitment of progenitors to specific myeloid lineages (Lara -Astiaso  et 
al., 2014 ).  Enhancers essential for terminal myeloid differentiation in lineage -specific progenitor 
cells, the so -called de novo  enhancers, must be poised for activation by [CONTACT_374749] H3K4me1 
marks.  As progenitors commit to differentiation, LSD1 is down -regulated dramatically allowing de 
novo  enhancers and promoters to be stably activated with progres sive methyl or acetyl additions on 
H3K4 and H3K27, respectively ( Lara -Astiaso  et al. , 2014 ).    
3.3 Background on LSD1 in Myeloid Neoplasia and Essential Thrombocythe mia  
Over -expression of LSD1  messenger RNA (mRNA) and excess LSD1 protein have been observed in 
many tumo r types, including poorly -differentiated neuroblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, 
Ewing’s sarcoma, AML, neuroendocrine carcinomas and epi[INVESTIGATOR_408849], prostate, 
bladder, small cell lung and colon cancers (Metzger et al. , 2005; Kahl et al. , 2006; Schulte et al. , 2009; 
Lim  et al. , 2010) .  In MPN s, LSD1 was over -expressed mainly in megakaryocytes and  erythroid 
precursors and to a lesser degree in early myeloid cells (Niebel et al ., 2014) . Treatment of various 
tumo r types in culture with LSD1 inhibitors (LSDi) has been reported to inhibit tumo r growth, reduce 
their potential for migration and invasion, reduce clonogenic potential and eliminate cancer stem cells, induce markers of differentiation appropriate to the cell lineage, and induce apoptosis
 
(Somervaille and Cleary, 2006 ; Somervaille  et al. , 2009 ; Harris  et al. , 2012 ; Zhang  et al. , 2013 ).  In 
various models of mouse leukem ia, treatment with LSD1 inhibitors induced monocytic markers of 
differentiation, reduced clonogenic potential of leukem ia initiating cells (LICs), and induced cell 
death (Harris  et al. , 2012 ).   
LSD1 activity is pr esent in a high proportion of malignant myeloid blasts cells (Lin et al. , 2011 ;  
Rhodes  et al. , 2007 ; Wouters  et al. , 2009 ).  LSD1 gene expression is among the highest in 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_374695]/progenitor populations of myeloid neoplastic cells (Goardon  et al. , 
2011 ; Somervaille  et al. , 2009 ; Harris  et al. , 2012 ).   
LSD1 may play a direct role in regulating pathogenic signaling from the activated JAK- STAT pathway.  
The JAK -STAT signaling pathway is activ ated by [CONTACT_374750], JAK2  and CALR  
via the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5, transcription factors that activate specific sets of genes 
with pleiotropic effects (Chen and Mullally, 2014) .  STAT3 activity as a transcription factor is 
modulated by [CONTACT_408863] (K140) and is one of many reported non -histone substrates for 
08HHB7

IMG- 7289    09Sep2020   
Page 23 of 88  LSD1 (Yang et al ., 2010) .   
Proof -of-concept studies of the therapeutic activity of LSD1 inhibition were performed in well 
established , pre-clinical mouse mo dels of MPNs  (Jak2V617F , MplW515L ).  Compared to mice treated with 
vehicle, LSD1 inhibition (LSDi) in MplW515L  mice markedly suppressed myeloproliferation reducing 
granulocyte and platelet counts, thus establishing therapeutic efficacy . Spleen weights in treated 
animals showed a dose -proportional decrease.  Histopathological analysis of bone marrow and 
spleen confirmed a marked reduction in myeloproliferation, as well as a reversal of extramedullary 
hem atopoiesis (EMH).  Most notably, there was near -complete resolution of reticulin fibrosis in the 
bone marrow in the LSDi treatment arm.  LSD1 inhibition had a significant impact on serum inflammatory cytokine concentrations as exemplified by a very marked reduction in the plasma concentrati on of the Chemokine (C -X-C Motif) Ligand 5
 (Cxcl5 or IL -8 in humans ), a key participant 
in the pathologic inflammatory state of MPN.   
LSD1 inhibition also reduced the mutant cell burden.  In mice treated with vehicle, 74.6% of 
circulating cells were  green fluorescent protein cell -positive (GFP+), while only 43.2% of circulating 
cells were GFP+ in LSDi -treated mice.  Flow cytometry analysis of spleen and bone marrow revealed 
reduced numbers of CD11b+/Gr1+ myeloid cells and CD41+ megakaryocytes.   The n umbers of mutant 
GFP+ myeloid cells and megakaryocytes in these tissues were also significantly reduced by [CONTACT_408864].  The decrease in platelet counts and mutant clone burden, and the resolution of fibrosis 
after 28 days of LSD1 inhibition supports targeting LSD1 in patients with MPN.  
3.5 Potential Clinical Risks and Benefits when Treating with an LSD1 Inhibitor  
The treatment effects with an LSD1 inhibitor (LSDi) are distinct from treatment with standard cytotoxic agents or with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors.   LSD1 inhibition has specific effects on each  
myeloid lineages.  LSD1 activity is needed for the differentiation of progenitors to red cells, platelets

cellular composition in the marrow  and the morphology of these cells.  Likewise, distribution of  blood 
cells based on lineage is also affected with an increase  in the production of monocytes and a 
decreasing in  the other myeloid cell types ; the production of platelets appears to be more sensitive 
to LSD1 inhibition and red cell production the least.  There is no evidence to suggest that inhibition 
of LSD1 has any effect on the proper function of platelets or neutrophils.  In the treatment of ET , the 
intent is not to inhibit LSD1 completely ; the treatment thesis is to titrate drug exposure to that which 
lowers platelets into the desired range.  The sensitivity to a given exposure of IMG -7289 in ET  
patients, however, may be variable and understanding that dose -response is one of the objective s of 
this study.  
The morphologic and clinical pathology changes may not be familiar to clinicians and 
hematopathologists.    As such, there is potential for confusion in the interpretation of peripheral 
hem atologic parameters and the morphology of bone m arrow cells.  Outlined below are some of the 
anticipated clinical scenarios that might be observed in ET  patients treated with IMG -7289 based on 
non- clinical and clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_408865]1:  
1. With complete  pharmacologic inhibition of LSD1, the red cell, platelet and neutrophil counts can 
be expected to decrease as a function of the lifespan of each cell type, that is, with zero order 
kinetics; hence, a linear decrease over time.  Hum an platelets circulate for an average of seven to 
ten days; if LSD1 were to be inhibited completely, the platelet count would be predicted to fall 
below 10 x 109/L (10  k/µL) within a week.  The time to observe these drug -induced effects on 
blood cell production may be less for a patient starting out with a lower granulocyte or red cell 
mass or platelet count.  In this study , the goal is to safely reduce platelet production.  
Notwithstanding, as thrombopoiesis appears most sensitive to LSD1 inhibition, severe 
thrombocytopenia represents the greatest clinical risk.  
2. The effects of LSD1 inhibition on normal hematopoiesis are fully reversible.  IMG -[ADDRESS_515690] as early as  24-48 hours.  ( N.B. Platelet counts, as well as granulocyte counts, can 
exceed baseline values after several days -to-weeks  of no drug exposure, owing , in part , to the rise 
in the plasma concentration of growth factors such as GM -CSF and thrombopoietin that 
accompanies LSD1 inhibition. )     
3. Cessation of IMG -7289 is invariably associated with a rebound in thrombopoiesis , hence platelet 
counts may easily exceed  the baseline value .  When IMG -7289 is discontinued , the platelet  count  
should be monitored closely  and an alternative cytoreductive  therapy to lower platelets should 
commence within 24 -48 hours  after the cessation of IMG -7289 .   
4. As a consequence of inhibition of LSD1 in both rat and dog, megakaryocytes appear dysplastic and form syncytia in proportion to the degree of  LSD1 inhibition.  Platelet volumes also increase 
dramatically as LSD1 inhibition reaches a maximum and platelet counts fall .  These effects are 
reversible after cessation of drug exposure.

Page 27 of 88  4 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES  
This trial will study the effects of IMG -7289, an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme LSD1 as a 
treatment of essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is an indolent hematologic cancer characterized 
by [CONTACT_408859], thrombocytosis, elevated cytokines, and increased rates of thrombosis and bleeding that can evolve to myelofibrosis and/or acute myeloid leukemia. LSD1 is an enzyme that regulates the maturation of megakaryocytes from progenitor cells, as well as the function of mature megakaryocytes. In ET, acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells cause JAK/STAT activation which results in an over -abundance of activated megakaryocytes that in turn produce an 
excess of platelets, growth factors and inflammatory cytokines.  
4.1 Hypothesis  
IMG- 7289 is a safe and tolerable orally available agent when administered to patients with ET ; 
inhibition o f LSD1 by [CONTACT_374734] -7289 will reduce both the number of megakaryocytes and their capacity 
to secrete growth factors and inflammatory cytokines to the clinical benefit of patients with ET . 
4.2 Objectives  
The following primary and exploratory objectives will be evalua ted in patients with essential 
thrombo cythe mia (ET)  treated with IMG -7289:  
4.2.1  Primary  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Reduction of platelet counts to ≤ 400 k /μL (400 x 10
9/L) in the absence of new thromboembolic 
events

5.1 Overview  
This is a Phase 2 multi -center, open -label study evaluating the safety, efficacy and 
pharmacodynamics  of IMG -7289 administered orally once daily  in patients with essential 
thrombo cythe mia (ET).    
The therapeutic goal for the treatment of ET is to inhibit the activity of LSD1 in hematopoietic cells 
for only a fraction of the [ADDRESS_515691] received IMG -7289 to date.  Using all of the information available in conjunction  
with the therapeutic goal for the treatment of ET , an IMG -7289 starting dose of 0.6 mg/kg QD has 
been selected .  Refer to Section 3.[ADDRESS_515692]  (SAB) will perform reviews at least quarterly of 
safety parameters and pharmacodynamic markers to draw conclusions around the safety and pharmacodynamic effect of IMG -7289.  The SAB  will also review patient dose titrations and may 
recommend adjustments.  
This study consists of two treatment periods:  The Initial Tre atment Period (ITP), followed by [CONTACT_408866] (ATP).  In the ITP, patients will be treated daily for 169 days.  In the ATP, which is iterative, treatment may continue  for an additional 169 days in those patients deriving 
clinical benefit  (defined as not meeting “ progressive disease ” criteria as per Appendix  16.5) and 
safely tolerating IMG -7289; this definition applies throughout the document and will not be repeated 
with each reference to clinical benefit) , as determined by [CONTACT_079].   
All patients will undergo follow -up period visits, including an End -of-Treatment (EoT) visit on the 
day of last dose  or as soon as possible thereafter, a pre- End -of-Study (EoS) visit approximately [ADDRESS_515693] dose, and an  End -of-Study (EoS) visit approximately [ADDRESS_515694] dose.  Patients that do 
not enter the ATP, or discontinue early, will undergo follow -up beginning with an E oT visit . 
Patients will be followed closely throughout the study for both Adverse Events (AEs) and signs of toxicity by [CONTACT_408856].  Efficacy and 
pharmacodynamic effects will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_408867], and requisite bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99193].  T hroughout dosing, 
transfusions may be administered  if needed  in accordance with standard institutional guidelines.

Page 29 of 88  5.1.1  Initial Treatment Period  
Through the use of dose titration, the dose of IMG -7289 will be adjusted in each patient to that dose 
that provides sufficient exposure to safely inhibit thrombopoiesis for a fraction of the dosing cycle 
(designated as the D pi).  Treatment will begin on Day 1 at the IMG- 7289 Ds of 0.6  mg/kg QD  for all 
patients , with dose -titrati on contingent on the comparison of  hem atology values from the prior visit .  
Up-titration s may begin on ITP Day [ADDRESS_515695] of the 
patient.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
D
uring the ITP, patients will initially return for study assessments every other week (bi-weekly) for 
the first 12 weeks (ITP Days 15, 29, 43 , 57, 71 and 85) and then monthly for 12  weeks (ITP Days 113, 
141 and 169). It is anticipated that by [CONTACT_10585] 12 (Day 85) the majority of patients will have achieved a 
stable dose . For safety purposes, bi-weekly visits may continue at the PI’s discretion post Day 85 if 
necessary.  On Day 169 bone marrow sampling is also required. Additionally, at the Day 169 visit a 
‘qualification’ assessment will be made to determine whether the patient is deriving clinical benefit and safely tolerating IMG -7289. For the patients who qualify for entry into the ATP, transition should 
occu r without interruption in dosing. Patients not deriving clinical benefit will discontinue IMG -7289 
and undergo End of Treatment (EoT), pre -End of Study (pre -EoS) and End of Study (EoS) visits.  
5.1.2  Additional Treatment Period (ATP) for Qualifying Patients Only  
In the ATP, treatment may continue for an additional 169 days in those patients deriving clinical benefit, as determined by [CONTACT_079] .   For the purposes of clarity and efficiency, rather 
than continuing to present chronological days/ week s, visits are presented as ‘ATP Day 1’, followed 
by, ‘ATP Days 29, 57, 85’, etc.  Qualifying patients will ‘re- start’ IMG -7289 on ATP Day 1, with dose 
titration continuing as per the Titration Rules table (Section 7 .2.3); there should be no interruption 
in dosing (Day 169 = Day 1 of the next ATP).  A dditional dose -titration may occur in consultation with 
the Medical Monitor.   
Qualifying patients will return for study assessments monthly (ATP Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141 and 
169). It is anticipated that patients continuing in the ATP will have already achieved a stable dose, with every other week visits no longer necessary. For safety purp oses, every other week visits may 
continue at the PI’s discretion, if necessary. On Day 169 of every other ATP (i.e., ATP 2, 4, etc.), the 
equivalent of yearly , patients will undergo bone marrow sampling. A t the Day 169 visit, a 
‘qualification’ assessment will be made to determine whether the patient is continuing to derive

6 STUDY POPULATION 
6.1 Study Entry Criteria  
For purposes of eligibility, the following definitions apply:  
• A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche 
and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation 
methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559].  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhoea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_31657].
 
• Abstinence is defin ed as refraining from heterosexual intercourse.   True abstinence, when this is 
in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject is permitted. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration o f abstinence for the 
duration of exposure to IP, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_515696] meet all of the applicable criteria to be eligible for enrollment in this study:  
1. Age ≥  18 years.  
2. Diagnosis of Essential Thrombocythemia per World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic 
criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms ( Arber et al ., 2016 ). 
3. Patients who have failed at least one standard therapy ( failure is the equivalent of inadequate 
response o r intolerance).  European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria for intolerance / resistance 
to hydroxyurea ( Appendix 16.8 ) may be used in association with Investigator discre tion.  
Ruxolitinib refractor iness or intoleran ce will be left to the discretion of the Investigator.  
4. Requires treatment in order to lower platelet count s based on  patient age over 60 or history of 
thrombosis . 
5. Platelet count >  450 k /μL (450  x 109/L) pre-dose Day  1. 
6. Peripheral blast count < 1% pre -dose Day  1. 
7. ANC ≥  0.5 x 109/L pre -dose Day  1. 
8. Fibrosis Score < grade 2, as per a slightly modified version ( Arber et al ., 2016 ) of the European 
Consensus Criteria for Grading Myelofibrosis (Thiele et al ., 2005 ).

2.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT is defined as a ny one of the f ollowing  AEs that occurs through Day 8 of the ITP and is considered 
by [CONTACT_110515], probably or definitely related to IMG -7289: 
• Any Grade 2 or above t hrombocytopenia associated with  clinically significant bleeding*  
• Any Grade 3 or above thrombocytopenia ; 
• Any Grade 4 or 5 non- hem atologic  adverse event ;  
• Any Grade 3 or above non- hem atologic  adverse event with failure to recover to Grade 2 within 7 
days of drug cessation , with the follo wing exceptions:  
o nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that responds to standard medical care  
o aesthenia lasting less than 14 days  
• Any Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality unrelated to the underlying malignancy  (for example , 
hyperkalemia is related to thrombocytosis  and would therefore not qualify as DLT ) and 
persisting greater than 24 hours.   
*Clinically significant bleeding is defined as an event  that is life -threatening, cannot be controlled and/or 
results in hem odynamic instability.  
Patients who experience DLT will have their dose adjusted downward if the Medical Monitor and 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_374683] -7289.  Any patient that 
experiences DLT that results in discontinuation of IMG -[ADDRESS_515705]  MPN -SAF 
 MPN- SAF is to be completed by [CONTACT_408868].  The MPN- SAF  will be 
completed during Screening ( as close to Day - 7 as possible), pre -
Dose Day 1 and  weekly from Day 7 through the EoS Visit.  Ideally, 
the MPN -SAF will be completed at the same time and day each 
week for consistency.  On visit days, the MPN -SAF should be 
completed prior to the study visit, and if the patient arrives 
without a completed MPN -SAF, then it will be completed during 
the visit and collected prior to the patient departing.  Importantly, multiple MPN -SAF forms will need to be provided to the patient 
for completion between visits, during each ‘off week’ .  Date of 
completion should be documented on each MPN -SAF completed.

11 SAFETY  
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of patients enrolled in this study.   
Once an Investig ator determines a patient is a treatment failure (see Section 6.8) or if the patient is 
withdrawn from treatment early due to a Dose Limiting Toxicity, the patient should discontinue 
study treatment and undergo follow -up period visits beginning with EoT (see Section 9.6.1 ).   
11.[ADDRESS_515711] IMG -7289 dose.  Female 
patients wi ll be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they become pregnant; male 
patients will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover that their sexual 
partner is pregnant.  Pregnancy data during the study will be report ed in an expedited manner using 
the Pregnancy Report Form and following the SAE reporting process (see Section 11.2.4 ).  It will be 
necessary to co llect detailed information on the course of any pregnancy occurring in a patient on 
study, including pregnancies in the partners of male patients, assuming consent to do so is provided.  
If the outcome and/or a complication of the pregnancy meets serious c riteria (i.e., miscarriage or 
congenital anomaly/birth defect), then it should be reported as an SAE using the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnant patients will discontinue study medication for the duration of the pregnancy.  The 
pregnancy will be followed by [CONTACT_408872] (SRM).   
All patients will be encouraged to discuss contraception and pregnancy concerns with their physician 
in advance of becomi ng pregnant.  Full disclosure of a patient’s participation in this study to their 
general practitioner is strongly recommended.  
11.[ADDRESS_515712] dose of IMG -7289 through to the End of Study Visit 
(scheduled at [ADDRESS_515713] IMG -7289 dose).  Adverse event recording will continue for patients 
who discontinue s tudy treatment early but remain in follow -up, until their End of Treatment, Pre-
End of Study and End of Study Visits have been completed.  
Note: Any medical event which occurs from the time of Informed Consent but prior to dosing with 
IMG -[ADDRESS_515714] still be documented in the patient’s medical notes and will be recorded on the 
appropriate medical history eCRF pages.  In the [LOCATION_006] only , serious AEs (SAEs) will be recorded from 
time of consent.  
Adverse events will be recorded on designated eCRF pages. Each AE is to be characterised (i.e., 
verbatim term) and information provided regarding its seriousness, start and stop dates, intensity, 
outcome, and causal relationship with the study drug .  
An AE is any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect exper ienced by a patient during 
participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of the drug or biologic, whether 
or not product -related.  This includes any untoward signs or symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_374771] -7289 until completion of the study.

IMG -7289    09Sep 2020   
Page 55 of 88  Adverse events may include, but are not limited to:  
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_5363]/or 
observed by [CONTACT_204418]  
• Findings at physical examinations  
• Laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance  
It is important Investigators record accurate AE terms in the eCRFs.  Wherever possible, a specific 
disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs, symptoms or laboratory parameter will 
be identified by [CONTACT_408873].  However, if an observed or reported sign, 
symptom or laboratory parameter is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], or is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], it should be recorded as a separate AE in the eCRF.  
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of the investigational product are not  considered AEs after treatment unless  they reoccur after the patient 
has recovered from the preexisting condition or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204377] a clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency.   
Clinical significance is defined as any variation in signs,  symptoms, or testing that has medical 
relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care.  The Investigator will continue to monitor 
the patient until the assessment returns to Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow -
up is no long er medically necessary.  
11.2.1  Adverse Event Intensity  
Adverse event intensity will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5, published 27 November 2017 . For AEs 
not included in the NC I CTCAE, the Investigator will be required to assess the intensity of the adverse 
drug/biologic experience using the following categories and associated guidelines:   
Grade  Guideline  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL*  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
Note 1: A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
Note 2: Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet,  taking 
medications, and not bedridden.

Page 56 of 88  11.2.2  Adverse Event Relatedness  
The Investigator will make a judgment regarding whether or not, in his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE was 
related to study drug.  The Investigator will also evaluate any changes in laboratory values, m ake a 
determination as to whether the change is clinically significant, and whether or not the change(s) were related to study drug.  However, even if the Investigator feels there is no relationship to the 
study drug, the AE or clinically significant labor atory abnormality MUST  be recorded in the eCRF.  
Below are guidelines for relationship assessment:  
• Unrelated: There was no relationship of the adverse event to the use of the drug or 
biologic. This may include, but is not limited, to the adverse experience being an expected outcome of a previously existing or concurrent disease, concomitant medication o r 
procedure the subject experienced during their treatment period.  
• Remote/Unlikely: Adverse events which are judged probably not related to the drug or biologic.  
• Possible: There was no clear relationship of the adverse event to the use of the drug or 
biologic; however, one cannot definitively conclude that there was no relationship.  
• Probable: While a clear relationship to the drug or biologic cannot be established, the event is associated with an expected adverse event (per the current Investigator 
Brochu re or SAB findings) or there is no other medical condition or intervention which 
would explain the occurrence of such an experience.  
• Definite: The relationship of the use of the drug or biologic to the experience is considered definitively established.  
If a causal relationship is considered probable, possible, or definite by [CONTACT_226112] 
(dependent on the regional reporting requirements) , the AE is considered to be “related” for 
purposes of regulatory reporting. If a causal relationship is c onsidered remote/unlikely or unrelated, 
the AE is considered “unrelated” for purposes of regulatory reporting.   
11.2.[ADDRESS_515715] dose (time of consent for [LOCATION_006] patients) 
through the End of Study Visit (scheduled for approximately [ADDRESS_515716] IMG -7289 dose) or  
until the Investigator and Imago BioSciences determine that follow -up is no longer necessary.  
Serious adverse events that are suspected to be drug related will be reported even if they occur when 
the patient is no longer on the study.   
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
Death  
Life -threatening experience . Any adverse event that places the patient, in the view of the reporter, 
at immediate risk of d eath from the adverse event as it occurred, i.e., does not include an adverse 
event that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]¥. The adverse event resulted in an initial 
08HHB7
Imago BioSciences,  Inc.  Protocol IMG -[ADDRESS_515717], a period of normal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408851]. Hosp italiz ations longer than this 
period will be prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192193].  
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . An adverse event that resulted in a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Congenital Anomaly. The exposure of the patient to the drug or biologic during pregnancy that is 
judged to have resulted in the congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events . Adverse events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193900] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardise the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Important medical events or  interventions 
may be considered an SAE based upon medical judgment  of the Investigator.   
11.2.4  Reporting Serious Adver se Events  
SAEs will be reported promptly, using the SAE Report Form, once the Investigator determines that 
the event meets the protocol definition of an SAE.  The Investigator or designee will report the SAE within 24 hours of his/her becoming aware of th ese events regardless of relationship of the 
SAE to the use of study drug , in accordance with the instructions in the Study Reference Manual. 
The Investigator will always provide an assessment of relatedness at the time of the initial report as 
described i n Section 11.2.[ADDRESS_515718] all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive 
additional information before reporting the SAE. Th e SAE Report will be updated when additional 
information is received within 24 hours of receipt of such information . 
Important:   For fatal and life -threatening events, the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_35857].  A death occurring during  the study or information related to such occurrence that 
comes to the attention of the Investigator during the study must be reported immediately to the Sponsor.  A  detailed SAE reporting procedure  and contact [CONTACT_408874] (SRM)  and provided to the site  before any patients are consented.  
Additionally, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) and Human 
Research Ethics Committee (HREC), as applicable, must be notified in writing of any SAEs that require 
expedited reporting to Regulatory Authorities.  Depending upon regional requirements, it is the 
responsibility of either the Investigator or Imago BioSciences to notify the IRB/ IEC/HREC.  All SAEs 
meeting expedited reporting requirements will be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies by

13.4 Study o r Site Termination  
The End -of-Trial date is considered to be the date of Database Lock.  
If Sponsor, an Investigator, or regulatory authorities discover conditions during the study that 
indicate that the study or related activities at a particular site sho uld be terminated, this action may 
be taken after appropriate consultation between Sponsor and the Investigator.  Conditions that may warrant study or site termination include but are not limited to:  
1. The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studie s indicates a potential health 
hazard to patients  
2. Patient recruitment is unsatisfactory  
3. Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
4. Investigator(s) do not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study  
5. GCP is not being maintained or adequately followed  
6. Administrative reasons  
7. Reasons unrelated to the study.  
Study or site termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the conditions set forth 
in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 312 and/or other national and local regulations, as applicable, and in compliance with the principles set forth in International Council on Harmonisation

Page 64 of 88  review. Centralized monitoring is t he remote, cross -functional review and evaluation of 
accumulating in-house data conducted by [CONTACT_374783], central monitor associate s, medical 
directors, the clinical team, and biostatisticians. The  review of data within and across sites 
proactively identifies missing or inconsistent data, data trends, systematic or significant errors and 
enables site performance characteristics to be analyzed. Remote data review is intended to 
encompass as many acti vities performed in a routine on -site monitoring visit as is functionally 
possible, and as permitted by [CONTACT_408878].  The remote review of data may be actioned via multiple pathways, often contingent on site’s capabilities.  Remote data review, specifically, has 
become critically important in the COVID -[ADDRESS_515722] ing patient 
safety, while also minimizing risks to trial data integrity and facilitat ing GCP compliance .  Note : 
Remove data review will only be implemented in [LOCATION_013] in times of increased safety measures such 
as the COVID -[ADDRESS_515723] facilities and records relevant to this study.  
Imago BioSciences or its designee will monitor the study.  Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_408879] ( monitor s) who will review the eCRFs and source documents.  
The monitors will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and 
regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_54665] (letter, email, telephone, and fax). The 
monitor/representative of Imago will perform an Investigator Site File review to confirm all 
documents required to reconstr uct the conduct of the clinical trial are present.  The ISF supports the 
validity of the research, as well as the conduct and integrit y of the data collected, and needs to be 
maintained by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and inspection ready at all times.  
All unused study materials are to be returned to Imago BioSciences or its designee after the clinical 
period of the trial has been com pleted, or be disposed of at the site according to institutional policies 
but not prior to the approval of the Sponsor and with appropriate documentation.

Diagnostic Criteria for Essential Thrombo cythe mia† (WHO 2016)  
Major criteria:  1. Platelet count ≥450 × 109/L 
2. BM biopsy showing proliferation mainly of the megakaryocyte lineage with increased numbers of enlarged, mature megakaryocy tes 
with hyperlobulated nuclei. No significant left- shift of neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis and very rarely minor (gra de 1) 
increase in reticulin fibersɸ 
 3. Not meeting WHO criteria for  BCR -ABL1+ CML, PV, PMF, MDS , or other myeloid neoplasms  
 4. Presence of  JAK2 , CALR , or MPL  mutation  
Minor criterion:   1. Presence of a clonal marker (e.g., abnormal karyotype) or absence of evidence for reactive thrombocytosis  
WHO indicates World Health Organization; PV, polycythemia vera; ET, essential thrombocythemia;  
PMF, primary myelofibrosis; CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome.  
† ET requires meeting all [ADDRESS_515737] three major criteria and one minor criterion.  
ɸGrading of BM fibers ( Thiele et al ., 2005 ) 
Criterion number 2 (BM biopsy) may not be required in cases with sustained absolute erythrocytosis: hemoglobin levels. 18.5 g /dL in men (hematocrit, 55.5%)  
or 16.5 g/dL in women (hematocrit, 49.5%) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present.  However, initial myelofibrosis (present in up to 20% of  
patients) can only be detected by [CONTACT_746] a BM biopsy; this finding may predict a more rapid progression to overt myelofib rosis (post- PV MF)  
 
16.3 Criteria for Grading Myelofibrosis (Arber et al. , 201 6)*  
Fibrosis grade  Definition  
MF-0 Scattered linear reticulin with no intersections (crossovers) corresponding to normal bone marrow  
MF-1 Loose network of reticulin with many intersections, especially in perivascular areas  
MF-2 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with focal bundles of thick fibers 
mostly consistent with collagen, and/or focal osteosclerosisa  
MF-3 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections and coarse bundles  of thick fibers consistent 
with collagen, usually associated with osteosclerosis a  
*Slighly modified from the European Consensus Criteria as presented in Thiele et al ., 2005 
Semiquantitative grading of BM fibrosis with minor modifications concerning collagen and osteosclerosis. Fibe r density should be assessed only in hematopoietic areas.   
aIn grades MF -2 or MF -3 an additional trichrome stain is recommended.

16.5 Revised Response Criteria for ET:  IWG -MRT and ELN Consensus 2013 (Barosi et al.,  2013)  
Response Categories  Criteria  
  
Complete Remission   
A Durable* resolution of disease -related signs including palpable hepatosplenomegaly, large 
symptoms improvement, † AND  
B Durable* peripheral blood count remission, defined as:  
platelet count ≤400 x 109/L, WBC count <10 x 109/L, absence of leukoerythroblastosis, AND  
C Without signs of progressive disease, and absence of any hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, AND  
D Bone marrow histological remission defined as disappearance of megakaryocyte hyperplasia and 
absence of >grade 1 reticulin fibrosis.  
  
Partial Remission   
A Durable* resolution of disease -related signs including palpable hepatosplenomegaly, and large 
symptoms improvement, AND  
B Durable* peripheral blood count remission, defined as:  
platelet count ≤400 x 109/L, WBC count <10 x 109/L, absence of leukoerythrob lastosis, AND  
C Without signs of progressive disease, and absence of any hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, AND  
D Without bone marrow histological remission, defined as the persistence of megakaryocyte 
hyperplasia.  
  
No Response  Any response that does not satisfy partial remission  
  
Progressive Disease  Transformation into PV, post -ET myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia‡ 
  
Molecular response is not required for assignment as complete response or partial response. Molecular response evaluation req uires 
analysis in peripheral blood granulocytes. Complete response is defined as eradication of a preexisting abnormality. Partial response 
applies only to patients with at least 20% mutant allele burden at baseline. Partial response is defined as ≥50% decrease in allele 
burden.  
WBC, white blood cell.  
*Lasting at least 12 wk.  
†Large symptom improvement (≥10 -point decrease) in MPN -SAF TSS.  
‡For the diagnosis of PV see World Health Organization criteria (WHO);  for the diagnosis of post -ET myelofibrosis, see the  
IWG -MRT criteria; for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia, see WHO criteria.

Version Date: January 29, 2018  1. STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES:  
 
Surgical procedures are an essential pi[INVESTIGATOR_44619] a dermatologist’s practice. In fact, it has been 
reported that dermatologists perform over [ADDRESS_132620] designed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_118840] (collagen powder)  in 
treating skin punch biopsy wounds. The objectives of the study are as follows:   
 
Primary objective:  
 
1. To evaluate  the effect of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  on complete wound healing using 
punch biopsy sites as an acute  full-thickness  human wound model  based on clinical 
wound closure . 
2. To evaluate the effect of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  on complete wound healing using 
punch biopsy sites as an acute full -thickness human wound model based on histology of 
wound site at [ADDRESS_132621] resulted in the development of 
advanced wound care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as collagen -based dressings, for use as adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118841].  
 
Collagen is a naturally occurring protein that comprises  three -quarters of the weight of human 
skin.3  Fibroblasts synthesize collagen molecules, which  are composed of three  polypeptide 
chains that together form a  triple -helical structure, allowing  covalent cross -linking and  formation 
of larger fibrils and fibers.4 Collagen’s unique structure makes it an essential component of the 
extracellular matrix ( ECM ), providing remarkable tensile strength and structural support to skin 
and other connective tissues.4–[ADDRESS_132622] degraded collagen 
fragments by [CONTACT_118860] . Furthermore,

Version Date: January 29, [ADDRESS_132623] and potential utility of topi[INVESTIGATOR_118842] (collagen powder)  on the rate and quality  of wound healing  in healthy volunteers  
using the punch biopsy method . After inducing a n acute full -thickness wound , the rate of 
complete healing of a wound treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_118843] (collagen powder)  will be 
compared to the rate of complete healing of a wound treated with primary closure with sutures , 
the current gold standard . Qualification and semi -quantification  of histologic and 
immunoh istochemical markers will be used to asses s the maturity and structural stability of the 
wound bed. Positive findings would suggest  that NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  may be capable 
of stimulating the healing of acute wounds in a similar or even superior manner to primary 
closure, suggesting collagen powder  may be used in place of sutures, and encourag ing further 
studies to characterize its therapeutic potential  in dermatologic surgery . 
 
3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
3.[ADDRESS_132624] been screened at the Department of Dermatology at the 
George Washington Medical Faculty Associates. Individuals taking part in the study will meet  
all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 3.2) . After completing 
the screening phase, subjects  will rece ive [ADDRESS_132625] study visit. Prior to dressing the wounds, 1  wound will be treated with primary closure, 
while the other will be treated with NuvagenTM (collagen powder) . Each wound will continue to 
be treated with the t reatment designate d in visit 1  (primary closure or collagen powder ) for the 
duration of the 12-week study. After visit 1 , patients will be provided with instructions and 
supply for daily self -administration of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  for the wound designated 
for collage n powder  treatment. Subjects will return weekly for 2 weeks, for suture removal  if 
needed , photographs, wound measuring, assessment of healing, assessment of adverse events, 
and determination for need of further treatment with NuvagenTM (collagen powder) . Subjects will 
then return at week [ADDRESS_132626] visit, 
and will be provided with similar treatment instructions as they were provided in week 1 . 
Patients will return in 2 weeks (visit 5) for suture removal, photographs, wound measuring, 
assessment of healing, assessment of adverse events, and determination for need of further 
treatment with NuvagenTM (collagen powder) . The last study visit will be a 6 week s after visit 5,

• Patients with other conditions considered by [CONTACT_118861] (e.g., acute illness or e xacerbation of chronic illness)  
• Patients with a known allergy or sensitivity to any component of the test medication 
(including bovin e and/or  collagen products)  or local anesthetic agent  used 
• Current or previous users of tobacco products  
• Recent a lcohol or drug abuse is evident  
6 
Version Date: January 29, 2018  • Pregnant females or nursing mothers. Eligible women of reproductive age will be 
required to have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. They will also be required 
to be on at least 1 reliable form of effective birth control [examples: barrier method 
(condoms, diaphragm), oral, injectable, implant birth control or abstinence ] during the 
course of this study and [ADDRESS_132627] be met prior to study entry  and enrollment.  
 
The patient’s first visit will comprise both screening and wounding. During the screening phase, 
after obtaining signed informed consent, subject’s personal data will be recorded. Data will 
include age, gender, medical and medication history and skin type.  The p hysical examination  
will be performed  and vital signs will be obtained. If the subject qualifies, visit [ADDRESS_132628] 1 area on each 
anterior, proximal thigh  of each volunteer where one 4 mm  punch biopsies will be performed. 
The 2 areas will be  cleansed using an alcohol swab , and anesthetized using 1 mL of 2% lidocaine 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. A n Inte gra Miltex  4.[ADDRESS_132629] Biopsy Punch  instrument will be used to 
create 2 full-thickness wounds, one on each thigh on each leg. Hemostasis will be obtained using  
Aluminum Chloride 20%, application of pressure, and gauze. Each wound will be  photographed  
with a measurement instrument and then cleaned with normal saline prior to treatment. One 
wound will be selected for treatment with collagen , while the  contralateral wound will undergo 
primary closure with sutures  (1-2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_118848], 4-0 ProleneTM Polypropylene Sutures , 
Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) . 
 
The wound selected for collagen treatment will receive 1 gram of topi[INVESTIGATOR_118843] (collagen 
powder)  directly on the wound with pressure applied using a dry gauze and forceps. Once 
hemostasis has occurred between 1 and 5 minutes later, the wound will be covered with a sterile 
dressing.  The other wound will undergo primary closure. Both punch biopsy sites  will be 
covered with a non -adherent dressing and a waterproof film dressing.  
 
The patient will be provided with a 2-week  supply of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  in 1-gram 
containers and dressings along with instructions. Instructions will detail the followi ng procedure: 
1) Irrigate the wound with tap water or saline solution, 2) Dry the wound with a dry gauze pad 
pat using gentle pressure, 3) Apply 1 gram of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  to the wound, and 4) 
Apply a sterile dressing which covers the entire wound. Assistance from a caregiver will be 
permitted in any instance in which this procedure is difficult for the patient to carry out for him 
or herself . This procedure is to be repeat ed daily for 2 weeks . On days of study visits, patients 
will be instructed to bring the day’s 1 gram of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  to the clinic for 
study coordinators to apply the corresponding day’s collagen treatment.  
 
7 
Version Date: January 29, 2018  One week after wounding, the patient will return for visit 2. Patients will perform the Patient 
Overall Assessment Score, wounds will be measured, photographs will be taken, and inquiry will 
be made about any possible adverse events.  The patient’s wound treat ed with collagen will then 
be treated and dressed in the office.  
 
One week after visit 2, the patient will retu rn for visit 3. Suture s will be removed, and the wound 
treated with collagen will be evaluated for further collagen treatment. The principal inve stigator 
will determine if another 2 weeks of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  treatment will be warranted.  
If further collagen treatment is advised, the patient will be provided with another 2-week supply 
of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  and dressings.  Patients will perform the Patient Overall 
Assessment Score, wounds will be measured, photographs will be taken, and inquiry will be 
made about any possible adverse events.  The wound treated with collagen will be treated and 
dressed in the o ffice.  
 
Two weeks after visit 3, the patient will return for visit 4. Both w ound sites will be photographed 
and then  biopsied again following the procedure from visit 1. Each wound will be treated 
identically (either with primary closure or with collagen p owder ) as it was in visit one . Patients 
will be provided with adequate supplies for at -home collagen treatment for 2 weeks.  Patients will 
perform the Patient Overall Assessment Score, wounds will be measured, photographs will be 
taken, and inquiry will be made about any possible adverse events.  
 
Two weeks after visit 4, the patient will return for visit 5. Sutures will be remo ved, and the 
wound treated with NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  will be evaluated for further collagen 
treatment. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_118849] 2 weeks of NuvagenTM (collagen 
powder)  treatment will be warranted. If further collagen treat ment is advised, the patient will be 
provided with another 2-week supply of NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  and dressings. Patients 
will perform the Patient Overall Assessment Score, wounds will be measured, photographs will 
be taken, and inquiry will be made about any possible adverse events. The wound treated with 
collagen will be treated and dressed in the o ffice.  
 
Six weeks after visit 5, the patient will return for visit 6. Patients will perform the Patient Overall 
Assessment Score, wounds will be measured, photographs will be taken, and inquiry will be 
made about any poss ible adverse events.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_132630]'s health or well -being is threatened by [CONTACT_118862]. Such subjects should 
be withdrawn from the study and not continued under a modified regimen.  
 
The following are circumstances that would result in the subject's discontinuation from the study:  
• The subject experiences a serious adverse event rendering them unable to continue study 
participation;  
• The subject is unable to physically or mentally tolerate the use of the lest medication;  
• An exclusion criterion becomes apparent at any time during the study, or the subject 
voluntarily withdraws.

Version Date: January 29, [ADDRESS_132631] who is withdrawn from the study prior to initiation 
of treatment may be replaced.  
 
3.6 Strength and Limitations of Proposed Research  
 
Strengths of the study include its relatively simple design and  the potential for its completion 
within a short period of time due to the small number of participants (eight).  
 
Limitations of this study include the inability to conduct robust statistical analysis due to its 
small sample size.  However, the results of  this project may lead to the development of larger 
studies that will have the statistical power to detect improvements.  
 
4. DATA VARIABLES, COLLECTION, AND EVALUATION  
4.1 Data Variables  
 
The following data will be evaluated in patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
who agree to participate in the study.  
 
1. Sociodemographic Variables : Age, gender, and race. 
 
2.   Clinical History : 
a. Past medical history : All current and past medical conditions will be documented, 
allowing us to screen for the presence of any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118850], would make the patient unsuitable for study inclusion. Allergies to 
medications will also be noted.  
b. Current medications : All medications will be recor ded.   
c. Social History : We will screen for the presence of tobacco product use in addition to 
any drug or alcohol abuse within the past [ADDRESS_132632] 
or patient interview.  
 
4.2 Wound specific variables  
 
Characterization of wound healing:  Photographs of the wounds will be taken on week 0,  1, 2, 
and 4, at which time the areas will be re -sampled for histologic analysis, and then photographed 
again at the 4 week time point, followed by [CONTACT_5875] 6 and then 12.  Photographs will be used to 
follow gross visual wound healing as assessed by [CONTACT_118863][INVESTIGATOR_118851]. Digital measurements will be 
performed by 2 different members of the research team . 
Morphometric analysis of wound sections : Wound re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_118852]. Dermatopathology 
procedures will be carried out by [CONTACT_118864], Inc., Broolyn, NY.  The distance between the wound 
edges, defined by [CONTACT_118865], and the distance that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_118853], will be analyzed using 
9 
Version Date: January 29, 2018  ImageJ. The percentage of re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_118854] [(distance traversed by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_2130])/(distance 
between wound edges) x 100] will be calculated an d averaged for 2 sections per wound.  The 
quality of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_118855] a measure of wound maturation at 
the 4 week time point.  
Collagen deposition : Dermatopathology procedures will be carried out by [CONTACT_118866], Inc., 
Broolyn, NY . Staining will be performed using Masson’s trichrome stain and the percentage of 
blue collagen -stained area relative to the total area of the wound bed after taking digital imag es. 
This will be quantified by [CONTACT_118867][INVESTIGATOR_118856] a threshold intensity and 
normalizing to the total number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463] . 
Angiogenesis : Dermatopathology procedures will be carried out by [CONTACT_118864], Inc., Broolyn, 
NY. Wound  sections will be stained using CD31 antibody (also called platelet -derived 
endothelial cell adhesion molecule -1). Digital images at 40x  magnification covering the majority 
of the wound bed will be taken . The percent area stained in each image will be quan tified by 
[CONTACT_118867][INVESTIGATOR_118856] a threshold intensity and normalizing to the total 
number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463]. Threshold intensity will be set such that only clearly stained pi[INVESTIGATOR_118857]. Staining identified as artifact, large vessels, a nd areas deemed to be outside the wound 
bed will be excluded.  
Patient Overall Assessment Scale. Patients will assess the overall improvement of their wounds  
using a 4 -point scale, where 1 = excellent improvement, 2 = goo d / moderate improvement, 3 = 
no cha nge, 4 = worse ning. This assessment will be performed prior to every follow up  visit after 
wounding at week 0 , and upon study completion  for each wound . Improvement will be indicated 
by a decrease by ≥ 1 poi nt compared to  the previous assessment. Worsening  will be indicated by 
[CONTACT_118868] ≥ 1 point compared to the previous assessment.  Patients will also be 
asked preference between the NuvagenTM (collagen powder)  and primary closure.  
 
Pruritus Numerical Rating (NRS) Scale . Patients will also score pruritus  on the validated NRS 
scale, which ranges from 1 -10.  This assessment will be performed prior to every follow up visit 
after wounding at week 0, and upon study completion  for each wound . Improvement will b e 
indicated by a d ecrease by ≥ 2  point s compared to the previous assessment. Worsening will be 
indicated by [CONTACT_118868] ≥ [ADDRESS_132633] of the data will initially be recorded on approved study forms containing the participant's 
study ID code. After transfer of data into the computerized d atabase, all paper forms will be kept 
in a secure locked cabinet within a locked office within the department.  Photographs will be 
stored with a secure electronic file and will be labeled with the participant's study ID code and 
date they were taken.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_132634] a significant  difference in any of the measured variables. Instead, we will look at 
10 
Version Date: January 29, [ADDRESS_132635] significant differences in these variables after treatment with 
NuvagenTM (collagen powder) .  
 
5. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
 
5.[ADDRESS_132636] during the 
screening period and prior to each treatment session for the duration of the study. Individuals 
from all racial/ethnic groups,  regardless of gender, and those that are economically and 
educationally disadvantaged are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility requirements.  
 
5.2 Risks and Benefits  
 
Risks from punch biopsies include the possibility of pain, bleeding, itching,  or infection at the 
biopsy site. Further, there is the possibility of persistent b ruising, swelling, or scarring.  Pain at 
the biopsy site will be minimized by [CONTACT_2363] a local anesthetizing agent. Excessive bleeding will 
be prevented by [CONTACT_118869] w ith known  coagulation disorders, patients taking  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , or 
patients taking anticoagulants (including heparin, low molecular weight heparin, warfarin, 
fondaparinux, or rivaroxaban).  Further, bleeding will be minimized by  [CONTACT_118870]. Previous work has shown  that wound infections can 
occur in about [ADDRESS_132637] an allergy or allergic reaction to the numbing agent used, but every attempt to 
prevent this will be made by [CONTACT_118871].  Furthermore, 
there is a potential risk of a llergy to the interventional type I NuvagenTM (collagen powder) . 
Although studies have shown that it is possible to develop monoclonal antibodies to mammalian 
collagen, type I collagen  has shown to be very poorly immunogenic.3,16,[ADDRESS_132638]  also been implicated in immunogenicity of collagen 
11 
Version Date: January 29, [ADDRESS_132639] 
medication (including bovine and/or collagen products).  
 
There is a potential risk of loss of privacy. A ll possible precautions will be taken to respect 
privacy and the confidentiality of patient information , and a secured database with coded 
identifiers will be used to keep privacy breach risk minimal.  
 
There is no  guarantee of  direct benefit from study involvement.  Information from this study will 
be used to improve wound care practices after skin biopsies.  Subjects could receive up to 
$590.00 total for participation if all study visits are attended. For each biopsy procedure, subjects 
will be compensated $125.00, for a total of $500.00 for all 4 planned biopsies obtained during 
the study (2 biopsies in visit 1, and 2 more biopsies in visit 4). In addition, subjects will be 
reimbursed $15.00 for travel expenses for each visit, for a total of $90.[ADDRESS_132640]'s study identification 
number. Database information will be maintained in a password -protected file. All the data 
included in this study will only be accessible to the investigators listed on the title page, 
and they will not be released for use by [CONTACT_29091].  
 
5.4  Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring  
 
Patients will be closely monitored for any adverse events experienced during this study, as 
described in Section 5.2: Risks and Benefits. Adverse events monitoring will be performed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_118858] 2. Any event occurring 
more tha n 8 weeks  after the second pair of punch biopsies at visit 4  will not be considered an 
adverse event. Patients will be educated as to the possible side effects and complications related 
to punch biopsies and NuvagenTM (collagen powder) , and will be instruc ted to notify any 
investigator should they experience signs or symptoms of an adverse event.  Because the 
anticipated risks associated with this study are low, we feel that an independent monitoring board 
will not be necessary.  
 
All events that meet the Prompt Reporting Requirements (HRP -801) (including but not limited to 
new or increased risk, harm experienced by [CONTACT_423], noncompliance with the federal 
regulations governing human research, and state medical board actions) will be reported to the 
GW OHR via a Problem Report and Promptly Reportable Information Form (HRP -204) within 5 
business days of knowledge of the event.

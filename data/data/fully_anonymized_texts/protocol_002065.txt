DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 
Title: Activating the hypoglossal motor nucleus using existing drugs for the treatment of 
obstructive sleep apnea  
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_755908] -Montemurro, MD  
 
Version Date:  Decem ber 6th, 2018  
 
I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA)  is a common sleep -related breathing disorder  associated with 
serious cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and  with important  consequences on the quality of 
life. It is characterized by [CONTACT_203781] ‘obstruction’ of the pharyngeal airway during 
sleep  resulting in a complete closure (apnea) or narrowing  (hypopnea) of the upper airway . The 
severity of the disease is measured as the frequency of obstructive events for each hou r of sleep 
(apnea -hypopnea index, AHI). When OSA is defined as an AHI ≥5 events per hour plus 
symptoms (eg, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) or A HI ≥[ADDRESS_1034707] decade research has show n that a number of pathogenic fa ctors, or traits, c ontribute 
to the development of OSA2-5. These include: 1) an anatomically small, collapsible upper airway; 
2) an oversensitive respi[INVESTIGATOR_622925], i.e., instability; 3) a loss of pharyngeal muscle tone or responsiveness during sleep; and 4) a low respi[INVESTIGATOR_111283], i.e., prem ature arousal to respi[INVESTIGATOR_622926].  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755909], it has not led to improved 
therapy.  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is still the only viable treatment for most patients, and it is usually e ffective because it mechanically splints the upper airway open.  The 
problem, however, is that many patients cannot use CPAP because they find it intolerable.  This 
represents a significant health concern, as OSA is known to cause a number of adverse 
cardiovascular
6-13, neurocognitive14, and daytime functioning15 consequences, making OSA a 
major health concern.  
 
In the presence of an anatomical predisposition  to airway collapse, the sleep -related withdrawal 
of motor output  from the hypoglossal motornucleus (HMN)  to the upper airway dilator muscles 
can cause the collapse of pharyngeal structures, with ensuing epi[INVESTIGATOR_755910], 
intermittent hypoxia, hype rcapnia, and arousals from sleep16. Loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle 
activation during sleep is central to the pathogenesis of OSA17. However, attempts to 
pharmacologically reverse pharyngeal hypotonia that occurs in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_755911] -motor areas .  
 Our group has made significant headway in dealing with ventilatory control sensitivity .
18, [ADDRESS_1034708] been developed to address the anatomi cal 
predisposition to collapse , drugs that activate the pharyngeal muscles are needed.  
 Recent investigation based on gene expression in the HMN motor and pre -motor (pre -HMN) 
areas has shown that t here is  a significant unexplored potential in terms of testing  FDA- approved 
BWH/MGH Human Subjects Research Application Form  Filename: [CONTACT_755932] 4: March [ADDRESS_1034709] musculature .    
 
Our group recently discovered that the combination of atomoxetine (a norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331]) and oxybutynin (an anticholinergic) reduced OSA severity by 63% in a group of 20 
unselected patients. The p utative mechanism of action was an increase in genioglossus muscle 
responsiveness during sleep by ~[ADDRESS_1034710] Horner’s 
lab in Toronto, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_755912], through the muscarinic receptors mediate the 
REM -related atonia in the same muscles.  The analysis of the effect of the drugs taken alone 
revealed that atomoxetine was able to increase the ventilation during sleep compared to placebo 
but the patients had frequent respi[INVESTIGATOR_755913] s from sleep,  the sleep quality 
was compromised  and the patients experienced still a high number of hypopneas . Oxybutynin 
taken alone had only a minor effect  in impr oving ventilation during sleep, however when 
administered with atomoxetine, it had the effect of consolidating sleep by i ncreasing  sleep 
efficiency, sleep duration and sleep architecture. Based on these findings, we have reasons to believe that oxybutynin could be substituted (in the combination with atomoxetine) with a non-myorelaxing hypnotic free from anticholinergic side effects such as zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], trazodone or gabapentin.          
 II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 AIM 1. To determine the effect of  several  FDA- approved drug s administered alone or in 
combination on OSA severity. The drugs tested in this protocol have been selected because of their potential to increase the upper airway muscle activity during sleep by [CONTACT_755930]/or the pre -HMN areas i n the brainstem.  
 Specifically, we will te st this hypothesis by [CONTACT_58833]:   
 1. The effect of lorcaserin  on OSA severity  (LTM1201L) . Lorcaserin is a  weight -loss 
drug acting specifically as an agonist of [ADDRESS_1034711] of the combination of lorcaserin  and cholecalciferol  on OSA severity  
(LTM1201LD) . Cholecalciferol is an agonist of the vitamin D receptor , which is expressed 
on HMN neurons >  [ADDRESS_1034712] of the combination of lorcaserin  and nabilone  on OSA severity  
(LTM1201LN) . Nabilone is a cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 (CB1/CB2) receptor agonist  
approved for the treatment of refractory nausea and vomiting associated with cancer

and phasic genioglossus activity23 during wakefulness. Furthermore, a recent clinical trial 
suggested cannabinoids  might be helpful in the treatment o f sleep apnea, although the 
administration of CB1/[ADDRESS_1034714] of the combination of lorcaserin  and buspi[INVESTIGATOR_755914]

On the phone, s ubjects will be given a thorough review of the risks, discomforts, potential 
benefits (if any) and their expected involvement  using a prepared script approved by [CONTACT_482721] .  Subjects will be given a copy of the inform ed consent and allowed a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1034718] the opportunity to discuss the research with his/her primary care 
physician or clinician. The study investiga tors will be available to answer any questions should 
any arise. Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects by a licensed physician investigator prior to commencement of any study procedures.  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be carefully as sessed prior to enrollment. Assuming subjects 
meet the inclusion criteria, they will begin the protocol by [CONTACT_755931]/physiology laborato ry. Subjects will be informed that they may withdraw from the 
study at any point, with  no impact on their ongoing care.  
 All email sent outside of the Partners firewall containing confidential information will be encrypted using "Send Secure" as per the Partners Policy.  Subjects may opt out of encrypted email communications if they  have been advised of the risks associated with unencrypted email, 
and they indicate a preference to receive unencrypted email despi[INVESTIGATOR_94858].  Consent to receive unencrypted email will be documented per the Partners Policy in the subject’s record.  We will discourage subjects from communicating about medical issues by [CONTACT_105]- secure email.  
 V.   STUDY PROCEDURES   
 
Protocol  
 After a medication and screening visit, five overnight sleep studies will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_1034719] effective 
BWH/MGH Human Subjects Research Application Form  Filename: [CONTACT_755932] 4: March [ADDRESS_1034720] at this visit.  
 
Sleep Studies  
 For each night, the s ubjects will arrive at the sleep laboratory at approximately 6:30pm. A 
physician will perform a history and physical examination. The placebo or drug(s) will be administered 30 minutes be fore lights out. The patients will perform five sleep studies in random 
order:  
 1) placebo night  
2) lorcaserin (15mg) night  – LTM1 201L  
3) lorcaserin (15mg) +cholecalciferol (1500 IU ) night  – LTM1 201LD  
4) lorcaserin+nabilone  (1mg)  night  – LTM1 201LN  
5) lorcaserin  (15mg) + buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331]  (20mg)  night – LTM1 201LB  
  
Measurements and equipment :  
 Subjects will be instrumented with standard pol ysomnography (PSG) recording sensors. Sleep 
stage and arousals will be measured with electrodes pasted on to the scalp, face, chin , and chest 
(EEG, EOG, EKG, chin EMG).  Paste-on EMG electrodes will be placed over the anterior 
tibialis muscle to detect leg movements. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_755920]. Oxygen saturation will be measured continuously with a puls e oximetry probe placed on the fingertip. Snoring will be detected with a 
small microphone positioned over the suprasternal notch. Body position will be recorded with a sensor taped to the thoracic belt. Each of these devices is standard for diagnostic PSG  and should 
not be uncomfortable.  
 To measure airflow, a standard CPAP  mask will be placed over the nose and held in place with 
straps. The mask allows monitoring of breathing (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_755921]) and  expi[INVESTIGATOR_755922] (PCO
2) using a calibrated 
infrared CO 2 analyzer (Capnograph/Oximeter Monitor).  
 After all the equipment is  in place, the patient will be asked to sleep in  the supi[INVESTIGATOR_755923]  (4 hour s). As much data will be recorded from NREM and REM sleep 
as possible over the night. Following completion of the study, all equipment will be removed, and the subject will be able to sleep  in the laboratory free from equipment for the rest of the 
night. A lternatively, if the subject feels alert enough to leave, they may do so.  
 
Data Analysis : 
 Apneas, hypopneas, arousals , and sleep stages will be scored using standard American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine guidelines
[ADDRESS_1034721] (RPSGT)  blinded 
BWH/MGH Human Subjects Research Application Form  Filename: [CONTACT_755932] 4: March 2 002   Page 6 to the treatment allocation. Hypopneas will be defined as r eduction in flow ≥30% from baseline, 
lasting at least 10 seconds and associated with an arousal from sleep or an oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation ≥ 3%.  
 If the data collected are considered insufficient, the subject may be asked to repeat the whole study or a pa rt of it.  
 
VI.   BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 In this protocol , we want to collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_755924]. Variables of interest will be compared using a  mixed effect model with p<0.[ADDRESS_1034722] been conducted in our laboratory without serious incident. 
Anticipated risks and discomforts are listed below:  
 1. The equipment used for assessing sleep (paste on electrodes) is standard and poses no 
risk. The electrodes may be mildly uncomfortable and could cause some sleep interruption. Thus , subjects may feel somewhat tired the day following this study.  
 
2. Lorcaserin  side effects include : headache (15% to 17%), hypoglycemia (diabetic 
patients 29%; symptomatic 7%; sev ere: 2%), back pain (6% to 12%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348] (14%), nasopharyngitis (11% to 13%), h ypertension (5%), peripheral edema (5%), 
decreased heart rate (less than 50 bpm: 4% to 5%), acquired valvular heart disease (3%), 
dizziness (7% to 9%),  fatigue (7%), anxiety (4%), insomnia (4%), depression (3%), stress 
(3%), cognitive dysfunction (2%), psychiatric disturbance (2%),  exacerbation of diabetes 
mellitus (3%), nausea (8% to 9%), diarrhea (7%), constipation (6%), xerostomia (5%), 
vomiting (4%) , gastroenteritis (3%), toothache (3%), decreased appetite (2%), urinary tract 
infection (7% to 9%), Decreased hemoglobin (10%), decreased neutrophils (6%), m uscle 
spasm (5%), musculoskeletal pain (2%), cough (4% to 8%), oropharyngeal pain (4%), sinus 
congestion (3%)  
 
3. Cholecalciferol : no adverse reactions are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.  High 
levels of Vitamin D may facilitate kidney stones formation  and atherosclerosis , secondary to 
hypercalcemia.  There are no known interactions  between  cholec alciferol and lorcaserin.   
 
4. Nabilone (Cesamet)  side effects include:  drowsiness (52% to 66%), dizziness (59%), 
vertigo (52% to 59%), euphoria (11% to 38%), ataxia (13% to 14%), depression (14%), lack 
of concentration (12%), sleep disorder (11%), x erosto mia (22% to 36%), visual disturbance 
(13%), hypotension (8%), d ysphoria (9%), headache (6% to 7%), sedation (3%), 
depersonalization (2%), disorientation (2%) . There are no known interactions  between  
nabilone and  lorcaserin.  
 
5. Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_755925]: Dizziness (3% to 12%), Chest pain (≥1%), Drowsiness 
(10%), headache (6%), nervousness (5%), confusion (2%), excitement (2%), numbness (2%), 
outbursts of anger (2%), abnormal dreams (≥1%), ataxia (1%) paresthesia (1%), Diaphoresis 
BWH/MGH Human Subjects Research Application Form  Filename: [CONTACT_755932] 4: March 2 002   Page 7 (1%), skin rash (1%),  Nausea (8%), diarrhea (2%), sore throat (≥1%) Weakness (2%), 
musculoskeletal pain (1%), tremor (1%), Blurred vision (2%), Tinnitus (≥1%), Nasal 
congestion (≥1%) . There are no known interactions  between  buspi[INVESTIGATOR_755926]. Both 
these agents are serot onin modulators but the development of serotonin toxicity/serotonin 
syndrome is highly unlikely because buspi[INVESTIGATOR_755927] s timula tes a single serotonin receptor ( 5HT 2C ).   
 
VIII.  POTENTIAL BEN EFITS  
 
Although it is unlikely that there will be any direct physical benefit to the subjects from participating in this study, we will make known to each subject, if requested, some of the information we have gathered from this testing. This study provide s a unique opportunity to gain 
insight into the specific mechanisms by [CONTACT_622942]. The results may, in the future, lead to improved strategies for the treatment of sleep apnea. However, if previously unknown abnormalities of sleep and breathing are encountered, this information will be passed onto the subject. Results can be forwarded to the primary care physician or clinician at the request of the subject.  
 
IX.   MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 As these s tudies represent physiologic investigation and not clinical studies, no formal quality 
assurance programs will be implemented.  However, the ongoing results, problems, and limitations of the study will be presented on a regular basis to the investigators in the Division of Sleep Medicine. Also, any adverse events will be promptly reported to the Human Research Committee for review.   See attached Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 We will also elect an independent safety monitor (ISM) to review the study and protocol on a quarterly basis .  The designated safety monitor is Robert Thomas, MD.  [CONTACT_132381] is an 
Associate Professor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices out of Beth Israel Deaconess Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297910].  He specializes in Sleep Medicine (Circadian Rhythm Disorders, Complex Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Periodic Limb Movements, and Narcolepsy).  He is not directly associated with our research lab.  He has no say over the design 
or implementation of these studies and will r eview the practices in an unbiased manner.

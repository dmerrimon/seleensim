Primary Objective x To investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of treatment with NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50mg/mL 
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in children and 
adolescents with PTHS 
Secondary Objectives x To investigate measures of ef ficacy during treatment with 
NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL IMP in children and

Trial Design Neu-2591-PTHS-001 is an open-label study of the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50mg/mL in male and female 
children and adolescents with PTHS. Participants receive treatment of 
orally administered NNZ-2591 for a total of 13 weeks. 
 Overall Design 
There are a total of 17 study visits over the duration of the study, 5 in-clinic visits, and 12 remote/in-home vi sits (see Table 1). Remote visits 
between the Investigator or designee at the clinical site and the participant at home are conducted via telemedicine or video facilities

Protocol Neu-2591-PTHS-001 Phase 2: Pediatric Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Study  
as appropriate. In-home visit refers to a visit made to the participant’s 
home by a visiting nurse. 
The study will commence with an approximately 4 to 6 week 
Screening and Baseline period. Duri ng this Screening/Baseline period, 
participants will be assessed for study eligibility. Rescreening of 
participants is allowable under cert ain circumstances with the approval 
of the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.   During the Screening/Baseline period  data will also be collected to 
establish the participant’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity based on assessments collect ed during the 4 to 6 week period. 
There are two in-clinic visits and one remote/in-home visit during the 
Screening and Baseline period (Visits 1, 2, 3).   Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be dosed at a starting 
dose of 4 mg/kg twice-daily (BID) and up-titrated to a target dose of 
12 mg/kg BID of orally administered NNZ-2591. The mg/kg dosing is based on the participant’s weight at Baseline (Visit 3). Participants will 
receive treatment with NNZ-2591 for a total of 13 weeks. During the 
treatment period there are three in-clin ic visits: Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 
6 (Visit 9) and Week 13 (Visit 16). There is a remote visit by [CONTACT_361714] a same-day in-home visit by a 
visiting nurse at Week 1, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 10. Additionally, 
there are in-home visits by a visiting nurse at Week 3, Week 5, Week 
7, Week 9, Week 11, and Week 12. 
All participants will have a combined remote Follow-Up visit with the 
Investigator via telemedicine and an in-person home visit by a visiting 
nurse approximately 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 15, 
Visit 17).  For all visits designated as in-clinic, an in-person visit is preferred. All 
requests for off-site assessments due to extenuating circumstances, such as related to the Coronavi rus-disease (COVID-19) health 
emergency, must be approved by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor or Medical Monitor in 
advance.  
Enrollment Groups 
For enrollment, the participants will be divided into three groups by 
[CONTACT_654]: 13–17-year-olds (Group 1), 8–12-year-olds (Group 2), and 3–7-
year-olds (Group 3). Enrollment will commence in the oldest age 
group (Group 1). After at least th ree participants in Group [ADDRESS_700653] 
received two weeks of treatment with the IMP at the starting dose (4 mg/kg BID), safety and tolerability da ta will be reviewed by [CONTACT_124954] (DSMC). If tolerability and safety data 
are deemed acceptable, enrollment for Group 2 will proceed and

thickeners, or food for administration. The dose can be taken from a cup or dosing syringe. Doses should be given on an empty stomach (2 
hours after the previous meal or snack and 30 minutes prior to the next). 
 
The first dose of IMP will be administered in the clinic after all 
Baseline assessments are completed, or, if the Investigator judges that it is too late in the day, on the following day. The participant should be monitored for at least three hours after the first dose. If the first dose is 
administered the day following Baseline, vital signs should be 
collected before the dose is administered. Day [ADDRESS_700661] dose is taken. At this visit, the site will provide IMP for the caregiver to dispense at home. Enough IMP will 
be provided to cover the interval un til the next in-clinic visit when the 
caregiver will be re-supplied from the site. 
 The protocol includes procedures for dose titration and dose adjustments, if any are necessary (Section 7.2), and pre-specified 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (i.e., discontinuation of IMP) consistent with the exclusion criteria, including QT cF, renal, ocular, and hepatic, 
exclusion criteria (Section 9.4.5 ). 
Endpoints Primary Endpoints 
 
Safety: 
The incidence of AEs and SAEs from commencement of IMP 
administration through to the time of the last study visit will be 
evaluated. Vital signs, laboratory  measures, urine output history, 
physical exam results (neurological, ophthalmologic, and general), 
, and ECGs will also be evaluated from 
screening/baseline through the end of the study.  Tolerability will be assessed base d on caregiver reports and the 
Caregiver Diary, required dosing adjustments or discontinuations, 
dosing compliance, and AEs relate d to participant experience. 
 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be  collected according to the age 
appropriate sampling schedule for each participant (See Table 2 and 
Table 3 ). Pharmacokinetic concentratio ns and exposure parameters for 
NNZ-2591 will be derived by [CONTACT_537919]-compartmental analysis

Biomarkers and Microbiome Samples 
Blood and stool samples will be collected for analysis of biomarkers 
and gut microbiome. The analysis will be detailed in a separate analysis plan but will not include DNA sequencing. Samples will be 
collected at Screening (Visit 1), Ba seline (Visit 3, before dosing) and 
at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit, or upon early termination. 
 
Sample Size Estimation Sample sizes were estimated for this open-label study using within-
participant change as the measure of improvement. Given the limited 
data from interventional trials in th ese patient populations, and that this 
is the first clinical study of NNZ-2591 IMP in this population, 
treatment change estimates were ba sed on CGI-I data from completed 
clinical trials in other rare, neurod evelopmental disorders. Based on the 
information provided in Glaze et al. 2019 (Double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of trofinetide in pediatric Rett syndrome), the standard deviation of the CGI-I is approximately 0.[ADDRESS_700662] a difference of 0.55 units of change in the CGI-I at a power of 0.90. For a power of 0.80, 0.85, and 0.90, the detectable difference would be 0.48, 0.51, and 0.55 or larger, respectively. 
Statistical Methods Safety  
Adverse events and other safety data will be summarized as 
frequencies and percentages, desc ribed in terms of severity and 
potential attribution. Objective safe ty assessments will be summarized 
over time on study; shift tables at  time points of interest may be 
generated.  Details of the safety an alyses will be specified in the SAP. 
 
Efficacy 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_537920] g at within-participant changes 
from the Baseline period to the EOT. The participant’s baseline 
characteristics and symptom sever ity will be established based on 
assessments collected during the 4 to 6 week Screening/Baseline 
period. Baseline values will be based on  the average values of visits 1, 
2, and3 for assessments collected at  more than one visit. A Wilcoxon

For the concentrations measured at trough points dose, relationship 
will be examined statistically with  age group and/or body weight of 
participant as covariate. 
Overall exposure parameters for NNZ-2591 such as C max and AUC tau 
may be derived by [CONTACT_361720]-comp artmental analysis (NCA). 
Additionally, PK concentrations of NNZ-[ADDRESS_700663] NCA approach will be used for simulated profiles to calculate parameters C
max, AUC tau, etc. for 
characterization of NNZ-2591 exposu re in pediatric participants. 
The PK analysis details will be specified in the PK Statistical Analysis Plan (PK SAP).  Biomarkers and Microbiome: Biomarker analysis will be detaile d in the SAP and will not include 
DNA sequencing.  
Microbiome analysis will be described in a separate analysis plan. 
Trial Sites Approximately 4-[ADDRESS_700664] be completed daily during the entire Screening/Baseline period whether it is 4 weeks or 6 weeks. The Screening visit  (Visit 1) and 
Baseline visit (Visit 3) may be conducted over three consecutive da ys. It is preferrable that ECGs, safety labs and biomarker s ample collection are 
conducted on the same day. All assessments must be completed within the window for th e visit (visit day ± 2 days).  For Visit [ADDRESS_700665] received IM P for longer than 2 weeks and discontinue premat urely any time after Visit 5 should return to the investigational 
site for final safety and efficacy assessments as scheduled for the EOT visit (Visit 16) and complete the study exit form. 
c At Visit 3, the first dose of IMP will be administered in the clinic after all Baseline assessments are completed, or, if the Investigator judges that 
it is too late in the day, on the following day. The participan t should be monitored for at least three hours post first dose. If the first dose is 
administered the day following Baseline, vita l signs (except height) should be collecte d before the dose is administered. Day [ADDRESS_700666] be 
done within the window for the visit. 
e This is a combined remote and in-person nurse visit. The remote visit is conducted by [CONTACT_537922]. 
Any caregiver-completed assessments should be completed the same day of the visit or no earlier than the day before the visit ( except the 
Caregiver Diary which is completed daily) and reviewed by [CONTACT_108899]. A modified version of the physical and neurological  exam will be 
done at the remote visits based on the guidance documents provided to the Investigator. At the W eek 4, the site should confirm with the caregiver 
that the child has started the new dose if they were approved for dose titration. These combination remote/in-home visits will be conducted 
simultaneously whenever possible, or they will ideally be conducte d on the same day. If that is not possible, the telemedicine visit and the nurse 
visit may be conducted over two consecutive da ys. A combined remote visit may be c onducted in-clinic by [CONTACT_537923].See Section 9.[ADDRESS_700667] urine, vital signs including  weight, and blood 
samples for a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). The nurse will also conduct a targeted physical exam assessing general appea rance, 
abdominal/CVA tenderness, and edema. A supra pubic exam (bladder palpation) to assess for urinary retention may be performed. The visiting 
nurse will also review the dosing diary, query oral intake, and do a review of tolera bility. Blood samples for CBC with differe ntial, and 
coagulation will be collected at Weeks 4, 8, 10 and Week 15 (indicated by “N” in the Schedule of Assessments). At the post-trea tment follow-up 
visit at Week 15, the visiting nurse will also collect ECG, in ad dition to the above assessments.  At Week 7, the site will also  have a phone call with 
the caregiver to confirm that the child has started the new dose if they were appr oved for dose titration. The site will confir m the visiting nurse has

g  The in-clinic physical exam will include an abdominal exam and an assessment of CVA. A suprapubic exam (bladder palpation) to a ssess for 
urinary retention may be performed.  Genera l awareness will be captured as part of the neurological exam. For in-home nursing visits, the nurse 
will do a Targeted Physical exam assessing general appearance (e.g., alertness), an abdominal/CVA, and edema. A suprapubic exam  (bladder 
palpation) to assess for urinar y retention may be performed.  
 
h A modified version of the neurological and physical exam will be done for the remote visit based on the guidance documents provided to the 
Investigator.  
 
 
j The visiting nurse will query any changes in tolerability during the in-home visit. Any changes will be noted and provided to the Investigator. The 
Investigator will also query changes in tolerability and note any changes in the remote  assessment. The Investigator is respons ible for determining 
and reporting any changes that  qualify as Adverse Events. 
 
k The caregiver fills out the diary daily from the first day of screening through two weeks after the EOT Visit. X denotes revie w of the Caregiver

Note: There are two rows for Caregiver Diary review procedures (to emphasize the importance of thorough and complete dosing 
documentation): this row (Caregiver Diary)  denotes that the caregiver fills out the diary daily and a designated clinician revi ews it for 
safety/tolerability; a second row (Review dos ing compliance documentation in diary, see footnote “l”) is intended to ensure tha t the 
caregiver is administering IMP/documenti ng dose properly in the Caregiver Diary. 
 
l The daily dosing log in the Caregiver Diar y will be reviewed at all post-baseline vis its through EOT. If any doses are missed or mis-dosed, this 
should be queried with the caregiver and a ppropriate feedback given to the family. Th is feedback should be documented in the so urce documents.  
At the in-home nurse visit, the nurse will re view the caregiver diary to check any issu es and provide feedback to the family at the visit. The nurse 
will notify the site about any urgent issues the day of the vis it and note anything else in the source documents. The nurse does not sign the daily

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-Hopkins Syndrome 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_537925], moderate to profound intellectual disab ility, absent/limited speech, distinctive facial 
dysmorphology, and breathing problems such as epis odic hyperventilation and/or breath-holding while 
awake. Other common symptoms may include repetitive behaviors and social communication 
impairments, constipation, severe near-sighted ness (myopia), sleep disturbances, and seizures.2, [ADDRESS_700680] facial features th at are important elements of the diagnostic criteria, 
including a square face with narrow forehead, thickened helix, wide nasal bridge, beaked nose 
characterized by [CONTACT_100276]-turned nasal tip, flared nasal al ae and wide nasal tip, full cheeks, wide mouth, full 
lips and a cupid bow upper lip.3-7 Myopia is observed in the majority of patients (48-88%) and strabismus 
and astigmatism are also observed.4, 6-[ADDRESS_700681] severe to profound cognitive impairments.  
Mental age equivalents for development level that ha ve been reported as betwee n 3.5 to 36 months for 
individuals between 32 m onths and 32 years old.9, 12 The majority of individuals (68%) have absent or 
limited speech (less than 5 words) and all have impaired speech.4, 6, 8, 9 While between 46-70% of 
individuals are reported to be independently ambulatory, the majority of individuals have gait 
abnormalities including a wide-based ataxic gait, as well as impaired motor coordination and hypotonia.4, 
6, 8-11, 13, [ADDRESS_700682] 45%-86% of individuals with PTHS, in 
particular hyperventilation or hyperven tilation with apnea (46%) when awake.3, 6-11, 15 GI problems are 
also highly prevalent, and can be severe, w ith around 35% needing corrective treatment.13 Chronic 
constipation, with an onset as early as infancy,8, 9 is particularly common (67%-85% of patients).6-11, 15  
Seizures present another challenge for 30%-51% of individuals with PTHS.4, 6, 8-11, 13, 15 The range of 
seizure types includes generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, focal onset, and infantile spasms.6, 8, 10, 16-18 
Additionally, between 18%-42%  of individuals with PTHS experience some type of sleep disturbance, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_537895].6, 8  
Individuals with PTHS face a range of behavioral challenges.3, 4, 6-8, 10 Compared to Angelman Syndrome 
(AS) and Cornelia de Lange syndrom e (CdLS), other genetically based disorders with similar early signs 
and features, the behavioral phenotype of PTHS is pa rticularly characterized by [CONTACT_716]: 1) a high 
level of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoma tology 2) social communication difficulties, 3) 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_537896], and 4) high levels of physical aggression and self-injury.13 Aggression and 
aggressive behavior are observed  in 40%-54% of individuals,8, 11-13 and in 38% of individuals, this has 
included destruction of property.13 Between 60-71% of individuals demo nstrate self-injurious behaviors.6, 
9, 11 Anxiety (81%) and agitation (88%) are also common symptoms.6 
Up to 95% of individuals met the cut off scor e for possible ASD on the Social Communication 
Questionnaire (SCQ) screener for ASD.[ADDRESS_700683] atypi[INVESTIGATOR_537896]. In response to 
behaviors in social contexts, the majority of individuals are hyporesponsive, but are hyperresponsive to 
sensory input.13  
Stereotypic behaviors are highly prevalent (54%-94%)3, 6, 8, 10, 12, [ADDRESS_700684] stereotypy,3, 13 body 
stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_537897] (54%-78%) and hand and finger stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (48-85%) including clappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], flappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (up to 80%), hand-wringing/hand- washing (45%), hand mouthing or biting (54%), 
finger movements (54%), and wrist movements (45%).

levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].3, 9, 19 There are no systematic recommendations for the use 
of psychotropic medications to treat behavioral pr oblems, but caregivers report using methylphenidate, 
clonidine and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_537899]/irritability and anti-psychotics for challenging behaviors.3, [ADDRESS_700686] of care includes physical, occupational, behavioral and 
speech therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as well as targeted approaches to orthopedic concerns and ga strointestinal dysfunction 
and seizures, as is reflected in recen tly published international guidelines.3 Establishment of an effective 
long-term care plan that can be implemented across settings, which includes pediatric medical follow-up 
and a transition plan for adult care, is a recommende d approach to the treatment of individuals with 
PTHS.2, 3, 20  
5.3 Genetic Basis of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-Hopkins Syndrome 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-Hopkins syndrome is caused by [CONTACT_537926] 4 ( TCF4 ) gene due to 
heterozygous hypomorphic or null mu tations, or up to 12 Mb interstitial deletions on chromosome 18q 
including the TCF4  gene, which result in TCF4  haploinsufficiency.3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 18, 21, 22 The majority of 
disease-causing genetic changes are de novo.2, 3, 11  
TCF4 is expressed in neurons and glial cells and it enc odes a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription 
factor that is known to heterodimerize with several other bHLH transcription factors that play important roles in neurogenesis and neurona l migration in the brain, regula ting glial cell differentiation, and 
regulating immune cell function.
[ADDRESS_700687] also shown that TCF4 
is important for normal brain function.25, 28

A comprehensive battery of safety, pharmacology, and toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats and 
dogs has also been conducted, providing support for th e progression of the drug into a Phase 2 clinical 
trial in a pediatric population with PTHS. Summaries of these studies are presented in the NNZ-2591 IB.   
5.6 Clinical Data 
NNZ-2591 has been studied in 28 healthy male and female adult volunteers. Study Neu-2591-HV-001 
was a combined Phase 1 study, with an open-label single dose stage and a double-blind, randomized, 
multiple ascending dose-escalation stage with 12 particip ants enrolled in 2 open-la bel single-dose cohorts 
and 16 participants enrolled in 2 randomized, double-b lind, placebo-controlled multiple dose cohorts. The 
single ascending dose stage of the Phase 1 study eval uated doses of 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. The two 
cohorts comprising the multiple asce nding dose stage of the Phase 1 study evaluated twice-daily dosing at 
3 mg/kg for 1 day followed by 6 mg/kg for 6 days (Cohort M1) and 6 mg/kg for 1 day, then 9 mg/kg for 
1 day followed by 12 mg/kg for 5 days (Cohort M2).   
 Twice daily dosing for 5 days at 12 mg/kg following up-titration for 1 day at 6 mg/kg and 1 day at 9 mg/kg was found to be safe and generally well-toler ated. There were no deaths , Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs), or severe Treatment Emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) reported during the conduct of this study. 
All adverse events (AEs) were mild  or moderate. No clinically signi ficant laboratory, ocular, physical 
examination, vital sign, or cardiac abnormalities were reported. There was a single discontinuation due to 
moderate AEs of somnolence and ataxia after the administration of one dose. The participant’s two 
TEAEs resolved after treatment was withdrawn.  The most common TEAEs deemed related to drug we re a cluster of apparently related neurological 
symptoms that included somnolence/drowsiness, blurre d vision/difficulty focusing, ataxia/unsteady gait, 
dizziness, and vertigo. The majority of these TEAE s occurred within 2-3 hours of a participant’s first 
dose. All resolved spontaneously without requiring me dical intervention, most within 24 hours from 
onset. This pattern suggests that these TEAEs are an acute phenomenon temporally correlated with initial 
T
max rather than being associated with cumulative exposure and that participants possibly develop 
tolerance to these neurological Aes. There were no cl inically significant findings on the laboratory tests or 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and no rena l or hepatic findings were observed. 
 PK appeared to be linear and predictable, w ith peak and total exposures (as measured by C
max and area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC], respec tively) appearing to increase in a generally dose 
proportional manner after both the morning and evening doses.  A summary of the study is provided in the NNZ-[ADDRESS_700688] udies participants receive BID 
treatment for a total of 13 weeks. The dose is up-titrated from 4 mg/kg (three weeks of treatment) to 8 mg/kg (three weeks of treatment) to 12 mg/kg (7 week s of treatment). As of the date of the last annual 
report to FDA, a total of 16 participants had been  dosed across this study, (PTHS-001) and the Angelman 
Syndrome and Phelan McDermid Syndrome studies. There were no SAEs or Adverse Events of Special 
Interest (renal, hepatic or ocular) report ed. There have been two discontinuations.

6.1 Study Rationale 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by [CONTACT_537927]4  gene, and the resulting reduction in the number and morphology of dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_537900].29 Characterized by [CONTACT_537928], moderate to 
profound intellectual disability, absen t/limited speech, distinctive facial  dysmorphology, and breathing 
problems,2, 3 PTHS causes lifelong difficulties for the indi viduals affected by [CONTACT_537929]. There is currently no approved treatment for PTHS.  
In pre-clinical pharmacodynamic studies, NNZ-2591 h as demonstrated the ability to improve impaired 
synaptic structure and signaling as well as re scuing the neurobehavioral phenotype. NNZ-2591 is a 
synthetic analogue of cGP that inhibits neuroinfla mmation and restores synap tic function and plasticity. 
NNZ-2591 has better stability than cGP, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has high 
bioavailability when administered orally. Therefore, th e purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of treatment with oral NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL IMP 
in children and adolescents with PTHS. 
6.2 Rationale for Dose Selection and Route of Administration 
6.2.0 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Selection of the dose schedule of NNZ-2591 IMP that will be utilized in this study is informed by: 
x Results of toxicity studies which assessed the effe cts of oral NNZ-[ADDRESS_700689] Level (NOA EL) of NNZ-2591 was 200 mg/kg/day in juvenile 
rats and 120 mg/kg/day in adul t dogs. At the NOAEL, no NNZ-2591-related clinical signs of 
toxicity considered adverse, or mortality occu rred and no non-reversible effects on the nervous 
system, skeletal system, renal or reproductive system were observed. 
x Pharmacodynamic studies in Tcf4+/- mice and wild-type, littermate controls found that 6 weeks of 
dosing at 100 mg/kg BID and 200 mg/kg BID we re effective in reversing cognitive and 
neurobehavioral deficits analogous to the human PTHS phenotype.     
x The safety, tolerability, and PK of NNZ-[ADDRESS_700690]-in-Human 
(FIH) Phase 1 study. NNZ-2591 appeared to be  safe and generally well-tolerated when 
administered orally twice daily for 7 days at doses up to 12 mg/kg BID. There were no SAEs. All 
AEs were mild or moderate. There were no NNZ-2591 related abnorma l laboratory results, 
ECGs, or vital signs and no sentinel safety issues. This study is summarized in the IB. 
x The results of allometric scaling of exposure at steady state (AUC tau) in healthy, adult volunteers 
at 12 mg/kg indicate that exposures for the pediatric population at weights lower than 70 kg are estimated to be lower than those observed fo r the adult population in the Phase 1 study at 
12 mg/kg. Therefore, dosing all children at a maxi mum of 12 mg/kg BID will not put them at risk 
of exposures higher than that experienced by h ealthy adults. At the same time, the predicted 
exposures are expected to be in the range of what  was identified as a potentially efficacious dose 
from the animal models so there is a prospect of benefit with dosing at the maximum proposed dose of 12 mg/kg BID. A summary of the allo metric scaling analysis is presented in Appendix A .

  Page 42 of 112 x Data from a parallel PK study in the same background strain of mice utilized in the 
pharmacodynamic study was conducted to support comparison of exposure between mice and 
humans. This study, combined with PK data from the Phase 1 study, resulted in an estimate that a 
dose of approximately 10 mg/kg BID in adults should result in daily exposure equivalent to 
100 mg/kg BID in the mouse. The weight-based doses in the Phase 2 study are intended to result 
in a distribution of exposures equivalent to th e 12 mg/kg dose in adults that will provide a 
reasonable opportunity for efficacy as well as being predicted to be safe and well-tolerated. 
In this Phase 2 study, NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL will be administered orally BID over the 
course of 13 weeks. Participants will be up-titrated  according to the dosing schedule outlined in Section 
7.2. The dose titration schedule may be modified based  on updated PK modelling in cluding data from the 
study. 
6.2.1 Rationale for Duration of Dosing 
Given the overall safety and tolerability profile of NN Z-2591 in preclinical studies to date, 13 weeks of 
treatment at this dose is expected to be safe an d well-tolerated. NNZ-2591 has been shown to be well-
tolerated in animal studies for up to 13 weeks at up to 200 mg/kg/day for rats and 120 mg/kg/day for 
dogs. In addition, NNZ-[ADDRESS_700691] in behavioral and symptom change. A number of functionally relevant symptoms in PTHS could 
show a more immediate response as a result of this change in synaptic  function. Based on findings in a 
parallel program of another IGF-1 metabolite analog (trofinetide) in Rett syndrome, it has been observed 
that improvements in some symptoms can be seen at 4 or 6 weeks of treatment.1, 32 This includes 
improvements in symptoms clinicians considered c linically meaningful such as behavior, seizures, 
ambulation, social interaction, motor skills (hand use) and repetitive behaviors. As such, there is a 
prospect of benefit with dosing at the maximum propo sed dose of 12 mg/kg BID for [ADDRESS_700692]. This has 
provided insights on the symptoms that are central to the disorder and are important  to patient functioning 
and well-being. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_537901] (P HRF) maintains a family registry as part of the 
Coordination of Rare Diseases (CoRDS) Registry at  Sanford which collects information on clinical 
symptoms (https://pi[INVESTIGATOR_537902].org/r esearch/how-to-get-involved-in-research-today/family-registry/). The 
PHRF also did an assessment of the patient and family  experience by [CONTACT_14664] a trend analysis of data 
shared through social networks.[ADDRESS_700693] relevant and potentially 
beneficial to patients with PTHS (see Section 9.5.9 ). The secondary outcome of efficacy in this study will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_56620] a range of  symptom areas to determine if th ere is preliminary evidence of 
efficacy, but also importantly to gather informa tion about the performance of outcome measures and the 
influence of baseline patient attributes on clinical response.

children and adolescents with PTHS.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Endpoints 
Safety: Incidence of AEs and SAEs from commenceme nt of IMP administration through to the time of 
the last study visit will be evaluated. Vital signs , laboratory measures, physical exam results 
(neurological, ophthalmologic, and general) urine output history, , and ECGs 
will also be evaluated from screening/b aseline through the end of the study.  
Tolerability: Tolerability will be asse ssed based on caregiver reports and the caregiver diary, required 
dosing adjustments or discontinuations, dosing compli ance and AEs related to participant experience. 
Pharmacokinetic:  
NNZ-2591 PK concentrations will be listed by [CONTACT_180653] t and time point for each dose level with actual

7.1 Study Design Overview 
This is a Phase 2, open-label study of the safety and tolerability of NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL in 
male and female children and adolescents with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]-H opkins syndrome. Approximate ly 10 to 20 male and 
female participants between the ages of 3 and 17 years will be enrolled and receive treatment of NNZ-
2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL for a total of 13 weeks.  Additional participants may be screened, enrolled, 
and treated to achieve appr oximately 20 study completers. 
There will be a total of 17 study visits, comprising 5 in-clinic visits, and 12 re mote telemedicine/in-home 
nurse visits. The study will commence with an appr oximately 4 to 6 week Screening and Baseline period. 
During this Screening/Baseline period, participants w ill be assessed for study eligibility and data will be 
collected to establish the particip ant’s baseline characteristics and sy mptom severity using a variety of 
assessments (Section 9.2). Two in-clinic visits and one remote/in -home visit (Visits 1, 2, 3) comprise 
Screening and Baseline.  
 Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will receiv e the starting dose of 4 mg/kg and then be up-titrated 
to the target dose (see Section 7.2). Participants will receive treatment for a total of 13 weeks. During the 
treatment period, there are three in-clinic visits: Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 9) and Week 13 (Visit 16). 
There is a combined remote, telemedicine visit by [CONTACT_3433] e site investigator and an in-home visit by a visiting 
nurse for safety at Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 4 (Visit 7), Week 8 (Visit 11) and Week 10 (Visit 13). These 
combination remote/in-home visits w ill be conducted simultaneously when ever possible, or they will be 
conducted on the same day with the telemedicine visit occurring first. If it is not feasible to conduct these visits simultaneously or on the same day, the telemedi cine portion of the visit and the nurse portion of the 
visit must be conducted on two consecu tive days. In-home visits with a vis iting nurse will be done at Weeks 
3 (Visit 6), 5 (Visit 8), 7 (Visit 10), 9 (Vis it 12), 11 (Visit 14), and 12 (Visit 15). 
 All participants will also have a remote post-treatment  visit with the Investigator via telemedicine and an 
in-person home visit by a visiting nurse approximately 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 15, Visit 
17).  For all visits designated as in-clinic, an in-person visi t is preferred. Off-site assessments may be allowed 
due to extenuating circumstances, such as those rela ted to the COVID-[ADDRESS_700695] be approved in  advance by [CONTACT_347188]. 
 Participants will be divided into three groups by [CONTACT_654]:  
x 13 to 17 years old (Group 1) 
x 8 to 12 years old (Group 2) 
x 3 to 7 years old (Group 3)  
Enrollment will commence with the oldest age group and will proceed as follows. After at least three 
participants in Group [ADDRESS_700696] rece ived two weeks of treatment at th e starting dose, the Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review data on safety, and tolerability. If tolerability and safety for those participants during the specified period is deem ed acceptable, enrollment for Group [ADDRESS_700697] two weeks of treatment, the DSMC will review data on safety, and tolerability. If tolerability and 
safety for Group 2 is deemed accepta ble, enrollment for Group 3 will co mmence and dosing will begin at 
the starting dose.

7.2 Dose-levels and Titration
The total administration period for NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50 mg/mL IMP will be 13 weeks. As 
outlined below in Table 4 ,the IMP will be administered open-label at a starting dose of 4 mg/kg BID for 
2 weeks. Following DSMC review and approval of each  dose titration, participants will be up-titrated to 
8 mg/kg BID for 2 weeks, and then to the 12 mg/kg BID dose . The participant will then continue on the 
assigned dose (or highest dose tolerated) for the remainder of the 13 weeks. The process for DSMC 
review of dose escalation is described in Section 7.2.2 .

The dose titration schedule may be modified based  on updated PK modelling incl uding data from the 
study.
7.2.1 Adjustment of the Dose for Tolerability
The dose for each participant is based on the participant’s weight at Baseline (Visit 3). The dose will not 
be increased or decreased if the participant’s weight  at a postbaseline visit changes. Within the up-
titration period, if a participant is deemed not to be tolerating the current dose within the 2-week period 
for that dose, and they have not met any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (Section 9.4.5 ), they can be down-titrated 
to the next lowest dose in the titration schedule. The  Investigator must attempt to increase the dose as 
soon as it is possible based on the clinical situation. The aim is to return to the or iginally assigned dose. If

dose until the DSMC has reviewed the data and approved  the participants to escalate to the next dose.  
 
After eligibility is confirmed, the participant will be administered NNZ-2591 IMP open label at a starting 
dose of 4 mg/kg BID for a total of approximately 3 we eks. After 2 weeks of dosing at 4 mg/kg BID, the 
DSMC will review the safety data. The participan t will remain on the starting dose during the DSMC 
review. If the DSMC determines that tolerability  and safety during the 2-week dosing period are 
acceptable, the participant will escalate to the ne xt dose of 8 mg/kg BID and be dosed for a total of 
approximately 3 additional weeks at that dose. After 2 weeks of dosing at 8 mg/kg BID, the DSMC will 
review the safety data. If the DSMC determines th at tolerability and safety during the 2-week dosing 
period on 8 mg/kg BID are acceptable, the participant w ill then escalate to the target dose of 12 mg/kg 
BID and be dosed for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of do sing at 12 mg/kg BID, the DSMC will review the 
safety data to determine if the participant can con tinue dosing at 12 mg/kg BID for the remainder of the 
[ADDRESS_700699] be conducted if possible. 
 
The site will inform the caregiver of the up-titrati on decisions as soon as possible after the site has 
received the official notification of the DSMC decision. The site will verify with the caregiver that instructions to up-titrate to 8 mg/kg BID have been fo llowed at the Week 4 visit (Visit 7), and will verify 
with the caregiver that instructions to up-titrate to 12 mg/kg BID have been followed at the Week 7 visit 
(Visit 10). If the DSMC has not yet approved the particip ant to escalate to the next dose by [CONTACT_361732], the site should contact [CONTACT_361733] [ADDRESS_700700] the caregiver to 
discuss appropriate follow-up as is cl inically indicated. At each visit, the clinician or nurse should check 
the dose when reviewing the caregiver diary.   
7.3 Treatment Assignment 
This is an open-label study in which all participan ts will be assigned to NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 
50mg/mL and receive 13 weeks of treatment. All partic ipants will be titrated to the dose of 12 mg/kg BID 
or the highest tolerated dose based  on the Dosing Schedule in Section 7.2. The dose titration schedule 
may be modified based on updated PK modelling including  data from the study. 
Participants who are unable to tolerate the study treatment may be discontinued from the study.  
If a participant meets all eligibility criteria and written informed consent has been  provided by a legally 
authorized representative, the participan t will be enrolled in the study.

appearance, abdominal/CVA, and edema. A suprapubic exam (bladder palpation) to assess for urinary retention may be performed. The vi siting nurse will review the caregive r diary, query oral intake, and 
review tolerability.   A combined remote visit or nurse-only in-home visit may be conducted in-clinic by [CONTACT_537934]. The site should inform the nursing service of such a 
change. If an unscheduled nurse visit is needed for follo w-up (e.g. repeat labs or other assessments), this 
can be requested by [CONTACT_537935]. The site should inform the Medical Monitor if they 
require an unscheduled nursing visit or w ill conduct a remote visit in the clinic. 
 The nurse will send a report for all in-home nurse visits to the Investigator along with a copy of the 
completed Caregiver Diary. The Investigator is responsible for reviewing the Caregiver Diary and 
determining if any issues should be reported as an a dverse event or require follow up. The visiting nurse 
will escalate any issues related to potential AE/SAEs, st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], major dosing issues or issues of 
potential safety concern to the Investigator the same day. Any chan ges noted will be provided to the 
Investigator who will be responsible fo r determining and reporting AE/SAEs.

9.5.[ADDRESS_700727] ome Assessment Instruments 
The battery of PTHS specific measures will evaluate symptom change in clin ically meaningful and 
functionally impactful symptom domains for individu als with PTHS including communication, cognition, 
motor function, maladaptive behavior, adaptive behavior s, sleep, seizures, breathing and GI issues (see 
Section 6.3.2). The selection of outcome measures for this study reflects the insights from the published 
literature, and expert clinical advice. All assessments will be administered in a standardiz ed manner by [CONTACT_537946]. To the extent 
possible, all efforts should be made to maintain th e same caregiver informant or investigator rater (as 
applicable) across visits for a single  participant. If in extenuating ci rcumstances (such as severe illness), 
the caregiver is unable to complete the rating for a visit, another appropriate rater can be designated to 
complete the assessment for that visit. This should be documented in the source  and the EDC. The site 
staff should ensure the alternative rater has appropriate knowledge of the participant to complete the 
rating and is informed of the instru ctions for completing the assessments. 
Caregivers will complete most assessments via an online portal. Paper versions of assessments will also 
be used and may be made available for online versio ns in the case of difficulty accessing the electronic 
portal. These assessments should be completed the day of the visit or no earlier than the day before the 
visit. No assessments can be conduc ted until informed consent has been given by [CONTACT_361738]. Also, training for the caregivers on all caregiver completed assessments must 
be completed before the caregiver ra ter may complete the assessments. 
Overall symptom severity and functional leve l will be assessed using the following tools: 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity assessments will be done at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), 
Week 6 (Visit 9), EOT (Week 13, Visit 16), and Fo llow-up (Week 15, Visit 17). The Clinical Global 
Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S)
36 is a 7-point scale that requires the In vestigator to rate the severity of 
the individual's overall illness at the time of assessment , relative to the Investigat or's past experience with 
participants who have the same diagnosis.36 Considering total clinical experi ence, a participant is assessed 
on severity of illness at the time of rating: 1, normal, not  at all impaired; 2, borderline, slightly impaired; 
3, mildly impaired; 4, moderately impaired; 5, markedly impaired; 6, severely impaired or 7, among the most extremely impaired ill. Following best practice for neurodevelopmental disorders, the CGI-S will be 
evaluated using PTHS-specific scoring anchors. The c linicians will provide an overall global severity 
rating and a severity rating for each of seven domains: language/comm unication, fine motor 
functioning/self-help, social initiation/social avoida nce, challenging behavior, ambulation/gross motor,

participant’s current state taking into consideration ob servations at the visit and symptoms within the last 
week.  To ensure that interpretation of the scoring ru bric is normalized amon g the raters, clinicians 
administering the CGI-S will be required to complete scoring calibration training. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) 
Clinical Global Impression of Improvement assessments will be made at Visit 9 (Week 6), EOT (Week 
13, Visit 16), and Follow-up (Week 15, Visit 17). The CGI-I scale36 requires the Investigator to rate how 
much the participant’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state. A 7-point scale is 
used with the following values: 1, very much improved;  2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no 
change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; 7, very  much worse.  The CGI-I will be evaluated using 
PTHS-specific scoring anchors. The clinicians will provide an overall global improvement rating and an 
improvement rating for each of seven domains: language /communication, social initiation/social 
avoidance, fine motor functioning/self-help challenging behavior, am bulation/gross motor, 
gastrointestinal issues, and autonomic/breathing abnormalities. The clinician should assess the 
participant’s current state taking into consideration ob servations at the visit and symptoms within the last 
week. The rating of change is compared with status at Baseline (Visit 3). To ensure that interpretation of 
the scoring rubric is normalized among the raters, clinicians administering the CGI-I will be required to 
complete scoring calibration training. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bayley Scales of Infant Development v4 (BS ID4) or Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales 
v5 (SB5) 
The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales version 5 (SB5) assessment w ill be done at Screening (Visit 1) and 
EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). SB5 is validated for ages 2 to 85+ and measures both verbal and nonverbal 
intellectual and cognitive abilities through a set of 10 subtests.37 General cognitive ability is reported as a 
full-scale intellectual quotient score (FSIQ). Cognitive ability in five categories are reported in the index 
scores: fluid reasoning (FR), knowledge (KN), quantit ative reasoning (QR), visual-spatial processing 
(VS), and working memory (WM). Non-verbal (NVIQ)  and verbal intelligence quotients (VIQ) are also 
calculated. Scoring of index scores and IQ will be calculated using the z-deviation method for intellectual 
disability.38  
The Bayley Scales of Infant Development version 4 (BSID-4) is conducted fo r participants who cannot 
achieve a basal score on SB5or for whom th e SB5 is developmentally inappropriate .39 Assessment will 
be done at Screening (Visit 1) and End of Trea tment (Week 13, Visit 16). The Bayley is a norm-
referenced developmental assessme nt validated for ages [ADDRESS_700728] andardized scores in five domains: Cognitive, 
Language, Motor, Social-Emotional, and Adaptive Beha vior. Scale scores, age equivalents and growth 
scale values (GSVs) can also be calculated fo r the scale subtests: cognition (CG), receptive 
communication (RC), expressive communication (EC), fi ne motor (FM), and gross motor (GM). Scaled 
scores and age equivalents can be calculated for the social emotional (SE) subscale. The Adaptive 
Behavior subscale will not be collected in this study. The Early Learning Composite score and scaled scores are calculated for children 42 months and you nger. Raw scores, age equivalents, and growth scale 
values are calculated for all participants. 
If the SB-5 or the Bayley had previously been admi nistered for the participant within 3 months of 
Screening, the scores from that administration ma y be used if it meets the following criteria: 1) 
assessment was administered by [CONTACT_8786], or another study site; 2) the site has access to all the 
scores required to be entered in the EDC; 3) the site has permission to share the scores from the 
previously administered assessment to the study ED C. Assessments done by [CONTACT_537947]. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.0

[IP_ADDRESS]  MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI) 
The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inve ntory (MB-CDI) will be completed at Baseline 
(Visit 3) and EOT (Week 13, Vis it 16). This caregiver-completed instrument assesses language 
development through vocabulary comprehension and production, gestures, and grammar.40 Designed to 
assess early language development in infants and toddle rs, it can also be used with older, developmentally 
delayed children to assess developm ental progress in language developm ent. The MB-CDI includes three 
modules based on chronological or developmental ag e: Words and Gestures (8- to 18- months or 
developmental equivalent), Words a nd Sentences (16- to 30-months or developmental equivalent) and the 
CDI-III, an extension of the MB-CDI used with child ren 30-[ADDRESS_700729] udy in line with the expected cognitive and language 
development of the study population. It assesses developi[INVESTIGATOR_537907] s in language including production of 
gestures, and vocabulary comprehe nsion and production which are repor ted as number of instances and 
percentile scores. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ORCA (Observer-Reported Communication Ability Measure) 
The Observer-Reported Communicatio n Ability Measure (ORCA) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) 
and EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). This caregiver-reported  measure was originally developed and validated 
for Angelman syndrome,41 to assess the individual’s overall co mmunicative ability and was designed to 
capture communicative abilities in low-verbal and non-verb al populations, so is relevant for PTHS. It was 
developed based on feedback from a patient-focused listening session with the advocacy community and 
the Food and Drug Administration following best prac tices for measure development including concept 
elicitation interviews with caregivers and communication experts, item generation, assessment of validity 
and psychometrics, and factor analysis conf irming single overall communication ability score.41-43 The 
rating scale evaluates the caregiver’s observation of the individual’s communication ability over the past 30 days.
42 The measure consists of 84 total questions with 70 behavioral items. It assesses communication 
abilities of individuals across all modalities: gestures, AAC (augmentative and alternative 
communication) and speech so is not dependent so lely on verbal abilities. Twenty-two communication 
concepts relevant to communicative ability in PTHS are assessed with in the categories of expressive 
communication, receptive communication, and pragmatic communication rendering a total 
communication score.   
[IP_ADDRESS]   Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Rating 
The Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Rating assessment is a syndrome-specific measure of 3 signs or symptoms 
of PTHS identified by [CONTACT_537948]/Baseli ne as being priority concerns in which they would 
like to see improvement as a result of treatment. The assessment will be comple ted at all Screening and 
Baseline visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 (Visit 9), EOT (Visit 16), a nd Follow-up (Visit 17). 
In this assessment, concerns are id entified on an individual, per-par ticipant basis. The clinician should 
review the assessment with the caregiver at the Screen ing visit, ideally as part of the overall medical and 
clinical history. Caregivers should be encouraged , in selecting the concerns, to identify distinct, 
observable symptoms rather than broad ones. And ca regivers should be advised to consider symptoms 
that they feel are important and have an impact  on their child’s daily functioning and well-being.  
Caregivers are asked to identify 3 concerns from  among 11 clinically important symptom domains: 
Language/Communication, Social in terest/avoidance, Repetitive Beha viors, Challenging Behaviors, 
Gross motor skills, Fine motor skills, Gastrointestinal problems, Breath ing Disruptions, Sleep, Seizures, 
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_700730] any domain and choose any symptom of concern within that domain. The same three 
concerns identified at screening/baseline are carrie d forward and rated at the follow-up visits. The 
severity of each concern is scored by [CONTACT_537949] g a 10-point Likert scale or severity. The caregiver 
should give consideration to symptoms within the last two weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-2) 
The ABC-2 will be completed at all Screening and Base line visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 
(Visit 9), EOT (Week 13, Visit 16), and Follow-up (Visit 17). The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-
2)44 is a caregiver-completed rating scale for assessin g problem behaviors that has been validated in a 
variety of clinical populations and been used as  an outcome measure in clinical trials of 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) across much of the lifespan.44 The rater considers the relative 
frequency of an individual’s behavior s and gives a rating of the severity of the problem it presents: 0, not 
at all a problem; 1, the behavior is a problem but slight in degree; 2, the problem is moderately serious; 3, 
the problem is severe in degree. Th e caregiver should give consideration to symptoms within the last two 
weeks.  
The ABC-2 includes 58 items providing five subscale scores: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic 
Behavior, Hyperactive/Noncompliance, and Inappropri ate Speech. These subscales have been shown to 
have good consistency, reliability, and validity with normative data available for specific populations 
including children with intellectual disability and ASD.45 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Behavior Problems Inventory -Short form (BPI-SF) 
The Behavior Problems Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) and at the 
EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). The BPI-SF is a caregiver-c ompleted rating scale for assessing self-injury, 
aggressive and stereotyped behavior.46, 47 Frequency is assessed for all three types of behavior on a five-
point scale from 0 (Never), 1 (Monthly), 2 (Weekly ), 3 (Daily) and 4 (Hourly). For self-injury and 
aggression, severity is also assessed on a 3-point scale of mild, moderate, or severe. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Caregiver Impression of Change 
The Caregiver Impression of Change assessment w ill be done at the EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). The 
Caregiver is asked to rate the change in his or her child’s overall function and well-being since the 
Baseline visit (Visit 3), and the change in specific symptom domains. Ratings are made using a 7-point 
Likert scale:1-Very much improved, 2-Much impr oved, 3-Improved, 4-Unchanged, 5-Worse, 6-Much 
worse, 7-Very much worse. For the rating of overall function, the caregiver also identifies the one symptom area or feature that has most influenced his or her rating of the child’s overall function and provides a description of symptom changes and the impa ct of the changes. The assessment of change 
should be made since the Baseline visit (Visit 3). The caregiver should assess the participant’s current state at the visit taking into consideration observatio ns at the visit and symptoms within the last week. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Quality of Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability) 
The Quality of Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) and EOT (Week 13, Visit 16).
48-50 The QI-Disability48 is a caregiver-report measure that assesses a child’s well-
being and quality of life over the past month. Designed to be relevant for children who have an 
intellectual disability, the QI-Disability  includes 32 questions in 6 domains: Social Interaction, Physical 
Health, Independence, Positive Em otions, Leisure and the Outdoors, and Negative Emotions. The QI-
Disability has been validated in individuals ages 5 to  18 with Rett syndrome, Downs syndrome, CDKL5

[IP_ADDRESS]  Impact of Childhood Neurological Disab ility-Overall Quality of Life Rating (ICND) 
The Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale (I CND) will be administered at Baseline (Visit 3) 
and at End of Treatment (Week 13, Visit 16). The IC ND was developed to evaluate the impact that a 
child’s condition has on the child’s and the family’s everyday life .[ADDRESS_700731] of 
four conditions or health problems on the child’s or the family’s life, and evaluates the child’s overall 
quality of life. In this study, only the overall qua lity of life assessment will be completed. The caregiver 
will rate overall quality of life of the participant by [CONTACT_361751]: “Please rate your child’s 
overall ‘Quality of Life’ on the scale below. Choose the number which you feel is best and circle it”. The choices range from 1 (“Poor”) to 6 (“Excellent”). The caregiver should consider the child’s status in the last month including their current condition. .
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) 
The Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) will be completed by [CONTACT_2299]’s caregiver at all Screening and Baseline visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 (Visit 9), EO T (Week 13, Visit 16), and 
Follow-up (Visit 17). The CSHQ gath ers information on bedtime and a ssesses sleep behavior, waking 
during the night, and morning waking/daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]
52 to assess both behavioral and medical sleep 
disorders. The CSHQ has been used across a range of NDDs including PTHS and has been used as an 
outcome measure for sleep intervention trials.53-55 It provides a total score and eight subscale scores: 
bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night awakenings, parasomnias, sleep 
disordered breathing, and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The car egiver should consider sleep behaviors within the 
last week in doing their ratings.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-[ADDRESS_700732] Editio n (Comprehensive Interview version, Vineland-3) 
will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) and EOT (Wee k 13, Visit 16). This standardized meas ure assesses 
development and adaptive functioni ng which correspond to the domains of adaptive functioning used in 
the DSM-5: Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization.56 The Vineland will be conducted as 
an interview by a trained site rater with the care giver. The measure provides an overall adaptive 
functioning score, and standardized domain scores in Daily Living Skills, Communication, Socialization 
and Motor Skills. The Vineland also has a maladaptive behavior domain which will not be completed in 
this study. V-scale scores and growth scale values (GSV) can also be calculated for the subdomains. The 
GSV scores on the Vineland have been found to be more  sensitive to change than standardized scores for 
developmentally de layed populations.57 Raw scores, standardized scores, v-scale scores, age equivalents, 
and GSV will be calculated for all participants. For par ticipants 3 to 9 years of age, Motor Skills can be 
calculated; for those older than 9 years old, sc ores will not be calculated for Motor Skills. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  GI Health Questionnaire (GIHQ) 
The Gastrointestinal Health Questionn aire (GIHQ) will be completed by [CONTACT_2299]’s caregiver at all 
Screening and Baseline visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 (Visit 9), EO T (Week 13, Visit 16), and 
Follow-up (Visit 17). The measure was developed for use in NDDs and validated in individuals with Rett syndrome and includes GI symptoms that are relevant for PTHS.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Modified 2-Minute Walk Test 
The modified 2-Minute Walk test (2MWT)59 is an assessment of how far an individual can walk during a 
2 minute period which assesses endurance and also has relevance for everyday functioning. The 2MWT 
will be done at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3) and at the EOT (Week 13, Visit 16).  For this 
assessment, the individual with PTHS walks back an d forth between two cones on a 20-meter track for 
two minutes and the total distance covered is measur ed. The modified 2MWT requires two assessors and 
one walk assistant. The walk a ssistant knows the person with PTHS well (e.g., parent, caregiver, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) and provides the necessary physical support for the person to keep his/her balance and to 
maintain the highest possible gait speed.  
9.5.10  Caregiver Diary 
A Caregiver Diary will be completed daily by [CONTACT_537953]. In the diary,  the participant’s caregiver will record dosing 
compliance of IMP, any changes in concomitant me dication or treatments, urine output measured by 
[CONTACT_537954], any changes in sympto ms including changes in or al intake, sleep activity, 
seizure activity, and breathing events. The diary also sp ecifically queries changes in maladaptive behavior 
or self-injury which may suggest changes in the te ndency to self-harm. At the Screening visit, the 
clinician will review the assessment with the caregiver and assist the caregiver to define the child’s 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_537908], breathing abnormalities, sleep is sues or other chronic conditions that are to be 
tracked in the diary. Any new, emergent types of se izures or breathing abnormalities, or any other new 
symptoms will also be docum ented if they occur.  
The Investigator must review the caregiver diary at or after each visit. At clinic visits, the Investigator 
will review the diary and the site will provide a new diary section to the caregiver. At remote visits, the nurse will review the diary in the home noting any potential issues in the nurse report and collect the diary to send to the Investigator along with notes from the visit. The nurse will provide the caregiver with a new 
diary section for the upcoming week. The nurse will not sign-off on the diary. The Investigator is 
responsible for reviewing the nurse notes, reviewing th e diary, signing the diary, and determining if 
anything needs to be reported as an Adverse Event.  
 
9.6 Pharmacokinetic Measurements 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected in accordance with the sampling schedule outlined in  
Table 2 for ages 7 to 17 years old and Table 3 for ages 3 to < 7 years old.  The date and actual time (hour 
and minute) that each sample is collected must be accu rately recorded. The site mu st also ensure that the 
date and time of the previous evening’s dose and the morning and evening dose on the day the sample is 
collected is accurately collected in the Caregiver Diary.  
For the Week 2, 6, and 13 data collection, the prev ious day’s PM dose should be taken in the evening as 
late as possible, preferably before bedtime. The pre-dose sample should be taken [ADDRESS_700735]-dose samples, sample collection can be

Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_700737] 30 minutes from the previous sample). Th e actual collection time is recorded. The post-dose 
windows are determined from the first dose of the visit (morning dose) and all PK samples should be 
collected before the second dose (PM dose). Full de tails regarding the PK sampling collection, storage 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_537909] e Laboratory Manual for the study. 
PK blood samples may be collected from a cannula por t or via venipuncture. Pre-prepared PK sampling 
tubes will be provided to each site within the lab vi sit kits for collection and storage of PK samples.  
Samples of whole blood will be collected, aliquoted, and will be stored at minus 20°C (or colder) no more 
than [ADDRESS_700738] orage and analysis. It is essential that accurate 
records are maintained regarding the date and time ea ch PK sample is obtained, and the date and time 
each sample is placed in the 20°C freezer. The date and time of the most recent dose of IMP and most 
recent meal relative to that dose should  be recorded in the Caregiver Diary.  
Minimum requirements for a participant to be c onsidered evaluable within the PK population are 
administration of NNZ-2591 per protocol through to th e morning dose at Visit 5 (Week 2) as a minimum, 
and collection of PK samples at the specified post-dos e time point(s) through to Visit 5 (Week 2) as a 
minimum.

10. ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator and site staff are responsible for dete ction, recording and reporting of events that meet 
the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as de scribed below. At in-home nurse visits, the nurse will do 
a query of any changes for potential AE/SAEs and document observations from the targeted physical 
exam. The nurse will escalate any issu es related to AE/SAEs, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], major dosing issues, or 
issues of potential safety concern to the Investigator the same day. Any changes noted will be provided to 
the Investigator who will be responsible for determining, recording, and reporting any events that qualify as AE/SAEs. 
10.[ADDRESS_700739] medical occurrence  associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE ca n be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease tempor ally associated with the use of a drug, without 
any judgment about causality.   
AEs can include the following: 
x Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-ex isting condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
x Conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP admini stration even though it may have been present 
prior to the start of the study. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either IMP or a concurrent 
medication. 
SAEs are a sub-category of AEs that are defined in Section 10.2, below. AEs/SAEs are recorded and 
reported from the time of first dose of IMP until Follow-up (Visit 17). 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_361703] a diseas e that existed prior to administration of IMP or 
enrollment in the clinical study are generally not to  be considered AEs. Individuals who have planned 
surgical procedures that would occur during the study are to be excluded from the study (Exclusion 43).  
If the participant has a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (non -surgical), the Investigator should consult with the 
Medical Monitor to ensure this will not cause disrup tion of IP administration or would not qualify the 
participant for exclusion.  
Note that medical or surgical procedures are no t considered AEs (e.g., endoscopy); however, the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
10.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropri ate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the outcomes listed 
in this definition. 
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_700740] be 
reported. These are referred to as treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  All AEs must be recorded 
irrespective of whether they are considered drug related. 
At each visit/assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_537955]. 
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing, should be reviewed at 
subsequent visits. If these have r esolved, this should be documented. 
10.7 Recording of AEs and SAEs 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation  
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relevant to the event. The Investigator 
should then record all relevant info rmation regarding an AE/SAE on the eCRF. It is not acceptable for the 
Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion 
of the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF pages. However, there may be instances when the Sponsor requests 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_54723]. In this instance, all partic ipant identifiers will be removed on 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_5191]. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis  of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information. In such ca ses, the diagnosis should be docu mented as the AE/SAE and not the 
individual signs/symptoms.  
10.8 Evaluating AEs and SAEs 
10.8.1  Assessment of Intensity 
The Investigator will make an assessment of intens ity for each AE and SAE reported during the study.  
The assessment will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE 
recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to  one of the following three categories: 
Mild:   
An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299],  causing minimal discomfort  and not interfering with 
everyday activities. 
Moderate:   
An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. 
Severe:   
An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confus ed with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for 
rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs  can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as 
‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-de fined outcomes as described in Section 10.2 Definition of 
Serious Adverse Event.  
10.8.2  Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relations hip between IMP and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. 
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determ ine the relationship. Alternative causes such as 
natural history of the underlying dise ases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal 
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.0 
Confidential Neu-2591-PTHS-001 October 30, 2023 
 
  Page 93 of 112 relationship of the event to the IMP will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult 
the Investigator’s Brochure in the dete rmination of his/her assessment.   
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_361704] a ‘reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event’ and on that basis be classified as either 
‘related’ or ‘not related’. 
There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the Investigator always 
make an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE form to the Sponsor.  
The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_327421]-up information, amending the 
SAE form accordingly.   
10.8.3  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively fo llow each participant and 
provide further information to the Sponsor on the participant’s condition. 
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_5258], will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until 30 days after the 
participant’s Visit [ADDRESS_700741]. At which time, the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF 
page(s) will be updated. SAEs and renal AEs that are ongoing at the Follow-u p visit (Visit 17) will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization of participant condition, or study end, whichever occurs first. In 
such cases, follow-up Serious Advers e Event Report (SAER)  forms will 
be completed at the Follow-up visit (Visit 17) as well as completed upon resolution, stabilization, or study 
end, whichever occurs first. “Study end” is when all participants have completed the study. 
The Investigator will ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental in vestigations as may be indicated 
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or  SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
The Sponsor may request that the Investigator pe rform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE.  The Investigator is obligated to assist. If a participant dies during the study or during a recognized 
follow-up period, the Sponsor will be provided with a copy of the death certificate and any post-mortem 
findings, including histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE  
with all changes signed and da ted by [CONTACT_737].  The update d SAE form should be re-sent to 
the Sponsor within the time frames outlined below in Section 10.8 Prompt Reporting of the SAEs to the 
Sponsor.  
Any clinical adverse event that is serious (as define d above in Section 10.2)  
  occurring during the course 
of the study, irrespective of the treatment received by [CONTACT_2299], must be reported to the Sponsor and 
Sponsor’s agent within 24 hrs (or sooner if possible) of the Investigator or designee becoming aware of the situation.

  Page 97 of 112 Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population 
 
The PK population will include all par ticipants enrolled in this study wh o receive the IMP through to the 
morning dose of Visit 5 (Week 2) as a minimum, and who undergo PK sample collection at the specified 
post-dose time point(s) through to Visit [ADDRESS_700742] clinical study for NNZ-2591 IMP in this population, treatment change  estimates were based on 
Clinical Global Impression Scale of Improvement (CG I-I) data from completed clinical trials in other 
rare, neurodevelopmental disorders.  
Based on the information provided in Glaze et al. 2019 (Double-blind, randomiz ed, placebo-controlled 
study of trofinetide in pediatric Rett syndrome), the standard deviation of the CG I-I is approximately 0.[ADDRESS_700743] a difference of 
0.55 units of change in the CGI-I at a power of 0.90. For a power of 0.80, 0.85, and 0.90, the detectable 
difference would be 0.48, 0.51, and 0.55 or larger, respectively. 
11.2 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Popula tion and based on the safety endpoints listed in 
Section 6.3.1. Adverse events and other safety data will be  summarized as frequencies and percentages, 
described in terms of severity and potential attribu tion. Objective safety asse ssments will be summarized 
over time on study; shift tables at time points of interest may be generated. The safety analysis details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
11.3 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_361721]-participant changes from the Baseline period to the EOT 
using the efficacy endpoints listed in Section 6.3.2. 
 The participant’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity will be established based on assessments collected during the 4 to 6 week Sc reening/Baseline period. Baseline valu es will be based on the average 
values of visits 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_700744] significance level will be computed.  
 Potentially influential factors will be considered and addressed with a linear regression model. This model may include covariates such as age, sex, nonverb al NVIQ or NVIQ equivalent, genotype, history of 
regression (yes/no), ASD diagnosis (yes/no) with no more than two covariates included in any model. 
Descriptive statistics and corresponding graphics will be used to present the results. The safety and 
efficacy analysis details will be specified in the SAP.

  Page 98 of 112 11.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK analysis will be based on the endpoints listed in Section 6.3.1 . Pharmacokinetic (PK) measures 
will be collected from all participants at Visits 5 (Week 2), 9 (Week 6), and 16 (Week 13, EOT).   
NNZ-2591 PK concentrations will be listed by [CONTACT_537956]. The concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_5586], dose level, and age group. For 
the concentrations measured at trough points dose re lationship will be examin ed statistically with age 
group and/or body weight of participant as covariate. 
Overall exposure parameters for NNZ-2591 such as C max and AUC tau may be derived by [CONTACT_361720]-
compartmental analysis (NCA). Ad ditionally, PK concentrations of NNZ-[ADDRESS_700745] 
NCA approach will be used for simulated profiles to calculate parameters C max, AUC tau, etc. for 
characterization of NNZ-2591 exposure in pediatric participants. 
The PK analysis details will be specified in the PK SAP. 
11.5 Biomarkers and Microbiome 
Blood and stool samples will be collected for an explor atory analysis of biomarkers and gut microbiome. 
The analysis will be detailed in a separate analys is plan but will not include DNA sequencing. Samples 
will be collected at Screening (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 3, before dosing) and at the EOT visit (Week 
13, Visit 16), or upon early termination.

device/computer (e.g., 12-lead ECG) or in an online format or paper format (e.g ., clinician and caregiver 
rating scales) and are to be obtained at the time of testing. It is imperative that the Investigator ensures 
that all tests are completed at each session, according to the participant’s capability. Data collected at the 
site will be entered into the eCRFs in centrali zed, password protected EDC system. Checking for 
completeness and rationality will be undertaken via th e EDC at a central location. If discrepancies are 
noted, the site monitor will be al erted and site follow-up undertaken in order that problems may be 
resolved immediately. This may require retraining of investigators on the testing process and the importance of competing the testing correctly.  
13.4 Auditing 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor nominee) may conduct period ic audits of the study processes including, but not 
limited to, the clinical site and the bioanalytical labo ratory. The Investigator must authorize access and 
make available all study related documents to au thorized Sponsor’s representatives and regulatory 
authorities. 
The scope of a clinical site audit may include but will not be limited to drug accountability, regulatory 
documentation, the informed consent process, a nd comparison of eCRFs against source data. The

14.1 Informed Consent 
Written informed consent will be obtained from a pa rent or legally authorized representative of the 
participant before any study-related procedures are performed. The Investigator has an ethical and legal 
responsibility to ensure the parent or legally au thorized representative of each participant being 
considered for inclusion in the study is given a full explanation of the study. The Investigator or designee 
shall inform the parent or legally authorized repres entative of each participant in writing of all aspects 
pertaining to the participant’s participation in th e study including (but not limited to) aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and potential risks. The particip ant’s parent or legally authorized representative will 
have the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether to participate.  
A participant’s parent or legally authorized representa tive should understand that they are free to refuse to 
allow the participant to participate in, and are free to  withdraw the participant from, the study at any time 
without prejudice or loss of medical care to which they are otherwise entitled. They have the ability to 
withdraw the participant from the study at any time, for any reason. 
The parent or legally authorized representative of each participant must personally sign and date a study-
specific informed consent form on behalf of the pa rticipant to be a participant in the study. The 
participant’s caregiver who will complete the study assessments must also provide written informed 
consent regarding their participation in the study prior to participating in any study procedures. The form 
must be countersigned by [CONTACT_9257] w ho conducted the informed consent discussion (or an 
authorized designee). Authorized designees will be  defined according to local center and ethics 
requirements. Their authorization will be documented on a written informed consent form, which, 
together with this protocol, will be approved by [CONTACT_2717].  
A separate consent for potential re-use of leftover Biomarker and PK samples in later research, including 
potential genetic research, is optional. 
Each informed consent will include the elements required by U.S. 21 CFR 50 and ICH E6, Section 4.8. 
The Investigator agrees to obtain approval from the IRB and Sponsor for any written informed consent 
form proposed for use in the study prior to submission to the IRB. 
Each parent or legally authorized representative w ho provides written informed consent for a participant 
to participate in the study (by [CONTACT_361762]) will be given a copy of the signed informed 
consent form, and assent form if the minor is capable of signing an assent form or providing oral consent 
as required by [CONTACT_361763]. The originals will be kept in the center’s regulatory file and a second 
copy filed in the participant’s medica l record as permitted by [CONTACT_378909]. The Investigator will inform 
participants and the parent or legally authorized repr esentative of new information that may be relevant to 
the participant’s willingness to contin ue participation in the study according to local ethics requirements. 
It is important to obtain complete follow-up for all pa rticipants enrolled. Every attempt should be made to 
undertake all protocol specified assessments and complete the eCRF except for those participants who 
specifically withdraw consent for release of such information.

15.2 Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
An independent DSMC will monitor the progress of the tr ial and ensure that the safety of trial participants 
is not compromised. The DSMC will pr ovide independent affirmation that no safety or tolerability issues 
are arising in the study through their on-going review  of the study data. Specifically, the DSMC will 
review the clinical safety data prior to any individua l dose titration and prior to initiation of subsequent 
age groups. The DSMC will review safety data and make an adjudication on: 1) the ability for any 
individual participant to escalate to the next higher dos e and 2) the ability for enrollment to begin in the 
younger age groups (Groups 2 and 3).  
The DSMC will minimally consist of a clinical chair, ot her physicians experienced in clinical trials with

Appendix A.  Allometric scaling to det ermine phase 2 exposures 
 
To determine the appropriate dose for pediatric participants, the Sponsor performed allometric scaling as 
discussed with the FDA in the Pre-IND Meeting. The findings from the allometric scaling analysis are 
summarized below . 
The allometric scaling analysis wa s performed using the pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 study of 
NNZ-2591 in healthy adults (PK Report Neu-2591-HV-001) . The purpose of the allometric scaling is to 
predict exposure in younger and lighter participan ts based on observed exposures in adult healthy 
volunteers at steady-state from the completed clinical study (Neu-2591-HV-001) for the dose of 12 mg/kg (cohort M2). 
1. Methods for the Allometric Scaling  
Steady-state PK parameters were used in the modeling. Median and percentiles were estimated for steady-
state clearance CLss/F on Day 7 morning dose for the adult participants in the Neu-2591-HV-001 study to 
be used as input for allometric scaling. Median and 5th and 95th percentiles for the AUC
tau at steady-state 
for the adult participants were us ed as a target exposure in childre n for comparison of the results.  
Fi value was already accounted for in the appa rent steady state clearance CLss/F. The WT centered  value for 
the study was median body weight for the participan ts in M1 and M2 cohorts of the study Neu-2591-HV-
001 was equal to 73 kg.  Median CLss/F derived for steady-state expo sure for Day 7 morning dose was used as CL
TV. Since the 
CLss/F was derived for body weight adjusted do ses and hence was estimated as L/hr/kg for the 
simulations, the value was multiplied by [CONTACT_361767] 73 kg to represent true value for the 
population of adult participants in the study Neu-2591-HV-001.  
For simulation of exposure for children 3-17 (the pl anned age group for the Phase 2 study), the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Growth Individual charts with 3rd and 97th percentiles (3rd, 
10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th) were dow nloaded from the CDC.gov website. The body weights 
for boys and girls from 36.5 months (3 years) to 17 y ears old (203.5 months) inclusive were combined for 
the input to Phoenix WinNonLin as a csv file. The file contained columns for 3rd, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 
75th, 90th, 95th, and 97th percentiles for each month of age and gender individually. Column with gender was added for the combined dataset. Age groupi[INVESTIGATOR_537915] 1 (3 to 
< 6), Group 2 (6 to <12), and 12-17. 
The equation for allometric scaling was implemented in the Data Wizard function of Phoenix WinNonLin 
using weight for children of different age, gender, and percentile as direct input.  
Doses were varied in the range from 11 to 20 mg/kg for final estimate with 1 mg/kg increments. The dose 
levels 11, 12, 13, 14, … 20 mg/kg were used to calcu late the related exposures for different body weight 
values and compare the resulting AUC
tau values with adult results.  
Additionally, a 17.5-mg/kg dose was evaluated for th e lowest body weights. Preliminary evaluation of 
suitable doses was done starting from 3 mg/kg dose le vels. The parameters derived for this allometric 
scaling were AUC tau at steady state to compare with adult exposures. 
 
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinic al Trial Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_700761] doses and multiple steady-state 
doses of NNZ-2591 in healthy adult participants . Evaluation of dose proportionality supported the 
application of the published allometric scaling formula to steady state exposure parameter AUC tauto be 
matched to adult exposures using body weight nor malized dose in mg/kg and apparent steady state 
clearance in healthy adult participants. The predicted exposures (steady-state AUC tau) were calculated 
from adult median CLss/F, estimated for morning and evening 12 mg/kg doses on Day 7 in the study 
Neu-2591-HV-001, for different dose values and body weights from CDC Growth Chart. 
The findings showed that overall the predicted pedi atric exposures were lower than adult exposures for 
the 12mg/kg dose for comparisons of exposure for di fferent dose values versus weight. Combining the 
dose into 3 age groups resulted in significant overlap of body weight and differen ces in the dose projected 
to match adult exposure for 12 mg/kg dose within th e group. Hence, body weight -based dosing instead of 
age-related dosing was originally proposed for the do se selection for children. The combined plots of 
AUC tauvs weight are as shown in Figure A1.

Neuren.phxproj; CDC Growth chart reported in Figure [ADDRESS_700763] been 
administered to the older group instead of exposur e-equivalent weight-based doses at higher nominal 
doses. Given that it was estimated from allometric scaling that exposures would be lower for children < 
70 kg at 12 mg/kg than for adults at 12 mg/kg, dosing all children at a maximum of 12 mg/kg will not put 
them at risk of exposures higher than that experienced by [CONTACT_361768]. So, this approach to the dosing maintains the balance between risk and benefit for this first Phase 2 study in the Angelman syndrome 
population.

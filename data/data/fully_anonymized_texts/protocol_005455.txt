Page 3 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 1.[ADDRESS_1010475], when compared to premenopausal women. β 1 selective antagonists (or “β 1 
blockers”) are used to lower heart rate and improve O 2 supply-to-demand balance in patients with coronary 
artery disease3. By [CONTACT_739503] (increased heart rate 
and cardiac output) we can examine peripheral mechanisms of O [ADDRESS_1010476] active muscle O 2 supply to an acute reduction in systemic O 2 delivery 
during large muscle dynamic exercise when compared to younger premenopausal women.
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary outcome variable is the difference in the change in skeletal muscle oxygenation (%SmO 2) in the 
active leg muscle from baseline during recumbent cycling exercise between saline and esmolol (∆%∆SmO 2). We 
predict that older women will have a greater ∆%∆SmO [ADDRESS_1010477] of concurrent sympathetic stimulation via isometric 
handgrip exercise on active thigh and inactive forearm muscle ∆%∆SmO 2. We will also include measurements of 
blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and VO 2. 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
Understanding the mechanisms facilitating the acute adjustments in oxygen uptake (VO 2) during large muscle 
exercise is biomedically important, as it is a major determinant of exercise tolerance17,18 and functional quality of 
life1 in both health and disease. The physiological adjustments that mediate increases in VO 2 during exercise are 
highly integrated and involve increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic and exercising muscle blood 
flow, and arterial-venous O 2 content (primarily via increased O 2 extraction)9. The matching of O 2 delivery-to-
utilization/demand during dynamic exercise, and the speed with which these processes occur at exercise onset 
(kinetics), reflects the integrated functioning of the autonomic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and muscular 
metabolic systems which in turn determine the necessity for substrate-level (nonoxidative) energy supply and 
subsequent exercise tolerance/intolerance22.  
Interventions that alter the normal balance between sympathetic control, active muscle O [ADDRESS_1010478] the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating kinetic and steady state VO 2 
responses to exercise. Studies employing beta-adrenergic blockade, which acutely reduce heart rate, contractility, 
and systemic O 2 delivery (refs), report compensatory increases in systemic4,6 and leg15,16 arterial-venous O 2 content 
difference during submaximal cycling exercise in healthy younger humans.
Age- and sex-related differences in O 2 utilization. It has been previously shown that older women demonstrate an 
attenuated ability to increase cardiac output and leg vascular conductance during moderate-intensity (50-60 
watts) cycling exercise resulting in reduced leg blood flow and O 2 delivery19. However, unlike older men (who 
displayed no reduction in leg blood flow during exercise), older women did not demonstrate an increase in O 2 
extraction compared to their younger counterparts21. It is unclear whether these differences represent a better-
preserved ability to deliver oxygen to active muscle or an impairment in oxygen extraction. By [CONTACT_739504], we will attempt to further reduce oxygen delivery to examine oxygen extraction in young vs older 
women.

Page 4 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) Age-related reductions in Functional Sympatholysis. Previous studies, both from our lab19,21 and others8,23, indicate 
substantial age differences in the ability of metabolically active muscles to blunt sympathetic vasoconstriction 
(functional sympatholysis). The age-related attenuation of this response is particularly evident in older post-
menopausal women and could contribute, along with an accelerated stiffening of central arteries and altered 
baroreflex function, to the exaggerated systemic blood pressure responses observed in these women when they 
perform dynamic exercise. Isometric handgrip has been established as a reliable way to acutely augment systemic 
sympathetic outflow2,[ADDRESS_1010479]-menopausal women5. The present study will assess how functional 
sympatholysis is affected by [CONTACT_739505]-mediated reduction in cardiac output during dynamic cycling 
exercise and how this response may differ between younger and older women. 
2.2 Previous Data
Because of its rapid onset and offset, Esmolol is used commonly in anesthesia and critical care to treat tachycardia.  
Our dose-finding studies indicated that infusing of ~125 mg of Esmolol (range 90 to 162 mg) acutely blocks beta-
1 adrenergic receptors (β1ARs) in healthy young men and women14.  β1ARs remain blocked in these subjects if a 
maintenance infusion of Esmolol continues.  When the infusion ends, the β1ARs return to baseline within [ADDRESS_1010480] esmolol to transiently reduce exercise heart rate in 
a mixed (age and sex) sample of healthy adults20.  Larger reductions in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived 
oxyhemoglobin/myoglobin O 2 saturation (an index of O 2 extraction) were observed within the exercising leg 
muscles (vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius) of these subjects during esmolol (vs. saline) infusion20.  These 
findings provide strong evidence of the dynamic coupling that exists between systemic O 2 delivery and active 
muscle O 2 extraction during submaximal exercise in humans. 
2.3 Study Rationale
The effects of infused Esmolol on the heart are rapid (observed within 5 min), quickly reversible (9 min half-life), 
and do not provoke lightheadedness, nausea, or significant hypotension in healthy adults14.  This is in contrast to 
non-selective (β1+β2) blockers such as Propranolol, which are not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_1920].  The use of β1-selective 
blockade is also advantageous in these studies because it does not impact β2-mediated responses in skeletal 
muscle (as we have shown with Esmolol14) and does not appear to suppress skeletal muscle glycolysis or hasten 
exercising muscle fatigue in the way that non-selective blockade does11.

7.0 Study Design and Procedures
7.1 Study Design
Design:  single blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover (each person receives both treatments)
Subjects:  young and older women (2 groups, n=13 completed subjects each)
Independent variable:   β1 selective blockade with Esmolol vs. saline
Dependent variables:  heart rate, cardiac output, arm BP, finger BP, VO 2, forearm, forehead, thigh and 
calf NIRS
There will be one screening visit and two study visits (one non-infusion and one infusion). The 
procedures for each visit are outlined in the diagram below:
 
STUDY00010736
Approval: 10/17/2023
Page 11 of 33 (V.01/21/2019)   
This is a single-blind study because, although the subjects, data collectors, and data analysts will not be 
aware of the treatment order, the nurses monitoring the subjects will be aware of the label on the infusion 
bag (Esmolol or saline). The nurses will be assessing safety (i.e., HR, BP, and symptoms).  However, the 
nurses will not be involved in any data analysis.  
Esmolol hydrochloride (2500 mg in 250 ml normal saline) will be purchased from McKesson in pre-mixed 
bags.  The placebo will be a 250 ml, 500 ml, or 1000 ml bag of normal saline.  The volume and rate of 
infusion will be constant for both trials.  Once the infusion pump is programmed by [CONTACT_54340], 
an opaque bag will be placed over the fluid bag so that the participants and researchers remain blinded 
to the treatment order.  
7.2 Study Procedures
7.2.1 Visit 1 (screening visit) 
When research staff schedules the subject (over the phone), the subject will be told to avoid alcohol, over 
the counter cold prep and NSAIDs, and strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and to eat a small meal 2-3 hours 
prior to coming to the laboratory.  They will also be asked to refrain from items containing caffeine 12 
hours prior to this visit. All participants will review their medications, including beta-blockers, with one of 
the research nurses.  This information will be shared with the CRC clinician who will then recommend 
which medications can be taken prior to the patient’s scheduled second and third study visit, and which 
ones should be withheld until after each study visit.  
During the first visit, informed consent will be obtained.  Women of childbearing potential (pre-
menopausal) will take a urine pregnancy test to ensure they are not pregnant.  This will be done at all [ADDRESS_1010489] will then complete a medical history 
questionnaire (all subjects) and a physical activity history questionnaire.  The subject will also have their 
height and weight (without shoes) and waist circumference measured.  The subject will then undergo a 
physical exam and a resting EKG (conducted by [CONTACT_80348]).  A venous blood draw will then be 
performed by a CRC nurse and sent for analysis (CBC and CMP; 7.5 ml total).  Lab values will be 
verified/signed off by a CRC clinician before infusion begins, and will be obtained no more than [ADDRESS_1010490] will then be asked to squeeze the handgrip device for approximately 1 minute at 
40% of their maximum effort.   Immediately after, we will ask the subject how they tolerated the 40% grip 
task (rating of perceived effort scale).  This procedure will familiarize the subject with the handgrip before 
they are asked to perform these tasks (for longer durations) during visits 2 and 3.  Analysis of the blood

Approval: 10/17/2023
Page 12 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) tests, EKG and medical history/exam results, and the subject’s tolerance to the handgrip will collectively 
determine the final eligibility of the participant.
(Figure from Iannetta et al., 2020)[ADDRESS_1010491] will then lay on an exam bed for placement of EKG pads and a doppler ultrasound device 
will be used to determine skinfold thickness of the thigh. The NIRS sensors will then be placed (one on the 
forearm, one on the forehead and two on the leg). The subject will then be assisted onto the recumbent 
bike. The subject will be asked to squeeze a handgrip device as hard as they can with their hand.  The 
maximum force they can exert (highest of 2 to 3 efforts) will be used to determine how hard they will 
squeeze this device later in the study (40% of this maximum value).  A silicone face mask will be placed 
over the subject’s nose and mouth to monitor their oxygen consumption and breathing frequency, and 
blood pressure devices will be placed over their arm (SunTech Tango) and finger (Finometer). After all 
instrumentation is in place, baseline measurements of heart rate, cardiac output, oxygen consumption, 
blood pressure, and NIRS will begin.
The subject will then be asked to complete three exercise bouts on a recumbent bike.  The first bout will 
consist of very light pedaling for 2 minutes (warm-up) followed by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1010492] and/or light pedaling 
(recovery), the subject will be asked to perform a second bout of exercise, which will consist of a very 
gradual increase in workload (“ramp”) until the subject can no longer maintain the required pedal speed 
or needs to stop due to fatigue.  This second bout will likely last between [ADDRESS_1010493] will then pedal for 2 minutes at a very light workload, followed immediately by 
[CONTACT_8622] 12 minutes of pedaling at a moderately heavy workload.  After a brief cool-down of light pedaling, 
the facemask and other sensors (e.g., EKG, NIRS, etc) will be removed.  At several points throughout this 
visit (minimum of 3, maximum of 6) a small drop of blood from your fingertip will be used to measure the 
subject’s blood lactate level.  The measurements obtained during this first study visit will determine the 
exercise workloads that will be individually assigned during study visits 2 and 3.
Women who are currently taking hormone therapy of any kind (oral contraceptives, estrogen 
replacement, etc) will not be excluded from participation in this study.  However, given the well-
documented effects of female sex hormones on resting blood pressure and exercise metabolic responses 
we will ask 1) pre-menopausal women to indicate their current menstrual status and oral contraceptive 
use and 2) post-menopausal women to self-report their history and duration of sex hormone 
replacement13.  This information will be collected at the time of their medical history/physical exam.

7.2.2 Visit 2 (non-infusion)
As with the screening visit, the subject will be told to avoid alcohol, over the counter cold prep and NSAIDs, 
and strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and to eat a small meal 2-3 hours prior to coming to the laboratory.  
They will also be asked to refrain from items containing caffeine 12 hours prior to this visit. Women of 
childbearing potential (pre-menopausal) will take a urine pregnancy test to ensure they are not pregnant.
The subject will then lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is performed to 
determine fat free mass. Then the subject will then lay on an exam bed for placement of EKG pads as well 
as NIRS devices (one on the forearm, one on the forehead, and two on the leg) and measurement of vital 
signs. 
The subject will then be assisted onto the recumbent bike. The Subject will be asked to squeeze a handgrip 
device as hard as they can with their hand.  The maximum force they can exert (highest of 2 to 3 efforts) 
will be used to determine how hard they will squeeze this device later in the study (40% of this maximum 
value).  A silicone face mask will be placed over the subject’s nose and mouth to monitor their oxygen 
consumption and breathing frequency, and blood pressure devices will be placed over their arm (SunTech 
Tango) and finger (Finometer). After all instrumentation is in place, baseline measurements of heart rate, 
cardiac output, oxygen consumption, blood pressure, and NIRS will begin.
All measurements (HR, BP, cardiac output, oxygen consumption and NIRS) continue to be collected 
throughout the exercise protocol (some continuously, others intermittently).   Once these measurements 
have stabilized, the subject will be asked to squeeze the handgrip device (constant tension) at 40% of the 
force they developed during the maximum grip testing for 1-[ADDRESS_1010494]

the upper thigh of the limbs with the NIRS probes attached. The cuffs will then be inflated to ~[ADDRESS_1010496] been completely deoxygenated (~5 minutes as determined by [CONTACT_160087]).
At least three lactate measurements will be collected during each trial (6 total); one during rest, one after 
4 mins of light intensity exercise, and one after 4 mins of moderate intensity exercise.

Once the subject’s BP and HR have returned to baseline levels, we will remove the remaining monitoring 
equipment and the subject may leave.
7.2.3 Visit 3 (Infusion)
The order of infusion will be randomized and “blinded” such that neither the subject nor the investigators 
will know what the infusion order is (only the nurses will know the order, for safety reasons).  
As with the screening visit, the subject will be told to avoid alcohol, over the counter cold prep and NSAIDs, 
and strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and to eat a small meal 2-3 hours prior to coming to the laboratory.  
They will also be asked to refrain from items containing caffeine 12 hours prior to this visit. Women of 
childbearing potential (pre-menopausal) will take a urine pregnancy test to ensure they are not pregnant.
Then the subject will then lay on an exam bed for placement of EKG pads as well as NIRS devices (one on 
the forearm, one on the forehead, and two on the leg) and measurement of vital signs. A nurse will then 
insert a catheter into a vein of the subject’s arm (visit 3 only).  This catheter will enable us to infuse the 
drug (Esmolol or saline).
The subject will then be assisted onto the recumbent bike. The subject will be asked to squeeze a handgrip 
device as hard as they can with their hand.  The maximum force they can exert (highest of 2 to 3 efforts) 
will be used to determine how hard they will squeeze this device later in the study (40% of this maximum 
value).  A silicone face mask will be placed over the subject’s nose and mouth to monitor their oxygen 
consumption and breathing frequency, and blood pressure devices will be placed over their arm (SunTech 
Tango) and finger (Finometer). After all instrumentation is in place, baseline measurements of heart rate, 
cardiac output, oxygen consumption, blood pressure, and NIRS will begin. After all instrumentation is in 
place baseline measurements of heart rate, cardiac output, oxygen consumption, blood pressure, and 
NIRS will begin.
A CRC clinician will join the research team immediately before it is time to start the infusion. The CRC 
clinician will be able to review the EKG results at that time if there are any concerns.  The subject will then 
receive an infusion of Esmolol or saline. The Esmolol loading dose will be 0.5 mg/kg fat free mass/min 
administered over the first 3 minutes (loading dose), followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg fat 
free mass/min for the remainder of the protocol (maximum of 60 minutes).

Page 15 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) All measurements (HR, BP, cardiac output, oxygen consumption and NIRS) will be continue to be collected 
throughout the exercise protocol (some continuously, others intermittently).   Once these measurements 
have stabilized (i.e., approximately 10 minutes into the maintenance infusion), the subject will be asked 
to squeeze the handgrip device (constant tension) at 40% of the force they developed during the 
maximum grip testing for 1-[ADDRESS_1010498] will continue cycling at the same moderate intensity for 1 to 2 minutes while 
simultaneously squeezing a handgrip device at 40% of their maximal effort. The subject will then rest for 
45 mins, after which they will repeat the exercise protocol. Immediately following the second exercise 
bout, cuffs will be placed on the upper arm and on the upper thigh of the limbs with the NIRS probes 
attached. The cuffs will then be inflated to ~[ADDRESS_1010499] been completely 
deoxygenated (~5 minutes as determined by [CONTACT_160087]).
  
After the recovery period, most instrumentation will be removed (except for the blood pressure cuffs and 
EKG).  The subject will then sit up slowly as we monitor their BP and HR, and offer them juice and crackers.  
Once the subject’s BP and HR have returned to baseline levels, we will remove the remaining monitoring 
equipment and the subject may leave.   There is no need to send subjects home with a heart rate monitor 
after the study because the effects of Esmolol are very short (9-minute half-life).
Listed below are all the parameters that will be measured.  The risks of each procedure are listed in Section 
11.0.
1. Oxygen consumption (VO 2): Pulmonary oxygen consumption will be measured using a COSMED Quark breath-
by-breath system. A silicone mask will be placed over the subject’s nose and mouth to measure breather 
frequency and volume in addition to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_739482].
2. Cardiac Output and Heart Rate: Cardiac output and heart rate will be measured non-invasively using a 
PhysioFlow Enduro device. [ADDRESS_1010500] ([ADDRESS_1010501], and 2 on 
the back). This device will determine heart rate using EKG and will use bioimpedance to estimate cardiac 
output throughout the experiment.
3.Blood pressure: Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured non-invasively via an automatic 
sphygmomanometer (SunTech Tango) and with a photoplethysmographic device (Finometer, FMS, 
Netherlands). To optimize the accuracy of beat-by-beat data collected by [CONTACT_739512], care will be taken to 
stabilize the device on the hand at heart level, and the device will be turned off between protocols to prevent 
finger edema, which may interfere with the ability to measure finger blood pressure.  Baseline BP will be 
measured by [CONTACT_739513]. The SunTech Tango device will not be used during the handgrip exercises 
because it cannot measure blood pressure under those conditions.
4.Venous catheter:  An IV will be placed in a peripheral vein to infuse Esmolol and saline, and to withdraw blood  
for CBC (complete blood count) and CMP (Chem-7).  The total volume of blood obtained will not exceed 50 
ml.  Blood will be sent to HMC Clinical Laboratory for processing.
5.Skinfold thickness: Doppler ultrasound will be used to measure the fat thickness at the sites of the NIRS 
sensors (forearm and calf). 
6.Physical activity questionnaire:  Healthy subjects will complete a physical activity history questionnaire, which 
is a pen and paper assessment of their estimated amount of leisure time physical activity 
STUDY00010736
Approval: 10/17/2023
Page 16 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 7.Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS): We will place a wireless portable near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device 
on the forearm (non-handgrip arm), as well as on the forehead, the vastus lateralis (thigh) and the 
gastrocnemius (calf) muscle of one leg. These devices are essentially small plastic boxes that measure skeletal 
muscle oxygenation noninvasively. The system measures the hemoglobin saturation of the investigated tissue, 
called the 'tissue saturation index' (TSI). In addition to TSI, the system also measures oxygenation changes in 
terms of oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin, which is an indication of the blood 
volume in the tissue. At the end of study visits 2 & 3, a cuff will be placed on the upper arm and upper thigh 
of the limbs with NIRS attached. The cuff will be inflated to a suprasystolic pressure (~250 mmHg) to occlude 
blood flow to fully deoxygenate the limb. This allows for calibration of the NIRS data.
8. Isometric handgrip exercise:  Subjects will perform a maximal voluntary handgrip using a handgrip 
dynamometer (highest of 2 to 3 maximum efforts).  A percent maximum is calculated and set on a visual 
display so the subject grips at the appropriate intensity.  Subjects will be asked to grip at 40% of their maximum 
and to maintain that grip for 90 seconds.
9. DEXA: Subjects will lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_72301] a flat, open x-ray table and will be asked to remain very still during the scan. 
This will provide us with the subject’s fat free mass, which will be used to determine esmolol dosing.
10. Blood Lactate: Before each sample is collected, the finger will be cleaned with an alcohol wipe and allowed 
time to dry. The blood sampling procedure will involve a single-use fingerstick device, on the 3rd and 4th fingers 
of the hand. The first drop will be wiped with gauze and the second drop will collected on the test strip of the 
lactate analyzer.

Esmolol hydrochloride will be handled following the Institution’s Standard Operating Procedures for Clinical 
Research Section III, PM 306.  Esmolol will be tracked using an accountability record, and dispensed by a 
physician, pharmacist, PA, or CRNP.  The receipt, storage, dispensing and return/destruction will follow the 
Institution’s Standard Operating Procedures for Clinical Research.
Description
Esmolol hydrochloride (2500 mg in 250 ml normal saline) will be purchased from McKesson in pre-mixed 
bags.  The placebo will be a 250 ml, 500 ml, or 1000 ml bag of normal saline.
Treatment Regimen
The route of administration of Esmolol in our study is the same as in clinical care (IV pump).  The loading 
dose will be 0.5 mg/kg fat free mass/min administered over the first 3 minutes, followed by a maintenance 
dose of 0.25 mg/kg fat free mass/min for the remainder of the protocol (maximum of 60 minutes).
Method for Assigning Subject to Treatment Groups
This study uses a crossover design so all subjects will complete both treatments in random order. Subjects 
will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences using an equal allocation ratio of 1:1.  The two 
treatment sequences to which subjects will be randomized are 1) Esmolol infusion first and saline infusion 
second and 2) saline infusion first and Esmolol infusion second. The CRC nurses will generate the 
randomization that will use variable size, random permuted blocks with block size [ADDRESS_1010503] until data collection has been completed to keep the research staff 
blinded.

Not applicable.
Blinding of the Test Article
This study is single blind because the subjects, data collectors, and data analysts will not be aware of the 
treatment. For safety reasons, the CRC nurse will not be blinded.  Additionally, once the Esmolol/saline 
infusion pump is programmed by [CONTACT_54340], an opaque bag will be placed over the fluid bag so 
that the participant and all investigators in the room remain blinded to the treatment order.  
Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return

esmolol dose and IV pump settings prior to infusion. The amount of Esmolol used for each 
study/participant will be recorded on the study protocol flow sheet.
7.4.[ADDRESS_1010505] Article
Any Esmolol bags (empty or partially used) remaining after completion of a study visit will be 
disposed on site.
7.4.[ADDRESS_1010506] of prior and current medications will be obtained during the screening visit as part of the 
medical history. Subjects will be asked to withhold all over-the-counter medications (e.g. motrin, 
cold medicine) for 24 hours prior to each study and during the study procedures.  ALL participants 
will review their prescribed medications, including beta-blockers, with one of the research nurses.  
This information will be shared with the CRC clinician who will then recommend which 
medications can be taken prior to the patient’s scheduled study visit, and which ones should be 
withheld until after the study.  All medications consumed by [CONTACT_739514] .
8.[ADDRESS_1010507] Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number of Subjects
We plan to enroll no more than 40 subjects (20 subjects per group) in this study.  We plan to complete data 
collection on 13 young women (age 21-35) and 13 older postmenopausal women (age 55-70).
8.2 Sample size determination
∆%∆SmO 2 (difference between %∆SmO 2 during saline and esmolol trials) in response to moderate-intensity 
cycling exercise is our primary outcome. We do not have any pi[INVESTIGATOR_739483].  However, using data from our recent publication, older adults (65.0 + 2.6 years, n=3) 
displayed a greater ∆%∆SmO 2 compared to their young (25.4 + 1.9 years, n=5) counterparts (22.0 + 4.0 % vs 16.2 
STUDY00010736
Approval: 10/17/2023
Page 18 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) + 4.0 %)20. Considering this prior data, we will consider the difference between the pre-to-post Esmolol change 
and the pre-to-post placebo change (i.e., delta delta) of 5.8% to be clinically relevant20. Furthermore, we assume 
the variability (i.e., standard deviation) will be 4.78%, the standard deviation seen from this previous data20. We 
also assume there will be no carryover effect. Given these assumptions, a sample size of 11 subjects per group 
will provide 80% power to detect a difference in the change in %∆SmO [ADDRESS_1010508] deviation of 4.78%, using a two-sided test having a significance level of 0.05.  To account for differences 
in subject population and exercise protocol between that study and this protocol, we plan to complete data 
collection on [ADDRESS_1010509] (e.g., premenopausal vs postmenopausal). Additionally, where applicable,  ANOVA will be used to assess 
differences between the groups for continuous outcomes (e.g., ∆%∆SmO 2). As this is a relatively small-scale 
exploratory study, no corrections for multiple hypothesis testing will be employed.

addressed (e.g. untoward events). It should also be noted that safety is constantly monitored in our laboratory 
because our studies involve beat-by-beat monitoring of physiological variables. Any concerns are immediately

In the case of an adverse event, research is suspended while evaluation, reporting, and rectification proceeds. 
Research is restored when the IRB and the DSMB determine that a rectification of the problem is satisfactory.
10.0 Risks
1. Confidentiality: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if medical information or identity are obtained by 
[CONTACT_127774], but precautions will be taken to prevent this from happening.
2. Pregnancy: It is important that a fetus not be exposed to any unnecessary risks; therefore, pregnant women will 
not be studied. A pregnancy test will be administered at the beginning of the study visit to all women of 
childbearing potential to ensure they are not pregnant.
3. Blood pressure, heart rate: Minimal risk of skin irritation from EKG patches.
4. PhysioFlow: 
5. Oxygen Consumption: No Risk.
6. IV placement: The discomfort associated with a blood draw/IV placement is a slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_739485]. The risks of a blood draw include mild discomfort and/or a black and blue mark 
at the puncture site. Less common risks include infection or bleeding at the puncture site, or on rare occasions, 
dizziness, light-headedness, nausea or fainting during the procedure. To minimize the risk of infection, aseptic 
techniques will be used.
7. Esmolol infusion: The risks stated by [CONTACT_739515], hypotension, injection site pain, 
nausea, seizure, bronchospasm, allergic reaction, infusion site reaction, or extravasation (leaking of infusion into 
tissue around the IV site which may cause tissue death).  However, in our experience these symptoms have 
never occurred in our research participants. The infusion will end if HR falls by [CONTACT_726] 20 beats/min or below 
40 beats/min or symptoms occur, or if symptomatic hypotension occurs (mean blood pressure drop of more 
than 20mmHg and/or symptoms).
If extravasation would occur, we would proceed as follows: 
1. Stop infusion
2. Apply warm compress over the catheter site 
3. Elevate the arm
4. Observe/monitor for at least 45 minutes (i.e. 5 half-lives for Esmolol)
5. Call subject within 24 hours
8. Saline infusion:  no risk
9. Skinfold of the forearm and leg to measure fat thickness:  No risk
10. Recumbent cycling exercise:  Cycling exercise will cause fatigue, shortness of breath, elevated body 
temperature and muscle fatigue. Could also cause chest discomfort and/or dehydration. 
STUDY00010736
Approval: 10/17/2023
Page 20 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 11. Isometric handgrip exercise: Handgrip exercise will cause fatigue in the forearm. This may be associated with a 
burning sensation in the forearm and possible muscle soreness after the test.
12. Post exercise occlusion:  The upper arm and upper leg cuff occlusions may result in a tingling or burning 
sensation in the limbs.  This will subside once the cuffs are released.
13. NIRS : No risk 
14. DEXA: There is a very small chance of cancer from excessive exposure to radiation. However, given the small 
amount of radiation used, this is very unlikely.
15. Blood Lactate: A slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_739486]. The risks include mild 
discomfort and/or a black and blue mark at the puncture site. Less common risks include infection or bleeding 
at the puncture site, or on rare occasions, dizziness, light-headedness, nausea or fainting during the procedure. 
To minimize the risk of infection, aseptic techniques will be used.
16. PhysioFlow:  Preparation for the PhysioFlow device requires rubbing the skin where patches will be applied with 
an abrasive gel (Nuprep) that will cause some skin irritation and may cause mild inflammation.
17.Order of measurements:  There are no additional risks to omitting or changing the order of the hemodynamic 
measurements in this study.  
18. Risk of incidental finding:  There is a rare risk of an incidental finding. The testing performed during this study 
is intended solely for research purposes and will not be utilized to detect any medical condition. However, if we 
notice something unusual, we will consult one of the cardiologists on the research team to determine if it merits 
follow-up. If so, we will contact [CONTACT_2690] [ADDRESS_1010516] Payment and/or Travel Reimbursements

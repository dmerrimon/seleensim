Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 11PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale:
Antibody -drug conjugates (ADCs) were developed to improve the therapeutic indices of 
cytotoxic anti -cancer agents.  The strat egy makes use of an immunoconjugate in which a 
cytotoxic agent is chemically  or enzy matically  linked to an antibody  that selectivel y binds to 
an internalizing tumor -associated antigen. This strategy  allows specific delivery  of the 
cytotoxic agent to the t umor site while minimizing the exposure to normal tissues.
PF-06647020 is an anti -PTK7 ADC intended to be for the treatment of patients with cancer.  
PF-06647020 is comprised of a humanized anti -PTK7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to 
an auristatin (Aur01 01) via a cleavable cy steine -reactive linker . Auristatins are full y 
synthetic dolastatin- based pentapeptide inhibitor of tubulin poly merization that induce 
G2/M cell cy cle arrest and cell death at low pi[INVESTIGATOR_274138].13,14
PTK7 is a phy logenetically  conserved member of the pseudokinase famil y of receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with no observable kinase activity .[ADDRESS_335018] developmental 
defects.3,7,11  In addition, PTK7 promotes cell survival in colorectal cancer and acute m yeloid 
leukemia (AML), and PTK7 may promote resistance to chemotherapy  in A ML.9,[ADDRESS_335019], colorectal, gastric, kidney , liver, lung, pancreatic and skin cancer.  In addition, 
PTK7 was found to be enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor -initiating 
cells, harvested from patient- derived xenografted tumor models of triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) in preclinical studies.19  It was also 
reported that 
higher expression of PTK7 is linked to poor prognosis in patients with NSCL C
and TNBC who received chemotherap y, particularly  in a subgroup patient population who 
received anthracy cline treatment.2,19  In preclinical studies, PF -06647020 induced sustained 
tumor regressions in models of ovarian cancer ( OVCA ), NSCL C and TNBC .19
TNBC accounts for 15% to 20% of breast cancers and is diagnosed based on lack of estrogen 
receptor ( ER)and proges terone receptor ( PgR)expression by  [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC) 
and lack of HER2 over expression or gene amplification by  [CONTACT_274182], 
respectivel y.  TNBC is a heterogeneous disease, not only  on the molecular level, but also on 
the patholog ic and clinical levels.  The m ajorit y of patients with TNBC respond with high 
sensitivity  to chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274139].  However, TNBC is associated with a significantly  higher probability  of 
relapse and poor overall survival 
(OS) in the first few y ears after diagnosis compared with 
other breast cancer subt ypes. Positive e xpression of PTK7 in TNBC was observed in 
~84% of archived sample s survey ed using a research grade IHC assay ([COMPANY_007] inte rnaldata).

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 12NSCL C accounts for approximately  85% cases of lung cancer, the leading cause of 
cancer -related mortalit y in the [LOCATION_002] ( US)and worldwide.  Most patients with 
NSCL C have locally  advanced and distant metastatic disease (stage III/ IV) at t he time of 
presentation, which is associated with a poor prognosis with 5 -year OSrate less than 10%.  
Although target ed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, Erlotinib and Crizotinib) for patients with NSCL C whose 
tumors carry  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) mutation or are anaplastic ly mphoma 
kinase (ALK) -positive have provided encouraging clinical outcome and promising 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274140], the unsatisfactory treatment outcomes in advanced 
NSCL C highlights the need of novel alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In add ition, PTK7 expression in 
NSCL C was observed to cover a d ynamic range ([COMPANY_007] internal data), suggesting that patient 
selection by  [CONTACT_274179]7 expression levels may  identify  patients that may  be more likely  to benefit.
OVCA is the 6thmost common malignancy in de veloped countries with approximately  
100,000 new cases resulting in nearly  65,000 deaths per y ear.15  Patients are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_274141] b y chemotherap y.  Initial therap y consists of combinatio ns with 
platinum -containing agents which results in responses in 70
-80% of patients.  However, the 
disease relapses in almost all patients requiring further therap y.  The timing of the relapse 
from the end of the platinum- containing regimen has been shown to be prognostic with 
platinum -resistant tumors (defined as progression while receiving initial therap y or relapse 
<6months from end of initial regimen), as having the worst outcomes.16  Pegylated 
doxorubicin a nd topotecan are both indicated as single agents in patients with refractory  
OVCA.  In patients with platinum -
resistant disease, both of these compounds result in 
response rate (RR) of 10 -15%, progression free survival (PFS) of 14 weeks, and OS 
35-40 weeks highlighting the need for alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].16
Avelumab (MSB0010718C), a fully  human antibody  of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
isoty pe, specificall y targets and blocks programmed death -
ligand 1 ( PD-L1),the ligand for 
programmed death 1 (PD-1)receptor .  This interaction inhibits the suppressive effects of 
PD-L1 on cluster of differentiation 8 ( CD8 )positive Tcells, and thus restores the cytotoxic 
Tcell response against the tumor.  In preclinical studies, c ombination of avelumab with 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274142] -tumor activity .20Broad expression of PD -L1 was 
observed in ovarian cancer samples, and higher expression of PD- L1 was associated with 
significant ly worse prognosis .32Preliminary  data from the ongoing OVCA Study  EMR 
100070-001, which is being conducted b y [COMPANY_006] KGaA/EMD Serono (EudraCT number 
2013 -002834-19, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) showed an overall response rate (ORR ) of 10.7% (8/75) 
and stable disease (SD) in an additional 44% (33/75) of patients with advanced OVCA .  
Available adverse event (AE) and laboratory  abnormality  data from patients with advanced 
solid tumors treated with single -agent avelumab suggest an acceptable safety  profile of the 
compound.  Most of the observed events were either in line with those expected in patients 
with advanced solid tumors or with similar class effects of monoclonal antibodies blocking 
the PD -1/PD -L1 axis.  Infusion-related r eactions including hy persensitivity and immune 
related Adverse Events (irAEs)/autoimmune disorders have been identified as important risks 
for avelumab.  

PF-[ADDRESS_335020] that combining the PTK7- targeted ADC with avelumab 
would improve cl inical outcomes.  In preclinical studies, combination of avelumab with 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274142] -tumor activity .20  A recent preclinical study  
demonstrated that immunotherap y can be enhanced by  [CONTACT_274183] y
;21indeed the PTK7 -targeted ADC delivers a potent chemotherap y 
preferentiall y to the tumor cells and thus is distinguished from standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In 
addition , the PTK7-targeted ADC could stimulate anti- tumor immunity  (and thus stimulate 
the response to avelumab) by  [CONTACT_16000]: (1) auristatins can activate dendritic cells 
([COMPANY_007], unpublished data), and the expression of PTK7 on dendritic cells could i ncrease the 
delivery  of auristatin to those cells ;(2) anti -angiogenic activity  can promote immune cell 
infiltration into tumors, and the PTK7 -targeted ADC specificall y inhibits angiogenesis; 
(3)immunogenic cell death can stimulate anti -tumor immunity , and auristatins induce this 
phenoty pe in cancer cell lines.[ADDRESS_335021] in human Phase 1, safety , pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy  study  of

Part 1 will estimate the MTD/RP2D in dose escalation cohorts in patients with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_274143].  Part 2 will include approximately 87 patients enrolled at a RP2D selected by [CONTACT_274187] 1, to explore benefit from treatment and to better define the safety profile, as well as the RP2D.  This expansion cohort will include approximately 22 patients with metastatic or recurrent TNBC, 45 patients with advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296], primary peritoneal or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351] (OVCA) and 20 patients with advanced NSCLC.

A drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-study for evaluating the effect of multiple-dose 
fluconazole on the PK of unconjugated payload (PF-06380101) is currently ongoing. The DDI sub-study is an open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence design in up to [ADDRESS_335024] of multiple-dose fluconazole, a model moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of PF-06380101 (payload), when fluconazole is co-administered with PF-06647020. This sub-study will be set up as a separate cohort from above mentioned studies in TNBC, NSCLC and OVCA, and the sub-study design and procedure details can be found in Appendix 7 .
Current Q2W Regimen Expansion (Amendment 7)
The Q2W regimen expansion is designed to evaluate safety, PK and anti-tumor efficacy of a 
Q2W dosing schedule as a single agent treatment of PF-06647020 in patients with OVCA and NSCLC, and combined treatment of PF-06647020 with avelumab in OVCA patients.  If supported by [CONTACT_274188]-tumor efficacy, additional combination study of PF-06647020 with avelumab may also be investigated (eg, in approximately 24 patients with NSCLC).  The study contains two parts, a Part 1 dose escalation to evaluate safety, PK and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment, and a Part 2 dose expansion to evaluate safety, PK and efficacy of PF-06647020 as single agent treatment and in combination with avelumab.
Part 1 contains a dose escalation scheme to estimate the MTD/RP2D of PF-06647020 as 
single agent treatment in patients with platinum-refractory or resistant OVCA and patients with recurrent NSCLC (in approximately 20 patients) using modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method.  Successive cohorts of patients will receive doses of PF-06647020starting at a dose of 2.1 mg/kg, Q2W. Once a RP2D is determined and preliminary efficacy is observed, dose expansion (Part 2) will be started to further investigate safety, PK and efficacy of Q2W PF-06647020 in three cohorts of patients:
•Cohort 1: PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment in patients with platinum resistant 
or refractory OVCA.
•Cohort 2: PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment in patients with recurrent 
advanced NSCLC.
•Cohort 3: PF-06647020 in combination with avelumab in platinum resistant or 
refractory OVCA.CCI

Page 20Approximately 24 patients will be enrolled for each cohort.  Patients that were enrolled in the 
Part 1 single agent dose escalation will be counted as part of the 24 patients in their respective Part 2 single agent cohorts. Additional cohorts (eg, approximately 24 patients with recurrent advanced NSCLC) receiving combination of PF-06647020 with avelumab may also be considered for inclusion at a later time, if supported by [CONTACT_274188]-tumor activity observed in Cohort 2. 
In the combination expansion cohort(s), the RP2D of PF-06647020 as determined by [CONTACT_9524] 1 
will be used as the dose to combine with avelumab at 800 mg (both administered IV, Q2W).  The PF-06647020 dose may be reduced (but not further escalated) for safety reasons. After at least [ADDRESS_335025] completed a minimum observation period of 4 weeks, safety will be reviewed by [CONTACT_274189] (using the same DLT definition described in Section A4.2 ). If there are no safety concerns precluding continuation 
of the study, enrollment of the remaining patients for this cohort will proceed. If DLT is observed in [ADDRESS_335026] 6 additional patients will be enrolled at a reduced dose of PF-06647020 (the reduced dose of PF-06647020 could be one dose level below the defined RP2D from Part 1 assuming the RP2D is above the starting dose of Part 1 (ie, 2.1 mg/kg), or 1.8 mg/kg of PF-06647020 in a circumstance that the RP2D from Part 1 is 2.1 mg/kg).
 
 
  
Approximately 190 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study at approximately
15-20 sites (including approximately 72 patients in the Q2W Regimen Sub-Study).  The actual number of patients enrolled will depend upon the tolerability of PF-06647020 and the number of dose levels required to identify the MTD/RP2D. 
Patients will participate in the study for approximately 6 months or until disease progression
(PD) as per RECIST 1.1 [or immune-related response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (irRECIST) in Cohort 3 of the Q2W regimen expansion], patient withdrawal of consent,unacceptable toxicity occurs, patient loss to follow up, or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034], whichever comes first.  This includes a [ADDRESS_335027] dose of study drug for AE and serious adverse event (SAE) collection will be 
conducted.  The time on study can vary depending on the observed toxicity and potential benefit an individual patient derives.  The study is expected to be completed in approximately 36 months.

Page 341.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Indication
PF-06647020 is an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) against the PTK7 (Protein Ty rosine 
Kinase 7) tumor antig en.  I t is intended to be used for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently  available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or for whom no 
standard therap y is available.
1.2.Background and Rationale
ADCs were developed to improve the therapeu tic indices of cy totoxic anti- cancer agents.  
The strateg y makes use of an immunoconjugate in which a cy totoxic agent is chemically  or 
enzy maticall y linked to an antibody that selectively binds to an internalizing 
tumor -associated antigen. This strategy  allows specific delivery  of the cy totoxic agent to the 
tumor site while minimizing the exposure to normal tissues.
PF-06647020 is an anti -PTK7 ADC intended to be for the treatment of patients with cancer.  
PF-06647020 is comprised of a humanized anti -PTK7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to 
an auristatin (Aur0101) via a cleavable cy steine -reactive linker .  Auristatins are full y 
synthetic dolastatin
-based pentapeptide inhibitor of tubulin poly merization that induce G2/M 
cell cy cle arrest and cell death at low pi[INVESTIGATOR_274138].13,14
PTK7 is a phy logenetically  conserved member of the pseudokinase family  of receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with no obser vable kinase activity .[ADDRESS_335052] dev elopmental 
defects.3,7,11  In addition, PTK7 promotes cell survival in colorectal cancer and acute m yeloid 
leukemia (AML) , and PTK7 may promote resistance to chemotherapy  in AML .9,[ADDRESS_335053], colorectal, gastric, kidney , liver, lung, pancreatic and skin cancer.  In addition, 
PTK7 was found to be enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor -initiat ing 
cells, harvested from patient
-derived xenografted tumor models of triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) in preclinical studies (unpublished 
data).  It was also reported that positive expression of PTK7 is linked to poor prognosis in 
patients with NSCL C ([COMPANY_007] internal data) and TNBC who received chemotherapy , 
particularl y in a subgroup patient population who received anthracycline treatment.2  In 
preclinical studies, PF -06647020 induced sustained tumor regressions in models of ovarian 
cancer (OVCA), NSCL C and TNBC.19
For complete details of the in vitro and nonclinical studies, refer to PF -06647020 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .22
TNBC accounts for 15% to 20% of breast cancers and is diagnosed based on lack of ER and 
PgR expression by  [CONTACT_274191]2 over expression or gene amplification by  [CONTACT_274192], respectively .  TNBC is a heterogeneous disease, not only  on the molecular 
level, but also on the pathologic and clinical levels.  The m ajority  of patients with TNBC 

PF-[ADDRESS_335054] cancer subtypes.  Positive expression of PTK7 in TNBC was observed in ~84% of archived samples surveyed using a research grade IHC assay sets tested ([COMPANY_007] internal data).
NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% cases of lung cancer, the leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and worldwide.  Most patients with NSCLC have locally advanced and distant metastatic disease (stage III/IV) at the time of presentation, which is associated with a poor prognosis with 5-year OS rate less than 10%.  Although targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, Erlotinib and Crizotinib) for patients with NSCLC whose tumors carry EGFR mutation or are ALK-positive and promising immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274140], the unsatisfactory treatment outcomes in advanced NSCLC highlights the need of novel alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In addition, PTK7 expression in NSCLC was observed to cover a dynamic range ([COMPANY_007] internal data), suggesting that patient selection by [CONTACT_274179]7 expression levels may identify patients that may be more likely to benefit. This is the first in human study of PF-[ADDRESS_335055] common malignancy in developed countries with approximately 
100,000 new cases resulting in nearly 65,000 deaths per year.15Patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_274144].  Initial therapy consists of combinations with platinum-containing agents which results in responses in 70-80% of patients.  However, the disease relapses in almost all patients requiring further therapy.  The timing of the relapse from the end of the platinum-containing regimen has been shown to be prognostic with platinum-resistant tumors (defined as progression while receiving initial therapy or relapse <6 months from end of initial regimen), as having the worst outcomes.
16Pegylated 
doxorubicin and topotecan are both indicated as single agents in patients with refractory OVCA.  In patients with platinum-resistant disease, both of these compounds result in RR of 10-15%, PFS of 14 weeks, and OS 35-40 weeks highlighting the need for alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Page 411.2.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
Following a single I V or intraperitoneal ( IP)dose of PF -06647020 to nod/SCI D mice, 
systemic exposure of ADC and total Ab were similar.  After repeat IV dosing of 
PF-06647020 to Wistar Han rats and cy nomolgus monkey s, mean s ystemic exposure (as 
assessed b y C maxand area under the curve [ AUC ]) increased with increasing dose f or ADC, 
total Ab, and unconjugated Aur0101 and no sex- related differences were observed.  Further, 
mean C maxand AUC 504ratios on Day 22relative to Day 1were generall y similar with ratios 
(Day 22/Day 1) less than 2.[ADDRESS_335056] in the 
12mg/kg/dose group (22% in toxicokinetic animals).  I n general, serum concentrations in
most ADA -positive rats were similar to ADA -negative rats.  In cy nomolgus monkey s, the 
incidence of ADA induction to PF -06647020 ranged from 75% to 93% across all dose groups 
(0.5, 2, and 4 mg/kg/dose).  On Study  Day  1, systemic exposure in ADA -positive an imals 
was similar to that of ADA -negative animals; whereas, on Study  Day 22systemic exposure 
in ADA -positive animals was lower than ADA -negative animals. 
After an IV dose of Aur0101 payload at 20 g/kg to Wistar Han rats, Aur0101 exhibited a 
mean sy stemi c clearance (CL ) of 70 mL/min/kg and a volume of distribution (V ss) of 
14,700 mL/kg, resulting in a terminal elimination half- life (t ½) of approximately  6hours. 
Following repeat IV dosing of Aur0101 to Wistar Han rats, mean s ystemic exposure 
increased wi th increasing dose.  Mean C maxand AUC 336ratios on Day  29relative to 
Day 1were generall y similar with ratios (Day 29/Day 1) less than 2.0, suggesting there was 
no accumulation of Aur0101 observed over the dosing interval.
Aur0101 was moderatel y to highl y bound to plasma proteins (monkey  < rat and human 
plasma proteins).  In vitro studies with non
-radiolabeled compound suggest that 
Aur0101 preferentially  distributes into human plasma relative to whole blood.  In vitro 
studies indicate that Aur0101 is a P- glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrate.
Based on preliminary  in vitro and in vivo assessments, Aur0101 is the only released chemical 
species resulting from PF -06647020 following incubation with rat, monkey, and human liver 
S9or in rat and monkey  serum after IV administration of PF -06647020.  A preliminary  
assessment of the metabolism of Aur0101 using non-radiolabeled compound was conducted 
using rat, monkey  and human liver S9 fractions and human recombinant cy tochrome 
P450 (rCYP) enzy mes.  All metabolites were oxi dative in nature and -Nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) -dependent with no amide hy droly sis products or 
glucuronide conjugates observed.  There was no evidence of human specific metabolites.  
Initial reaction phenot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_274145]3A4 is the predominant enzy me 
involved in the metabolism of Aur0101.

PF-[ADDRESS_335057] inhibition, metabolism -dependent inhibition, and induction data 
and the anticipated low systemic concentrations in humans (C max<0.001M or 
<0.001 µg/mL , based on the assumption that levels of released Aur0101 are the same in 
humans as in monkey s), Aur0101 has an anticipated low probability  to perpetrate 
pharmacokinetic DDI with compounds for which CYP (1A2, 2B6, C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
and/or 3A4/5) -mediated metabolism constitutes the primary  mechanism of clearance.  
However, since Aur0101 is primarily  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4, there is a potential that its 
metabolism may  be altered in the presence of a potent inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4. In 
addition, coadministration with a potent CYP3A4 inducer would result in accelerating 
clearance and lowering systemic Aur0101 concentrations.
1.2.3. Nonclinical Safety 
The nonclinical safet y profile of PF -06647020 was characterized in a series of nonclinical in 
vivo studie s. Repeat -dose exploratory  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] (Good Laboratory  Practice (GLP) 
compliant) studies were conducted in Wistar Han rats and cy nomolgus monkey s. An in vivo 
micronucleus assay  was conducted in the rat pi[INVESTIGATOR_274146] (cardiovascular function in particular) were included in the monkey  pi[INVESTIGATOR_274147] . In addition, a GL P tissue cross- reactivity study  was conducted with normal 
tissues of cy nomolgus monkey s and humans. The major clinically  significant findings in the 
repeat -dose toxicity  studies were reversible bone marrow toxicit y (all lineages) with 
associated hematological changes in both rats and monkeys. PF-6647020 was positive in the 
rat micronucleus assay  and there were no adverse findings in the mo nkey  cardiovascular 
function assessments.
Wistar Han rats were dosed with PF -06647020 once every  3weeks for 3 cycles at 2, 6 or 
12mg/kg/dose in an exploratory  study  and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_274148] P study . In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_274149] , 
administration of 12 mg/kg/dose res ulted in the early  euthanasia of 2/30 animals on 
Days 8and 9 due to poor clinical condition (egdecreased activity  and skin turgor, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
lame/limpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], chromodacry orrhea) , which was secondary  to bone marrow and ly mphoid 
depletion associated with second ary bacterial infection. Major effects in surviving animals 
consisted of reversible bone marrow h ypocellularity  (minimal to mild at 2 mg/kg/dose and 
moderate to severe at 6 mg/kg/dose) that was associated with hematological changes of 
transient decreases in all major blood cell ty pes. Additional adverse changes were noted in 
the testes (tubular degeneration) at 2mg/kg/dose, thy mus at  6mg/kg/dose (ly mphoid 
depletion) and skin (intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_61355]/cleft formation) at 12 mg/kg/dose. Other 
non-advers e changes (based on the small magnitude of the findings) consisted of increased 
mitoses and/or single cell necrosis in a variet y of organs at 
2mg/kg/dose, connective tissue 
inflammation around various organs at 6mg/kg/dose and mammary  gland atrophy  in males 
at 12 mg/kg/dose. Lastl y, adverse injection site findings were seen at all doses and 
considered mostly  related to extravasation of the test article. All changes, with the exception 
of the testicular findings, were fully  recovered at the end of the 6-week reversibility  period.  
The severel y toxic dose for 10% of the animals ( STD10) (was considered be 6 mg/kg/dose in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_274149] .

PF-06647020

Page 43Cynomolgus monkey s were dosed with PF -06647020 once every  3weeks for 3 cycles at 
0.5, 2 or 5mg/kg/dose in an ex ploratory  study  and at 0.5, 2 or 4mg/kg/dose in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45880] . In the exploratory study , administration of 5 mg/kg/dose resulted in the earl y 
euthanasia of 1/6 animals on Day  49(6days after the last dosing) due to lameness and 
swelling of the left hi nd limb, which correlated with microscopic findings of necrosis and 
inflammation at the injection site consistent with extravasation of the test article. Similar 
clinical and microscopic injection site findings were observed in other animals at 
2mg/kg/d ose. Test article -related effects were seen in the bone marrow (multifocal 
hematopoietic necrosis, altered my eloid to ery throid ratio) at  2 mg/kg/dose and l ymphoid 
organs (l ymphoid depletion) and testes (tubular degeneration) at 0.5mg/kg/dose. In the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_274150] , mild transient clinical signs (eg focal ery thema or swelling, decreased 
activity , ataxia, emesis) consistent with a mild infusion reaction were observed in some 
animals at 2mg/kg/dose and were possibl y related to ADA formation. Clinical signs were 
noted within 5-[ADDRESS_335058] significant hematolog y changes in these monkeys consisted of minimal to 
marked transient decreases in neutrophil counts at 0.5mg/kg/d ose, which were most 
prominent at mid- cycle (eg, 10days after dosing) and were considered adverse at 
4 mg/kg/dose based on the magnitude of the changes. Additional non- adverse hematology  
changes consisted of minimal to mild decreases in RBC mass paramete rs2mg/kg/dose.
Hematology  changes were attributable to bone marrow toxicity and associated with altered 
myeloid to ery throid ratio. Other microscopic findings consisted of non- adverse minimally  
increased mitoses and/or single cell necrosis in several organs at 4 mg/kg/dose. Hematolog y 
and histology  changes were recovered at the end of the 6- week reversibility  period. It is 
noteworth y that, due to a change in dosing procedure (post -dose flushing), there were no 
clinical signs or microscopic findings of test article extravasation at the injection sites in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_274150] .Last, there were no test article -related effects on electrocardiograms 
and heart rate. The highest non -severel y toxic dose ( HNSTD ) was considered to be 
4mg/kg/dose in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_274150] .
The tissue cross- reactivity  study  conducted with PF -06647020 indicated membrane 
expression of PTK7 in the esophagus (squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), cervix (squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), 
and skin (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], hair follicle and/or sweat glands) in monkey sand humans.  However, no 
test article related clinical and microscopic findings were observed in these organs in the 
Cynomolgus pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] . 
Overall, the nonclinical safet y profile of PF -06647020 has been adequatel y characterized and 
supports its use i n advanced cancer patients.

Pharmacokinetics of PF -06647020 (ADC, measured as conjugated antibody), hu 6M024 mAb 
(total antibody ), and PF -06380101 (unconjugated pay load) following the first 1-hour infusion 
of PF -[ADDRESS_335067] -in-Patient (FIP) study , B7661001.  This 
preliminary  anal ysis revealed that the s ystemic exposure based on area under the 
concentration -time curve during the dosing interval (AUC) and maximum concentration 
(Cmax) values for ADC, total antibody , and unconjugated pay load gen erally increased in a 
dose related manner across the 0.2, 0.5, 1.25, 2.1, 2.8, and 3.7 mg/kg doses.  Apparent 
terminal half -life (t1/2) values for ADC and total antibody tended to increase with doses with 
comparable half -life values among 2.1, 2.8, and 3.7 mg/kg doses, likely  related to target 
mediated disposition at lower doses.   
The Cycle1 PK parameters were comprehensively  characterized for the 2.8 mg/kg dose 
level, where data were available from 41 patients. Following single IV infusion of 
PF
-06647020 at dose of 2.8 mg/kg, ADC and total antibody  peak concentrations (82.6 and 
86.9g/mL  respectively ) occurred at or shortly  after the end of infusion, followed by  a 
multi
-phasic decline of concentrations with terminal t1/2values of approximately 2.7 and
3.3days for ADC and total antibody , respectively .  Unconjugated pay load (PF -06380101) 
concentrations appeared to increase following PF-06647020 infusion and reached a mean 
Cmaxof 8.8 ng/mL  at [ADDRESS_335068] -dose, and the mean t 1/2was 2.9 days. There were no 
appreciable drug accumulations over repeated doses following Q3W regimen.

1.3.Starting Dose Ration ale
The selection of the starting dose of PF -06647020 for this FI P study  is based on the 
preclinical toxicolog y results in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH)S9Guidance entitled “Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer 
Pharm aceuticals”.  Cy nomolgus monkey  was considered to be the most appropriate species 
for determining the proposed starting dose in patients.  The HNSTD in cy nomolgus monkey  
was determined to be 4 mg/kg. The proposed starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg given as an IV 
infusion Q3W represents approximatel y 1/6thof monkey HNSTD (based on human 
equivalent dose normalized to body  surface area).  In addition, given the projected human PK 
parameters based on allometric scaling from cy nomolgus monkey  PK, the projected human 
Cavfor PF -06647020 at the proposed starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg is expected to be 
approximatel y 1/11thof the observed monkey  Cavat HNSTD. 
PK/PD parameters were estimated from mouse xenograft models where at least 3 different 
doses of PF -06647020 were eval uated ( Figure 2, TNBC BR13, TNBC BR22). The PK/PD 
relationship between mouse PF

PD parameters and predicted human PK parameters. Stasis was considered as a criterion for 
minimal efficacy  in the clinic compensating for the difference in tu mor growth rates between 
xenograft and clinical tumors.  Based on these projections, an efficacious clinical dose of 
1.5to 1.6mg/kg of PF -[ADDRESS_335071] ef ficacy . 
1.4.PTK7 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Assay for PTK7 Expression
A PTK7- specific IHC assay  was developed using control cancer cell lines with a range of 
PTK7 expression reflective of PTK7 expression in clinical samples.  The PTK7 high, 
moderate, low and negative control cancer cells lines were characterized for PTK7 mRNA 
expression and protein levels using qRT -PCR, nanostring and western blot methodologies.  
Xenografts from the control cell lines were stained with the IHC assay  and PTK7 membrane 
expression was assessed.  PTK7 H-scores were highly  correlated with PTK7 readouts from 
orthogonal methodologies (qRT- PCR, nanostring and western blot).  Control cell line 
xenografts were subjected to various pre -analytical variables ( eg,time to fixation and time o f 
fixation) and stained with the PTK7 IHC assay .  The IHC assay  was robust to pre -analytic 
variables, enabling the IHC assay  to be performed on routinely collected formalin -fixed 
paraffin embedded clinical samples.

The PTK7 H-scores were ranked lowest to highest and the resulting graph reflects the 
dynamic range of PTK7 expression within an indication.  The ranked IHC values were then divided into lowest, middle, and highest statistical tertiles based on total patient number.  The middle one-third tertile of H-scores define the moderate PTK7 expressing tumors, whereas the tertile with the highest H-score values define the high PTK7 expressing tumors.

PF-[ADDRESS_335073] Cancer, NSCLC and OVCA in Dose Expansion
The selection of the indications in dose expansion was based on the literature reviews, the 
expression of PTK7 in human TNBC ,NSCL C and OVCA samples, the effic acy 
demonstrated in preclinical studies, and earl y signs of efficacy  in this study.
1.6.Rationale for Expansion of OVCA Cohort (Protocol Amendment 5)
To further understand PF -06647020 anti-tumor activity  in ovarian cancer, the protocol is 
amended to enroll app roximately  25additional patients with OVCA who are 
platinum -resistant or refractory  for further evaluating the anti -tumor activity  of 
PF-06647020.  This additional enrollment is supported by [CONTACT_274195]: Based on preliminary early readout of the ongoing Part 2 OVCA study , an 
approximatel y 27% of ORR is assumed for the available evaluable patients, and an inference 
can be made for the next 24 evaluable patients (including on- going patients) using Bay esian 
probability  of achieving a target ORR (in the 50 evaluable patients).   Assuming a uniform 
prior (ie, Beta(1,1)), if 9, 10, 11 and 12 responses are observed in the next 24 evaluable 
patients, then a posterior probability  of 65%, 78%, 88% and 94%, respectively , would be 
predicte d to achieve ORR 30% in all 50 evaluable OVCA patients.   Analogously , a 66%, 
78%, 87% and 94% predictive probability  would be achieved if there are respectivel y 11, 12, 
13and 14 responses out of the next 24 evaluable patients when ORR 34% is targeted in all 
50evaluable OVCA patients.   Note that ORR 34% in 50 evaluable patients implies that the 
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of this ORR is >20% which is the null
hypothesis (Ho) in the sample size calculation.  The Bay esian model is spec ified b y a prior 
distribution (Beta function), sampling distribution (binomial function), response predictions 
and probability  of exceeding a critical threshold.  The calculation is done using Mark ov 
Chain Monte -Carlo methods (e g, in OpenBUGS –an open sou
rce computing tool for 
Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling ).
This expansion study  (Protocol A mendment 5) was discontinued and the protocol has been
amended to investigate Q2W PF -06647020 as a single agent and in combination with 
avelumab treatment (Pro tocol Amendment 7)in patients with OVC Aand NSCL C.
1.7.Rationale for DDI Sub -Study
The major cy tochrome P450 isoform involved in the metabolism of the unconjugated 
payload ( PF-06380101) in humans was determined to be CYP3A4. (See
Section 1.2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics).  Ph ysiologically -based PK modeling in 
SimCYP, utilizing nonclinical and preliminary clinical data, predicted an average 2 -to 
10-fold increase in unconjugated pay load AUC with co-administration of ketoconazole, a
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, at a clinical dose (200 mg twice daily  [BID
]). Moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, are predicted to have less impact on unconjugated 
payload AUC than ketoconazole, with average AUC increase estimated approximately  2-fold 
at clinical doses.   The effect of fluconazole on unconjugated pay load exposure cannot be 
precisel y predicted at this time due to the lack of certaint y surrounding the overall 
contribution of the CYP3A4 pathway  to elimination of PF -
06380101. A DDI sub -study  will 
be performed to determine the effect of mu ltiple-dose fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of 

PF-06647020

Final Protocol Amendment 8, 09 November 2017
Page 51unconjugated payload (PF-06380101), when fluconazole is co-administered with ADC 
(PF-06647020). 
The primary aim of the DDI sub-study is to verify the DDI related PK alterations 
(eg, decreased clearance of unconjugated payload) and to enable informed decisions regarding inclusion of patients taking concomitant medications, specifically CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
See Appendix 7 for details.
Complete information for fluconazole may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the 
Investigator Brochure (IB).

PF-[ADDRESS_335075] therapy is available.  Successive cohorts of patients received doses of PF-06647020 intravenously Q3W starting at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg.
This clinical study will include two parts.  Part 1 will estimate the MTD/RP2D in dose 
escalation cohorts in patients with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_274143].  Part [ADDRESS_335076] of multiple-dose fluconazole on the PK of 
unconjugated payload (PF-06380101) is currently ongoing.
The DDI sub-study is an open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence design in up to [ADDRESS_335077] of multiple-dose fluconazole, a model moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of ADC (PF-06647020), total antibody (hu6M024 mAb) and unconjugated payload 
(PF-06380101), when fluconazole is co-administered with PF-06647020. The sub-study will 
be in a separate cohort from the studies for TNBC, NSCLC and OVCA, and study design and procedure details can be found in Appendix 7 .
Approximately 190 patients enrolled from 15-20 sites will participate in this study (including 
the Q2W Regimen Expansion).  The actual number of patients enrolled will depend upon tolerability of PF-06647020 and the number of dose levels required to identify the MTD/RP2D. CCI

The target size of each cohort will be 3 patients.  However, patients may  be enrolled in 
cohorts of 2- 4, starting with 0.2mg/kg for the first cohort.  In cohorts with 2 patients 
enrolled, an additional patient may  be enrol led for dose escalation assessment if one of the 
two patients has a DLT.   Subsequent dose levels may  include a maximum 250% escalation 
until either the dose reaches 1.25 mg/kg, or a patient experiences a DLT.  Starting from 
1.25 mg/kg , dose escalation in subsequent cohorts will follow a modified Fibonacci scheme 
with maximum dose increases of 68%, 34%, 33%, 33% , and 33% , respectively .  If a high 
DLT rate is observed at the s tarting dose, a lower dose (eg , 0.1

3.3.DLT Definition
Severity  of adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose 
of dose escalation (Part 1), any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of 
treatment (within [ADDRESS_335080] dose or until patient receives 2ndinfusion if there are 
treatment delay s) will be classified as DLTs , unless there is a c lear alternative explanation 
(eg, related to underl ying disease/progression) :
Hematologic:
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7days;
Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia Grade 3and a single bod y 
temperature >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of 38°C for more than one 
hour

Grade3thrombocy topenia with clinically  significant bleeding;
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia :
any <10,000;
10,000-25,000 for > 3days .
Hepatic:
Grade 3serum bilirubin, hepatic t ransaminase (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]
or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ) or alkaline phosphatase. For patients with 
Grade 2hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline as a result 
of liver metastasis or bone metastasis, a hepat ic transaminase or alkaline 
phosphatase level >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) will be considered 
as a DLT. 
ALT or AST  3.0x ULN concurr ent with elevation in bilirubin 2.0x ULN .
Non-hematologic, non -hepatic:
Grade 3toxicities that are considered non-hematologic, non -hepatic major organ 
toxicity  (excluding alopecia of an y grade, Grade 3
diarrhea that responds to 
therap y, and Grade 3nausea and vomiting in the absence of premedication that 
responds to therap y). 
Delay  by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks in re ceiving the next scheduled cy cle due to 
persisting toxicities attributable to PF -06647020.
In addition, clinically  important or persistent toxicities that are not included in the above 
criteria may  be considered a DLT following review by  [CONTACT_274198].  All 
DLTs need to represent a clinically  significant shift from baseline.
Grade 3cytokine release sy ndrome, infusion reaction, and allergic reaction will not be 
considered as DLTs (as it is unlikely  to be dose related), but may  be a reason fo r study  
discontinuation, protocol amendment (eg ,pre-infusion treatments, infusion duration) and 
should be reviewed with [COMPANY_007]. 
In principle, a patient needs to be on study  for at least 21 days to be evaluable for DLT 
observation, and may  be replaced if they terminate study  participation earlier than 21 days.  
However, in circumstances of a nevent not related to study  drug (eg, traffic accident, clear 
disease progression) that leads to study  termination close to/before 21 days, the patient might 
be deemed evaluable if the investigators and sponsor agree.

DDI Sub -Study : See Appendix 7for additional exclusion criteria.
4.3.Lifestyle Guidelines 
In this stud y, male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of
childbearing potential r eceive PF-06647020, a compound for which a teratogenic risk is 
currentl y unknown.  Those who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are sexually active and at 
risk for pregnancy  must agree to use two (2) methods of highly  effective contraception 
throughout t he study  and continue to do so for at least 30days after the last dose .  The 
investigator or his/her 
designee , in consultation with the patient, will select two appropriate 
methods of contraception for the individual patient from the list of permitted con traception 
methods (see below) and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use.  Patients need 

PF-[ADDRESS_335092] use of 2 of the selected methods of 
contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will d iscuss with the patient the need 
to use 2 highly  effective contraception methods consistently  and correctly  according to the 
Schedule Of Activities and document such conversation in the patient’s chart.  In addition, 
the investigat or or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately  if one or 
both selected contraception methods are discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected 
in the patient or the patient’s partner. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal 
methods of contraception are allowed provided the patient plans to remain on the 
same treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal 
contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctly placed copper -containi ng intrauterine device (IUD) .
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, 
or suppository ). For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, t his option is not 
appropriate.
[LOCATION_006] only : Per Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency (MHRA) , a 
condom with or without spermicide is not considered a highl y effective method of 
contraception in the [LOCATION_006]. Other highly  effective methods of contraception described 
in this section should be used.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
5.Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_47572] (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the 
device’s label).
Female patients of non -
childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following 
criteria:
Have undergone a documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectomy ;
Have medically  confirmed ovarian failure; or 
Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses 
for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or 
physiological cause; status may  be confirmed b y having a serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level con firming the post -menopausal state.

5.4.Administration
PF-[ADDRESS_335098] Manual. All patients should be weighed within 
72
hours prior to dosing for every  cycle to ensure they  did not experience either a weight loss 
or gain >10% from the prior weight used to calculate the amount of PF-06647020 requi red 
for dose preparation. The decision to recalculate PF-06647020 dose based on the weight 
obtained at each cy cle can be in accordance with institutional practice; however, if the patient 
experienced either a weight loss or gain >10% compared to the weigh t used to calculate the 
initial dose, the amount of PF-[ADDRESS_335099] medical and nursing practice.  The monitoring and treatment guidelines are 
provided in Appendix 5.  In  the case of infusion related reactions, characteri zed by  [CONTACT_274203], and less commonly  hypotension, the sponsor should be notified and pre -treatment
medication should be administered prior to subsequent infusions (in the case that the patient 
is able to continue on treatment as per Appendix 5).  The decision to incorporate 
pre-medication in all patients will be made following discussions between the sponsor and 
the investigators.  Patients should be pre
-treated with acetaminophen and diphenhy dramine 
(or ot her antihistamine) approximately  0.5to 2hours before each 
PF-06647020 administration.   The pre -treatment medications will not be supplied by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Suggested starting doses are 650 to 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg diphenhy dramine (or 
equivalent of ot her antihistamine) IV or oral.  Two (2) additional doses of acetaminophen 
may be administered approximately  every  4hours after the initial pre -treatment or as needed.

Appendix 8.
5.4.1. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every  effort should be made to administer study  treatment on the planned dose and schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity  dosing may  be delay ed and/or reduced as described below.  
Inthe event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity  
observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify  investigators at the first occurrence of any  
adverse s ymptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery
 and dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cy cle; 
Between cy cles: next cy cle administration may  be delay ed due to persisting toxicity  
when a new cy cle is due to start;
In the next cy cle: d ose reduction may  be required in a subsequent cy cle based on 
toxicity  experienced in the previous cy cle. 
5.4.2. Dose Interruptions /Delays
Patients experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_335100] their treatment interrupted/delay ed.  
Appropriate follow up assessments should be done until adequate recovery occurs as 
assessed b y the investigator. 
If a treatment interruption continues bey ond Day 21of the current cy cle, then the day when 
treatment is restarted will be counted as Day 1of the next cy cle.  Re-treatment following 
treatment interruption for treatment related toxicity or at the start of an y new cycle may not 
occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
ANC 1,000/mm3;
Platelets count 75,000/mm3;
Non-hematologic toxicities have returned to baseline or Grade 1severity  (or, at the 
investigator discretion, Grade 2if not considered a safet y risk for the patient).
If these conditions are not met, treatment m ust be delay ed by 1week.  If, after a 1-week 
delay , all toxicities have recovered within the limits described above treatment with 
PF-06647020 can be resumed.  Please refer to section Dose Reductions for adverse e vents 
requiring dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption. 

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 70Initiation of the next cy cle can onl y be delay ed by a maximum of 2 weeks.  Therefore, if 
persisting toxicity  does not allow PF-06647020 treatment resumption within 35 days of 
Day 1of pre vious cy cle, this will result in discontinuation of the patient from treatment 
unless discussed and agreed with the Sponsor.
5.4.3. Dose Reductions
Following dose interruption or cy cle delay  due to toxicity , PF-06647020 may need to be 
reduced when treatment is re sumed.
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2treatment -related toxicity .  
However, investigators should alway s manage their patients according to their medical 
judgment based on the particular clinical circumstances.
Patients experienc ing recurrent and intolerable Grade 2toxicity  may  resume dosing at the 
next lower dose level once recovery  to Grade [ADDRESS_335101] ions are 
required , unless otherwise agreed between the investigator and the sponsor .  All dose 
modifications/adjustments must be clearl y documented in the patient's source notes and CRF. 
Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cy cles should be 
administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required.  Dose re -escalation 
is not allowed.
For patients experiencing an adverse event related to PF
-06647020 that fails to recover to 
CTCAE Grade 1(or within 1 grade of sta rting values for pre -existing laboratory  
abnormalities) leading to treatment delay  of >2 weeks should be discontinued unless 
discussed with the Sponsor .
Recommended dose reductions are illustrated in Table 10.
Patients experiencing a DL T may  resume dosing at the next lower dose level (if applicable) 
once adequate recovery  is achieved.

Page 725.5.Drug Storage
The investigator, or an approved representative ( eg, pharmacist )will ensure that all 
investigational product isstored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
drug label .  See the Investigational Product Manual for storage conditions of the product.
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure )will be superseded b y the 
storage conditions stated in the labeling.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation 
for excursions should be d ocumented.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device 
and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to 
ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery .  
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to labeled storage 
conditions, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any 
actions taken, must be documented and report ed to the sponsor.
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It 
will not be considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational 
product after the 
temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007]
approval will be considered a protocol deviation. 
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site. 
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not 
considered excursions. 
5.6.Drug Accountability
The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/recor d. 
5.6.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigato r must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 

PF-[ADDRESS_335104] be adequatel y documented.
5.7.Concomitant Treatment (s)
Concomitant treatment considered necessary  for the patient’s well-being may be given at 
discretion of the treating phy sician.
All concomitant treatments including supportive care drugs (eg, anti- emetic treatment and 
prophy laxis) ,drugs used to treat adverse eve nts or chronic diseases, blood products, as well 
as non-drug interventions (eg, transfusions, analgesic use or paracentesis) received b y 
patients within 28 days (4weeks) prior to first dose of study  treatment until the end of study  
visit will be recorded on the CRF.  This will include the name [CONTACT_135005], route and duration of treatment.

-[ADDRESS_335105] the PK of compounds pri marily  metabolized by  [CONTACT_274207]. As Aur0101 is a P -gp substrate and is primarily  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4, there 
may be a potential change in Aur0101 PK exposure when PF-06647020 is co-administered 
with potent CYP3A/P -gp inhibitors and/or inducers. Theref ore, co -administration of 
PF-06647020 and potent CYP3A/P- gp inhibitors and/or inducers, as listed in Appendix 6, is 
not recommended. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal 
enzy me in
hibition and/or induction potential is recommended. Any questions regarding 
administration of concomitant medications should be directed to the sponsor.
During the study , co-administration of potent CYP3A inducers and strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(see Appendix 6) with PF - 06647020 is not permitted.  This restriction is included to 
minimize the potential influence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction on the determination 
of the maximum tolerated dose.  Patients may  undergo a washout period of 4 to 5times the 
half-life of the inducer or inhibitor prior to screening and enrollment in the study .
DDI Sub -Study : See Appendix 7for further details on concomitant medications.
Guidance for concomitant treatment in the Q2W regimen expansion is included in 
Appendix 8.
5.7.1. Other 
Anti -tumor/ Anti -cancer or Experimental Drugs
No additional anti -tumor treatment including chemotherap y, hormonal therapy, radiotherap y, 
or experimental anticancer medications will be permitted while patients are receiving stud y 
therap y.  Additionally, the concurrent use of select vitamins or herbal supplements is not 
permitted .
Palliative radiotherap y on study  is permitted for the treat ment of painful bony  lesions 
providing the lesions were known at the time of study  entry  and the investigator clearl y 
indicates that the need for palliative radiotherap y is not indicative of disease progression.

known or expected drug -drug interaction and assuming the drug is not included in the 
Concomitant Treatment (s)section. 
5.7.6. Corticosteroid s
Chronic, sy stemic corticosteroid use (prednisone 12.5 mg/day  or dexamethasone
2mg/day )for palliative or supportive purpose is not permitted. Acute emergency  
administration, topi[INVESTIGATOR_14929], inhaled spray s, eye drops or local injections of 
corticosteroids are allowed.
5.7.7. Surgery 
Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for an y surgical procedures during the study .  The 
appropriate interval of time between surgery  and PF-[ADDRESS_335106] provide evidence 
of informed consent for the study  before completing any  study -specific procedures and may  
be >[ADDRESS_335107] dose .  A patient identification number will be assigned.  The 
investigator (or appropriate delegate at the site) will obtain informed consent from each 
patient in accordance with the procedures described in the 
Schedule Of Activities and 
Assessments section on Patient I nformation and Informed Consent.
Patients will be screened within [ADDRESS_335108] every  4weeks 
until resolut ion or determination, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, that no further 
improvement is expected. 
6.4.Patient Withdrawal
Withdrawal of Consent: Patients who request to discontinue study  treatment will remain in 
the study  and must continue to be fol lowed for protocol specified follow- up procedures.   The 
only exception to this is when a patient specifically  withdraws consent for any  further contact 
[CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously  authorized by  [CONTACT_252769].   
Patients should n
otify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow -up in writing, whenever possible.   The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is from furthe r 
treatment with study  drug only  or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study  
follow -
up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether 
the patient is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available info rmation should be used 
to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law.
Lost to Follow -Up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate patients to determine and 
report their ongoing status.   This includes follow-up w ith persons authorized by  [CONTACT_274209].
  Lost to follow -up is defined b y the inability  to reach the patient after a

Page 76minimum of three documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response b y 
patient to one registered mail letter .  All attempts should be documented in the patient’s 
medical records.   
If it is determined that the patient has died, the site will use permissible 
local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  If investigator’s use of third -party 
representative t o assist in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the patient’s 
informed consent, then the investigator may  use a Sponsor retained third -party  representative 
to assist site staff with obtaining patient’s contact [CONTACT_274210] c vital status data 
necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the study .  The site staff and representative 
will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in 
order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031].
  If after all attempts, the patient remains lost to 
follow -up, then the last known alive date as determined by  [CONTACT_274211]’s medical records.
Withdrawal due to disease progression: According to published and internal lygenerated data, 
an ADCmay trigg er immune response sin NSCLC adenocarcinoma resulting in a “delay ed” 
response phenomenon in which the mechanism of the delay ed response is to be explored. It 
is possible that a patient with NSCL C adenocarcinoma treated with PF -[ADDRESS_335109] dose of stud y drug, the I nvestigator 
may discuss with the Sponsor about the possibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_274155].
The reason for a patient’s discontinuation from treatment will be documented in the end of 
study /withdrawal CRF.  Patients will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_335110], or they  may  be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safet yor behavioral reasons , or 
the inability  of the 
patient to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a giv en investigator site. 
Reasons for withdrawal of study  treatment may  include:
Objective disease progression according to RECIST 1.1;
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;
Unacceptable toxicit y;
Pregnancy ;

Reasons for withdrawal from study  follow -up may include:
Completed study  follow -up;
Study  terminated by  [CONTACT_3211];
Lost to follow -up;
Refus edfurther follow- up;
Death.
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_265358]’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return for a final visit, if applicable 
and follow -up with the patient regarding any unresolved AEs .
If the patient refuses further visits, the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information or for further contact, no further study specific evaluations should be performed, 
and no additional data should be collected.  Th e sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  
data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However , it is anticipated that fr om time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the 
patient . When a protocol -required test cannot be performed , the
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner .

7.1.Safety Assessment
Safety  assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, 
vital signs and phy sical 
examination, ECG (12-lead), laboratory  assessments, including pregnancy  tests and 
verification of concomitant treatments.
7.1.1. Pregnancy 
Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy  test, with 
sensit ivity of at least 25 mIU/mL ,will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study  
therap y –once at the start of screening and once on Day 1of Cycle 1before investigational
product administration .  Following a negative pregnancy  test result at scre ening, appropriate 
contraception must be commenced and another negative pregnancy  test result will then be 
required at the baseline visit before the patient may receive the investigational product.  
Pregnancy  tests will be repeated at every  treatment cy cleduring the active treatment period, 
at the end of stud y treatment and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or 
when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy  tests may  also be 
undertaken if requested by  [CONTACT_128624]/Ethics Committees (IRB/EC )or if 
required b y local regulations.   In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the patient will 
be withdrawn from study medication but may  remain in the study . 
7.1.2. Adverse Events
Assessment of adverse events will include the ty pe, incidence, severity  (graded by  [CONTACT_128669] 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.
7.1.3. Laboratory Safety Assessment
Hematology  and blood chemistry  will be drawn at the time points described in the Schedule 
Of Activities and analy sed at local laboratories.  On Day 1of Cycle 1, the hematology , 
coagulation, blood chemistry  and urinal ysis samples do not need to be repeated if the

7.1.4. Vital Signs and Physical Examination
Patients will have a physical exam to include weight, vital signs, assessment of ECOG status 
and height; height will be measured a t baseline only . 
A full phy sical examination (PE) will be performed at Screening, Day 1of Cy cle1, and at 
the End of Treatment visit for each patient and will include an assessment of all body  
systems (including neurological examination, genitourinary  examination is optional), the 
measurement of bod y weight, height (measured at screening onl y)vital signs and assessment 
of ECOG performance status.  The f ullPE on Day 1of Cy cle1 is not required if the 
screening f ullPE is performed within 1week of dosin g.  Findings of all physical 
examinations should be recorded in the source documents, and any  change from baseline 
considered b y the investigator to be clinicall y significant should be recorded as an adverse 
event in the CRF.
Abbreviated PEs should be perf ormed as appropriate at each visit where f ullphysical exams 
are not required, and on an as needed basis for assessment of adverse events.  Abbreviated 
exams should be targeted to specific s ymptoms or complaints and be consistent with local 
standard of car e. 

PF-06647020

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 80An ey e exam (performed by  [CONTACT_4674]) will be performed at screening.  The ey e 
exam includes Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Int raocular Pressure (IOP) preferabl y 
by [CONTACT_180058], Biomicroscopic Exam (also called slit lamp exam) to evaluate the 
Lids/Lashes/Adnexae, conjunctiva/sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, and Dilate 
fundus exam to evaluate the optic nerve, the vessels, the macula, the peripheral retina.
Further ophthalmic examinations should be guided by  [CONTACT_274213]. 
Weight and body  surface area (BSA) do not need to be performed at each visit; however 
patients should be monitored throughout the study for significant weight change.  If a 
patient’ s weight fluctuates by  [CONTACT_726] 10% in either direction, weight should be collected 
to recalculate the appropriate dose for the next cy cle.  I n cases where individual 
institution/pharmacy  require more frequent weight measurements, weight can be obtained on 
each day  of administration, and the dose recalculated.
Vital signs will include measurements of blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature (oral, 
tympanic or axillary ).  On Day 1of each cy cle, vital signs should be measured prior to 
infusion start (pre -dose) and 1 hour after the start of the infusion.  Sitting blood pressure (BP) 
will be measured after [ADDRESS_335112] with the patient’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg sufficient.  The same arm (preferably  the dominant 
arm) should preferably  be used throughout the trial.  The blood pressure cuff, which has been 
properl y sized and calibrated, should be used to measure blood pressure.  The use of 
automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable.  When the timing of the 
measurements coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate should be 
obtained around to the nominal time of the blood collection.
Beginning at Cy cle8, the Day 8assessments will be optional for patients that have ach ieved 
a CR, PR or SD if agreed upon by  [CONTACT_1963].
7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG
12-lead ECG will be collected as per the Schedule Of Activities and should be performed 
after the patient has rested quietly  fora sufficient amount of time .  ECGs will be compared to 
the patient’s screening ECG and an y clinicall y significant changes will be recorded as 
adverse events and evaluated further, as clinicall y warranted.  If the mean QTc is prolonged 
(value of >500 msec), the ECGs should be re -evaluated by  a qualified person at the 
institution for confirmation.  Additional ECGs should be performed if clinically  indicated.
If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specificall y syncope, dizziness, seizures, 
or stroke), an ECG (triplicate) s
hould be obtained at the time of the event. 
When matched with PK sampling, the ECG should preferabl y be carried out before or after 
each PK sample drawing such that the PK sample is collected at the nominal time ( ie, the 
timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). 
The following measurements from ECGs will be recorded: QT interval, Heart Rate, RR 
Interval, PR Interval, and QRS Complex.

PF-[ADDRESS_335113] achieved a 
CR, PR or SD if agreed upon by [CONTACT_1963].
7.2. Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Blood samples will be collected from patients for PK analysis as noted in the Schedule Of 
Activities .  All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing and according to windows provided in the Schedule Of Activities .  
Samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time of the sample collection will always be noted on the Case Report Form (CRF).  If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical investigators, patient and sponsor.  PK samples will be assayed using validated analytical methods in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures.  Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_274156].
7.2.1. Serum Sample Collection for PK analysis of ADC (PF-06647020), Total Antibody 
(hu6M024 mAb) and Unconjugated Payload (PF-06380101)
Blood samples (4 mL whole blood) to provide approximately 2 mL of serum for 
measurement of serum PF-06380101 concentrations and blood samples (6 mL whole blood) to provide approximately 3 mL of serum for determination of ADC (PF-06647020) and total antibody (hu6M024 mAb) concentrations will be collected from patients in dose escalationand randomized Arms A and C, in appropriately labeled tubes at times specified in the SOA .  
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, an additional blood sample should be 
collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AEs and the date and time should be documented in the CRF.
As part of understanding the PK disposition of the study drug, samples may be used for 
possible metabolite identification experiments and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical methods.  These data will be used for internal exploratory purpose and will not be included in the clinical report.  Samples collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if not consumed during the course of these experiments, will be discarded.

PF-[ADDRESS_335114], abdomen and pelvis computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; brain CT or MRI scan for patients with known or suspected brain metastases; bone scan and/or bone X-rays for patients with known or suspected bone metastases.  Baseline CNS imaging is not required with the exception of symptomatic patients to rule out central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline will be employed in the subsequent tumor assessments.
CT or MRI scans are to be done every 6 weeks ( ±5 days) from the start of study treatment 
until disease progression or death, or at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in 
the previous 6 weeks).  The frequency may be reduced to every 12 weeks after 6 months of study treatment.  Tumor assessments should be fixed according to the calendar, regardless of treatment delays.  For patients enrolled in Part 2, responses of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_274214] [ADDRESS_335115] version 1.1 ( Appendix 2 ). Changes in
tumor size will be categorized as CR, PR, SD, or PD, the latter incorporating the appearance of new lesions. For patients in Part 2, responses of CR or PR must be confirmed by [CONTACT_274214] [ADDRESS_335116] serum samples collected for CA-125 at pre-treatment, each 
tumor assessment (every 6 wks), and end of treatment.  Additional serum samples to be collected for assessment of CA-125 as per Investigator discretion.
One of the key elements of this study is the possibility to evaluate potential molecular targets 
that could be modified in vivo by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]-06647020.

7.9. Other Assessments
7.9.1. Tumor and Medical History
History of the patient’s disease under study including details of the primary diagnosis and 
treatment history will be collected within 28 days before the start of treatment.  In addition, a history of disease process other than the cancer under study (active or resolved) and concurrent illnesses will be collected.  This will also include prior treatments and any current medical treatments for any condition.
7.9.2. Baseline Signs and Symptoms
On Day [ADDRESS_335119](s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by  [CONTACT_274216].  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_36545] a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y nonserious AEs that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_3174] a SAE.  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in t he context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Reporting Period
ForSAEs , the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in t he study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product ,through and including [ADDRESS_335120]. SAEs occurring to a patient after the active 
repor tingperiod has ended should be reported to the sponsor ifthe investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported t o the 
sponsor .
AEs (serious and nonserious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has 
taken at least 1dose of 
investigational product through thepatient’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the AEreporting perio d for nonserious AEs ends 
at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE 
reporting 
period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y intervening 
treatment.
8.1.2. Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to :
Abnormal test findings;

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 88Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdraw al;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasations;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported as AEs
in the approp riate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by [CONTACT_196361].
8.2.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by [CONTACT_4670], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength .  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF which is a specific version of the AE page , and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.

Page 89Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_167167], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated adverse event(s) are captured on an adverse event AE CRF 
page .
8.2.1. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows : 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing o r medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
Test result leads to a change in st udy dosing (outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeati ng an abnormal test, in the absence of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.2.2. Serious Adverse Events
A
nSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect ;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and symptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as a nSAE unless the outcome is fatal within the 
safet y repo rting period.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134920].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome 
during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be recorde d as an AEand as an SAE with NCI CTCAE grade 5 (see Section on 
Severity  Assessment ).

medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical eve nt should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug ab use.
8.2.3. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .
  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_134988] y 
database (see Section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ).
8.2.4. Potential Cases of Drug
-Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total 
bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver 
injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced liver injury  (potential Hy’s law cases) 
and should alway s be considered important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a pot ential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Patients who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range

Page 91The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment .  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered. In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and AL
T, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase, PT/ INR, and 
alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history
, including relevant information, suc h as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , 
occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced 
person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, 
should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging 
(eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the 
laboratory  criteria defined above , wit h no other cause for liver function test ( LFT)
abnormalities identified at the time ,should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s law cases should be reported as SAEs .

includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily  constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver re lief);

Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory  procedures).

Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as 
AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported asthe AE , and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
GRADE Clinical Descrip tion of Severit y
0 No Change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the NCI 
CTCAE Version 4.03 document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE adverse event
4 LIFE -THREA TENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example headache may  be severe (interferes signifi cantly  with the 
patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs listed above.
8.3.1. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.   An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 93AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investiga tional product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigato r's causalit y assessment is 
“unknown but not related to investigational product ,”
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed pr oducts, an exposure during 
pregnancy occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes ,or is fo
und to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a study patient or study  patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safety uniton a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE )Report Form 
and Exposure During Pregnancy  (EDP ) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE 
has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient rep orts that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The informati on submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow
-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
the termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural integrity  of the 

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 94terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless prepr ocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congeni tal anomal y [in a 
liveborn bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_335121].
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by  [CONTACT_1275] .  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be ha ndled on a case -by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his pa
rtner.  The investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job du ties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event .
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unitwithin 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form , regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/ SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF ;however a cop y of the co mpleted SAE Report form
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section onPatient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEsshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes , 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page.
When a patient withdraws because of a SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.4.1. Eliciting Advers e Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient .  In addition, each study  patient will be questioned about AEs.

PF-[ADDRESS_335122] be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This time frame 
also applies to additional new information (foll ow
-up) on previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy ,exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occ urrence of a n SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_335123] awareness of the AE.
For all 
SAEs , the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs ismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent d etermination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitte d as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.5.2. Non Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same a s the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.5.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

9.2. Statistical Methods and Properties
This study is designed to establish the MTD defined as the dose that yields approximately 
25% probability of DLT and considers equivalent doses that yield probability of DLT in the interval (Equivalence Interval) 20% to 30%.  The 25% target was chosen based on safety considerations. The prior distribution of DLT is set as a beta (0.75, 0.65), and the threshold probability for early termination and dose exclusion is set to 0.975. Doses with an incidence 
of DLT≥33% cannot be selected as MTD although is allowed by [CONTACT_203326] [INVESTIGATOR_12183].
9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Dose Escalation/De-Escalation
The modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design
8uses a Bayesian statistics 
framework and a beta/binomial hierarchical model to compute the posterior probability of three dosing intervals that reflect the relative difference between the toxicity rate of each dose level to the target rate (pT = 0.25). If the toxicity rate of the currently used dose level is far smaller than pT, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_134922]; if it is close to target probability (pT), the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_134923]; if it is far greater than pT, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_128598]-escalating the dose level. These rules are conceptually similar to those used by [CONTACT_941] 3+[ADDRESS_335126] table as shown in Table 8 . Thus, compared to 
other advanced model-based designs published in the literature, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_274158]-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 98logistically  less complicated and easier to implement. Recentl y, a phase I study based on the 
mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_274159] .6
Decision rules are based on calculating unit probability  mass (UPM) of three dosing intervals 
corresponding to under, proper, and over dosing in terms of toxicity . Specifically , the 
underdosing interval is defined as (0; pT -e1), the over-dosing interval (pT+e 2), and the 
proper -dosing interval (pT - e1, pT+ e 2), where e 1and e 2are small fractions.   Based on the 
safet y profile of PF
-06647020 as a single -agent, e1is selected as 0.05, and e 2is selected as 
0.05. Therefore, the target interval for the DLT rate is (0.20, 0.30).
The three dosing intervals are associated with three different dose -escalation decisions. The 
under -dosing interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), over- dosing corresponds to a dose 
de-escalation (D), and pr oper-dosing corresponds to remaining at the current dose (R). 
Given a dosing interval and a probability  distribution, the unit probability  mass (UPM) of 
that dosing interval is defined as the probabilit y of a patient belonging to that dosing interval 
divided by  [CONTACT_274217]. The mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_274160], and the one with the largest UPM informs the corresponding 
dose-finding decision, which is the dose level to be used for future patients. For example, if 
the under -dosing interval has the largest UPM, the decision will be to escalate, and the next 
cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level8have demonstrated that the 
decision based on UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a posterior expected loss (ie, 
minimizes the chance of making a wrong dosing decision). 
The dose -finding portion of the study  is terminated when either approximately  40DLT 
evaluable patients have been enrolled or w hen at least [ADDRESS_335127] dose with DL T rate <30%, whichever comes first.
The following table shows the probability  of escalating to the next dose level for a range of 
underly ing true DLT rates.  For example, for a 
cohort size of n=3 and for a DL T that occurs 
in 10% of patients, there is a greater than 90% probability  of escalating.  Conversel y, for a 
DLT that occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability  of escalating is 3%.  I t is assumed that 
dose escalation occurs w ith either 0/3 or 1/6 patients with DL Ts.

clinical benefit response ra te will be summarized and presented if data permits.
9.4.1. Analysis of Overall Response
For patients to be considered evaluable for efficacy they  must have received at least one dose 
of study  medication and have a baseline tumor assessment.  Patients must also p resent with 
measureable disease.
The best overall response is the best response recorded from first dose until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since 
screening).  In general, the patient's best r esponse assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  All measurements (or “too 
small to measure”) must be provided for every  target lesion to document SD or PR.

PF-[ADDRESS_335130] met.  
Clinical benefit response (CBR) is defined as a CR, PR, or SD lasting for ≥[ADDRESS_335131] noncompartmental methods.  Actual sample collection times will be used for the parameter calculations.  For ADC (PF-06647020) and total antibody (hu6M024 mAb), PK parameters including maximum concentration (C
max), time to maximum concentration (T max), area under the 
concentration-time curve over 1 dosing interval (AUC τ), area under the concentration-time 
curve from time [ADDRESS_335132] measurable concentration (AUC last), and if data permit or if 
considered appropriate, area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity time (AUC
inf), terminal elimination half-life (t ½), clearance (CL), volume of 
distribution at steady state (V ss), and accumulation ratio (R ac) will be calculated.  For 
unconjugated payload (PF-06380101), PK parameters including C max, Tmax, AUC last, AUC inf, 
AUCτ, t½, and R acwill be calculated as appropriate.  For avelumab, PK parameters including 
Cmax, Tmax, AUC last, AUC inf, AUC τ, t½, CL, V ssand R acwill be calculated as appropriate.
Drug concentrations of ADC (PF-06647020), total antibody (hu6M024 mAb), unconjugated 
payload (PF-06380101), and avelumab will be summarized graphically and with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_2715]/regimen/treatment, cycle, and the nominal PK sampling time.  Noncompartmental PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_2715]/regimen/treatment and cycle.  
9.5.2. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis

For the immunogenicity data, the percentage of patients with positive ADA and Nab each 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994] (Part 1) or by [CONTACT_5268] (Part 2). For patients with positive ADA or neutralizing antibodies, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA or neutralizing antibodies response will also be described, if data permit. 
Potential impact of immunogenicity on PK and  
safety/tolerability and efficacy of PF-[ADDRESS_335133] to causality based on the investigator’s 
judgment.  The frequency of overall toxicity, categorized by [CONTACT_274220] 1 through 5, will be described.  Additional summaries will be provided for AEs that are observed with higher frequency.
Adverse events, ECGs, blood pressure, pulse rate, and safety laboratory data will be 
reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of patients.  Any clinical laboratory, ECG, BP, and PR abnormalities of potential clinical concern will be described.  Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate.
Medical history and physical examination information collected during the course of the 
study will not be captured for inclusion into the study database, unless otherwise noted.  However, any untoward findings identified on physical and/or neurologic examinations conducted after the administration of the first dose of study medication will be captured as an adverse event, if those findings meet the definition of an adverse event.  Data collected at Screening that is used for inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as laboratory data, ECGs and vital signs will be considered source data, and will not be captured for inclusion into the study database, unless otherwise noted.  Demographic data collected at Screening will be 
included in the study database.
9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
DLT is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation component of the study.  The occurrence 
of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD as described in the Study Design section.  Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be listed per dose level.  
Because the intent is to find a desirable dose that meets the tolerability criteria based on DLT rate while demonstrating clinical activity based on response rate, descriptive statistics (n, frequency and percentage) will be reported.  Corresponding listings of data will be generated.CCI

The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its age nts immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever fea sible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the patient's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

PF-[ADDRESS_335135] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The inves tigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributab le, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292]. Any corrections to en tries made in the CRFs orsource 
documents must be dated, initialed , and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's chart.  I n these cases ,
data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site andat [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on th e CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or 
inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documen tation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to ICH, according to local regulations, or as 
specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , which ever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee accept
able to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_335136] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

PF-[ADDRESS_335137] (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the i nvestigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazar ds to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requireme ntsandthe general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guidelines for G ood Clinical Practice , and the Declara tion of 
Helsinki . 
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required b y law.
When study  data is compi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], patient
names, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical code sbased on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study patient s.  The investigator 
site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study , linking each 
patient’s numerical code to his or her 
actual identity . In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patient personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document sand an y patient recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicabl e privacy  laws .
The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and an y patient 
recruitment materials 
must be reviewed b y [COMPANY_007] , approved b y the IRB/EC before use, and 
available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that eac h study  patient , or his/ her legally  acceptable 
representative , is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation.

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 106Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally  acceptable representative the patient’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient’s decisional capacity  is so limited he or she canno t reasonabl y be consulted, then, as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
patient’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not prov ide his or her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y 
acceptable represen tative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  patient (eg, parent, 
spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y, 
it must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designa ted b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient 's legally  acceptable representative , before an y 
study -specific activity  is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each patient 's
signed consent document .
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information thatmight influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial inAll Participating Countries 
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, or investigational pro duct safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of 
PF-[ADDRESS_335138] all participating patients and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601]  
(if applicable) within a reasonable period of time
.  As directed b y [COMPANY_007], all study  materials 
must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

CATEGORIZING LESIONS
AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension.
Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least 10mm or greater 
when assessed b y CT or MRI  (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_335149] X -ray. 
Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by  [CONTACT_4733].
Malignant ly mph nodes wi th the short axis [ADDRESS_335150].
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest 
axis for all other measurable lesions. 
Non-measurable disease
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly  non-measurable disease such as
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or l
ung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately  measured 
with calipers, abdominal masses identified b y physical exam that are not measurable b y 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated b y CT or MRI and meet the definition of 
measurability  at baseline. 
Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non -measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
Normal sites
Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non -target disease.  Cy stic lesions thought to 
represent cy stic metastases can be measurable lesio ns, if they  meet the specific 
definition above.  If non -cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target 
lesions.

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 117Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <[ADDRESS_335151] be documented 
appropriatel y.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. 
Note: For the patient population being evaluated in this protocol, the baseline assessment 
may be completed within 6 weeks prior to randomization. 
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline .  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the 
case of pathological l ymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study . 
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_335152] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be 
recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement 
should still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non-measurable disease is non- target. All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non -target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMI NATE, PRESENT/NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non- target lesio ns in one organ may be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic l ymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).

PF-[ADDRESS_335153] to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate . 
Target disease
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
<10mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
Stable: Does not qualify  for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only  in the rare case that the sum increases by  [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously  documented 30 % decrease no 
longer holds. 
Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therap y), with a minimum absolute increas e of 5 mm. 
Indeterminate.  Progression has not been documented, and 
one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed; 
or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline;
or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accuratel y (eg, poorl y visible 
unless due to being too small to measure);
or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared 
or increased. 
Non-target disease
CR: Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tu mor marker 
levels.  All ly mph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 119Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of an y non -target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits. 
PD: Unequivocal progression of pre- existing lesions.  Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non- target 
disease should be rare. 
Indeterminate: Progression has not been deter mined and one or more non -target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of an y new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due t o its small size, continued assessment will clarify  the etiology .  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be 
considere d a new lesion.
Supplemental I nvestigations
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completel y, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_134941]. 
Subject ive progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health 
Status.  Every  effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

Page 126Appendix 7.Drug -Drug Interaction (DDI) Sub- Study
The objective of this DDI sub -study  is to evaluate the effects of multiple -dose fluconazole, a 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of unconjugated pay load 
(PF-06380101) following single -dose administ ration of ADC (PF -06647020).  Information 
on the effect of fluconazole on the PK profile of unconjugated pay load (PF -06380101) will 
help better understand the risk of increase in exposure to PF -06380101 due to inhibition of 
the CYP3A4 mediated PF -06380101 elimination that may  occur when moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors are present.
The potential effects of multiple -dose fluconazole on the PK of ADC (PF -06647020) and 
total antibody  (hu6M024 mAb ) will also be assessed.
Background:
The major cy tochrome P450 isoform involved in the metabolism of unconjugated pay load 
(PF-06380101) in humans was determined to be CYP3A4 (See Section 1.2.2 Nonclinical 
Pharmacokinetics). Physiologically -based P K modeling in SimCYP, utilizing nonclinical 
and preliminary  clinical data, predicts an average 2 to 10 -fold increase in 
PF
-06380101 (payload) AUC with co -administration of ketoconazole, a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, at a clinical dose (200 mg BID). Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as 
fluconazole, are predicted to have less impact on PF -[ADDRESS_335156]  to elimination 
of PF -06380101.
Fluconazole is a sy nthetic azole antifungal medication. In normal volunteers, the 
bioavailability  of orally  administered fluconazole is over 90% compared with intravenous 
administration. In fasted healthy  volunteers, administration of a single oral 400 mg dose of 
fluconazole leads to a mean C maxof 6.72 μg/mL  which occurs between [ADDRESS_335157] day  of therapy  to result in plasma concentrations close to steady -state by  [CONTACT_274222] y. The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedl y affected b y reduction in renal 
function. Therefore, only  patients with sufficient renal f unction ( serum creatinine 
1.5 x upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance 60ml/min) will be eligible for this 
sub-study . Data from a food effect study  with fluconazole indicated that Cmax and AUC of 
fluconazole are not affected by  [CONTACT_8208].   Therefore, fluconazole may  be taken without regard to 
meals.
Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cy tochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzy me 2C9 and 2C19, and a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily  by 
[CONTACT_13624], with appro ximately  80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as 
unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites. Due to the 
majority  of fluconazole being excreted unchanged in the urine, and due to the low observed 
concentra tions (<0.05 ug/mL ) of PF -06380101, PF -
[ADDRESS_335158] dose (C1D1) of PF -06647020 administered for the DDI sub- study will be 
2.8mg/kg.  The second dose (C2D1) of PF -06647020 administered will be 1.4 mg/kg. An 
approximatel y 90% increase in unconjugated pay load (PF -06380101) AUC is anticipated 
when c o-administered with fluconazole (a loading dose of 400 mg followed by  200 mg dail y 
doses).  The exposure of unconjugated pay load (PF -06380101) following a single dose 
administration of 1.4 mg/kg of ADC ( PF-06647020) with fluconazole is expected to be lower
than the unconjugated pay load exposure previously  observed at the 3.
7mg/kg using a 
Q3W schedule.
DDI Sub -Study Design:
This is an open -label, [ADDRESS_335159] of 
multiple -dose fluconazole on the PK of unco njugated pay load (PF -06380101) following a 
single dose of ADC (PF -06647020). PF-[ADDRESS_335160] of two periods of intense PK sampling, Period A 
(Cycle1) and Period B (Cy cle2).In the first period, Period A, a single- dose of 
PF-06647020 will be administered alone on C1D1 at 2.8 mg/kg. In Period B a single -dose of 
PF-06647020 will be administered on C2D1 at 1.4 mg/kg , in combination with fluconazole.
Fluconazole will be admini stered starting one day before Period B (C2D1). A maximum of 
10patients will be enrolled to ensure at least 8 patients complete the DDI sub -study  
procedures. (See Schedule of Activities Table A1 and Table A2 for details). 
Enrollment of patients into the DDI sub -study  will initially  be carried out in a staggered 
manner. Once the first patient receives the second dose ( C2D1) of PF -06647020 and has 
been evaluated for one week (C2D8) w ith no clinically  significant treatment- related side 
effects requiring intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], then a second patient may  be enrolled.  
Remaining patients may  be enrolled once the first and second patients have completed 
C2D8 with no clinically  significant treatment-related side effects requiring intervention or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Once completing C ycle 2, patients will continue to receive treatment with PF -06647020 at 
2.8mg/kg every  21days if the patient does not meet discontinuation criteria, as o utlined in
Section 6.4. 
All study  requirements and guidelines described in the main body  of the protocol must be 
followed, in addition to any
 described in this Appendix 7.

2Day 12).
Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cy tochrome CYP2C9 and CYP 2C19, and a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. Clinically  or potentiall y significant drug interactions between 
fluconazole and the agents/classes provided in Table 14have been observed or anticipated. 
In addition, th
ere is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 co-administered with fluconazole. These elevated 
plasma concentrations may  increase or prolong therapeutic and adverse effects of these 
drugs. Caution should be exercised when using any  of these combinations. Whenever 
possible, plasma concentrations of these drugs should be monitored, and when appropriate, 
clinical monitoring for signs or sy mptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects is 
advised. The enz yme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4 –5days after discontinuation 
of fluconazole treatment due to the long half -
life of fluconazole.

ECGs:
12-lead ECG will be collected as per the Schedule of Activit ies (Table A1 and Table A2 in 
Appendix 7) and should be performed after the patient has rested quietl y for at least 
10minutes. ECGs will 
be compared to the patient’s screening ECG and any clinically 
significant changes will be recorded as adverse events and evaluated further, as clinically  
warranted.  If the mean QTc is prolonged (value of >500 msec), the ECGs should be 
re-evaluated b y a qualified person at the institution for confirmation.  Additional ECGs 
should be performed if clinically  indicated.
If patient experiences cardiac or neurologic AEs (specificall y syncope, dizziness, seizures, or 
stroke), an ECG (triplicate) should be obtain ed at the time of the event.

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 135When matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be obtained before (preferable) or after 
each PK sample drawing such that the PK sample is collected at the nominal time (ie, the 
timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). For Cy cle2, 
Day 1, pre -dose PK sampling should occur prior to administration of fluconazole at the site, 
while the pre -dose ECG should be performed approximately  1hour after fluconazole dose 
(~T maxfor fluconazole), prior to PF -06647020 infusion. 
Sample Size:
A maximum of 10 patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumor that is resistant to standard 
therap y or for which no standard therap y is available will be enrolled in this DDI sub -study  
to obtain 6evaluable patients.  Evaluable patients are those that complete Period A 
(Cycle1)and Period B (Cy cle2)with no evidence of missed doses of fluconazole.
SeeSection 9.3 for additional details regardin g sample size.
Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis:
Serum concentrations of unconjugated pay load (PF -06380101), ADC (PF -06647020), and 
total antibody  (hu6M024 mAb) will be measured using validated method(s). 
Log-transformed C maxand AUC values for unconjugated payload (PF -06380101) will be 
evaluated using a mixed -
effect ANOVA model.  The ratios (Test/Reference) of geometric 
means and 90% confidence intervals for the ratios will be computed for AUC and Cmax to 
assess the interaction. ADC alone will be the Refere nce and ADC in the presence of 
fluconazole will be the Test.
A similar anal ysis will be conducted for ADC (PF -06647020) and total antibody  
(hu6M024 mAb), as supportive data.
Data from 
patients prematurely ending participation in the study  or failing to mee t evaluation 
criteria may  be excluded from pharmacokinetic data evaluation.

Combination of PF -06647020 with Avelumab in patients with OVCA and NSCLC)
A1. Background and Rationale
This sub-study  will evaluate the safet y, PK, and anti -tumor activity  of si ngle agent 
PF-06647020 and combination of PF-0664720 with avelumab when administered Q2W in 
patients with platinum -refractory or resistant OVCA and patients with recurrent advanced 
NSCL C.  
This sub- study  contains a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expa nsion (Part 2).  The Part 1 
will be conducted in patients with platinum resistant or refractory  OVCA and patients with 
recurrent advanced NSCLC; and PF -[ADDRESS_335184] three cohorts of 
patients: 
Cohort 1 PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment in patients with platinum resistant 
or refractory  OVCA .
Cohort 2 PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment in patients with recurrent advanced 
NSCL C
.
Cohort 3 PF-06647020 in combination with avelumab in platinum resistant or 
refractory  OVCA.  
If supported b y safet y and anti -tumor activity , additional cohort with approximately  
24patients with recurrent advanced NSCL C may  be considered in Part 2 to receive 
combination of PF -06647020 with avelumab.

PF-06647020

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 143The study  scheme for the Q2W regimen expansion is described in the diagram below: 
A1.1. PF -06647020
PF-06647020, a novel ADC targeting PTK7, has been investigated in 112 patients (as of 
17March 2017) with advanced cancers including platinum and/or paclitaxel heavily  
pre-treated OVCA. In the ongoing Phase I stud y,as of [ADDRESS_335185] been treated with PF -06647020 on a Q3W regimen at 
different dose levels in the ongoing Phase I stud y, of which 44 were OVCA patients, 25 were 
NSCLC patients, and 31 were TNBC patients, 12 patients had other t ypes of solid tumor.
Of the total 44 OVCA patients who received PF-06647020 treatment, 42 were treated at 
2.8mg/kg, 1 at 2.1 mg/kg, and 1 at 3.7 mg/kg.   In 38 patients who were considered eva luable 
for ORR assessment, 9 patients achieved objective response (1 CR, and 8 PR) with an ORR 
of 24% (95% CI, 13%, 39%) and 18 patients (47%) had a best response with SD. Median 
PFS was 12.6 weeks (95% CI, 12, 24). Median duration of treatment with PF -06647020 was 
8.1weeks (range 0.1 -45.3 weeks).
Of the total 25 NSCL C patients received PF -06647020 treatment, 22 were treated at 
2.8mg/kg, 2 at 1.25 mg/kg, 1 at 2.1 mg/kg. In 23patients who were considered evaluable 
for ORR assessment, 4 patients achiev ed PR with an ORR of 17% (95% CI, 7%, 37%) and 
9
patients (39%) had a best response with SD. Median PFS was 18.1 weeks (95% CI, 
6,30.1) and median duration of treatment with PF -06647020 was 9.0 weeks 
(range -0.1-46.3- weeks).
Of the total 31 TNBC patients received PF -06647020 treatment, 27 were treated at 
2.8mg/kg, 2 at 2.1 mg/kg, 2 at 3.7 mg/kg.   In 27patients who were considered evaluable for 
ORR assessment, 6 achieved PR with an ORR of 22% (95% CI, 11%, 41%). Eight (30%) 
patients had a best response o f SD.   Median PFS was 8.3 weeks (95% CI, 6, 23.6) and a 
median duration of treatment with PF -06647020 was 3.0 weeks (range 0.1 -
40.3 weeks). 

PF-[ADDRESS_335186] were Grade 1 or 2.  A total of 15 patients 
(35.7%) experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_335187] common was neutropenia 
(10patients, 23.8%), headache, m yalgia, vomiting, and hypomagnesaemia (2 patients (4.8%)
each).
When administe red Q3W, PF -06647020 at RP2D 2.8 mg/kg demonstrated encouraging 
anti-tumor activity  with a generall y well acceptable safet y profile. Preliminary  PK anal yses 
and simulation suggest that Q2W dosing is expected to be better aligned with PK 
characteristics of PF-06647020, with lower peak -to-trough PK fluctuation compared to the 
Q3W regimen.  Therefore the Q2W regimen of PF- [ADDRESS_335188] that combi ning the PTK7- targeted ADC with avelumab 
would improve clinical outcomes.  In preclinical studies, combination of avelumab with 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_274142] -tumor activity .20  A recent preclinical study  
demonstrated that immunotherap y can be enhanced by  [CONTACT_274227] y;21indeed the PTK7 -targeted ADC delivers a potent chemotherap y 
preferentiall y to the tumor cells and thus is distinguished from standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In 
addition, the PTK7 -
targeted ADC could stimulate anti- tumor immunity  (and thus stimulate 
the response to avelumab) by  [CONTACT_16000]: (1) auristatins can activate dendritic cells 
([COMPANY_007], unpublished data), and the expression of PTK7 on dendritic cells could increase the 
delivery  of auristatin to those cells ;(2) anti -angiogenic activity  can promote immune cell 
infiltration into tumors, and the PTK7 -targeted ADC specificall y inhibits angiogenesis; 
(3)immunogenic cell death can stimulate anti -tumor immunity , and auristatins induce this 
phenoty pe in cancer cell lines.19
A1.2. Avelumab (MSB0010718C)
Avelumab (MSB0010718C), a fully  human antibody  of the IgG1 isot ype, specifically targets 
and blocks PD- L1, the ligand for PD -[ADDRESS_335189] expression of PD -L1 was observed in ovarian 
cancer samples, and higher expression of PD -L1 was associated with significantly  worse 
prognosis.32Preliminary data from the ongoing OVCA Study  EMR 100070-001, which is 
being conducted b y [COMPANY_006] KGaA/EMD Serono (EudraCT number 2013 -002834 -
19, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) showed an overall response rate (ORR ) of 10.7% (8/75) and stable disease 
(SD) in an additional 44% (33/75) of patients with advanced OVCA.

Page 146As of 05 November 2015, 509 of 1300 patients (39.2%) in the pooled expansion cohort had 
at least 1 serious TEAE. Treatment-related serious TEAEs were reported in 71 of the 1300 patients (5.5%) in the pooled expansion cohort.  These included infusion-related reaction (11 patients; 0.8%), pneumonitis (8 patients; 0.6%), pyrexia and dyspnea (each in 5 patients; 0.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (3 patients; 0.2%), and asthenia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, vomiting, hyponatremia, adrenal insufficiency, and non-cardiac chest pain (each in 2 patients; 0.2%). All other treatment-related TEAEs were reported in a single subject (0.1%) only.
As of 05 November 2015, 466 deaths (35.8%) occurred in the dose expansion cohorts.  The 
majority of deaths in the dose expansion cohorts were due to progressive disease (360 patients; 27.7%).  Overall, a total of 5 deaths (0.4%) due to TEAEs related to trial treatment were considered as primary reason of the death by [CONTACT_093]. Two additional cases of death were reported and assessed as treatment-related, but the treatment related TEAEs were not considered as the primary reason of death. A total of 142 deaths (10.9%) occurred within [ADDRESS_335193] treatment in the dose expansion cohorts.  Overall there were (14%) patients who experienced treatment related AEs with fatal outcome; in 4 patients the treatment-related AE was reported as the primary cause of death as noted above.  These 7 cases with AEs related to study treatment included: pneumonitis radiation induced and dyspnea; acute liver failure associated with autoimmune hepatitis (no biopsy/autopsy performed); disease progression; fatal anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest; autoimmune hepatitis with hepatic failure and fatigue (no biopsy/autopsy performed); respi[INVESTIGATOR_274169]; and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and leukocytosis (occurred after the end of the on-treatment period).
As of 05 November 2015, a total of 175 patients (13.5%) treated in the dose expansion 
cohorts withdrew permanently from trial treatment due to one or more TEAE.  Of these patients with treatment discontinuations, 79 patients (6.1%) in the dose expansion cohorts had treatment discontinuations that were due to treatment-related TEAEs.  These TEAEs were infusion-related reaction (25 withdrawals; 1.9%), Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased and rash (5 withdrawals each, 0.4%), and aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and lipase increased (3 patients each, 0.2%), and 
ALT increase, autoimmune hepatitis, and dyspnea (2 patients each, 0.2%).  All other 
treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in a single patient (0.1%) only.

Infusion-Related Reactions: Two unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs); 
anaphylactic reaction and infusion-related reaction) involving 2 patients were reported in December 2013 and triggered a cumulative review of serious and non-serious cases of infusion-related reactions/hypersensitivity across the avelumab program.  Following evaluation of safety signals, infusion-related reactions/hypersensitivity have been classified as a newly identified risk (previously classified as a potential risk) and a mandatory premedication regimen of a histamine H1 receptor (H1) blocker plus acetaminophen was implemented for all trial patients starting 29 January 2014.
Starting from 29 January 2014, a mandatory premedication with H1 blockers plus 
acetaminophen was implemented for all patients who are to receive avelumab.  One hundred and ninety-four of 1259 patients (15.4%) in the pooled treatment expansion cohort experienced infusion-related reaction in the presence of premedication with 50 patients (4.0%) having Grade 1, 138 patients (11.0%) having Grade 2, 4 patients (0.3%) having Grade 3, and 2 patients (0.2%) having Grade 4 events.  Two patients (5.3%) in the dose escalation cohort reported infusion-related reactions (both Grade 2) in the presence of premedication. In addition to the aforementioned patients, one case of Grade [ADDRESS_335194] infusion of avelumab (10 mg/kg).  The patient died due to an anoxic brain injury 7 days later; no autopsy was performed. 
Guidelines for the management of infusion-related reactions and severe hypersensitivity 
reaction are found in Section A7.3.3.2 .  A complete guideline for the emergency treatment of 
anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council ([LOCATION_008]) and can be found at https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdfhttps://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdfhttps://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf.

A1.2.2. Avelumab Pharmacokinetics (MSB0010718C)
PK following the first 1-hour infusion and dose proportionality of avelumab have been 
characterized in [ADDRESS_335195] dose 
generally increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the dose range between 3 to 20 mg/kg.  Apparent half-life tended to increase with dose, likely due to target mediated disposition at lower doses, but terminal half-life at 10 and 20 mg/kg doses were similar (102-120 hours).  This likely indicates that target mediated elimination does not increase at these two doses and target occupancy is very high. CCI

Page 149A1.3. Summary of Benefit/Risk Assessment
An evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks as require d in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC) has been conducted.
PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment with Q3W regimen in the Phase I study  has 
demonstrated encouraging anti- tumor activity  in heavily  pre-treated patients with advanced 
solid tumors including OVCA , NSCL C and TNBC with ORR ranging from 17- 24%.  The 
median PFS (8-18 weeks) observed is within the expected range and continues to evolving 
due to the nature of the ongoing study . 
AEand laboratory  test data for PF -06647020, as of [ADDRESS_335196] edPF-06647020 , 
administered at Q3W, is generall y well tolerated and has an acceptable and manageable 
safet y profile.  The 
AEs observed were in line with those expected in patients with advanced 
solid tu mors treated by [CONTACT_274228].  Febrile neutropenia and neutropenia observed in the study  
are considered manageable toxicities with appropriate prophy laxis and/or clinical 
management but remain classified as potential safety  concerns.  Grade 3 headache and 
fatigue were identified as DL Ts in the dose escalation study and were well managed with 
dose reduction and/or treatment following institutional guidance .  Preliminary  
exposure -response anal ysis revealed a napparent correlation between PF -06647020 PK 
exposure andORR in OVCA patients
;sustained PF -[ADDRESS_335197] of the observed events were either in line with those expected in patients with advanced 
solid tumors or with similar class effects of monoclonal antibodies blocking the PD -1/PD -L1 
axis.  I nfusion -related reactions including hy persensitivity  and irAEs/autoimmune disorders 
have been identified as important risks for avelumab.  Respective risk mitigation measures 
have been implemented in all ongoing clinical studies with avelumab, including this clinical 
trial protocol.  These mitigation measures include a treatment algorithm and guidelines for 
treatment interruption and discontinuation in case of irAEs, as well as mandatory  
pre-treatment with a hist amine H1 receptor (H1) blocker and acetaminophen.  Avelumab 
demonstrated clinical activity in heavil y pretreated OVCA patients in an expansion cohort of 
an ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_335198] of care treatment in multiple ty pes of advanced cancers 
including OVCA and NSCL C.

combination with avelumab at a Q2W regimen is anticipated to be favorable for investigation 
inanadvanced cancer patient population.
A2. STARTING DOSE RATIONALE FOR Q2W REGIMEN
A2.1. PF -06647020 
The recommended starting PF -06647020 dose for the Q2W regimen study  will be 2.1 mg/kg ,
administered as 1 -hour IVinfusions.  
In the ongoing trial , single agent PF-06647020 at doses ranging from 0.2 mg/kgto 3.7 mg/kg
Q3W were evaluated in 1 12patients with advanced solid tumors including 44patients with 
heavily  pre-treated OVCA.  PF-06647020 was found to be generally  well tole rated with an 
acceptable safet y profile.  The RP2D of PF -06647020 was identified as 2.8 mg/kgQ3W , 
which was used in the ongoing dose expansion studies including TNBC, OVCA and NSCL C 
and has been demonstrated with encouraging anti
-tumor clinical activity . 
Preliminary  exposure -response anal ysis revealed a napparent correlation between 
PF-06647020 exposure and ORR in OVCA patients ;sustained PF -06647020 PK exposure 
appeared to be associated with higher ORR.  Preliminary  PK anal ysis suggested that Q2W 
schedul e would be better aligned with the PK characteristics of PF
-06647020, resulting in 
lower peak -to-trough PK fluctuation, compared to Q3W, likely  yielding a higher exposure 
while maintaining a tolerable safety  profile . The recommended starting dose of 2.1 m g/kg 
for Q2W dosing represents 75% of the MTD of 2.8 mg/kg determined for PF-06647020
Q3W.  PK simulations suggests that the cumulative exposure of 6 weeks of the 2.1 mg/kg 
Q2W is expected to be generall y comparable to that of the 2.8 mg/kg Q3W, with a sli ghtly  
lower C max, and expected to be tolerable.   
A2.2. Avelumab 
To date, avelumab has been administered at the clinically active, safe and tolerable dose of 
10mg/kg Q2W to more than 1700 patients across multiple indications.  Furthermore, this 
10mg/kg Q2W avelumab dosing regimen has been approved b y the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as the first treatment for Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC).  I t has also 
recentl y been approved at this dose and regimen as a second line treatment of Urothelial 
Carcinoma.  Avelumab was originally  dosed on a mg/kg basis in order to reduce inter- subject 
variability  in drug exposure. However, emerging data for monoclonal antibodies, including 
marketed PD -1 and PD- L1immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab a nd 
atezolizumab, reveal that body  weight -based dosing regimens do not result in less variability  
in measures of exposure over fixed (i e,body -weight independent) dosing regimens).29,30,[ADDRESS_335199] that exposures to avelumab across the available range of body  weights are similar 

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8, 09 November 2017
Page 151with 800 mg Q2W compared to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Low-weight subjects tended towards 
marginally lower exposures relative to the rest of the population when weight-based dosing was used, and marginally higher exposures when fixed dosing was applied. However, the implications of these exposure differences are not expected to be clinically meaningful. 
Furthermore, the 800 mg Q2W dosing regimen is expected to result in C
trough >1μg/mL 
required to maintain avelumab serum concentrations at >90% Target Occupancy (TO) 
throughout the entire dosing interval in all weight categories.
Therefore, in this clinical trial, a fixed dosing regimen of 800 mg administered as a 1-hour IV 
infusion Q2W will be utilized for avelumab.

Page 153A4. STUDY DESIGN FOR THE Q2W REGIMEN EXPANSION  
The expansion is designed to evaluate safet y, PK and anti -tumor efficacy  of a Q2W dosing 
schedule as a single agent treatment in patients with OVCA and NSCL C, and combined 
treatment of PF -06647020 with avelumab in OVCA patients.  If supported by [CONTACT_45308] y and 
anti-tumor efficacy , additional combination study  of PF -06647020 with avelumab may  also 
be investigated in approximately  24patients with NSCL C.  
The study  contains two par ts, a Part 1 dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion.  Part 1 
contains a dose escalation scheme to estimate the MTD/RP2D of PF -06647020 as single 
agent treatment in patients with platinum -refractory or resistant OVCA and recurrent NSCL C 
(in approximatel y 20 patients) using mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_12183].  Successive cohorts of patients will 
receive doses of PF -06647020 starting at a dose of 2.1 mg/kg, Q2W. Once the RP2D is 
determined and preliminary  efficacy  is observed, dose expansions (Part 2) will be started to
further investigate safet y, PK and efficacy  of Q2W PF -06647020 in three cohorts of patients :
Cohort 1:PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment in patients with platin um resistant 
or refractory  OVCA .
Cohort 2:PF-06647020 as a single agent treat ment in patients wit hrecurrent 
advanced NSCL C.
Cohort 3:PF-06647020 in combination with avelumab in platin um resistant or 
refractory  OVCA .
Approximately  24 patients will be enrolled for each cohort.  Patients that were enrolled in the 
Part1 single agent dose escalation wil l be counted as part of the 24 patients in their 
respective Part 2 single agent cohorts. A n additional cohort in approximately  24patients 
with recurrent advanced NSCL C receiving combination of PF -06647020 with avelumab may  
also be considered for inclusio n at a later time, if supported by  [CONTACT_45308] y and anti -tumor activity  
observed in the single agent treatment cohort . 
In the combination expansion Cohort 3, the RP2D of PF -06647020 as determined by  [CONTACT_9524] 1 
will be used as the dose to combine with avelumab at 800 mg(both administered IV, Q2W).  
The PF -06647020 dose may  be reduced (but not further escalated) for safety  reasons. After 
at least [ADDRESS_335200] completed a minimum observation period 
of 4weeks, safet y will be reviewed b y the investigators and [COMPANY_007] (using the same DLT 
definition described in Section A4.2 ). If there are no safet y concerns precluding continuation 
of the study , enrollment of the remaining patients for this cohort will proceed. If DLT is 
observed in 
2out of [ADDRESS_335201] 6 additional patients will be enrolled at a reduced dose 
of PF -06647020 (the reduced dose of PF -06647020 could be one dose level below the 
defined RP2D from Part 1 assuming the RP2D is above the starting dose of Part 1 
(ie,2.1mg/kg), or 1.8 mg/kg of PF -06647020 in a circumstance that the RP2D from Part 1 is 
2.1mg/kg).

PF-[ADDRESS_335202] be 
followed, in addition to any described in this Appendix 8 .
A4.1. Dose Escalation 
The Q2W regimen expansion contains a PF-06647020 dose escalation portion (Part 1) using 
the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_274172] 3.2 and Table 8 .
Patients may be enrolled in cohorts of 2-4, starting with 2.1 mg/kg Q2W for the first cohort.  
In cohorts with 2 patients enrolled, an additional patient may be enrolled for dose escalation assessment if one of the two patients has a DLT.  If a high DLT rate (>33%) is observed at the starting dose, a lower dose may be considered.  The study may be stopped if the drug is deemed not tolerable at the lowest dose. Table 18 illustrates the potential dose levels in Part 1 dose escalation.

A4.2. DLT Definition for the Q2W Regimen
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03.  For the purpose 
of DLT assessment, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of treatment (within [ADDRESS_335203] dose or until patient receives 2
ndinfusion if there are 
treatment delays) in the single agent dose escalation (Part 1) and combination of PF-06647020 with avelumab will be classified as DLTs, unless there is a clear alternative explanation (eg, related to underlying disease/progression).  DLTs in combination cohort(s) CCI

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 156In add ition, clinically  important or persistent toxicities lasting >5 daysin presence of 
supportive care (eg, Grade 3diarrhea) that are not included in the above criteria should be 
considered a DLT following review b y [COMPANY_007] and the investigators.  All DLTs n eed to 
represent a clinicall y significant shift from baseline.
During Cy cle1 and subsequent cy cles, primary use of granulocy te-colon y stimulating factors 
is permitted following ASCO guidance, if ANC 1000/mm3. 
Primary  prophy laxis of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting is permitted in the first cy cle and 
subsequent cy cles at the investigator’s discretion.
Grade 3cytokine release sy ndrome, infusion reaction, and allergic reaction will not be 
considered as DLTs (as it is unlikely  to be dose related), but may  be a reason for study  
discontinuation, protocol amendment (eg, pre -infusion treatments, infusion duration) and 
should be reviewed with [COMPANY_007]. 
In principle, a patient needs to be on study  for at least 2 8days to be evaluable for DLT 
observation, and may  be replaced if they  terminate study  participation earlier than 28 days.  
However, in circumstances of an event not related to study  drug (eg, traffic accident, clear 
disease progression) that leads to study  termination close to/before 2 8days, the patient migh t 
be deemed evaluable if the investigators and [COMPANY_007] agree.
In the combination cohort (Part 2), the RP2D of PF- 06647020 defined from Part 1 will be 
used to combine with avelumab 10 mg/kg, Q2W.  There will be no dose escalation for the 
combination cohorts.   Part 1 and Part 2 patients will be pooled for the evaluation of safet y, 
tolerability  and anti -tumor activity  of PF -
06647020.  In Part 2, OVCA patients will be 
randomized to receive the combination treatment (Cohort 3) or PF -06647020 single agent 
treatmen
t cohort (Cohort 1) once Cohort 3 is open for enrollment. 
A4.2.1. Late Immune -Related DLTs
In the combination of PF -06647020 with avelumab Cohort 3, late immune -related DLTs are 
immune -related AEs that meet the same grading criteria as DLT criteria and oc cur from 
Day 29 through the Day 84 assessment period (or completion of first 3 cycles if a patient 
remains on treatment).   If late immune related DLTs occur, enrollment in dose expansion (if 
it has been started at the time the late immune related DLT is ob served) will be placed on 
temporary  hold.   All safety  data will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_274229], and a decision 
will be made to either:
Continue enrollment of dose expansion.
All [ADDRESS_335205] 84 days to 
reassess safet y.  The totality  of patients with above described DLT and late immune 
related DLT will be used to reassess DLT rate and inform decision whether a lower 
dose of PF -06647020 should be considered to be combined with avelumab 
(10mg/kg) to further investigate safet y and tolerability .

A5. Assessments
Assessments that are captured in the Schedule of Activities but n ot described below may  be 
found in the main body  of the protocol and must b e followed.
A5.1. Tumor Assessment
Anti- tumor activity  will be assessed b y radiological tumor assessments at 8- week intervals 
until documented disease progression, using RECIST version 1.1 for the single agent arms , 
and immune -related response criteria (ir RECI ST)Appendix 9for combinations arm(s).  If 
PR or CR is observed and the response duration exceeded [ADDRESS_335206], abdomen, and pelvis.
Single agent Cohorts 1 and 2: All radiographic images will be collected for potential 
retrospective central review. Additional information on diagnostic imaging procedures and 
collection will be included in the I maging Manua l.
Complete responses, partial responses and progressive disease must be confirmed on 
repeated imaging at least [ADDRESS_335207] ed 
(eg,symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done 
in the previous 4 weeks).  Brain CT or MRI  scans are required at baseline only  when there is 
a suspected brain metastasis.  A bone scan (bone scintigraphy ) orfluorine -18
fluorodeox yglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG -PET)/CTis required at baseline 
only if bone metastases are suspected, then every  16weeks onl y if bone metastases are 
present at baseline.  Otherwise, bone imaging is required only  if new bone metastases are 
suspected.  Bone imaging is also required at the time of CR confirmation for patients who 
have bone metastases. MRI  is acceptable for bone imaging if consistent with local practice.
CA-125 will be assessed in a local lab every  4weeks . CA-125 measurement alone will not 
be used as criteria for disease progression or response determination . 
In the Part 2 PF-06647020 combination with avelumab cohort (Cohort 3), any patient 
observed with disease progression (based on irRECI ST)will require an additional tumor
assessment in > 4 weeks in order to confirm disease progression.  Patients can stay  in the 
study  at the discretion of investigator and sponsor until progressive disease is confirmed by

Blood samples (4 mL whole blood) to provide approximately  2mL of serum for 
measurement of serum PF -06380101 concentrations and blood samples (6 mL whole blood) 
to provide approximatel y 3mL of serum for determination of ADC (PF -06647020) and total 
antibody  (hu6M024 mAb) concentrations will be collected from all patients, in appropriatel y 
labeled tubes at times specified in the Schedule Of Activities .  
For determination of serum avelumab concentrations, blood samples (4 mL) to provide 
approximatel y 2mL of serum will be collected from patients in combination cohort in 
appropriatel y labeled tubes at times specified in the Schedule Of Activities.
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the scheduled nominal time relative to 
dosing and according to windows provided in the Schedule Of Activities.  Samples obtained 
within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be 
considered protocol co mpliant, and the exact time of the sample collection will alway s be 
noted on the CRF.  I f a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for an y 
reason, the missed sample time may  be re scheduled with agreement of clinical investigators,

PF-[ADDRESS_335209] 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs. 
All patients participating in the combination regimen (Cohort 3) require a triplicate ECG 
measurement at screening.  On-treatment ECGs will be performed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3 pre-infusion and Day 15 of Cycle 1.  At each time point, three (3) consecutive 12-lead 
ECGs (triplicates) will be performed approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc (average of triplicates).  When coinciding with blood sample draws for PK, ECG assessment should be performed prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood sample is collected at the nominal time.  If a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures, or stroke) triplicate ECGs should be obtained at time of the event.  If the mean QTcF is prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the institution for confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  Clinically significant findings seen on follow-up ECGs should be recorded as AEs. 
To ensure safety, if there is a finding of QTc >500 msec (ie, CTCAE Grade >2), then ECG 
must be reviewed by [CONTACT_128670], including verifying that the machine reading is accurate and that the Fridericia correction formula is applied.  If manual reading verifies a rate corrected QTc of >[ADDRESS_335210] be confirmed by [CONTACT_274232].  Prior to

A7. STUDY TREATMENTS
A7.1. Avelumab
Avelumab is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution intended for IV administration.  Avelumab 
is formulated as a 20 mg/mL  solution and is supplied by  [CONTACT_166864] -use glass vials, 
stoppered with a rubber sept um and sealed with an aluminum poly propy lene flip -off seal.
Avelumab (MSB0010718C) will be supplied for the study  by [CONTACT_128651] , 
Worldwide Research and Development.
Packaging and labeling will be in accordance with applicable local regul atory  requirements 
and applicable Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines.  Avelumab will be packed in 
boxes each containing one vial.  The information on the study treatment will be in 
accordance with approved submission documents. 
Avelumab will be shipped in transport cool containers (2 C to 8C) that are monitored with 
temperature monitoring devices.

PF-[ADDRESS_335220] Manual (IP Manual) for instructions on how to prepare the 
investigati onal product for administration.  I nvestigational product should be prepared and 
dispensed by  [CONTACT_274234] 
(eg,physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy  assistant/technici an, 
or pharmacist) as allowed by  [CONTACT_5737], state, and institutional guidance.  
Only  qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe 
disposal of the investigational agents.  
A7.2.1. PF -06647020 Administration
PF-06647020 will be administered on Day 1and 15 of each 4 -week cy cle as an IV infusion 
over approximately  60minutes on an outpatient basis. A cy cle is defined as the time from 
Day 1dose to the next Day 1dose.  
Details for preparation and administration of the PF -06647020 infusion are provided in the IP
Manual.  All patients should be weighed within 72 hours prior to dosing for every  cycle to 
ensure they  did not experience eithe r a weight loss or gain >10% from the prior weight used 
to calculate the amount of PF-06647020 required for dose preparation.   The decision to 
recalculate PF -
06647020 dose based on the weight obtained at each cycle can be in 
accordance with institutional practice; however, if the patient experienced either a weight 
loss or gain >10% compared to the weight used to calculate the initial dose, the amount of 
PF-[ADDRESS_335221] recent weight obtained.
Sites should make every  effort to target PF -06647020 infusion timing to be as close to 1 hour 
as possible.  However, given the variabilit y of infusion pumps from site to site, time windows 
of -10/+20 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 50 -80 minutes).  The exact duration of 
infusion should be recorded in both source documents and CRFs. 
A7.2.2. Avelumab Administration
Avelumab will be administered as a 1 -hour IV infusion once every  14days.  Details for 
preparation and administration of the avelumab
infusion are provided in the IPManual.   
Avelumab will be administered at 800mgon Day 1 and Day 15 of each 4- week cy cle after 
all procedures/assessments have been completed as described in the SOAtable.  Avelumab 
may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled day of administration of each 
cycle due to administrative reasons.
For the combination arm , where both PF -06647020 and avelumab are infused ( Q2W ) 
avelumab will be infused a fter PF -06647020.  If premedication was administered prior to 
PF-06647020, the decision whether to repeat pre -medication prior to avelumab is at the 
discretion of the investigator depending on the elapsed time and the half -life of 

PF-06647020
B7661001
Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 169corresponding premedicati on agent.  The line should be flushed, according to local practice, 
between infusions, and a new administration set should be used for avelumab. 
Sites should make every  effort to target avelumab infusion timing to be as close to 1 hour as 
possible.  Howev er, given the variability  of infusion pumps from site to site, time windows of 
minus 10 minutes and plus 20 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 50 -80minutes).  The 
exact duration of infusion should be recorded in both source documents and CRFs.  Po ssible 
modifications of the infusion rate for the management of infusion -related reactions are 
described in the Guidelines for Toxicit y Management (below) .
A7.2.2.1. Mandatory Premedication for Avelumab Administration
In order to mitigate infusion -related reactions, a premedication with an antihistamine and 
with paracetamol (acetaminophen) 30 to 60 minutes prior to each dose of avelumab is 
mandatory  (for example, 25-50 mg diphenhy dramine and 500 -650 mg paracetamol IV or 
oral).  This may  be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as 
appropriate. The pre -treatment medications will not be supplied by  [CONTACT_4618].
A7.2.2.2. Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression (Part 2 
Combination Cohort 3)
In the combination of PF -[ADDRESS_335222] as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the 
appearance of new lesions. 
A
ll patients receiving the combination that demonstrate progression at initial scan (based on 
RECI ST1.1 and/or irRECI ST), an additional tumor assessment should be repeated 4weeks 
later 
and assessed in order to confirm progression.  Single agent avelumab may be continued 
at the Investigator’s discretion while awaiting radiologic confirmation (ie, expedited central 
review) of disease progression.  If repeat imaging no longer shows PD but rather CR, PR, or 
SD compared to the baseline scan, treatment may  be continued/resumed .  In determining 
whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decre ased, Investigators should consider all 
target lesions as well as non- target lesions (refer to the Study  Manual). 
Before continuation of treatment, the patient must provide consent and be informed that in 
order to continue receiving the investigational pr oducts on study , the patient may  be 
foregoing approved therapy  with possible clinical benefit(s).  Patients may  receive avelumab 
while waiting for confirmation of PD if they  are clinically stable as defined by  [CONTACT_54041]: 
Absence of clinical signs and sy mptoms (including worsening of laboratory  values) 
of disease progression. 
No decline in ECOG performance status.

Final Protocol Amendment 8,09 November 2017
Page 170Absence of rapid progression of disease b y radiographic imaging. 
Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, c ord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
If repeat imaging demonstrates confirmed evidence of PD, patients should be discontinued 
from all study  treatment.  However, according to the Investigator’s clinical judgment and 
after dis cussion between the I nvestigator and the Sponsor, if a patient with evidence of PD is 
still experiencing clinical benefit, the patient may  be eligible for continued treatment with 
single agent avelumab if above criteria are met.   The Investigator’s judgme nt should be 
based on the overall benefit -risk assessment and the patient’s clinical condition, including 
performance status, clinical sy mptoms, AEs, and laboratory  data.  
A7.2.3. Food Requirements
All study  drugs may  be administered without regard to foo d.
A7.3. Guidelines for Toxicity Management 
A7.3.1. PF -06647020: Dose Interruptions/Delays 
Patients experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_335223] their treatment inter rupted/delay ed.  
Appropriate follow up assessments should be done until adequate recovery occurs as 
assessed b y the investigator. 
If a treatment interruption continues bey ond Day 28of the current cy cle, then the day  when 
treatment is restarted will be co unted as Day 1of the next cy cle.  Re -treatment following 
treatment interruption for treatment related toxicity or at the start of an y new cycle may not 
occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
ANC 1,000/mm3. 
Platelets count 75,000/mm3. 
Non-hematologic toxicities have returned to baseline or Grade 1severity  (or, at the 
investigator discretion, Grade 2if not considered a safet y risk for the patient).
If these conditions are not met, treatment must be delay ed by 1week.  If, after a 
1-week 
delay , all toxicities have recovered within the limits described above treatment with 
PF
-06647020 can be resumed.  
Initiation of the next cyclecan onl y be delay ed by a maximum of 2 weeks.  Therefore, if 
persisting toxicity  does not allow PF-06647020 treatment resumption within 28 days of 
previous dose administration
, this will result in discontinuation of the patient from treatment 
unless discussed and agreed with the Sponsor.

Following dose interruption or cy cle delay  due to toxicity , PF- [ADDRESS_335224] PF -06647020 reduced to 1.8 mg/kg, 
but no further reductions are allowed.  Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all 
subsequent cy cles should be administered at that dose level. Dose re -escalation is not 
allowed. 
Refer to Section 5.4.3 for additional guidance on dose reductions.
A7.3.2. PF -06647020 in Combination with Avel umab
For patients receiving PF -06647020 and avelumab combination, PF -06647020 dose 
modifications as well as infusion omissions/delay s for PF -06647020 and/or avelumab may  
occur independentl y for the two drugs according to the guidance provided (see Table 10and 
Table 22)and according to investigator’s medical judgment . Modifications will be reported 
in the CRF. Patients may have PF -06647020 reduced to 1.8 mg/kg (assuming 2.1 mg/kg is 
the RP2D for the Q2W dosing schedule )or one dose level below the RP2D determined in the 
single agent treatment lead -in study  (Part 1), no further reductions are allowed.  Once a dose 
has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cy cles should be admini stered at that 
dose level. 
Dose re -escalation is not allowed. 
If PF -06647020 is delay ed by  1week, avelumab should also be delay ed by 1week so that 
PF-06647020 and avelumab are administered together.

Page 173A7.3.3.2. Avelumab: Infusion -relate d Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions
As with all monoclonal antibody  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], there is a risk of allergic reactions including 
anaph ylactic shock.  Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for immediate 
access to an intensive care un it or equivalent environment and administration of therap y for 
anaph ylaxis, such as the ability  to implement immediate resuscitation measures.  Steroids 
(dexamethasone 10 mg), epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1,000 dilution), allergy  medications 
(IVantihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxy gen should be available for 
immediate access.
Infusion of avelumab will be stopped in case of Grade [ADDRESS_335232] available medical practice.  The emergency  treatment of 
anaph ylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (United 
Kingdom) can be found at https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf.  Patients should be 
instructed to report an y delay ed rea ctions to the Investigator immediately . 
Table 19. Avelumab: Treatment Modifications for Symptoms of Infusion -related 
Reactions
NCI-
CTCAE Grade Treatment Modification for Avelumab
Grade 1 –mild
Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not indicated.Decrease Avelumab infusion rate by 50% and monitor 
closely for any worsening.
Grade 2 –moderate
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, 
NSAIDs, narcotics, IVfluids); prophylactic medications 
indicated for 24 hours.Stop Avelumab infusion.
Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once 
infusion -related reaction has resolved or decreased to at 
least Grade 1 in severity, and monitor closely for any 
worsening.
Grade 3 or Grade 4 –severe or life -threatening
Grade 3: Prolonged (eg, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_86025]/or brief interruption of 
infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial 
improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274176].
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.Stop the Avelumab infusion immediately and disconnect 
infusion tubing from the patient.
Patients have to be withdrawn immediately from 
Avelumab treat ment and must not receive any further 
Avelumab treatment.

Page 174Once the Avelumab infusion rate has been decreased b y 50% due to an infusion -related 
reaction, it must remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.
A7.3.3.3. Avelumab: Additional Modifications for Patients with Grade 2 
Infusion -related Reactions
If, in the event of a Grade 2 infusion- related reaction that does not improve or worsens after 
implementation of the modifications indicated in Table 19(including reducing the infusion 
rate b y 50%), the investigator may consider treatment with corticosteroids and the infusion 
should be st opped for that day .  At the next cy cle, the investigator may  consider the addition 
of H2 -blocker antihistamines (eg, famotidine or ranitidine), in addition to the mandatory  
premedication.  However, prophy lactic steroids are NOT permitted.  If the patient h as a 
second infusion
-related reaction Grade 2 on the slower infusion rate, with or without the 
addition of further medication to the mandatory  premedication, the infusion should be 
stopped and the patient removed from avelumab treatment.
A7.3.3.4. Avelum ab: Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -like Symptoms
If hypersensitivity  reaction occurs, the patient must be treated according to the best available 
medical practice.  A complete guideline for the emergency  treatment of anaphy lactic 
reactions accor ding to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council ([LOCATION_008]) 
can be found at https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf.  Patients should be instructed to 
report an y delay ed reactions to the I nvestigator immediately .
Symptoms include impaired a irway , decreased oxy gen saturation (<92%), confusion, 
letharg y, hypotension, pale or clamm y skin, and cyanosis.  These s ymptoms can be managed 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_166832].  Patients should be placed on monitor 
immediately , and the intensiv e care unit should be alerted for possible transfer if required.
For prophy laxis of flu -like sy mptoms, 25 mg of indomethacin or comparable nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drug (NSAID) dose ( eg, ibuprofen 600 mg, naproxen sodium 500 mg) 
may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of avelumab IV 
infusion.  Alternative treatments for fever ( eg, paracetamol) may  be given to patients at the 
discretion of the investigator.
A7.3.3.5. Avelumab: Immune- related Adverse Events
Because inhibition of PD -L1 stimulates the immune sy stem, irAEs may  occur.  Treatment of 
irAEs is mainly  dependent upon severity  (NCI -CTCAE grade):
Grades 1 to 2: treat sy mptomatically  or with moderate dose steroids, more frequent 
monitoring.
Grades 1 to 2 (persiste nt): manage similar to high grade AE (Grades 3 to 4).
Grades 3 to 4: treat with high dose corticosteroids.

16. Coagulation: No need to repeat on C1D1 if baseline assessment performed within [ADDRESS_335252].   
17. CA-125: Will be assessed locally according to the schedule in the table. 
18. Urinalysis: Dipstick is acceptable.  Microscopic analyses must be performed if dipstick is abnormal. 
19. Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a urine or serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on 
two occasions prior to starting study treatment, once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately b efore study treatment administration.  Urine 
pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every treatment cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of st udy therapy and additionally whenever one 
menstrual cycle is missed or when potential p regnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by [CONTACT_274239]/ethics committee (IRB/ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427].  See Section 7.1.1 for contraception guidelines.
20. 12-Lead ECGs: ECG measurement will be collected during screening and at the End of Treatment Visit.  On -treatment ECGs will be performed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 
3 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 (all pre -
infusion).   In Cycle 4 and subsequent cycles, a single ECG should be taken pre - dose on Day 1.  When coinciding with blood sample draws 
for pharmacokinetics (PK), ECG assessment should be performed prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood sample is collected at the nominal time.  It is 
recommended that ECGs are performed prior to any blood collection or other invasive procedures.  If patient experiences a car diac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, 
dizziness, seizures, or stroke) triplicate ECGs shou ld be obtained at time of the event.  If the mean QTcF is prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should be re
-evaluated by a 
qualified person at the institution for confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated (see 
Section 7.1.5 ).Beginning at Cycle 8, the Day [ADDRESS_335253] achieved a CR, PR or SD if agreed upon by [CONTACT_1963].
21. Registration: Patient number and dose level allocation will be provided by [CONTACT_3954].
22. Study Treat ment: PF-06647020 will be given as a 1 -hour intravenous infusion (IV) every 2 weeks.  Weight should be collected prior to each infusion, assessed and 
docume nted in the CRF.  
23. Tumor Assessments :Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Tumor assessments must include chest, abdomen and pelvi s CT or MRI scans 
and will be conducted every 8 weeks (window of 5 days prior to dosing is al lowed) from the start of study treatment until disease progression by [CONTACT_393] (v1.1) or death, or

Page 185at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in previous 8 weeks). If PR or CR is observed and the response duration ex ceeded 6 months, tumor assessment can be 
assessed at a 12-week interval. Brain scans will be performed at baseline only if disease is suspected and on study as appropria te to follow disease.  Baseline central nervous 
system (CNS) imaging is not required with the exception of symptomatic patients to rule out CNS metastases.  A bone scan (bone scintigraphy) or 18FDG-PET/CT is required 
at baseline only if disease is suspected and then every [ADDRESS_335254] bone metastases.  MRI is acceptable for bone imaging if 
consistent with local practice.  Responses of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_274240] [ADDRESS_335255] met. All radiographic images will be collected for potential central review. Additional information on d iagnostic imaging procedures and collection will 
be included in the Imaging Manual.
24. Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: AEs should be documented and recorded in the CRF.  The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI CTCAE) version (v) 4.03 will be used. The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collecti on period”) for each patient begins from the 
time the patient provides informed consent through and including a minimum of [ADDRESS_335256] still be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety and recorded on the CRF, irrespective of any intervening treatment. Se e Section 8.1.1 .

PF-[ADDRESS_335270] 1.1 (irRECIST)
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional response criteria may not be sufficient 
to fully  characterize activity  in this new era of targeted therap ies and/or biologics.  
This is particularly  true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti- CTLA4 and anti -PD1\anti 
PDL [ADDRESS_335271] 
cytotoxic effects.24,25  Clinical observations of patients with advanced melanoma treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], for example, sugg ested that conventional response assessment criteria such as 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) and World Health Organization 
(WHO )criteria are not sufficient to fully  characterize patterns of tumor response to
immunotherapy  because tumors treated with immunotherapeutic agents may show additional 
response patterns that are not described in these conventional criteria.26,27
Furthermore, the conventional tumor assessment criteria (RECI ST and WHO criteria) have 
been reported as not capturing the existence of a subset of patients who have an OS similar to 
those who have experienced CR or PR but were flagged as PD b y WHO criteria.26,[ADDRESS_335272] 1.1 criteria (irRECI ST).[ADDRESS_335273] criteria .
require confirmation of both progression and response by  [CONTACT_135004] [ADDRESS_335274] documented, and 
does not necessarily  score the appearance of new lesions as progressive disease if the 
sum of lesion diameters of target lesions (minimum of 10 mm per lesion, maximum 
of 5target lesions, maximum of 2 per organ) and measurable new lesion s does not 
increase b y 20%. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported target lesion(s) at baseline and throughout the trial.
irRECI ST criteria are defined as follows: 
Overall immune -related complete response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all 
lesions (whether measurable or not) and no new lesions.  All measurable l ymph nodes 
also must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Overall immune -related partial response (irPR): Sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, shortest for nodal lesions) of target and new measurable lesions 
decreases 30%.

increases 
20% (compared to nadir), confirmed by  a repeat, consecutive observation 
at least [ADDRESS_335275] documented. 
New measurable lesions: I ncorporated into tumor burden (ie, added to the target lesion 
measurements).  A ly mph node has to be  15 mm in short axis to be a measurable new lesion 
and its short axis measurement is included in the sum. Up to 2 new lesions per organ and up 
to 5new lesions in total can be added to the measu rements. 
New non -measurable lesions: Do not define progression but preclude irCR.
Overall responses derived from changes in index, non- index, and new lesions are outlines in

1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International 
Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1. Background  
Early pregnancy failure (EPF) is the most common complication in pregnancy . An estimated 15% - 25% of 
clinically recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage [1 -4], and approximately 1 out of 4 of women will 
experi ence a pregnancy loss over the course of her life [1].  About one million women will experience a 
pregnancy loss each year in the [LOCATION_002].  Pregnancy failures most commonly occur in the early first 
trimester and these losses are sub  typed as  intrauterine embryonic demise/intrauterine feta l demise 
(IUED/IUFD), anembryonic gestation [5], inevitable abortion, and incomplete abortion [6]. For patients 
with EPF, traditional treatment has been surgical uterine evacuation with sharp uterine curettage 
and/or suction. This practice dates to the ear ly 20th century when prompt treatment was required to 
prevent hemorrhage and infection when women presented acutely [7].   With the widespread use of 
transvaginal ultrasound in early pregnancy, women diagnosed with EPF no longer universally present 
with ble eding at the time of pregnancy expulsion (incomplete/inevitable abortion). Instead, most 
women learn of their pregnancy’s demise during routine care prior to the onset of symptoms ( missed 
abortion or IUED/IUFD/anembryonic gestation). This shift away from u rgent/emergent care has led to 
an interest in pursuing nonsurgical treatment options for EPF that avoid the morbidity, time, expense 
and complications associated with surgery [3,4,8]. While some women pursue expectant management, 
the unpredictability of th e bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and the prolonged time -to-resolution, make this 
alternative less acceptable than active management to most patients [9,10]. Women generally prefer 
active management [3,9 -12]; in fact, the ability to have control over the management  of the miscarriage 
can relieve some of the emotional burden that accompanies first trimester pregnancy loss [13 -17].   
 
Medical management of EPF with prostaglandin analogues, at least theoretically, allows for planned, 
expedited expulsion of the nonviabl e pregnancy tissue without the morbidity and expense of surgery. 
Prostaglandins (PG) induce uterine contractions and , when compared with oral administration, vaginal 
administration has a longer -lasting effect on the myometrium  [18]. Medical management of E PF is highly 
desired by [CONTACT_336260]. Treatment can be self -administered and expulsion can be accomplished in the 
privacy of a woman's home.    
 
The most studied and commonly used method of medical management is misoprostol.  It is FDA 
approved and markete d for gastric ulcer disease treatment, but widely used in obstetrics and 
gynecology to ripen the cervix and induce uterine contractility.  Misoprostol is a PGE [ADDRESS_989579] as effective as uterine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724935] . 
However, in women who present without active bleeding, i.e. women with missed abortion or 
IUED/IUFD/anembryonic gestation , misoprostol alone provides suboptimal results .  
 
 
7 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  Notably, a different regimen is used for uterine evacuation of viable  pregnancies with much better 
results than those reported with misoprostol alone for missed abortion .  Misoprostol is combined with 
mifepristone for women who  do not want to continue their pregnancy.  Mifepristone is a 19 -nor steroid 
with a bulky side chain responsible for inducing and stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation. In the 
presence of progesterone (P 4), mifepristone acts as a competitive P [ADDRESS_989580] [ 19]. During 
pregnancy, uterine contractility is suppressed by [CONTACT_367945]. As a P [ADDRESS_989581], 
mifepristone primes the myometrium and cervix for prostaglandin activity and increases uterine 
contractility [18,19-22]. By [CONTACT_47506] P 4, mifepristone limits the invasion of trophoblastic tissue at the 
level of the endometrium [ 23], and interrupts P 4-mediated trophoblast -decidua interactions [ 20,21,24 ].  
 
This protocol is designed to test the efficacy of the combined regimen, mifepristone  + misoprostol, 
among women with stable missed abortion.  
1.2. Clinical Data to Date  
Misoprostol has been used by [CONTACT_724956] 1988 for 
prevention of gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID use. Notably , misopros tol has been used 
safely for incomplete abortion around the world. Misoprostol has not been associated with long -term 
effects on women’s health, and prolonged or serious side effects are virtually nonexistent. Misoprostol 
is the most commonly used prostagl andin to effect uterine evacuation in the setting of early pregnancy 
failure. Its safety and effectiveness, specifically when given vaginally, have been established by [CONTACT_724957] , as demonstrated by [CONTACT_724958] [5, 6 ]. The advantages of 
misoprostol over other drugs (including prostaglandin E2) are its low cost, low incidence of side effects 
when given intravaginally, stability at room temperature, and ready availability. The risk of a major 
complication is rare.  
 
Comp lete expulsion rates for women using misoprostol for miscarriage completion vary significantly in 
the published literature, from 25 -86% [ 5,6,8, 25-30]. This variability is due, in part, to the fact that 
studies have used differing definitions of pregnancy f ailure; as well as varying drug doses, delivery 
modes, criteria for success, and outcome measures [ 5,6,8,26,31 -40].  The earlier studies helped to reveal 
the relative merits of different drugs, doses and routes. The data support that misoprostol [ADDRESS_989582] toxicity/efficacy profile [ 6,8]. The definitive, multi -center, randomized trial 
comparing surgical management to medical management with vaginal misoprostol (the 2005 MEPF trial 
[9]) in women through approximately 12 weeks gestatio n (in which our team at both centers 
collaborated), reported successful uterine evacuation in 71% of participants with one dose of 
misoprostol (800 µg vaginally). These complete abortion rates contrast dramatically with the published 
98% success rate for u terine curettage [ 9]. While the MEPF trial found misoprostol to be “non -inferior” 
to surgery due to trial design, few could argue that 60 -71% success compares fairly with the 98% that 
surgery boasts. Nevertheless, misoprostol is now widely used in the U.S.  and across the globe for 
management of EPF; the regimen tested by [CONTACT_338452]. [ 9] has become the evidence -based standard of 
care. The efficacy of misoprostol for medical management of pregnancy failure in the first trimester was 
illustrated in a large, w ell-designed trial in which 652 women with missed, incomplete, or inevitable 
abortion were randomly assigned 3:1 to receive 800 µg misoprostol intravaginally or undergo vacuum 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724936] [ 9]. The rates of complications such as fever, infecti on, and excessive bleeding, 
and emergency room visits, were very low and similar to those from uterine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Published clinical predictors of treatment success with misoprostol for EPF include lower abdominal 
pain, vaginal bleeding within 24 hours of presentation, and nulliparity [ 25]. Misoprostol alone is highly 
 
8 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  effective for women who present with incomplete/inevitable abortion (active bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
usually with an open cervical os) [ 6,9,2 8,41-43]. We propose a novel investigation of mate rnal serum 
biomarkers of implantation, endometrial maturation, and pregnancy maintenance as prognosticators of 
medical treatment success for EPF. Investigation of the role that Activins (intra and extra -villus 
cyctotrophoblast) Inhibins (corpus luteum, cyt otrophoplast), Glycodelin (endometrial decidua), and 
others (see choice of markers  section below) play in abetting or impeding tissue expulsion with medical 
management are likely to further our understanding about a woman’s likelihood of successful medical  
treatment for miscarriage.   Our preliminary data show that statistically significantly depressed levels of 
β-human Chorionic Gonadatropin (βhCG) and elevated Activin levels are present in women who failed 
misoprostol treatment in the NICHD -sponsored MEPF trial. Our goal is to improve the success of non -
surgical management of EPF.   
1.3. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Studies of medical termination of viable  pregnancies using a combination of 200 mg mifepristone with 
misoprostol 800 µg demonstrate higher succes s rates than the use of misoprostol alone for the same 
indication, exceeding 95% in women up to 9 weeks gestation [ 22,44 -46]. This is different from the FDA 
approved regimen of [ADDRESS_989583], success rates with a single dose of misoprostol alone for termination of viable pregnancy are 
60-70% [ 47-49]), a rate similar to that found in t he MEPF study for misoprostol alone for EPF [ 9].  While 
not commonly used in the U.S., multiple studies verify the efficacy of the combined use of mifepristone 
and misoprostol to induce viable pregnancy termination beyond 9 weeks as well [ 50-54]. 
 
Mifepris tone, dosed as 200 mg, in combination with misoprostol, has been used by [CONTACT_724959] (National Abortion Federation statistics, 2010). The 200 mg dose is equally as 
effective and less expensive than the 600mg option [ 55,56 ]. The combination of mifepristone and 
misoprostol has also been used to treat women with EPF [ 36]. In fact, even though its efficacy has yet to 
be proven due to problems with trial designs, it was used in a study (the MIST  trial) that was designed to 
evalu ate infection risk for women undergoing miscarriage management with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], medication, or 
expectantly [ 57]. The MIST trial confirmed low infection rates, and low complication rates overall, but 
the authors  did not compute efficacy . In this protocol , we aim to bridge the final gap and to definitively 
test the efficacy  of mifepristone combined with misoprostol for the management of missed abortion. 
The safety of the dosage, delivery route, and combination is well tested in pregnant women generally 
(see A ppendix 1).   
 
The highly effective, safe combination regimen  described above may also effectively treat women with 
EPF [ 11,12 ,39,58]. Our preliminary observations [ 11] strongly support this.   However, this regimen needs 
to be rigorously tested in a suffici ently powered clinical trial [ 5].  The biologic basis for why a 
combination regimen should be more effective and safe than misoprostol alone, even in the cases of a 
failed pregnancy, has been preliminarily described. We and others have hypothesized that th ose failed 
pregnancies that do not respond to uterine evacuation with misoprostol alone appear to represent a 
subset of EPF in which the invasion of the extravillous trophoblast into the decidualized endometrium is 
altered [ 24,59 ]. This enhanced “attachmen t” of the pregnancy may be due to a direct trophoblastic 
effect, and/or may be due to characteristics of the decidualized endometrium. There is evidence for a 
direct supportive effect of P [ADDRESS_989584] function [ 60], and therefore, this effect cou ld be 
inhibited by [CONTACT_724960]. In addition, mifepristone also has anti -glucocorticoid activity, with 
relatively high binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor [ 20,21 ]. Since glucocorticoids are critical to 
 
9 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/[ADDRESS_989585] cells [ 61], the presence of mifepristone could lead to decreased 
proliferation, differentiation, and/or invasive properties of the trophoblast – even in a failed pregnancy 
[62].  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
 
Primary Objective  
To compare the effectiveness of com bination treatment (mifepristone premedication plus single -dose 
misoprostol) to single -dose misoprostol (standard of care) for the management of early pregnancy 
failure.  
 
Our hypothesis states that the combination of mifepristone and single -dose misoprosto l will be more 
effective than single -dose misoprostol  alone , and will reduce the proportion of failed medical treatments 
(those who require repeat dosing or surgery) by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in [ADDRESS_989586] 
trimester embryonic/fetal demise and anembryonic gestation.  
 
Secondary Objective  
To test the ability of trophoblastic and endometrial biomarkers to predict which women are most likely 
to succeed with medical management of early pregnancy failure and to derive and internally validate a 
prediction model designed to guide individualized counseling and treatment for early pregnancy failure.  
 
Our hypotheses state that (1) biomarkers of endometrial decidualization and trophoblast function in the 
maternal circulation prior to treatment will pred ict the success of medical management and that (2) 
quantitative evaluation of a single biomarker or combination of biomarkers, combined with clinical 
characteristics, will accurately predict the women who will benefit from medical management overall 
and wi ll identify those women who may especially benefit from combination treatment.  
3 Study Design  
3.1. General Design  
This is a pragmatic randomized, controlled  trial comparing mifepristone (200mg) administered orally for 
premedication in office followed by [CONTACT_724961] m isoprostol (800 µg) self -administered at home 
approximately [ADDRESS_989587] of care  for medical management of EPF , and 
widely used across the globe for treatment of early pregnancy failure as well as for other obstetrics 
indicat ions. Participants will be randomized to each group in a 1:[ADDRESS_989588] treatment.  The general schema is as follows:

Women who meet the entry criteria will be advised of the study and, if interested, referred to the 
research office. All subjects will sign the informed consent form before any study procedures are 
performed.  
4.4. Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1.  When and How to Withd raw Subjects  
 
 
12 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/[ADDRESS_989591], or for any significant adverse experience 
that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871](s), precludes further participation.  
4.4.2.  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
All reas onable efforts will be made to ensure that enrolled subjects return to the  sites for all study visits. 
Any subject who misses a scheduled visit or telephone follow -up call will receive further contact 
[CONTACT_724963]:  
 At least three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_363843], e -mail or similar  mode of 
communication . 
 If the subject cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or is contact[CONTACT_697264]  a scheduled visit, a 
certified letter must be sent to the subject indicating th e importance of follow -up and instructing her 
to contact [CONTACT_29261] . 
A subject should be considered lost to follow -up when:  
 There have been three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_363843], e -mail , or similar 
mode of communication, and a  certified letter, that has not yielded a response , has been sent  
 
Subjects who received treatment and discontinued from the study for any reason will be contact[CONTACT_724964] [ADDRESS_989592] inflated our sample size estimate by 5% for lo ss to conservatively account for follow -up that 
may occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502].  The Zhang study [ 9], in which our sites participated, had a less than 1% 
lost to follow -up in the medical management arm. Our 5% is, therefore, a generous allotment for lost t o 
follow -up.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1. Description  
The mifepristone will be provided to subjects as one (1) 200 mg oral tablet .  The misoprostol will be 
provided to subjects as four (4) [ADDRESS_989593] will be randomized to receiv e 800 µg (vaginally) misoprostol alone or 800 µg of misoprostol 
(vaginally) preceded by 200 mg  of mifepristone (orally) [ADDRESS_989594] will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: 800 µg vaginal misoprostol (group 1) 
or 800 µg vaginal misoprostol preceded by 200 mg mifepristone orally  (group 2). Randomization will be 
performed through  a central randomization process using REDCAP. Participants  will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio of treatme nt groups.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_724965].  
 
13 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  5.4. Preparation and Administration of Study  Drug  
Both mifepristone and misoprostol will be acquired, repackaged, and labeled for investigational use by 
[CONTACT_724966] (IDS).   Penn IDS will supply the 
investigational drugs to all study sites.  Investigational drugs are procured, stored, inventoried, and 
dispensed in compliance with all applicable regulations and policies.  Since the standard is for the drugs 
to be dispensed from the doctor’s office, the investigational drug will be stored in a locked cabinet in the 
research office.  
5.5. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
To assess and track subject compliance with the misoprostol administration , participants ’ diaries will be 
reviewed. Subjects will also be asked to return the medication packaging at their next scheduled visit.  
5.6. Packaging  
The University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will acquire both study drugs and re -
package them for investiga tional use.  Mifepristone will be packaged in blister packs of three (3)  [ADDRESS_989595] being dispensed for administration in the office .  Misoprostol 
will be packaged in quantities of four (4) [ADDRESS_989596] notify study spons or of any damaged or unusable study treatments that were supplied 
to the investigator’s site.  
5.7.2.  Storage  
The investigation al drug is to be stored a t room temperature  (15-25° C). Excursions up to 30 ° are 
allowed.  No special handling is required during  storage.    
5.7.3.  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The drug will be assigned to each subject per the randomization scheme. Regular drug reconciliation 
checks will occur by [CONTACT_3476]. Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document 
drug assig ned; drug consumed ; and drug remaining. This reconciliation will be recorded, and signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
14 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  5.7.4.  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug co nsumed, and 
drug remaining. This reconciliation will be recorded , signed and dated. Any discrepancies noted will be 
investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused study drug. Drugs 
destroyed on site will be documented in th e study files.  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1    Screening Visit  
  Informed consent will be obtained.  
 Information about telephone contact [CONTACT_183884] .  A pelvic examination will be performed to 
determine that the cervical os is closed.  Gonorrhea and Chlamydia t esting may be performed at this 
time if it has not been done in this pregnancy and is indicated.  
 A transvaginal ultrasound examination will be performed unless a complete report is available from 
an adequately detailed examination within 24 hours prior to  enrollment.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_989597] of

[ADDRESS_989605] a 60 -71% single -
dose success rate in the misoprostol only group [ 25]. Our preliminary data showed a 90% single -dose 
 
17 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  success rate in the combined gr oup using the proposed study regimen [ 11]. If we assume a conservative  
85% success rate estimate for combined (C) and 70% success in the misoprostol only (M), we require 
134 participants/group to show a difference if one is there (Table 2). To arrive at th e total number of 
women needed to enroll, we inflate this estimate by 10% for loss to follow -up (5%) and interim analysis 
(5%). We will have adequate power to show a difference in success rates for all proportions above 10%. 
Thus, our proposed recruitment goal of 300 women (150/group) will enable us to find a clinically 
meaningful difference of 15% and confidently find the expected difference (20%) between groups . 
7.2. Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis:  Baseline demographic characteristics of the subjects in the two groups will be 
examined.  If the randomization is executed correctly, we expect no significant difference between the 
two groups on these variab les. If there is an imbalance on certain variables (mostly likely by [CONTACT_3364]) and 
these variables also affect the outcomes variables, we will control for these variables using indirect 
standardization, Mantel -Haenzel stratified analysis or multivariable log istic (for categorical outcome) or 
linear regression (for continuous outcome).  If there is a gross imbalance between the two groups, we 
will conduct in -depth evaluation to identify factors that may adversely affect randomization. 
Multivariable logistic an d linear regressions will be used to adjust for the imbalance.  
We will explore outcomes by [CONTACT_68566]; if there is no significant overall difference among the sites 
(homogeneous), we will pool sites together. However, if there is significant overall dif ference, we will 
identify which site(s) differ from others. Pairwise comparison will be conducted with Scheffe adjustment 
of significance level.  In all following analyses, site will then be an independent variable for adjustment.  
Both intent to treat and compliant populations will be analyzed. For categorical data, chi -square test will 
be used. For continuous variables, t -test will be used if the distribution is normal; otherwise rank -sum 
test or log transformation will be used. The following outcomes will  be evaluated:  
 Success rates between study arms for early pregnancy failure;  
 Frequency of side effects and serious adverse events between study arms;  
 Patient’s satisfaction, anxiety, and acceptability of the treatment regimens;  
 Cost analysis to compare the se two treatments.  
 
The outcome is defined as gestational sac expulsion with one treatment dose on Study Day 3 and no 
need for surgical intervention or medical  intervention  within 30 days of treatment. The overall success 
proportion, along with 95% confide nce intervals, will be calculated for each treatment group. The Combination

PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/[ADDRESS_989606] descriptive statistics. 
Bivariate methods, such as chi -square or Fish er’s exact tests (categorical variables) and t -tests or Mann -
Whitney U tests (continuous/ordinal variables) will be used to compare the treatment groups’ 
demographic and clinical characteristics. These same methods will be used to initially evaluate 
differ ences in the success by [CONTACT_604766]. The bivariate analyses will be used 
to select variables for inclusion in subsequent multivariable regression models. We will stratify our 
results by [CONTACT_724968] (spotting/cramp ing etc.) . Multivariable logistic regression will be 
used to evaluate the odds of success within each treatment arm and adjusted for demographic s 
(including race and ethnic variation) and clinical variables that may affect the odds of success. The 
variable s found to be related to the success rate on the bivariate level will be entered one at a time into 
the model, iteratively comparing the adjusted odds ratios. The final regression models will include the 
treatment group, study site s, characteristics associ ated with success rate at the p<0.[ADDRESS_989607] 10%. Graphical techniques, such as lowess 
plots, will be used to assess the assumptions of the models.  
 
The acceptability will be assessed by [CONTACT_9086]. We will query participants using validated 
instruments [ 9,11, 63] about perceived acceptability of the procedure, adverse effects, pain, bleeding, 
and duration of symptoms and treatment, as well as whether the procedure met the expec tations for 
the experience, would be chosen again, and would be recommended to a friend.   The mean values + 
standard deviation of the VAS measurements will be compared using the Student’s t -test.   As above, 
bivariate methods will also be used to assess any  demographic or clinical characteristics that may by 
[CONTACT_724969]. We will calculate treatment recovery time [ 63] as assessed by [CONTACT_724970], required the help of others  in 
their recovery, and the duration of physical and self -reported psychological symptoms as recorded on 
the daily diary maintained by [CONTACT_4317].  
 
In order to assess the impact of our results on health care costs, we will calculate whether there is an 
increased or decreased cost from adding mifepristone to the medical management regimen. 
Mifepristone is priced at $90 per tablet .  However, depending on how much it decreases extra medical 
and surgical care, this price may be more than off -set [ 64]. The co st for each woman will be computed 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724939] (ER visits, physician time, ultrasounds, etc), cost to the woman (days off 
work, childcare expenses, travel expenses, etc), and lost productivity. Total costs will be compared 
between tre atment arms using standard bivariate techniques. The nonparametric bootstrap method will 
be used to present cost -effectiveness acceptability curves and net benefit statistics at alternative 
willingness to pay thresholds held by [CONTACT_724971] a need for surgery [ 65]. 
 
Once all participant phlebotomy specimens have been obtained,  we will be able to derive a predictive 
model for successful medical management vs. failure for all subjects. Separate predictive models will 
then be built for each t reatment arm, and any differences found here will lay foundations for future 
research. Accurate assessment of gestational age (GA) can be a challenge in women who present with 
EPF, and GA may in fact be a confounder in the relationship between hormone leve ls and the nature of 
the demise. Depending on time of presentation relative to time of demise, biomarker le vels may be 
more a reflection of the actual GA, or may in fact be impacted by [CONTACT_724972] (i.e. βhCG, P 4 may 
start declining after demise occurs). We can utilize last menstrual period dating (LMP) with the caveat 
that LMP is not always certain.   To overcome this measurement error problem, we will also analyze a 
 
19 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/[ADDRESS_989608] descriptive 
statistics. We will use graphical methods, such as lowess smoothers, to determine  the shape (linear or 
non-linear, potential cut -points for classifying levels) of the relationship between the biomarker level 
and probability of success, and subsequently for inclusion as predictors in  a multivariable logistic model. 
We will analyze a sub set of women with a sure LMP and for whom ultrasound dating is consistent with 
LMP separately for the most accurate analysis of the relationship between biomarker concentration and 
the characterization of an EPF that will respond well to medical management . We can compare this 
definitive LMP group to the group of women in whom LMP is unsure. We will calculate the sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each biomarker. The predictive accuracy of 
different cutoffs will be eva luated using ROC curves.  
 
Logistic regression and classification and regression trees (CART) will be used to develop a predictive 
model for successful management of early pregnancy failure, which will serve as the basis for a clinical 
predictive index [ 66-68]. Our group has used this methodology with success [ 69,70 ]. Initially the 
predictive model will only include biomarkers, and then both biomarkers and epi[INVESTIGATOR_724940]. The sensitivity  of the predictive index (i.e., 
proportion of patients with success who are defined as “high chance of success” by [CONTACT_724973]) will be of 
primary interest [ 71]. The negative predictive value will also be calculated using the derived sensitivity 
and specifici ty with the population prevalence of success. This value is also of clinical interest.  
 
For model building, we will enter all biomarkers that will have shown in the bivariate analysis at least 
borderline associations with the endpoints of interest (p<0.20 ), as well as interaction terms that are 
suggested by [CONTACT_724974]. Terms will then be removed from the model using a 
backward elimination procedure, removing factor s which cause an insignificant change in the sensitivity 
of the mod el. To test the change in sensitivity between models (with and without the variables), we will 
use McNemar’s test. In particular, we will be comparing the proportion of correctly classified cases of 
success between models. The rule would involve calculatin g a score for each person, based on the actual 
values of the regression coefficients. The goal is to utilize all variables that improve the sensitivity of the 
model. Unlike the explanatory model, whose goal is to determine which variables are associated wi th 
success, the predictive models will be developed in order to determine which combination of variables 
best predicts the outcome. Additionally, variables and interactions included in the model must be 
biologically plausible.  
 
To be useful, a clinical ru le must be easily applied. In order to ensure easy understanding and 
unhindered application, the variables and parameters comprising the predictive score will be simplified 
with two methods: 1) by [CONTACT_724975], rounded to 
the nearest integer, and 2) by [CONTACT_724976]. (It will be necessary, for this approach to recode continuous predictors 
as dichotomous variables. ) This will result in the most parsimonious model. The performance of the new 
rules will then be compared with that of more complete models using ROC curves. We plan to evaluate 
potential cutoffs of each marker to optimize our ability to distinguish among successes and failures.  
We will also approach our predictive modeling using CART. Candidates that have an individual area 
under the curve (AUC) > 0.6 will be considered. CART is useful in identifying complex relationships 
between biomarkers and clinical ou tcomes. These analyses recursively split observations into two 
 
20 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  groups (nodes), t L and t R, based on the covariate that maximizes a given split function.   In the case of a 
continuous outcome, a commonly used split function is the reduction in sums of squares  error, i.e. the 
amount of variability explained by [CONTACT_724977].   The best split is defined to be the one that best predicts the 
response where the best predictor is defined to be the one that maximizes the split function.   All splits 
of the observations in each of the resulting nodes are then considered and the best split identified. This 
process is repeated recursively until a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724941] (e.g. no further splits exist with greater 
than 5 observations in each of the resulting nodes).   We will e mploy 10 -fold cross -validation to assess 
the significance of the resulting tree as described in Breiman [ 72]. The sensitivity and specificity of the 
CART versus logistic model will be compared using ROC curves, to determine the best predictive rule for 
man agement success.  CART software will be used to evaluate combinations of biomarkers creating a 
tree maximizing sensitivity and a tree maximizing specificity. Data will be combined into a three -tiered 
algorithm to maximize accuracy .  
 
The prediction rule wil l be internally validated with a “bootstrap” approach [73 -78]. With this approach, 
a large number of samples are taken from the original data (with replacement) and the predictive 
accuracy is tested in each of these samples. Sampling with replacement gener ates a population identical 
in composition to the observed sample. This method provides a relatively unbiased estimate of the test 
characteristics of the predictive rule [78].  
7.3. Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All-randomized population will be subject to analysis.  
7.4. Interim Analysis  
 
Since safety and failure is a consideration in this study, we have chosen to use a group sequential design. 
Thus, in addition to the final analysis, we are planning on performing an interim statistical analysis 
during the course  of the study. The purpose of the interim analyses will be to determine whether or not 
there is sufficient evidence of an increased failure rate in the combined arm compared to the control 
such that the trial should be discontinued prior to reaching the ta rget accrual goal. The interim analysis 
will be performed after approximately 1/2 (150 subjects) of the total required patients have completed 
their primary outcome. This interim analysis will also examine whether or not there is sufficient 
evidence of an increased infection rate in the combined arm.  
The primary outcome for the interim analyses will be the comparison of success/failure rates between 
the treatment arms. This comparison will be accomplished by [CONTACT_3553] a simple logistic regression 
model for t he outcomes versus treatment. An approximate O’Brien -Fleming boundary will be used at 
the interim look to calculate the nominal significance level to which interim p -values are compared 
(O’Brien PC 1979). Using the O’Brien Fleming spending function, the tw o analyses (interim + final) should 
use the following incremental α values (0.003, 0.047) in order to achieve an overall α=0.05.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724942]:  
(1) Clear superiority  -- whether the misoprostol alone is clearly inferior to combined treatment. Fo r 
these calculations, we trade off the power to detect a difference and the size of that difference. 
Assuming α=0.[ADDRESS_989609] a reduction from 30% in the misoprostol alone arm to 6.7% in the 
 
21 
PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  combination arm. Thus, early or premature stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724943], without dramatic 
improvement from the com bined treatment.  
(2) Inferiority . Power is limited to identify inferiority of the combined treatment, with 0.8 power to 
demonstrate a 30% -point  increase in the risk of failure from 30% in the misoprostol alone arm to 60.7% 
in the combined treatment arm. In stead, we will base inferiority on the safety concern (see (4)) of an 
increased failure rate in the combination arm.  
(3) Futility . Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724944] s afety outcomes. In the event that the intervention arm has equivalent 
BPD/death rates to the standard care arm, it would still be clinically useful to know if the intervention 
improves any of the secondary outcomes (that are closer to the time of the inter vention) or decreases 
the serious adverse event rate.  
(4) Safety .  
(a) Failure:  Failure rates may be different via weeks of gestation at the time of treatment. Based on prior 
studies, we would expect the proportion of women recruited by [CONTACT_724978] 50% at 5 -7 
weeks, 40% at 8 -9 weeks and 10% at [ADDRESS_989610] anything but an extreme difference. Instead, in these gestational strata, stoppage will 
be based on seeing a failure rate greater than the 95% confidence interval expected in the misoprostol 
alone group. Thus, recruitment will be stopped at the interim analysis in any gestational  age group for 
which the combined arm has a 40% or higher failure rate.  
(b) An important safety outcome is the rate of infection, (and/or other serious adverse events that have 
been adjudicated as potentially relating to the intervention). In order to mini mize the risk, this safety 
outcome will be compared between treatment arms at the planned interim analysis for the primary 
outcome. Based on prior studies, we would expect a conservative 2% infection rate in the combined 
arm. We have 80% power to detect a clinically important increase at study end to a 6% infection rate in 
the combined arm (double that expected in surgical management). Using the O’Brien -Fleming alpha of 
0.003 at the interim analysis, we would stop the study if the overall infection rate was  >17% in the 
combined arm after half the subjects have completed the study. Since we would not expect such a high 
infection rate at the interim analysis; we will instead look for a clinically meaningful double the rate in 
the combination versus that previo usly found using surgical management techniques (i.e. 6%).   
In summary, given the projected number of patients to be enrolled, early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724945].  
The results of the interim analysis will be judged by [CONTACT_4318]. This committee will act completely 
independently of the clinical investigators, including the Principal Investigator. However, the ultimate 
decision to stop the study will rest with the Principal Investigator.

PreFaiR Protocol Version 9.0 3/7/2017  8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1. Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study . Not all events that would traditionally be defined as AEs will be collected 
by [CONTACT_280179].  
 
There are a number of expected side effects related to the medical management of miscarriage with 
misoprostol including abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], vagina l bleeding, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , 
dizziness, and endometritis . Sepsis (infection of the bloodstream):   sepsis is a known risk related to any 
type of spontaneous or induced abortion.   There have been reports of deaths due to sepsis in women 
who have had induced abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol.   Most of these women were 
infected with the same type of bacteria, known as Clostridium sordellii.   The symptoms in these cases of 
infection were not the usual symptoms of sepsis.   It is not known whether using mifepristone and 
misoprostol caused these deaths.   Reports of fatal sepsis in women undergoing medical abortion are 
very rare (approximately 1 in 100,000).   There is also the chance that uterine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724946].  These symptoms will be collected from patient self -report and 
subject diaries, but may also be discovered in the medical record. The only non -serious events that will 
be specifically collected  by [CONTACT_724979].  All attempts will be made 
to obtain records of care obtained outside the study sites for adverse events that are possibly related to 
the study treatment.  Subjects will be informed that these records may be needed, and will be asked to 
sign a release form when they enroll in the study.  
 
All adverse events will be collected, recorded, and assessed locally by [CONTACT_15009]/her 
designee.  Events that are determined to be both unexpected and related to the study will be entered 
into the electronic CRF and thus reported to the sponsor.  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal  
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may no t be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  
 
All serious adverse events will be reported to the medical monitor, regardless of causality assessment.   
Serious adverse events will also be reported by [CONTACT_724980], Inc.

Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period durin g which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from 
the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up. For this study, the 
study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_989612] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The 
investigator should notify the study spon sor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.

condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for an adv erse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724951].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is 
a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].

approval of a clinical investigation before the investigation may be initiated and to ensure continuing 
review of the study by [CONTACT_224534] 21 CFR Part 56; and to keep the sponsor informed of 
such IRB approval and s ubsequent IRB actions concerning the study.  
 
Monitoring Activities  
 
Frequency  
Enrollment will be complete when 300 subjects are enrolled into the trial.  Approximately 6 subjects will 
be enrolled per month across both sites.  Monitoring will be conducted p eriodically throughout the 
study as described below:  
 The first monitoring time -point will occur after the first [ADDRESS_989616].  
 If no issues of concern are noted during the first monitoring time -point, subsequent monitoring will 
occur at least annually.  
 The final monitoring time -point  will be conducted when 100% of the subject s have been enrolled 
and completed the s tudy.  This visit will also serve as the close -out monitoring visit  
 
Additional monitoring may occur on an as -needed basi s as determined by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
Data Review  
All database entries for the first 5 subjects at each site will be 100% source data verif ied.  In addition, 
the database entries for one in every cohort of 10 subjects at each site will be 100% source data verified.   
 
If a greater than 10% error rate is noted during the data review, the monitor will request additional 
documents to source veri fy 100% of the data on a larger sample.  
 
The following variables will be 100% source data verified for all subjects enrolled in the study.  
 Informed Consent  
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 Drug Accountability  
 Serious Adverse Events  
 Primary Outcomes/Endpoint Da ta Verification

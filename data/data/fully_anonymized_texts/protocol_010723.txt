Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter , Open -Label Pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] 2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and Safety of 
INNO -206 (Doxorubicin -EMCH) in Subjects with Advanced  or Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal 
Carcinoma Whose Tumors Have Progressed Following  Prior Treatment with Gemcitab ine and 
Fluoropyrimidine -Based Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of INNO -
[ADDRESS_44937] failed 2 
courses of chemotherapy (gemcitabine -containing and fluoropyrimidine -containing regimens)  as 
measured by [CONTACT_42754] (RECIST 1.1 criteria), disease control (complete and partial 
response s, and stable disease  at 4 months ), progression -free and overall survival . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the safety of INNO -206 in this population 
assessed by [CONTACT_42755] (AEs), abnormal findings on physical 
examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, ECHO  evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and 
weight , the pharmacokinetic profile of INNO -206, evaluation of secreted protein acidic and rich in 
cysteine (SPARC) in tumor specimens , changes in PET -CT scans and  changes in  CA 19 -9 
expression during treatment.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
INNO -206 is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by [CONTACT_42756] 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable pancreatic ductal carc inomas (PDA) who 
have failed prior chemotherapy with gemcitabine regimens  have a n extremely  poor prognosis with 
progression -free survival of around [ADDRESS_44938] insid e the tumor. Based on its postulated mechanism of action,   
INNO -206 may improve the activity of doxorubicin without increasing its toxicity , as has been 
demonstrated in animal studies , and induce  enhanced anti -tumor efficacy .

Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 2  open -label , pi[INVESTIGATOR_42752] -206 
administered at 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent )  intravenously ( IV) on Day 1 every 21 
days for  up to  8 consecutive cycles . 
Tumor response  (complete and partial response  and stable disease)  will be monitored at Screening , 
then every 8 weeks  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria , 
and treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is observed, 8  cycles of treatment 
are completed or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Progression -free survival  [PFS] , stable disease at 4 
months  and overall survival  [OS] will be monitored as other primary objectives. PET/CT will be 
performed at Baseline and W eek 9 to determine change in tumor metabolic activity , and CA 19 -9 will 
be determined serially to assess potential tumor reduction. Subjects will visit the study site every 21 
days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical 
exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete blood count [ CBC ], and urinalysis ), 
vital signs, weight measurements , ECOG  performance status and ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac 
function will a lso be followed periodically using ECHO s.

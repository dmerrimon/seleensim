 Title:  A randomized -controlled trial to assess the effect of ibuprofen on post -partum 
blood pressure in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy  
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_868637], MD   
 
Co-Investigators: Alexander Tsodikov, PhD ; Jourdan Trieb wasser, MD, MA  
 
1. Objective  
To assess the effect of routine doses of ibuprofen on post -partum blood pressure 
control in women with gestational hypertension (gHTN) or preeclampsia without 
severe features (preE).   
 
2. Specific Aims   
 
Hypothesis: When compared t o acetaminophen, ibuprofen does not increase post -
partum systolic blood pressure (SBP) above baseline to a clinically relevant degree 
(10 mmHg) in women with gHTN and preE.  
 
Aim 1 : To assess the mean difference in SBP  during  24 hours of exposure to 
ibupro fen and acetaminophen.  
 
Aim 2:  To assess whether ibuprofen results in higher satisfaction with pain control in 
the immediate post -partum period ( 48 hours) compared to acetaminophen.  
 
Aim 3:  To prospectively assess the need for post -partum anti -hypertensiv e therapy 
and readmission for blood pressure control in women with gHTN and preE.  The 
post-partum period is defined as delivery through 6 weeks after delivery.  
 
3. Background   
 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently prescribed for post -
partum analgesia. This use is supported by [CONTACT_868643] -partum pain specifically; 
however, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen in ameliorating 
uterine pain and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_868638].1-[ADDRESS_1212405] of NSAIDs on blood pressur e 
(BP) in women post -partum is less well -known. In non -pregnant hypertensive patients 
NSAIDs are associated with increased BP over short courses of days to months, though 
effects of various NSAIDs differ.5,[ADDRESS_1212406] -partum in both normotensive and 
hypertensive women.7 A larger, recent retrospective cohort study found no difference in 
mean  arterial pressure ( MAP ) or need for antihypertensive therapy in women with 
severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy who were exposed to NSAIDs post -partum.8 
 
In light of the potential for worsening blood pressure in women with hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy, the Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy of American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that “providers should be reminded of 
the contribution of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents to increased BP.” Additionally 
the task for ce recommends that NSAIDS “be replaced by [CONTACT_868644] 1 day postpartum”.[ADDRESS_1212407] varied.

ix. Additional anesthesia at time of delivery (spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], sedation) 
that would change routine pain management.  
 
iii. Recruitment Plan and Study Design  
1. Number of Subjects:  40 (see details of power calculation in 
statistical analysis plan) ; however, we anticipate that up to [ADDRESS_1212410] and Consenting:  
 
1. Antepartum Recruitment:  
a. Patients with diagnoses of gHTN and preE will be 
recru ited as outpatients through the Fetal Diagnostic 
Center and OB -Gyn clinics at VonVoightlander 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Study  team members will review 
daily appointments in MiChart to determine eligibility.  
b. Once the patient is determine eligible a study team 
member will approach the potential subject prior to or 
after their scheduled appointment.   
2. Intrapartum Recruitment:  
a. Patients admitted to Labor & Delivery at 
VonVoightlander Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868641] . Study team members will 
identify potential participants through monitoring triage 
admissions through the electronic medical system .  
b. To reduce possible burden on the participants who 
have personal or medical situations th at might make 
recruitment contact [CONTACT_868647] -in to triage distressing, 
we have added a step of contact[CONTACT_868648]. This 
will decrease the likelihood of recruiting someone 
OBGYN Research Program Study Protocol Template  
Page [ADDRESS_1212411] the 
potential volunteer, a study team member will approach 
the woman and explain the study. The potential 
participant w ill then be approached in a private location 
(such as a patient room) to discuss possible 
enrollment.  If enrollment is declined, a record will be 
made that the study was offered and declined so that 
the study team does not approach the participant 
again.  
 
3. Written informed consent will be obtained if all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied at time of recruitment.  
4. If exclusion criteria develop in the interim (i.e. 
thrombocytopenia) between recruitment and delivery, the 
participant will not be randomiz ed.  However, data from their 
delivery admission and post -partum period will be collected to 
compare to women who maintained trial eligibility.  
3. Method of Interaction/Procedure/Intervention:  
1. At the time the participant signs the consent document,  a 
study t eam member  will administer a survey to capture 
demographic and obstetric characteristics of participants.  
2. Patients will be managed intrapartum without regard to study 
involvement.  Mode of delivery will be determined by [CONTACT_868649].  
3. If a participant undergoes cesarean delivery, she will not be 
randomized . 
4. At the time of delivery, eligibility will be reviewed.  If the 
participant remains eligible, she will be randomized by [CONTACT_868650] -partum analgesic therapy with 
ibupr ofen or acetaminophen.  Providers will be blinded to 
allocation group.  
5. The intervention will be conducted in cross over -fashion.  
Either ibuprofen or acetaminophen will be given for [ADDRESS_1212412] dispense time (period 1).  Then the 
other drug will be given for the subsequent 24 hours (period 
2).  
a. Study drugs will be encapsulated for blinding purposes 
and given with in the following schedule: ibuprofen 
(600 mg every 6 hours) or acetaminophen (650 mg 
every 6 hours).   
b. The study drug doses will come in packets.   Ibuprofen 
packets will have three [ADDRESS_1212413] two 325 mg tabs and one placebo 
tab.   
c. Oxycodone will be available for uncontrolled pain (5 -10 
mg every 6 hours as needed). The number of doses 
taken  will be recorded as measure of pain control.  
6. Pain assessment:  
OBGYN Research Program Study Protocol Template  
Page [ADDRESS_1212414] dose of pain medication, participants 
will take a brief, self -administered survey to assess 
pain.  
i. Abdominal pain and perineal pain will be 
assessed separately using 0 (no pai n) to 10 
(worst possible pain) scale.  
ii. Overall pain will also be assessed using 0 (no 
pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) scale.  
b. Two hours after the first dose of study drug, 
participants will repeat the self -administered survey to 
assess abdominal, perineal,  and overall pain using a [ADDRESS_1212415] -
partum stay will be adm inistered prior to discharge.  
i. Satisfaction will be assessed using a 5 -point 
scale of (1) not at all satisfied (2) slightly 
satisfied (3) moderately satisfied (4) very 
satisfied (5) extremely satisfied.  
7. Blood pressure assessment:  
a. Standard blood pressure mon itoring per post -partum 
protocol:  every 15 min x 1 hour, then every 30 min x 1 
hour, then every 4-8 hours until discharge  per the 
discretion of the treating team .   
i. Additional blood pressures may be recorded 
according to provider preference (i.e. concern 
for spurious value, need to initiate 
antihypertensive therapy).  
b. Additional blood pressure monitoring will be performed 
during the period of study drug administration using a 
Spacelabs model [ADDRESS_1212416] values every 
60 minutes.   
ii. The blood pressure monitor display will be 
covered in the accompanying carrying pouch to 
blind partic ipants and providers to values.  
iii. The ambulatory blood pressure monitor will be 
discontinued after period 2 is complete.  
8. If the participant remains inpatient beyond the 48 hours of 
study drug administration, she will be given pain medication 
according to pro vider preference.   
9. Initiating antihypertensive therapy, repeating lab tests 
(creatinine, liver function tests, blood counts), time of 
discharge, and discharge pain medications will be at the 
discretion of treating physicians.

 Outpatient with diagnosis of preE or gHTN.  
 Inpatient -if not previously approached as an outpatient or with 
new diagnosis of preE or gHTN upon admission.  
Consent  
 Written informed consent will be obtained if all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied at time of recruitment.  
Randomization  
 Eligibility criteria reviewed at time of delivery.  
 If participant remains eligible, will be randomized to 
ibuprofen/acetaminophen versus acetaminophen/ibuprofen by 
[CONTACT_15446].  
Intervention  
 Pain medications will be dispensed by [CONTACT_868651].  
 Blood pressure monitoring  
o Standard post -partum bl ood pressure monitoring will be 
performed by [CONTACT_868652].  
o Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs model 
[ZIP_CODE]) will be performed during 48 hours of study drug 
administration.  
 Inpatient pain assessment  
o Pain su rvey will be administered prior to first dose of 
medication in period [ADDRESS_1212418] dose of 
medication in period 1 . 
o Pain control satisfaction survey administered prior to 
discharge.  
Data abstraction  
 The following will  be abstracted from the electronic medical 
record after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58012] [ADDRESS_1212419] -partum: 
delivery mode, anesthesia, medical comorbidities, post -partum 
blood pressures readings, antihypertensives given, need for 
magnesium, pain medication usage , and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
  
Compensation:  $[ADDRESS_1212420] be withdrawn prior to 
completion:  
1. Those who develop  any exclusion criteria between enrollment 
and delivery.  
2. Those who require a second increase in antihypertensive 
medications post -partum.  
3. Those who develop renal insufficiency (creatinine > 1.1 or 
double the baseline creatinine).  
4. Those who develop thromboc ytopenia (platelets < 
100,000/µL).  
2. If a subject withdraws prior to completion, what is the plan for the 
use of their data:  
1. If the participant wit hdraws prior to randomization, data on 
baseline characteristics , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779], and post -partum 
course will c ontinue to be collected and analyzed unless the 
participant requests otherwise in writing . 
2. If the parti cipant underwent randomization, data on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868642] -partum course will continue to be collected 
and analyzed.  Her information will be included in intention -to-
treat analysis.  
 
v. Data Retention and/or Data Destruction Plan:  
 
The patient data will be entered from paper enrollment forms into a REDCap database.  
All PHI will be marked as such in the REDCap database.  When data is downloaded for 
analysis, no PHI will be downloaded from the REDCap database.   REDCap is a secure 
web application designed to support data capture for research studies. REDCap servers 
are physically located in the University of Michigan Medical School Information Systems 
(MSIS) data center. Physical security for the databases is provided in a professionally 
managed and equipped tier -2data center with tightly controlled access.  Remote data 
access employs SSL encryption and 2 -tier Kerberos/Level [ADDRESS_1212421] study 
closure.

(Rare)  
3.   Risks of acetaminophen (package labeling warnings)  
a. Severe liver damage  (Rare)  
i. Risk is higher if you take more than [ADDRESS_1212424].  
 
ii. Benefits:  
1.   Likely better  pain control when receiving ibuprofen.  
 
7. Study Agent  
The study agents (ibuprofen and acetaminophen) will be procured by [CONTACT_868653] (RP) from commercial supply; RP will compound into blinded supply by 
[CONTACT_46431]-encapsulating the tablets in matching gelatin capsules. RP will package the 
blinded supplies into kits as follows: the ibuprofen packets will have three [ADDRESS_1212425] SOPs for drug 
accountability.  The medications w ill be administered by [CONTACT_868654].  
 
8. Statistical Design   
 
Randomization:  
- A random allocation sequence using 1:1 allocation will be generated by [CONTACT_868655].  
- Allocation concealment mechanism: randomization sequ ence given directly to 
study phar macy.  Providers  will call study pharmacy at time of deli very with 
randomization number.  This will be unblinded at the completion of study 
recruitment.  
Blinding:  
- Providers and participants blind to treatment allocation wi th capsules from 
pharmacy.  
 
Statistical methods:  
 
Sample size calculation:  
- There is limited post -partum or short -term NSAID data from which to base our 
sample size.   
OBGYN Research Program Study Protocol Template  
Page [ADDRESS_1212426] deviation of the difference in BP from baseline of 13 mmHg 
was observed.11  
- We are assuming the margin of equivalence (equivalence limit difference) to be 
approximately  10 mmHg. We also assume that intra -participant variation will be 
less than ac ross-group variation seen in the Palmer study; we then assume a 
standard deviation of [ADDRESS_1212427] 80% power to prove the hypothesis of 
equiv alence with a total of 44 measurements. We are planning to recruit 40 
women over 12 months. This will bring the expected number of measurements 
available for the analysis (accounting for each woman bringing two -measurement 
in a cross -over trial) to 68 with  a 15% expected drop -out rate. The reserve of 
sample size will be used to ensure we have more power to detect the carry -over 
effects of treatment into the next study  drug period.  
 
Primary outcome: difference in SBP from baseline during [ADDRESS_1212428] -specific intercept term will be used 
to regress the longitu dinal BP measurements on the treatment type, group 
(Ibuprofen -Acetaminophen, Acetaminophen -Ibuprofen) , and time. The main 
effect of time that expresses differences at baseline before the drugs had a 
chance to have an effect will likely be removed from the model as no such 
differences are expected due to randomization. The time by [CONTACT_868656]. The primary hypothesis is that of 
equivalence. Equivalence testing (no meaningful difference in BP between the 
two d rugs) will be done using two one -sided 95% confidence intervals for the 
regression parameter representing the effect. The hypothesis of equivalence will 
be accepted if the intersection of the two one -sided intervals is contained entirely 
inside the region of equivalence.  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
- Mean change in pain score after [ADDRESS_1212429] ion with pain control (treated as an ordinal categorical score)  
o Linear models will be used to analyze pain. Ordinal logistic regression 
(the Proportion al Odds Model) will be used to analyze the satisfaction 
endpoint.  Hypotheses of significance will be tested by [CONTACT_868657]. Model diagnostics will be performed using standardized residual 
plots. Variable transformations and Generalized Linea r (Mixed) Models 
will be considered with continuous responses in case model diagnostics 
reveals a departure from linearity or normality assumptions. Reasons for 
missing data will be analyzed using a multinomial logistic model. Analysis 
results with missing  data excluded will be presented along with the 
analysis where missing data will be imputed using predictive matching.  
 
- Need for antihypertensive therapy in the post -partum period (descriptive statistics 
only) 
- Incidence of severe hypertension  during period  1 versus period 2 (Fisher exact 
test) and during the post -partum period (descriptive statistics only).

 Descriptive statistics such as means and proportions will be calculated for each variable 
of interes t (obstetric and demographic characteristics) . Stat istically significant differences 
will be assessed at the p<.05 level.  Data will be analyzed using R and SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC).  
9. Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subj ect participating in 
an investigation study or protocol regardless of causality assessment. An adverse event 
can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptoms, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring du ring the use of an 
investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
 
These events may be:  
a) Definitely related: clearly associated with study drug/treatment  
b) Probably related:  likely associated with study drug/treatmen t 
c) Possibly related:  may be associated with study drug or other treatment  
d) Unlikely to be related or 
e) Definitely not related to the study drug/treatment  
 
For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as definitely or probably related to the 
regimen if the investigator believes that at least one of the following criteria are met:  
a) There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and the 
administration of the study drug or treatment.  
b) There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the stud y drug or treatment 
causing or contributing to the AE.  
c) The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, 
or procedures.  
d) A potential alternative cause does not exist.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE):  An adverse drug experience  occurring at any dose 
that results in any of the following outcomes:  
a) Death  
b) A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
c) A persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity  
d) A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not resu lt in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. A serious adverse experience includes any experience that is fatal or 
immediately life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or 
overdose.  
 
Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life -threatening, or 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, 
based upon appropriate med ical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject/patient 
and may required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously.  
OBGYN Research Program Study Protocol Template  
Page 12 of 12 
 Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed in the protocol, the 
package in serts or in the study informed consent document.  
Unexpected adverse events are those that are not described in the package insert or are 
not anticipated in the study informed consent document. This includes adverse events 
for which the specificity or sever ity is not consistent with the description in the informed 
consent.  
 
The severity or grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following 
definitions:  
Mild: Noticeable to the subject, but does not interfere with subject’s expected daily 
activities , usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of the study.  
Moderate: Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some 
additional therapy or intervention but does not require disc ontinuation of the study.  
Severe: Extremely limits the subject’s daily act ivities and may require discontinuation of 
study therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention resolve  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
The study will comply with the IRB & FDA report ing requirements and guidelines.

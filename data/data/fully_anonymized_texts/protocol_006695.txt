CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        9 3 Background 
3.1 Regulatory History 
The Hybrid L24 Implant System (P130016) was the subject of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_169579] (IDE 
G070191) from 2007 -2012. The data on the 50 subjects  enrolled in the study , in support of 
safety and effectiveness of the device , was submitted in June 2013 as part of PMA #130016. 
As part of the PMA approval, a Post -Approval Study to monitor the long- term ( 3 years) safety 
and effectiveness of the device in a cohort of newly implanted subjects was designed. A concurrent post -approval study was also initiated to continue 5 -year follow up in the original 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_411124] (Nucleus Hybrid Extended Duration Post Approval Study).  
3.2 Device Description  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 implant system consists of the follow core components:  
• Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant,  
• Nucleus Sound Processor,  
• Nucleus Custom Sound™ programming software. 
3.2.1  Nucleus Hybrid L24 Cochlear Implant  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Cochlear Implant that will be used in this study is the same as that used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411125] ( #G070191) . There have been no changes to this internal 
system component.  
3.2.2  Nucleus 6 (CP910/920) Sound Processor  
The Cochlear Nucleus 6 Sound Processor is a BTE processor (Figure 1), with a modular 
design that incorporates a main signal processing module (the “sound processor”) with built -
in directional microphones, a battery module (2 zinc air or rechargeable), radio frequency (RF) coil and coil cable. This sound processor was developed to p rovide acoustic (optionally) 
and electrical stimulation to hearing- impaired candidates who have some low -frequency 
residual hearing. The Nucleus 6 Sound Processor is functionally the same as the previous generation Freedom Hybrid Sound Processor. It is one of the  commercially available sound 
processors  for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_411126], including the Hybrid L24 
implant .

Figure 1:  Labeled components of the Nucleus 6 Sound Processor  
3.2.3  Nucleus 7 (CP1000) Sound Processor  
The Nucleus 7 Sound Processor is a behind -the-ear (BTE) sound processor that is 
functionally the same as the previous generation Nucleus 6 Sound Processor, and like that 
device, can a lso be programmed to allow acoustic stimulation. The Nucleus 7 Sound 
Processor hardware consists of a single- push- button control, a replaceable top microphone 
cover that contains a pair of permanently mounted covers, and an integrated coil and coil 
cable. There is  no accessory port on the Nucleus 7 Sound Processor, but it is compatible 
with Cochlear’s existing range of wireless accessories. The Nucleus 7  Sound Processor was 
approved by [CONTACT_67638] P970051/S151 on June 13, 2017.   
The Nucleus 7 Sound Processor is compatible with:  
• A wireless programming adaptor for wireless programming sessions. 
• Hybrid receivers in three  receiver sizes.  
• Cochlear’s range of Wireless Accessories (Cochlear Phoneclip, Cochlear Mini Microphone, Mini Microphone 2 and 2+, and Cochlear TV Streamer). 
o These accessories are also compatible with the CP910 and CP920 Sound Processors and certain GN ReSound Hearing Aids, meaning that bimodal 
streaming is available.

Figure 2:  Image of the Nucleus [ADDRESS_518502] as good as that from the Nucleus 6 and 
Nucleus 7 sound processor s, subjects may be given the option to upgrade to the new 
technology as part of this investigation.  
3.2.4  Acoustic Component  
Acoustic stimulation is delivered via an acoustic module, called the Acoustic Component. 
The Acoustic Component (Figure 2) connects to the sound processor to deliver acoustic 
amplification in a similar way to that from a conventional hearing aid. The retention of the acoustic component to the ear can be either via a custom earmold or a non -custom dome . 
However, it is highly recommended that a custom earmold be made and fit for optimal low -

CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        12 frequency amplification to be delivered via the acoustic component. Programming of the 
sound processor and acoustic component is achieved via Custom Sound™ s oftware.  
 
Figure 2: Nucleus 6 Sound Processor with Acoustic Component. Shown is the dome retention system . 
The Acoustic Component can also be used with a custom earmold.  
3.2.5  Custom Sound Clinical Programming Software  
Programming of the sound processor is achieved via Custom Sound™ software. Custom 
Sound permits the characterization of both electric and acoustic parameters required for Nucleus 6 Sound Processor programming. The general approach for the electric 
programming is the same as that for traditional cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_411127] 22 channels of the Nucleus Hybrid cochlear implant. The software provides the ability to specify the cut -off 
frequency at which acoustic stimulation ends and electrical stimulation begins. In addition, 
the software provides a user interface for the clinician to program amplification 
characteristics (gain and maximum output, frequency by [CONTACT_35043]) for the subject’s low -
frequency range of hearing.

high- frequency sensorineural hearing loss, and who obtain limited benefit from appropriately 
fit bilateral hearing aids.  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_411128] (thresholds no poorer than 60dB HL up to and including 500 Hz), with severe to profound mid- to high- frequency hearing loss (threshold 
average of 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz ≥ 75dB HL), and moderately sever e to profound 

The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        13 mid- to high -frequency hearing loss (threshold average of 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz ≥ 
60dB HL) in the contralateral ear.  
• The CNC word recognition score will be between 10% and 60% inclusively, in the ear 
to be implanted in the pre operative aided condition and in the contralateral ear will be 
equal to or better than that of the ear to be implanted but not more than 80% correct . 
• Prospective candidates should go through a suitable hearing aid trial, unless already 
appropriately fitted with hearing aids .  
A Cochlear Nucleus Hybrid L24 cochlear implant is not indicated for individuals who have the 
following conditions:  
1. Deafness due  to lesions of the acoustic nerve or central auditory pathway . 
2. Active middle -ear disease, with or without tympanic membrane perforation. 
3. Absence of cochlear development . 
4. A duration of severe to profound hearing loss of 30 years or greater. 
5 Purpose  of Study  
The purpose of the Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System : New Enrollment  Study  is to gather 
supplementary long- term safety and effectiveness data in a newly implanted population. This 
real-world experience may allow the Sponsor  to learn about sub -groups of patients, evaluate 
training programs, and further explore the type and frequency of adverse events beyond that which could be captured during the original clinical trial . 
6 Study Objective  and Hypothesis  
The objective of the Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant  System: New Enrollment  Study is to assess 
the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid L24 System in a newly implanted population 
through  3 years  postactivation.  
The primary study hypotheses are 1) that the majority of  subjects will show improved 
objective and subjective benefit with the Hybrid L24 Implant when compared with  the 
preoperative aided condition and 2) the type and frequency of adverse events in the study population will be similar to that seen in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411129] . 
 
[ADDRESS_518504] research design (in which 
each subject serves as his or her own control) is appropriate since it accommodates the 
heterogeneity that characterizes hearing- impaired populations . Blinding or masking 
procedures are not included in the design as it is not possible to conceal the presence or absence of an implant from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_411130]/or  clinical investigators . To minimize order 
effects and test bias, word and sentence lists assigned to the various test conditions will be 
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-[ADDRESS_518505] approval study and/or  a retrospective review of standard of care clinical records will be 
included for a total population of up to 85 subjects for effectiveness analysis and 150 
individuals for safety analysis.  
9 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion criteria are identical to the Indications for U se in labeling since the  Hybrid L24 
Implant is FDA approved and commercially available. See the Indications for Use section of 
this protocol for additional information.  
Exclusion criteria include those from the Indications for Use in addition to the following: 
• Unwilling and/or unable  to comply with the investigational requirements . 
• Not proficient in English . 
10 Sample Size Calculation 
Data collected in this study will includ e 50 newly implanted subjects . These data, combined 
with that from other sources, in total should provide efficacy information on up to 85 subjects and safety information on up to 150 subjects . The three sources of data include:  
1) A minimum of [ADDRESS_518506] -approval study . 
2) Thirty -five subjects from the Hybrid Extended  Duration post -approval study . 
3) Eighteen subjects from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411131] 1- year 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_411132].  
4) A minimum of [ADDRESS_518507] 
of care t echniques.  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        15 In addition to this study of 50 newly implanted Hybrid L24 sub jects, there are up to 35 eligible 
subjects drawn from the original cohort of 53 subjects in the Hybrid L24 pi[INVESTIGATOR_411125] 
(including 3 subjects from the Continued Access supplement to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411125]) to be 
followed longitudinally to a 5- year postactivation end point . To be more specific, of the 53 
IDE subjects , 10 subjects were explanted and/or discontinued participati on, [ADDRESS_518508] 6 additional 
subjects  had already met the 5- year postactivation interval  but were  seen for a one -time 
baseline evaluation.  
For characterizing the incidence of adverse events over time, such as the occurrence of low -
frequency hearing loss, a total of 150 subjects would provide a precision (defined as the half-
width of a two- sided 95% confidence interval) of approximately 11.9%  or smaller. This 
calculation is based on an exact binomial confidence interval . Additionally, speech 
performance can be well characterized with a  cohort of 50 subjects as demonstrated by [CONTACT_411144] L24 PMA data; the larger sample size here will provide more statistical precision. In particular , with this planned sample size for the combined cohorts, speech 
performance data on between 50 and 1 00 subjects will provide a precision of between 4.7% 
and 8.2% based on a standard deviation of approximately 29% as observed in the Hybrid 
L24 PMA data for the change in CNC and AzBio scores from preoperative to [ADDRESS_518509] differences, 
as measured using the Consonant -Nucleus -Consonant (CNC) test (Peterson and Lehiste, 
1962) in two listening conditions:   
• the implant ear alone and, 
• when using both ears together  through [ADDRESS_518510] will be obtained at the study candidacy/baseline evaluation and 
postoperatively at [ADDRESS_518511] Approval Study – Extended Duration Monitoring of 
Subjects with the Cochl ear Nucleus Hybrid L24 Cochlear Implant System .

The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        16 • Sentence recognition in noise will be measure in the best unilateral condition as 
evaluated with the AzBio test (Spahr et al., 2011)  
At Basel ine all subjects will be evaluated with the AzBio sentences at both a +5 dB and a 
+10 dB signal -to-noise ratio  (SNR)  in all conditions.  
Postoperatively , subjects will be evaluated with the AzBio sentences in the implant ear at a 
+[ADDRESS_518513] 
scores ≤ 20% correct when tested in the implanted ear at +5dB SNR then the remaining 
conditions (electric only if the subjects has residual hearing and both ears together) will be 
tested using a +[ADDRESS_518514] scores > 20% correct,  then remaining conditions 
will continue to be tested using a +[ADDRESS_518515] Battery (MSTB) published in 2011 as a joint effort of the cochlear implant industry and the audiologic/otologic professional community . These test materials are provided free of charge to any cochlear 
implanting center and include calibration and instructions for use.  
11.[ADDRESS_518516] 
and/or the procedure to place the investigational device will be recorded.  
An adverse event will be considered to be device- related or procedure -related when, in the 
judgment of the Primary Investigator, there is a logical connection between the use and/or 
placement  of the device and the occurrence of the event . Adverse events associated with 
cochlear implantation in previous investigations include tinnitus,  dizziness, swelling, facial 
nerve stimulation, and open- and/or short -circuit electrodes, among others.  
Device -specific adverse events include loss of hearing sensitivity in the implanted ear 
(defined as a loss of hearing that results in a pure-tone average  (PTA)  of > 90 dB for 
frequencies 125- 1000  Hz), total loss, and/or explantation.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence which: 
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] > 24 hours or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411133];  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; or  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        17 For an  event that meets the definition of a SAE, if the Primary Investigator judges that there 
is a logical connection between the use of the device and/or the p rocedure to place the 
device and the occurrence, the SAE will be recorded as device -related and/or procedure-
related.  
Device -related adverse event rates will be reported as the number and frequency of events 
with corresponding 95% exact binomial confidence limits, as well as the number of events 
per patient -time (e.g., events per 10 patient years). These values will be qualitatively 
compared to the same rates observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411125]; no formal statistical comparisons will be conducted.  
11.3.1    Secondar y Safety Endpoint  
Secondary safety endpoints will include the following:  
• Cumulative Safety Assessment:  Adverse events recorded per protocol with start 
dates prior to initial activation and each follow -up time interval will be tabulated. 
• Procedure -Related Adverse Event Assessment:  Procedure -related events occurring 
during the follow -up period will be tabulated.  
• Device -Related Adverse Event Assessment:  Device -related events occurring during 
the follow -up period will be tabulated.  
• The above two classes of events (procedure and device related) will be summarized as rates . The numerator for each rate will be the number of subjects with at least one 
procedure - or device -related adverse event . The denominator will be the total number 
of subjects .  
• Rates (overall and procedure and device related) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_24975].  
• Time to first adverse event (including total losses of residual hearing) will be 
summarized using Kaplan Meier plots. Exploratory proportional hazards regression 
models will be used to determine whether demographics and baseline characteristics are associated with risk for adverse events over follow -up. Hazard ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals for these analyses will be cited.  
[ADDRESS_518517] cochlear implant patients routinely return for annual follow -
up/programming visits, this is not anticipated to place a burden on sites or subjects . The 
target retention rate is at least 80% at [ADDRESS_518518] to follow -up.  
13 Overview of Study Procedures   
Preoperatively, candidates will be assessed in the unaided and aided (i.e., with hearing aids) 
conditions to evaluate their appropriateness for entrance into the study and to establish baseline measures . Postoperatively, speech perception testing will be completed using the 
implanted ear alone (hybrid mode  if the subject has residual hearing and electric only mode 
for all subjects), and both ears together (combined or bimodal mode) . In addition, subjects 
will be asked to complete subjective questionnaires to measure overall health status, device use, and sa tisfaction. The degree of preservation of low- frequency hearing will be assessed 
as part of the safety data at each study interval.  
Subjects will be assessed for study purposes preoperatively as well as at intervals corresponding to the initial activation of the device ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 to 5 weeks postoperative), [ADDRESS_518519] at the discretion of the study site as part of 
routine care (e.g., to address device programming needs). 
This protocol is slightly revised from the original protocol under the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411134] . Some 
measurements and test conditions that are considered to not provide novel information have 
been removed to increase compliance with a [ADDRESS_518520]’s name [CONTACT_411172] . All individuals who provide informed consent (who 
sign the Informed Consent form), are considered to be consented into the study and will be assigned a unique identifier . A unique alphanumeric code will identify the subject throughout 
the course of the study . For example, US01-H NE-0000, where:  
o US = [LOCATION_002]   
o 01 = a sequential number corresponding to the order in which a subject is 
enrolled into the study for a given study site  
o HNE = an abbreviation for the study, in this case HNE  for Hybrid New

appropriate consideration be made for masking or plugging the contralateral ear during 
unilateral testing in the sound field. See Appendix B for details on masking procedure.  
14.4.2  Speech Perception Assessment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech Understanding in Quiet  
The CNC Word Test (Peterson & Lehiste, 1962) is a validated test used clinically and in 
research to assess the performance of adults with hearing aids or cochlear implants on 
open- set word recognition ability . The test consists of [ADDRESS_518524] for this study . Subjects will be tested using a 
configuration of speech at 0° azimuth.  
Preoperatively , the following test conditions will be assessed for CNC words in quiet:  
1. Best unilateral for each ear . 
2. Best bilateral . 
The following test conditions will be assessed for CNC words in quiet postoperatively : 
1. Implant Ear , best unilateral (Hybrid mode if hearing has been preserved  or CI alone if 
not). 
2. Best bilateral  (Hybrid + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as Combined mode or CI 
alone + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as Bimodal mode). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech Understanding in Noise  
The AzBio Sentence Test (Spahr et al, 2012) is a validated test used clinically and in 
research to assess the open- set sentence recognition in speech- spectrum noise of adults 
with hearing aids or cochlear implants . It consists of [ADDRESS_518525] or ‘fill in’ unintelligible words . The sentences will be 
presented at a fixed level of 65 dBA in speech- weighted noise at a fixed signal -to-noise ratio 
(+5 dB  and/or  +10dB ). Each list includes [ADDRESS_518526] is 85% +/ - 1%. Each word in the 
sentence counts towards the overall sco re. Subjects will be tested using a configuration of 
speech and noise at 0° azimuth.  
The following test conditions will be assessed for AzBio Sentences in noise:  
1. Implant Ear , best unilateral  listening mode (Hybrid Mode or Electric Only ). 
2. Implant Ear ,
  Electric Only . 
(NOTE:  If the best unilateral listening mode corresponds to Electric Only  in condition 
1 above, condition 2 will not be necessary ).

CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-[ADDRESS_518527] Bilateral  (Hybrid Mode + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as Combined Mode  
or Electric Only  + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as Bimodal Mode). 
At all post activation intervals each subject’s default MAP parameters, including rate of 
stimulation, number of maxima, and pulse width will be maintained for testing. The signal 
processing algorithms ASC +ADRO will be utilized with all other signal processing algorithms 
turned off.  
14.4.3  Subjective Questionnaires  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech, Spatial , and Qualities of Hearing  Questionnaire (SSQ)  
The SSQ (Gatehouse & Noble, 2004) will be used as a subject ive self-assessment in three 
categories (speech hearing rating scale, spatial hearing rating scale, and sound qualities 
rating scale). The SSQ is considered a closed -ended sel f-report assessment of outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Device Use Questionnaire (DUQ)  
This questionnaire was developed by [CONTACT_411146][INVESTIGATOR_411135], subjective preferences, and satisfaction with 
regards to device use in various listening conditions . The original version has been modified 
in order to only ask questions not otherwise addressed in the SSQ. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3)  
The HUI (Furlong, W., Feeny, D., Torrance, G.W., Barr, R.D., 2001) is a validated, 15- item 
population- based health utility instrument that postulates the domains of health as hearing, 
vision, speech, emotion, pain, ambulation, dexterity, cognition, and self -care.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The Hybrid Post -Market Cost of Ownership Survey 
The Hybrid Post -Market Cost of Ownership Surveys will be used to collect self -reported short  
and long term costs of cochlear implantation. This questionnaire is a modified version of that 
developed in South Africa (Kerr G, 2012) . The data may be used in Health Economic and 
Quality of Life modeling.  
15 Preoperative Procedures  (within 90 days prior to surgery)  
15.1 Informed Consent 
A preoperative interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_51896]/or audiologist to inform the 
candidate about all aspects of implantation with the Nucleus Hybrid L24 implant, study 
expectations , surgical procedure, and the postoperative evaluation schedule. The risks and 
benefits of surgery and implantation shall be explained to the subject as outlined on the Informed Consent Form . These include the risks associated with general anesthesia, as well 
as other risks such as loss of residual hearing, facial paralysis, dizziness, meningitis, postoperative discomfort, and skin flap complications . The potential limitations and 
advantages of implantation shall also be explained. 
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        22 After reviewing the Informed Consent Form the candidate will be given the opportunity to ask 
questions about the Informed Consent Form and/or the study prior to signing the Informed Consent Form . The candidate will be offered the opportunity to take the form home to 
discuss with family members should they choose to do so. If they sign the Informed Consent 
Form, t he candidate will then be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form to take 
home.  
Note : The Informed Consent document must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_411147] -related evaluation taking place. Testing completed as part of normal 
clinical practice, such as the audiogram, is acceptable. However, such testing must be completed per the requirements laid out in the Procedures Manual and/or Case Report 
Forms (e.g., threshold measurement at inter -octave frequencies).  
15.2 Fitting and Use of Hearing Aids 
To be considered for the study, subjects will be assessed using appropriately fitted behind-
the-ear (BTE) or in -the-ear (ITE) hearing aids in each ear. There may be some individuals 
with very good low -frequency hearing, who prefer and perform comparably with no 
amplification in one or both ears. For the purposes of this study, subjects will use either their 
own hearing aids or be fitted with new/replacement aids for candidacy assessment . See 
Appendix C for additional details . The decision to replace hearing aids will be based on the 
clinical judgment  of the audiologist . All speech perception criteria must be met in the aided 
condition, even if amplification provides no additional subjective and/or objective benefit 
over natural acoustic hearing.  
If the subject does not use hearing aids on a daily basis, does not own hearing aids, or uses 
hearing aids that are not appropriately fitted, loaner hearing aids are to be provided and fit. 
The subject will undergo a hearing aid trial of sufficient length and using hearing instruments with characteristics chosen based upon the clinician’s best judgment prior to being further assessed for study candidacy. The specific procedures surrounding the hearing aid trial should be determined by [CONTACT_411148] . The study Procedures Manual will provide references for hearing 
aid fitting strategies and guidance on amplifying areas of useful residual hearing. Taking a 
conservative approach, useful hearing will be defined by [CONTACT_411149] [ADDRESS_518528] recognition will be re-assessed 
to ensure that candidacy criteria are met.  
15.3 Medical/Surgical History 
The subject’s relevant medical/surgical history is to be briefly reported and is required in 
order to determine that the subject is medically suitable for implantation. Information to be 
collected may include the subject’s general medical history, medications, radiological information (i.e., x -rays), otologic history, and otologic surgical history . This inform ation may 
be obtained from the subject directly and/or the subject’s medical record.  
15.4 Candidacy Assessment  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        23 The candidacy evaluation has two components: 
1. Preoperative Candidacy Evaluation will be completed to determine if the subject  
meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria to qualify for enrollment in the study . The 
Informed Consent Form must be signed prior to any study related evaluation taking 
place.  
2. The Preoperative Baseline Assessment will be completed to establish baseline 
measures after candidacy has  been determined but prior to surgical implantation of 
the Hybrid L24 device . Information gathered during these preoperative procedures 
will be reported on the appropriate Case Record Forms (CRFs) . There will be no 
predetermined time period required between candidacy and baseline assessment . 
However, candidacy must be re -assessed if more than [ADDRESS_518529] elapsed prior to 
the surgery date.  
15.4.1  Preoperative Candidacy Evaluation  
Candidacy evaluation will include verification of appropriate amplification per above under 
“Fitting  and Use of Hearing Aids,” unaided and aided audiometric thresholds , as well as 
unaided and aided speech discrimination assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Audiometric Assessment  
U
naided audiometric thresholds will be obtained for each ear, with insert earphones, using 
the standard audiometric technique for pure- tone air -conduction testing. Aided audiometric 
thresholds will be obtained for each ear in the sound- field using narrow band noise and the 
standard audiometric technique with the speakers positioned at 0 ° azimuth relative to the 
subject’s head. As these subjects have relatively good low -frequency hearing bilaterally, 
perhaps within normal limits at some frequencies, it is important that appropriate 
consideration be made for masking/plugging the contralateral ear during aided testing.  
Testing, for both ears, will include the following:  
• Air conduction thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 
and 8000 Hz;  
• Bone conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500,  2000, and 4000 Hz;  
• Aided thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz;  
• Tympanometry in each ear . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech Perception Candidacy Testing  
Two lists of the CNC word test will be administered at [ADDRESS_518530] 
recognition score between 10% and 60% , inclusive (i.e., 10% ≤ score ≤ 60%) in the ear to be 
implanted and ≤  80% in the contralateral ear.  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-[ADDRESS_518531] conditions . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hearing History and Counseling  
Information regarding subject hearing -history (etiology, onset of hearing loss, duration of 
severe to profound hearing loss, amplification use) wi ll be obtained and reported on the 
appropriate Case Report Form . In addition, patients will be carefully and extensively 
counseled to ensure that their expectations from implantation are reasonable and 
appropriate (as determined by [CONTACT_737]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Candidacy Determination 
Once the candidacy evaluation is completed the Investigator is required to submit the 
candidacy CRFs for review by [CONTACT_1034]’s study manager, or designee . The data will be 
reviewed,  and candidacy assessed by [CONTACT_75680]. Approval or 
disapproval will then be provided by [CONTACT_411150] . 
15.[ADDRESS_518532] recognition requirements outlined above, under “ Candidacy Assessment .” Additionally, 
initiation of these measures should only occur upon completion of  any hearing aid trial period 
the candidate requires. Any aided speech perception test conditions completed prior to the completion of the hearing aid trial will need to be repeated. Considerable baseline testing is required,  and study sites may choose to complete the testing over more than one study visit 
to avoid subject fatigue effects.  
For the study, subjects will be required to make use of the best -listening mode (i.e., unaided 
or aided for each ear). The best -listening mode, in this context, will be based on the mode in 
which the subjects score significantly better, based on binomial comparisons of the CNC word scores obtained aided and unaided for each ear, during the candidacy assessment. 
The Sponsor will provide these to the testing clinician as part of Investigator training. Resultant aided/unaided configurations for a given individual might be : 
• aided bilaterally , 
• aided unilaterally , or 
• unaided bilaterally . 
15.5.1  Baseline Aided Speech Perception M easures: 
1. The CNC Word Test (two lists per condition, at 60 dBA) will be used to assess speech perception in quiet, in the best listening modes:  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        25 a. unilaterally6 for each ear (plug/mask the opposite ear) and, 
b. bilaterally . 
2. The AzBio sentence lists (t wo lists at  65 dBA, one  a +5 dB SNR  and one at  +10 dB 
SNR with both  presented from the same speaker at 0° azimuth, in the best listening 
modes:  
a. unilaterally for the ear to be implanted (plug/mask the opposite ear) and,  
b. bilaterally . 
15.5.2  Self-Assessment/Subjective Questionnaires 
The following self -assessment/subjective questionnaires will also b e completed as part of the 
Baseline assessment : 
• SSQ . 
• DUQ . 
• HUI3 . 
• Hybrid Post Ma rket Cost of Ownership Survey . 
16 Surgical Procedure  
The surgical procedure for the Nucleus Hybrid L24 implant is described in the S urgeon’s Guide 
provide with each implant (part 427182 ISS5 MAR14) . 
17 Postoperative Procedures  
17.1 Summary of Postoperative Procedures  
Following surgical implantation of the device and a healing period, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  3-5 weeks , the 
implant will be activated . Shortly thereafter (usually 2-4 weeks after activation) a follow -up visit 
may take place to “fine- tune” sound processor programming. No formal study testing will be 
required at the programming follow- up.  
A combination of audiometric testing, speech perception assessment, subjective questionnaire 
assessment, and psychophysical and electrical impedances measures will be completed at 
the intervals below . For details on the procedures to be followed at each specific interval, 
please see Section 20: Summary of Data Collection Visits .  
• Initial activation . 
• [ADDRESS_518533] testing will be completed unilaterally at the Candidacy Evaluation and repeated 
during Baseline testing only if a hearing aid trial is required.

17.2 Detailed Postoperative Procedures 
17.2.1  Initial Activation  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Audiometric Testing  
Test frequencies will include the following:  
• Air conduction thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 
and 8000 Hz;  
• Bone conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 4000 Hz;  
• Implant soundfield thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 
[ADDRESS_518537] conditions will include:  
• Unaided audiometric thresholds  for each ear, with insert earphones, using the 
standard audiometric technique for pure -tone air -conduction test ing.  
• Audiometric thresholds will be obtained in the sound- field using the standard 
audiometric technique with the speakers positioned at 0°  azimuth relative to the 
subject’s head in the following condition: 
o Hybrid Mode  (Implant + Acoustic , ipsilateral ) if the subject demonstrates 
preserved low -frequency hearing, 
o Electric Only , if the subject demonstrates a profound loss of low- frequency 
hearing. 
• Tympanometry in each ear . 
If any significant change in unaided thresholds i s noted then the amplification fitting(s) should 
be re -evaluated and adjustments made , if necessary, using the same procedures outlined in 
the Preoperative Evaluation. A significant change for this purpose only is defined as a shift of more than 10 dB (for  the better or worse) at two or more aidable frequencies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sound Processor Fitting 
The subject  will be fitted with the Nucleus [ADDRESS_518538] current commercially approved processor available.  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        27 the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411136], called the Acoustic Component (AC ). The AC connects to the sound proc essor via a 
speaker unit  attached to th e earhook  of the sound processor, thereby [CONTACT_411151] a similar way to a conventional Receiver -in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aid.  
Threshold (T) and comfort (C) values will be measured for the electrical stimulation on at least 5 channels per the streamlined fitting method. Impedance telemetry results using 
common ground (CG) and monopolar (MP1, MP2 and MP1+2) stimulation modes will also be recorded. This information will be used to program the sound processor and also to monitor 
the device.  
The basic programming approach will be to assign frequency channels to the Hybrid 
electrode array that supplement the acoustic sensitivity . In oth er words, the frequency 
assignment of the electrical stimulation will begin at the frequency where acoustic hearing is no longer useful. For this purpose, hearing thresholds poorer than  [ADDRESS_518539]’s hearing in the implanted ear is more than 85 dB HL for frequencies at and above 1000 Hz (i.e., useful acoustic hearing up to 750 Hz), the lower frequency boundary for electric stimulation will be set as close as possible to 750 Hz (i.e., the last aidable frequency) . That is, electrical stimulation would be provided in this case for inputs 
from around [ADDRESS_518540] based on current 
research as well as patient performance and preference. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acoustic Component (AC ) Fitting  
The acoustic component will be appropriately fit using the National Acoustics Laboratories’ 
hearing aid fitting strategy (as used preoperatively for the acoustic hearing aids) to assess the degree to which real- ear targets are met for each subject. Fitting methodology with the AC  is 
unchanged from that of conventional acoustic hearing aids.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fitting a Contralateral Hearing Aid  
A hearing aid will be supplied by [CONTACT_411152] i t. This hearing aid or any other hearing aid 
being used by a study subject in the contralateral ear should be optimized and the fit verified prior to any postactivation testing in the best bilateral condition.  
17.2.2  Programming Follow -up 
It is not unusual for T- and C -levels to change during the initial postactivation period. This 
optional follow- up evaluation will allow the subjects’ T- and C -levels to be checked as well as 
any programming adjustments to be made based on the subjects’ initial experience with t he 
device. No clinical data will be required at this or any other interval  outside of those defined 
by [CONTACT_411153]. However, it will be required that an Adverse Event (AE) 
Form be completed should any event meeting the definition of a  device-related AE occur.

CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-[ADDRESS_518541] activation Evaluations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  External Equipment Check 
Prior to any speech perception testing, an assessment of the external hardware, including 
the Sound Processor and Acoustic Component, will be made. If any clinically significant 
change in unaided thresholds is noted,  then the amplification fitting(s) will be re- evaluated 
and adjustments made if necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hearing Aid Verification 
A hearing aid check will be completed by [CONTACT_411154], if 
used, are functioning appropriately  prior to conducting aided testing .  
If any significant change in unaided thresholds is noted,  then the amplification fitting(s) 
should be re -evaluated and adjustments made if necessary . As noted above, significant 
change for this purpose only is defined as a shift of more than 10 dB (for the better or worse) 
at two or more aidable (i.e., those frequencies where threshold are < 90dB HL) frequencies . 
See Appendix C for additional information on fitting the contralateral hearing aid.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Audiomet ric Testing  
Unaided audiometric thresholds will be obtained for each ear, with insert earphones , using 
the standard audiometric technique for pure- tone air -conduction testing.  
• Air conduction thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz;  
• Bone conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 4000 Hz . 
Assessing aided thresholds after the initial activation will only be conducted if there is a 
change in unaided hearing. A significant change is defined as a shift of more than 10 dB (for 
the better or worse) at two or more aidable (i.e., < 90 dB HL) frequencies .  
Aided audiometric thresholds, if required,  will be obtained using narrow band noise, in sound-
field employing the standard audiometric technique with the speakers positioned at 0 ° 
azimuth relative to the subject’s head. With these subjects having relatively good low-
frequency hearing bilaterally, perhaps within normal limits at some frequencies, it is important 
that appropriate consideration be made for masking/plugging the contralateral, non- test, ear 
during aided testing. Testing, for each ear, will include the following:  
• Aided thresholds at 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-Assessment/Subjective Questionnaires

[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech Perception Testing  
The CNC Word Test in quiet at 60 dBA  will be administered in the following listening 
conditions:  
1. Implant Ear, best unilateral listening mode (Hybrid Mode or Electric Only , if ipsilateral 
low-frequency hearing is not maintained).  
2. Best bilateral listening (Hybrid Mode + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as 
Combined Mode or Electric Only  + Cont ralateral Acoustic, referred to as Bimodal 
Mode, if ipsilateral low- frequency hearing is not maintained). 
The AzBio sentenc e test will be administered in noise , target  presented at 65 dBA (+5 dB 
SNR and/or  +10 dB SNR ) for the following listening  conditions :  
1. Implant Ear, best unilateral listening mode (Hybrid Mode or Electric Only , if low-
frequency hearing is not maintained).  
2. Implant Ear, Electric O nly. 
(Note: If the best unilateral listening mode corresponds to Electric Only  in condition 1 
above, condition 2 will not be necessary).  
3. Best bi lateral listening (Hybrid Mode + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as 
Combined Mode or Electric Only  + Contralateral Acoustic, referred to as Bimodal 
Mode, if low- frequency hearing is not maintained).8 
Note  1: Testing in the first implant ear condition (Hybrid Mode or Electric Only ) will be 
completed at a +5 dB SNR. If the resulting score is ≤ 20% correct,  then the remaini ng 
conditions will be tested using a +10 dB SNR. If the resulting score is > 20% correct,  then the 
SNR for subsequent conditions will remain at +5 dB.  
Note  2:  For the Implant Ear, Hybrid and/or Electric Only  modes (i.e., conditions 1 and 2, 
above) the contralateral ear will need to be occluded for speech perception testing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Psychophysical and Electrical Impedance Measurements  
The following routine psychophysical and electrical impedance measurements will be obtained at the 3-month, 6- month, 12- month , and annual postactivation intervals up to 3 
years  postactivation: 
• Electrical thresholds measured in Current Level  on at least [ADDRESS_518542] is using the 
implant (study) ear as well as when using the implant ear plus the contralateral ear. Testing with both 
ears will be completed as such regardless of what technology (i.e., implant, hearing aid, or no technology) is used in the contralateral ear. Given the possibility of residual acoustic hearing in the ipsilateral and/or contralateral ears it is possible that amplification may not be needed for Hybri d 
stimulation and is therefore not required.

[ADDRESS_518545] experienced a profound or complete loss of residual hearing and achieve less than expected speech perception outcomes (6 of the 50 subjects implanted 
as of November 8, 2013 under this IDE).  
In order to ensure that accurate information is gathered for any subject electing to undergo 
explantation and re -implantation with a long array, additional data will be collected prior to re -
implantation. This evaluation will include the following information and will follow the 
procedures described in the annual evaluation schedule:  
• Audiometric testing, 
• Speech perception testing, 
• Psychophysical and electrical impedance measurements , 
• Otologic/medical questionnaire. 
If explantation occurs, in addition to being considered an anticipated serious adverse event, 
an MDR will be filed per [ADDRESS_518546] activation interval  with the Hybrid 
device.  
20 Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to an 
investigational product, whether or not considered causally related to the product or the 
surgical procedure to implant it . An untoward medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., 
nausea), signs (e.g., tachycardia, fever) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, chest x -ray). 
Adverse events that occur during this study may be associated with the implant procedure, including those from general anesthesia, or specifically associated with the use of the device. 
An adverse event will be considered to be device- related when, in the judgment of the 
Primary Investigator, there is a logical connection between the use of the device and the occurrence of the event, above and beyond the study procedure itself . Adverse events 
associated with cochlear implantation in previous investigations include tinnitus, dizziness, 
swelling, facial nerve stimulation, and open and/or short circuit electrodes, among others.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence which:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life-threatening;  
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] > 24 hours or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411133];  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; or  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
If the Primary Investigator judges that there  is a logical connection (caused or contributed to) 
between the use of the device and the occurrence, the event will be evaluated for reporting 
requirements under [ADDRESS_518547]  (UADE) is “any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if 
that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” [FDA 21 CFR 812.3(s)] . The Sponsor will 
promptly conduct an investigation upon notification by [CONTACT_411155] a UADE and will 
notify the FDA and all reviewing IRBs and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_518548] and/or the procedure to place the investigational device will be recorded.  In this context  
As for loss of hearing sensitivity at the implanted ear, these data will be trended in a similar 
fashion to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411137] (G070191) but will not be considered an adverse event unless 
the loss reaches a profound level (pure- tone average of greater than 90 dB HL for 
frequencies 125- 1000 Hz), total loss, and/or explantation. Should an explantation occur, the 
Sponsor will treat this as a serious injury with reporting occurring under the Medical Device 
Reporting regulations (21 CFR Part 803) in addition to inclusion in the annual update report 
on the Post -Approval Study.  
 
20.1.1  Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by [CONTACT_411156]. The first concern will be the safety and welfare of the subject and for 
providing appropriate medical intervention, as indicated. Detailed information regarding adverse device effects  (ADEs) will be recorded by [CONTACT_411157] e, provided as part of the Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) for the study. Adverse device effects  will be recorded from the day of 
enrollment (Day 0) to termination of study or when the subject exits the study, whichever is 
last, even if the event was acknowledged as a risk factor in the Informed  Consent  Form . 
Adverse device effects  will be recorded on an  Adverse Event Questionnaire and will include 
the following information:  
• Date of onset . 
• Date reported to the investigational site . 
• Description of the event . 
• Seriousness . 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE to the device and/or 
procedure . 
• Treatment . 
• Outcome . 
20.1.2  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        34 Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) must be reported directly t o the clinical 
center’s reviewing IRB and the Sponsor, Cochlear Americas, within [ADDRESS_518549] be followed until resolution, or until the condition stabilizes. The Primary  
Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow- up includes any supplemental investigations 
as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as possible the nature and/or causality of the 
ADE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals . Cochlear or its designee may request that the Investigator perform 
or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations . AE follow up 
information will be recorded using a Follow Up to a Previously Reported Adverse Event 
Questionnaire, provided with the CRFs for the study.  
20.1.4  Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
All ADEs will be reported annually to FDA in accordance with the IDE regulation [FDA 21 
CFR Part 812.150(b)(5)]. All unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) will be reported to FDA within 10 calendar days of the event in accordance with FDA 21 CFR Part 812.46(b) and 812.150(b)(1) as well as [ADDRESS_518550] be reported to the IRB and Sponsor within 5 
(five) days of the event .  
If a subject is unable to return for follow -up before the closure of a study visit window (+/ - [ADDRESS_518551] activation study visits), or if protocol -defined assessments or parts thereof  are 
omitted or completed incorrectly, the event is to be noted on the Protocol Deviation Log 
provided to the Investigator in the study Regulatory Binder . Depending on the type or 
severity of the deviation the Investigator may be required to notify the IRB  and/or Sponsor if 
the deviation impacts safety or performance of the subject or data integrity.  
[ADDRESS_518552] from the study at any time if (s)he considers that remaining in the study compromises the subject’s health or the subject is not sufficiently cooperative. In either event, reason(s) for discontinuation should be recorded on a study 
withdrawal form, provided as part of the CRFs for the study.  
Possible reasons for study discontinuation include the following:  
• AE necessitating discontinuation from the study . 
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Voluntary decision to withdraw consent made by [CONTACT_423] .
9 
• Investigator decision.10 
• Other reason. 
In case of a subject lost -to-follow- up, the Investigator must attempt to contact [CONTACT_423] (or 
relative/family contact) by [CONTACT_648], email or letter at least three tim es. If attempts are 
unsuccessful, the ‘subject withdrawal’ form is to be completed in the study file and reported, 
as appropriate, in required reports to the Sponsor, IRB , and FDA.

23 D ata Analyses  
Statistical Analys is for this study is addressed in detail in the document entitled “Statistical 
Analysis Plan for Nucleus® Hybrid™ L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study Post 
Approval Study .” 
23.1 Analysis of Safety 
• Adverse events and serious adverse events will be expressed as  events per patient -
time.  
• All adverse event rates will be reported as the number and frequency of events with 
corresponding 95% exact binomial confidence limits and the number of events per patient -time (e.g., events per 10 patient years), and compared to the adverse events 
from G07019 (Hybrid L24 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]).  
• Time to first adverse event (including total losses of residual hearing) will be summarized using Kaplan Meier plots. Exploratory proportional hazards regression models will be used to determine whether baseline factors are associated with risk for 
adverse events over follow -up. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for these 
analyses will be cited. 
 
Safety analyses will include data from three cohorts for a target minimum of [ADDRESS_518556] correlation, 
allowing for comparisons between candidacy/ baseline and follow- up endpoints . The analyses 
will incorporate the 8 time intervals:  baseline, [ADDRESS_518557] initial activation ( IA), [ADDRESS_518558] score trajectory pattern will need to be captured by [CONTACT_396642] . If there is significant evidence that the assumption of normality does not hold (i.e., p 
< 0.[ADDRESS_518559] of normality), then ranked data will be used in the repeated 
measures models.  
Analysis of effectiveness will include up to [ADDRESS_518560] -approval study, which is now 
completed.  
23.3 Additional Analysis 
The primary analyses for each of the effectiveness endpoints will be based on the unilateral 
listening condition. As an additional exploratory analysis, the analysis for each effectiveness endpoint will also be analyzed under the other tested conditions (i.e. , best bilateral – 
combined or bimodal).  
23.[ADDRESS_518561] to follow u p. Baseline covariates to be explored and compared with study outcomes, specifically 
hearing loss and effectiveness measures, include: 
• age at implantation, 
• gender , 
• duration of hearing loss , 
• duration of severe to profound hearing loss  (if applicable) , 
• preoperative speech perception score, 
• preoperative low -frequency pure -tone average, 
• postoperative speech perception score (CNC and AzBio Sentences) at the last 
evaluation, 
• type and frequency of adverse events ,  
• distance from the implant center . 
24 Risk Benefit Statement  
The Hybrid L24 Implant System represents a new treatment option for a patient population that has few current therapeutic alternatives for high- frequency sensorineural hearing loss . 
High-frequency sound, crucial for speech discrimination, is provided electrically by [CONTACT_411143] 
L24 Implant while residual low- frequency hearing is amplified by [CONTACT_411158] . 
The two modes of stimulation are processed and provided simultaneously by [CONTACT_411159].  
Subjects with high-frequency hearing loss who  participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_411138] L24 clinical 
study (G070191) were able to combine both low -frequency (acoustic) and high- frequency 
(electric) information, from one or both ears, provided by [CONTACT_411143] L24 Implant System. 
Results indicated significant speech perception improvements in quiet and in noise when compared to preoperative performance. At the primary study endpoint (6 months 
postactivation), 100% of subjects showed equal or greater speech perception performance 
when listening with both ears (Hybrid + hearing aid in the opposite ear); greater than or equal to 90% of subjects showed equal to or greater speech perception performance when listening in the Hybrid Mode (electric and acoustic in the same ear) . More recently, with the 
The Nucleus Hybrid L24 Implant System New Enrollment Study  
CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-[ADDRESS_518562] unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks.  
To characterize the clinical significance of residual low- frequency loss and assess the 
benefit -risk profile of the Hybrid L24 implant, an analysis of subjects’ eff ectiveness  endpoint 
will be performed based on splitting subjects by [CONTACT_411160] -frequency hearing loss. 
This will follow the analysis of the Hybrid L24 PMA data with subjects experiencing 
moderate, moderately -severe, or severe low -frequency hearing loss (Group 1) and subjects 
experiencing profound or total low -frequency hearing loss (Group 2) described separately for 
their long- term speech performance.

CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        44 37 Appendix A: Procedural C onsiderations  
• All pre - and postimplantation testing will be completed using an audiometer, such 
as a Grason Stadler GSI 61 (Grason Stadler, Inc., Milford, NH, U.S.A.) or 
equivalent, calibrated to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards with maximum output for frequencies of 0.5 to 4 kHz of no less than 120 dB HL.  
• Speech and hearing evaluations will be completed in, at a minimum, a single- walled 
sound booth capable of accommodating a calibrated, 90- degree, speaker 
orientation.  
• Stimuli will be administered using either insert earphones and/or sound field speakers. Applicable ANSI standards are: ANSI/ASA S3.6- 2004;  ANSI S3.1 -1999  
(R 2003).  
• Pure -tone threshold exploration will be completed using the adaptive Hughson & 
Westlake procedure (1944).  
• Sound field calibration will be completed as recommended by [CONTACT_411169] (2002). The sound level meter should be set to the “A scale” and “slow” settings . The sound 
level meter will be placed in the center of sound booth, approximately 1m from the loudspeaker  face, at the height of which would represent the center of an average 
subject’s  head. The calibration noise (test specific, but  preferably speech spectrum 
noise) will be administered through the audiometer output to the loudspeaker  within 
the sound booth. The sound level meter detects the audiometer output through the 
loudspeaker . With the VU meter on the audiometer set to 0 while, the dial on the 
audiometer is adjusted until the sound level meter within the sound booth detects 
the desired output.

CAM -CLE-CAM5573- CIP-01 Version 8        45 38 Appendix B: Instructions for Masking  
1. Pure -tone threshold is established in the test ear.  
2. Masking noise is introduced to the non- test ear at the initial masking level (10dB 
above the established threshold in the non -test ear). Pure -tone threshold then is re -
established.  
3. Level of the masking tone or noise is increased subsequently by 5 dB . If there is a 
response to the tone in the presence of the noise, the level of the noise is increased 
by 5 dB . If there is no response to the tone in the presence of the noise, the level of 
the tone is increased by 5 dB steps until a response is ob tained.  
4. A plateau has been reached when the level of the noise can be increased over a 
range of 15 to 20 dB without shifting the threshold of the tone . This corresponds to a 
response to the tone at the same hearing level  when the masker is increased in thr ee 
to four consecutive levels.  
5. Masked pure -tone threshold corresponds to the hearing level  of the tone at which a 
masking plateau has been established.

1.0 Study Summary  
Title: Endotracheal Tube Securement Study:  The Effect of Adhesive Tape Versus Endotracheal 
Tube Fastener on Lip Integrity, Tube Dislodgement, and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia in 
Critically Ill Adults  
- A single center randomized controlled trial of endotracheal tube securement with adhesive 
tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in the incidence  of lip ulcers, tube dislodgement, and 
ventilator associated pneumonia.   
Study Site:   Vanderbilt Univ ersity Medical Center Nashville, TN  
Background:   During e ndotracheal  intubation there are many potential complications includ ing 
laryngeal trauma, bronchospasm, hypotension, airway perforation, and vertebral column injury. Following intubation for mechanic al ventilation, there are several techniques to secure the 
endotracheal tube.  The optimal stabilization method in reducing complications  is unknown. We 
propose a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of adhesive  tape  versus 
endotracheal tube fastener on complications including lip ulcers, endotracheal tube 
dislodgement, and ventilator associated pneumonia among critically ill adults requiring 
intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
Primary Aim:  
• To compare the effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fasteners on 
the incidence  of lip ulcers, tube dislodgement, and ventilator associated 
pneumonia among critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  
• The use of an endotracheal tube fastener  will redu ce the incidence of lip ulcers, 
tube dislodgement, and ventilator associated pneumonia among critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient is admitted to an ICU  at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
2. Patient requires  intubation and mechanical ventilation 
3. Intubated for less than 12  hours before enrollment in the study  
4. Patient anticipated to be intubated 24 hours or longer  
5. Age > 18 years  
 
Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Presence of oral mucosa or facial skin breakdown before study enrollment  
2. Nasotracheal intubation 
3. Patients with documented allergy to tape  
4. Patient has facial anatomy which prevents the use of endotracheal tube fastener

5. Prisoners  
6. Pregnant patients  
Consent:   Given that both techniques for securing endotracheal tubes are  used in practice, 
appear to be arbitrarily chosen by [CONTACT_815253], and that there is a lack of 
established risk or benefit between the two techniques, this trial poses no increased risk 
beyond usual ICU care to the patients.   Also, over 90% of p atients undergoing endotracheal 
intubation in the ICU cannot consent for the procedure itself  and choosing a securement 
strategy is time -sensitive as endotracheal tube securement must occur at the time of 
intubation, therefore it is impractical to obtain informed consent for research prior to the procedure.  Given the minimal risk interventions and impractability of informed consent, a waiver of informed consent will be requested.  
Randomization:   Using opaque envelopes available in the patient care area par ticipating in the 
study, participants will be randomized 1:1 to adhesive or endotracheal tube fastener  
Study Interventions:   
• Endotracheal tube securement 
o Adhesive  Tape : (1) Use skin preparation pad (tincture benzocaine) to 
prepare area over cheeks and upper lip where adhesive tape will be secured (2) Use tape to tape approach to decrease adhesiveness of tape 
to back of neck / hair area.  (3) Secure  tape around patient’s neck. ( 4) 
Encircle the adhesive tape around the tube and fix to the maxilla about 
the upper lip and down the lower lip.  
o Endotracheal tube fastener: (1) Place upper lip stabilizer so it rests on skin between nose and lip; place skin barrier pads on cheeks. (2) Secure ETT wrap with non- slip grippers and one -click security clamp. (3) Position 
gliding tube shuttle; reposition as needed for oral care and pressure relief.  
o Repositioning: Frequency of repositioning of endotracheal tube in both groups will be left to the applicable ICU protocol ( or discretion of the 
provider if no applicable prot ocol) and will be documented accordingly.  
Primary Endpoint (All endpoints are collected non -invasively and are already a part of clinical 
data obtained in usual ICU care at the bedside or in the medical record):    
• Composite of any of: presence of lip ulcer, endotracheal tube dislodgement, or facial skin tears from the time of randomization to the earlier of death or 48 hours after extubation  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Presence of Lip Ulcer  
• Endotracheal tube dislodgement  
• Ventilator associated pneumonia incidence

5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
We will include endotracheal tube securement events in which:  
1. Patient is admitted to the intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  
2. Planned proce dure is endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation OR 
3. Patient is intubated prior to arrival, however the intubation occurred less than 12 
hours pr ior to admission to the intensive care unit 
4. Patient is likely to be intubated > 24 hours.  
5. Age > [ADDRESS_1128802] management events in which:  
1. Patient has presence of oral mucosa or facial skin breakdown before study enrollment

6.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
6.1 Study Sites: ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
6.2 Study Population:  The study population will be all critically ill adults admitted to an 
ICU service  for whom the clinical team has decided to perform endotracheal 
intubation or for whom endotracheal intubation has been performed within [ADDRESS_1128804] a documented allergy to tape.  
6.3 Enrollment :  All patients will be enrolled at the time the clinical team decides that 
intubation is required and the patient meets inclusion but no exclusion criteria .  If 
the patient arrives in the MICU already intubated, but has been intubated less than [ADDRESS_1128805] exclusion criteria, they will be eligible for randomization  
as soon as po ssible (but must occur within 12 hours of the intubation)  when their 
endotracheal tube is undergoing securement.  
6.4 Consent: Because the intervention studied (1) is FDA approved and used according 
to its FDA approval as a part of routine care, (2) is an inter vention the patients would 
arbitrarily  be exposed to even if not participating in the study, and (3) is an 
equivalent option from the perspective of the clinical provider (otherwise patient is excluded), we feel the waiver of consent involves no more than minimal risk.  
Additionally, obtaining informed consent in the study would be impractical.  
Endotracheal intubation of acutely ill patients is frequently a time -sensitive 
procedure.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_249669] a formal informed consent document for the 
procedure itself, time allows discussion of risks and benefits in less than 10% of 
airway management events in the ICU.  
Because the study interventions represent minimal risk, would not adversely affect the welfare or privacy rights of the participant, and co nsent would be impracticable, 
we will request a waiver of informed consent.  Information regarding the study will 
be available for patients and families.  
6.5 Randomization: Computerized randomization using permuted blocks of two, four , or 
six will be conducted in order to generate a series of study assignments deliberately 
exceeding the planned enrollment number.  Study assignments will be placed in opaque randomization envelopes and will be available to operators in the ICU at VUMC.  Study gr oup assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and

Study Title: Adhesive Versus Endotracheal Tube Fastener  
Institution: Vanderbilt University Medical Center   Version Date: 3/21/2018  
operators until after the decision has been made to enroll the patient in the study.  
Once it has been determined by [CONTACT_815254], (or 
maintenance of endotracheal tube securement  in patients intubated less than 12 
hours prior to admission) the operator will open the envelope and follow the assignment of either adhesive tape or endotracheal tube fastener.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1128806] will secure the endotracheal tube with the Hollister endotracheal  tube fastener per the 
manufacturer ’s instructions (demonstrated in figure 2).    
7.1.2 Endotracheal Tube Repositioning  
Prior studies investigating endotracheal tube securement techniques require that the endotracheal tube is repositioned and retaped every 24 hours (1,2). However, due to the pragmatic design and intent of this 
protocol, the endotracheal tube will  not routinely be repositioned 
specifically as part of the study protocol . The tube will be  repositioned as 
needed according to ICU policy or protocols or at the discretion of the 
provider, bedside nurse, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489].  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1128807].  
Baseline: Age, gender, height, weight, race, active medical problems  at the time of intubation, 
active comorbidities complicating intubation, indication for intubation, whether it is a reintubation, whether the face was soiled during the intubation   
 Periprocedural: Depth of tube as measured at lip line and position in mouth (ie 22 cm at the lip, 
midline) at time of securement  
In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77176]: days on mechanical ventilator,  ICU mortality , mortality for ventilator

dislodgement of the endotracheal tube (i.e. accidental extubation) or needing to reposition the 
endotra cheal tube more than 1 cm (i.e. need to pull ETT back 2+ cm or move it down 2+ cm).  
 
The following study endpoints will be collected if they occur anytime between randomization and the earlier of death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], tracheostomy placement, or 48 hours after extubation:  lip ulcers, facial skin tears, tube dislodgement, and ventilator associated pneumonia.  
 
Ventilator -free days will be collected from the time of randomization through study day 28.  In 
order to get credit for a ventilator -free day, a p atient must be both alive and free of mechanical 
ventilation.  Patients who are extubated and reintubated will only be credited with being free of 
mechanical ventilation for days after the last extubation.  Patients who die before study day 28, regardless of whether or not they ever achieved unassisted breathing, will be assigned zero 
ventilator -free days.  Patients who are still on the ventilator at study day 28 will al so receive 
zero ventilator- free days.   Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815249] 28 
free of mechanical ventilation will be assumed to remain free of mechanical ventilation through 
study day 28.  Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97011] 28 on mechanical 
ventilation will try to be followed at the dischar ge location for date of extubation –  however, if 
the date is not able to be obtained, they will be assumed to have zero ventilator free days in the analysis.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1128808] that in routine care, respi[INVESTIGATOR_815250].  At this time, there is 
no reason to believe that participation in this study would expose patients to greater medical risks or benefits than those experienced by [CONTACT_815255] a part of routine care. The greater b enefit of 
the study would be to improve  understanding of safe and effective endotracheal tube 
securement for critically ill patients.  
A potential risk to patients participating in this study involves the collection of protected health information (PHI).  In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum amoun t of PHI 
necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) only accessible by [CONTACT_473].  After publication, a de-identified database will be generated to protect particip ant privacy.

causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event therefore can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
intervention, whether or not the incident is c onsidered related to the intervention.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any unexpected and untoward medical 
occurrence that is probably or possibly related to the study and meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threateni ng (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it would have been more severe)  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
d. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
e. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
f. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect

respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], who will also be monitoring the patients continuously for adverse events 
and serious adverse events.  Serious and unexpected adverse events associated with study interventions will be recorded in a case report form in the study record and reported to the IRB within 10 business days.    
11.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the following circumstances:  
• The investi gator or medical team decides that the patient should be withdrawn 
for safety considerations.  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_815248], ACNP-BC  
Study Title: Adhesive Versus Endotracheal Tube Fastener  
Institution: Vanderbilt University Medical Center   Version Date: 3/21/2018  
• There is a significant protocol violation in the judgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded in the patient study records.  Follow-
up will be performed for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or any other 
safety parameter.  Follow -up will also be performed for all patients w ho end participation in the 
protocol for another reason, but who also have an adverse event or other safety parameter 
that could have led to discontinuation.  Follow- up will be conducted until the condition has 
resolved, until diagnosis of the adverse event or safety parameter is deemed chronic and stable, or as long as clinically appropriate.  This follow -up will be documented in the patient 
study record as well.

dropout or loss to follow -up rate.  We used PS software to calculate the sample size.  
 
12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
Analysis principles  
• Primary analysis will be conducted on an intention- to-treat basis (patients with protocol 
violations are analyzed per the assigned treatment arm).  
• All hypothesis tests will be two sided, with an α of 0.05 unless otherwise specified.  
• All analyses will be unadjusted unless otherwise specified.  
• Subgroup analyses will be performed irrespe ctive of treatment efficacy.  
 
Trial profile:  
• We will present a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram as  Figure 1 to 
detail the movement of patients through the study. This diagram will  include total 
number of patients meeting inclusion criteria, number excluded and  reason for 
exclusion, number enrolled and randomized in the study, number  followed, and number 
analyzed.

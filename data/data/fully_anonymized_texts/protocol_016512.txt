Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  3 INVESTIGATOR’S AGREE MENT  
 
I have read the ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973015] PK analyses . 
The primary analysis is percent  change from baseline in plasma oxalate (Cohort A) / pre -dialysis 
plasma oxalate (Cohort B) summarized through Month 6 by [CONTACT_32024].   Secondary endpoints will 
be analyzed and reported with by -patient listings and by -patient figures of actual values, change 
from baseline and percent change  (where change in percent is applicable)  at each visit (scheduled 
and unscheduled visits).  Tabular summaries using descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, 
median, min, max) will be reported.   Long -term treatment effect  of lumasiran will be 
summarized descriptively for the long -term extension period.  Safety data will be summarized 
descriptively and presented in by -patient listings .

Notes:  
• One month is defined as 28 days.  
• Assessments are to be performed prior to dosing, where applicable. When scheduled at the sa me time points and where feasible, the assessments of vital 
signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed before physical examinations and blood sample collections.  
• Visits and study drug dosing may be conducted offsite where applicable country and local regul ations and infrastructure allow (at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability), provided the patient has tolerated a dose of lumasiran administered in the clinic.  If a visit is conducted offsite, 
a body system assessment may be performed in lieu of a physical examination.

• The 8- and 12 -hour timepoints of the POx profile assessment will only be performed  at selected study 
centers.  
• When feasible , POx assessment should be performed after the shortest interv al between dialysis sessions, 
ie, starting on or after the second dialysis session of the week .  This applies to all patients on dialysis, 
regardless of  the number of days in treatment regimen .  The timing of POx assessments relative to dialysis 
should remain consistent throughout the study (ie, af ter the shortest interval between dialysis sessions if 
this was done during screening) .  During the first 6  months on study, the starting time for the predialysis 
POx levels (including those in POx profiles) is 24 hrs (±2 hrs) after a dialysis session on t he previous day 
or 48 hrs (±4 hrs) after previous session in patients on 3 days per week dialys is regimen.  See Section  6.1 
for information regarding  interruption of dialysis regimen during the screening period.  
• After the first 6 months, the timing of the POx assessment relative to patients’ dialysis schedule should 
continue to remain consistent for each patient, when possible .   
• Suggested sample times  are listed.  The hour (±range) indicate s sample collection timing relative to dosing 
and end of dialysis session.  Precise sample times (hour and minute) are recorded.  
• At Screening, the timepoints described above are relative to beginning and end of dialysis sessions . See

• See Section  6.4 for additional information on PK assessments.  
• If an S AE occurs associated with dosing , an additional PK sample may be collected at 4 to 8 h rs postdose 
on the day of dosing, where blood volume permits (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  31 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Overview  
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_439080].  PH1 is caused by 
[CONTACT_714503] -glyoxylate aminotransferase ( AGXT ) gene, which encodes the liver 
peroxisomal enzyme alanine -glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT).  As a consequence of AGT 
deficiency, glyoxylate accumulates and is oxidized to oxalate  in the hepatocyte and ultimately 
transported to the kidneys for excretion.  Oxalate, in the form of its calcium salt, is excreted 
almost entirely by [CONTACT_10521].  Due to its insolubility, calcium oxalate can crystallize readily in 
the urinary tract.  In PH 1, excess urinary oxalate results in recurrent nephrolithiasis and/or 
nephrocalcinosis, which can lead to pain, infections, progressive kidney disease and failure, 
along with reduced quality of life. [Cochat 2013 ]  As renal function declines, elimination of 
oxalate is further reduced, such that calcium oxalate accumulates in bone, vasculature, skin, 
retina, heart, and nervous system, resulting in severe end -organ damage. [Cochat 2013 ]  This 
devastating condition, systemic oxalosis, arises when the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) has declined to below 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.[Cochat 2013 ]  Without treatment, the 
disease progresses inexorably, and death from end -stage renal disease (ESRD) and/or 
complications of oxalosis is inevitable. [Cochat 2013 ; Harambat 2010 ; van der Hoeven 2012 ] 
Over [ADDRESS_973047] been described. [William s 2009 ]  While there are broad 
genotype –phenotype associations with the underlying causative defect, patients can present with 
very different symptoms, disease course, including timing of an individual’s eGFR decline, and 
treatment response. [Danpure 2014 ; Hoppe 1997 ]  Patients progress at various rates and an event 
that leads to acute or chronic worsening, such as an obstructive kidney stone or epi[INVESTIGATOR_439069], can occur at any time.  
The incidence of PH1 is approximately 1 in 120,000 live births, and the prevalence is 1 to 3 per 
million in North America and Europe. [Cochat 2013 ; Hopp 2015 ; Hoppe 2010 ]  The disease is 
more prevalent in areas where consanguineous marriage s are common, especially in the Middle 
East and Northern Africa. [Al-Eisa 2004 ; Boualla 2015 ; Frishberg 2005 ; Kamoun 1996 ] 
PH1 often presents as a pediatric disease, and many patients remain undia gnosed for years after 
the initial clinical manifestations of the disease. [Lieske 2005 ; Mandrile 2014 ; van Woerden 
2003 ]  A recently published analysis of [ADDRESS_973048] symptoms at 5.2 years 
of age and a cumulative renal survival of 76%, 43%, and 12% at 20 years, 40  years, and 60  years 
of age, respectively. [Hopp 2015 ]  Similarly, an analysis of 526 patients with PH1 published by 
[CONTACT_439082] a median age of disease symptom onset of 3.9 years and a 
median age of diagnosis of 8 .1 years; disease presented in infancy in 29% of patients, 40% of 
whom had ESRD. [Mandrile 2014 ]  Overall, 43% of all pati ents diagnosed with PH1 had already 
progressed to ESRD at the time of diagnosis.   
There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_714487]1 and the current standard of care is 
burdensome to patients and their families.  Disease management is based on suppo rtive 
measures, including high fluid intake and crystallization inhibitors to increase urinary oxalate 
solubility, and treatment of disease complications such as urinary tract stones and infections in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973049].  Pyridoxine can normal ize hepatic oxalate production (and 
consequently urinary oxalate ) in a small subset (~5%) of patients .[Hoppe 2010 ]  Dietary 
modification plays a minor role in treatment since endogenous oxalate production far exceeds 
dietary intake in patients with PH1.  Patients progressing to, or presenting with  ESRD, require 
intense dialysis replacement therapy.  Dialysis is not viewed as an effective therapy for PH1, but 
rather serves as a step in the clinical course toward a liver -kidney transplant or as an alternative 
to no therapy at all.  Dialysis is often inadequate to effectively offload accumulating oxalate, and 
systemic oxalosis with end organ damage may develop despi[INVESTIGATOR_439070].  
Dialysis regimens for PH1 are typi[INVESTIGATOR_714488], predisposing 
to increased risk of complications.  Combined liver -kidney transplantation offers potentially 
curative therapy, but is limited due to restricted availability, complications associated with the 
procedure, ethical considerations in resource -poor settings [Cochat 2013 ], and intense use of 
health care resources.  
PH1, over time, develops into a serious, severely debilitating disease with significant morbidity 
and mortality which have a profoundly negative impact on quality of life.   In renally impaired 
patients, plasma oxalate saturation and persistent deposition across multiple organs leads to 
systemic o xalosis manifestations.  Given the clinical course and characteristics  of PH1 disease 
progression, it is reasonable to expect that decreases in hepatic oxalate production may result in 
clinical benefit in PH1 patients with advanced renal disease.  Limited and burdensome 
management options for PH1 outlined above highlight the serious unmet need for a safe and 
efficacious treatment for all patients with this devastating disease, regardless  of renal function . 
1.2. Lumasiran  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponso r) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_439071] (ALN -GO1), an 
investigational agent comprised of a synthetic, small interfering RNA (siRNA) (drug substance 
ALN -[ZIP_CODE]) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, 
designed to target liver hydroxyaci d oxidase 1 ( HAO1)  mRNA, blocking production of glycolate 
oxidase (GO) and hence reducing hepatic oxalate production, which is the underlying cause of 
the morbidity and mortality associated with PH1.  
Lumasiran is currently in development for treatment of PH1 in infants, pediatric, and adult 
patients.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of lumasiran is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.2.1.  Summary of Nonclinical Data with Lumasiran  
The pharmacology, safety pharmaco logy, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
toxicology of lumasiran were evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies.  
Lumasiran was pharmacologically active in all tested species.  Subcutaneous (SC) administration 
of lumasira n demonstrated potent, dose -dependent pharmacologic activity resulting in reduced 
hepatic HAO1  mRNA levels with the expected increases in glycolate levels in wild -type and 
diseased animals and subsequent reductions in urinary oxalate in diseased animals.

Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  33 Genetic toxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation, human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberrations, and rat bone marrow micronucleus) assays were all negative at 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S2 (R1) limit doses.  
The nonclinic al toxicology program for lumasiran includes a repeat -dose exploratory toxicology 
study in rats, and a series of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies, which include 
developmental and reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_714489] s, and 
repeat -dose studies of up to [ADDRESS_973050] similar ASGPR 
mRNA and protein levels as adults, indicating that siRNA uptake into the liver will not be 
influenced by [CONTACT_654].  
In addition, the PK and PD evaluations of lumasiran and two additional siRNAs in subtotal 
nephrectomy model in rats, where 5/6th of the kidney s was removed to mimic severe renal 
impairment, showed no meaningful differences in plasma  or liver PK, and  no differe nces in  PD 
in rats with and without nephrectomy.    
The results of these nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrate a favorable safety profile for 
lumasiran and supports the use of lumasiran in the planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_714490] (as 
young as full-term neonates) and adult patients with PH1.  
A summary of nonclinical studies is included in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.2.2.  Summary of Clinical Data with Lumasiran  
Lumasiran is being investigated in [ADDRESS_973051] -GO1 -001 is a Phase 1/2 study, and was completed  in 2 parts (single -ascending dose [SAD; 
Part A] and multiple -ascending dose [MAD; Part B]), in healthy adult subjects and adult and 
pediatric patients (≥ 6 years old) with PH1.  In this study, heal thy adult subjects in Part A were 
randomized to receive a single -blind dose of lumasiran (0.3 -6.0 mg/kg) or placebo (6:2).  In Part 
B, patients ≥6 years of age with PH1 and preserved renal function (eGFR  >45 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
were randomized 3:1 to receive s ingle -blind doses of lumasiran or placebo at 1.0  mg/kg monthly 
for 3  doses, 3.0 mg/kg monthly for 3  doses, or 3.0 mg/kg every -3-months for [ADDRESS_973052] -GO1 -001 demonstrate a mean maximal reduction in 
24-hour urinary oxalate of 64% (Cohorts 1 to 3) and achievement of normal to near -normal 
levels of urinary oxalate (<0.7 mmol/24h/1.73 m2) in patients dosed with lumasiran (range: 0.29 
to 0.67 mmol/24h/1.73 m2).  This suppression of urinary oxalate was maintained with repeat 
dosing, indicative of the durability of the pharmacodynamic effect of lumasiran.   In addition, in 
the multiple -ascending dose group (Part B ; n=10), preliminary data showed a mean reduction of 
59% in plasma oxalate relative to baseline  [ADDRESS_973053] dose .  The mean maximal 
reduction in plasma oxalate was 75% (range 57 -94%), and 50% of patients achieved plasma 
oxalate levels within the no rmal range (<1.6 μmol/L).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973054] -GO1 -002 clinical studi es, available data indicate that lumasiran 
has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile across all dosing regimens  with no drug -related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) or study discontinuations attributed to drug administration.   
Additional detailed in formation on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of 
lumasiran is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
Elevated oxalate is the direct cause of disease pathology (kidney stones, renal failure, and 
systemic oxalosis) in patients with PH1 , and can be evaluated as plasma oxalate level , plasma 
oxalate AUC  between dialysis sessions , urinary excretion of oxalate , and measures of systemic 
oxalosis .  As discussed in Section  1.2.2 , meaningful reductions in  urinary  oxalate excretion were 
seen in the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_973055] -GO1 -001.  In addition to reducing urinary oxalate, l umasiran is 
expected to significantly lower plasm a oxalate levels in patients with renal impairment based on 
the observed decrease in plasma oxalate levels in clinical studies of patients with preserved renal 
function.  PH1 patients with advanced renal disease (eGFR ≤45  mL/min/1.73  m2), who have 
severe u nmet medical need, are also expected to meaningfully benefit from decreased hepatic 
oxalate production , regardless of whether or not on dialysis therapy .  The majority of PH1 
patients in the [LOCATION_002] present in early childhood and many progress to ren al failure by 
[CONTACT_428850].  Up to 26% of PH1 patients present with severe infantile disease and can 
develop end stage renal disease (ESRD) as early as 4  to 6 months of age. [Harambat 2010 ; Hopp 
2015 ]  Therefore, it is justified to study the effect of lumasiran in a PH1 population with 
advanced renal disease , ranging from full term infants to adults .   
The weight -based dosing regimen of this study, for PH1 patients with advanced renal disease, is 
similar to those being studied (studies ALN -GO1 -003, ALN -GO1 -004) in PH1 patients of the 
same age range as this study, with less advanced renal disease and is described in Section  5.2.2 .  
Preclinical and clinical data indicate renal impairment does not influence the systemic exposure , 
PD, or safety of siRNA compounds (see Section  1.4). 
This study will evaluate PH1 patients with advanced renal disease in separate cohorts to account 
for differences in patients who do not yet require dialysis (Cohort A) vs patients who are 
currently on a dialysis maintenance regimen (Cohort B).  The objectives and endpoints reflect 
the differences in clinical management between cohorts during both the Primary Analysis Period 
(Baseline to 6 months) and the Long -term Ext ension Period (Month 6 to End of Study; 
54 months total).  The primary objective of plasma oxalate reduction applies to both cohorts.  
Also, the following can be measured regardless of dialysis dependence status and objectives are 
the same for both cohorts :  evaluation of growth parameters  and developmental milestones (in 
children <6 years of age), quality of life, caregiver resource use, patient/caregiver experiences on 
lumasiran , antidrug antibodies  (ADA),  and additional PD parameters of plasma and urinary 
glycolate.  In addition, to further evaluate the effect of lumasiran on disease progression, 
measures of systemic oxalosis will be assessed across  multiple organ systems , ie, cardiac, 
dermatologic, skelet al, and ocular .

Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  35 Multiple samples will be collected for evaluation of plasma oxalate level (in both cohorts) and 
2 separate plasma oxalate profile assessments (in Cohort B only, to calculate AUC  between 
dialysis sessions ) will be performed during Screening to establish robust baseline measurements 
of the primary and secondary endpoints.  The primary endpoint is an objective  laboratory 
assessment and not subject to bias.  D ue to the combination of patient heterogeneity of a 
population spanning full term infan ts to adults, heterogeneity of disease characteristics in the 
broad age range, and the ultra-rare orphan population, a  single -arm design is employed for this 
study.  
Lumasiran is currently being investigated in [ADDRESS_973056] to oxalate excretion by [CONTACT_8212] .  In this study, lumasiran will be evaluated in 
PH1 patients of all ages with advanced renal disease, including patients on dialysis.  Enrolling 
infants and young pediatric patients in this study is acceptable given that lumasiran has been well 
tolerated in children ≥[ADDRESS_973057] is a minor elimination route for 
lumasiran, consistent with the renal excretion properties of 5 other siRNAs  with similar 
physiochemical properties, as detailed below.  Hence it is considered that the weight -based dose 
regimen should be  the same regardless of degree of renal function . 
A preclinical rat model of renal impairment using lumasiran and 2 additional GalNac conjugated 
siRNAs showed that renal impairment does not influence the systemic exposure  of siRNA , liver 
PK, or PD (Table  8).  The  preclinical study  used nephrectomized (subtotal nephrectomy) rats, 
where 5/6th of the kidney s was removed to mimic severe renal impairment.  Urinary excretion of 
siRNAs was reduced to approximately 1% in rats with nephrectomy relative to the 5% renal 
excretion seen in rats without nephrectomy.  However, no meaningful differences were observed 
in the plasma concentrations, liver PK, and PD of the siRNAs in rats with and without subtotal 
nephrectomy .  Thus, the preclinical study results infer that renal excretion plays a minor role in 
the disposition of siRNA molecules and that moderate to severe ren al impairment does not 
influence the liver concentration and activity of these molecules.

The contribution of renal excretion to total plasma  clearance of lumasiran  in humans  is low 
(<25%) .  This  is similar to the renal excretion profiles of other GalNAc conjugated siRNA 
molecules.  The low urinary recovery is attributable to the short plasma circulation time (about 
24 hours) for these GalNAc conjugated molecules, including lumasiran.  The GalNAc on 
lumasiran binds to abundantly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptors on hepatocytes leading to 
highly efficient and rapid uptake of lumasiran from the plasma into hepatocytes.  Consequently, 
plasma concentrations decline rapi[INVESTIGATOR_714491] t of quantitation within 24 to 48 
hours postdose.  
In addition, a dedicated renal impairment study of a similar GalNAc conjugated siRNA molecule 
showed that urinary drug excretion accounted for 13.3%, 13.7%, 6.68%, and 3.16 % of that 
administered study drug  in subjects with normal renal function and those with mild, moderate, 
and severe renal function, respectively .  The urine PK data in renal impairment subjects show a 
small reduction in the already low urinary excretion of siRNA compounds, which suggest up  to a 
10% increase in liver exposure can be expected in subjects with severe renal impairment 
compared to those with normal renal function.  This indicates that the influence of renal 
impairment on liver exposures is minimal; hence no major difference in p harmacodynamics is 
expected in renal impairment patients.    
Weight -based Dose Regimen  
Lumasiran liver concentration is the sole driver of the pharmacodynamic properties of lumasiran, 
therefore, change in body weight and liver size particularly during infan cy and early childhood 
(<6 years of age) were considerations that went into dose regimen selection.  
The weight -based dosing regimen for this study was informed by [CONTACT_714504] ( Section  1.2), preclinical data of similar GalNAc conjugated siRNAs, and results of 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  37 PK/PD modeling and simulation which considered differences in body weight, liver growth, and 
metabolic rates.   
Data from Study  ALN -GO1 -001 Parts A and B in healthy subjects and PH1 patients and 
associated PK/PD  modeling  were  used to support  dose selection in adults and children ≥20 kg 
body weight .  The urinary oxalate reductions observed in PH1 patients serve as an indicator of 
suppression of hepatic oxalate production.  P opulation PK/PD modeling demonstrated dose 
dependent oxalate reductions over the dose range (1.0 to 6.0 mg/kg continuous once monthly or 
once every 3  months SC administrations), with diminishing add itional effect predicted with 
higher doses consistent with an asymptotic rather than linear dose-response relationship.  For a 
given dose level, the PK/PD model indicated that monthly administration leads to a more rapid 
decline in urinary oxalate levels r elative to dosing every 3 months.  Thus, a lumasiran dosing 
regimen of 3.0 mg/kg once monthly for 3 loading doses total followed by 3.0  mg/kg once every 
3 months was selected for PH1 patients ≥[ADDRESS_973058] year of life incr easing from a median weight of 3.5 kg at birth to about 
10 kg at 1 year of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Growth Chart 
[Kuczmarski 2002 ]).  Subsequently, the annual rate of body weight gain decr eases to about 20% 
per year up to [ADDRESS_973059] proportionally larger liver size 
relative to body weight compared to adults. [CDC 2018 ; Johnson 2005 ]  For an individual in the 
0 to 1 year, 1 to 6 years, and 6 years of age categories, the mean liver weight as a percentage of 
body weight were 3.5%, 2.9%, and 2.0%, res pectively, indicating that younger children are 
expected to have lower hepatocyte drug concentrations at a given dose level.  Moreover, based 
on allometric principles, children have faster drug clearance and drug clearance decreases with 
increasing weight.   Thus, considering the rapid growth rate, higher relative liver size, and faster 
drug clearance, children require a higher mg/kg dose to achieve similar systemic concentration 
and target suppression.  It should be noted that although the mg/kg dose is hig her in younger 
patients, the absolute amount (mg) of lumasiran administered is small due to the lower body 
weight in these younger patients.  
Body weight categories for dose selection in this study were determined using CDC growth chart 
data.  Based on PK/P D modeling and simulation, for children with body weight <10 kg, the 
regimen is 6.0 mg/kg monthly × 3 doses (loading) followed by 3.0 mg/kg monthly 
(maintenance).  For children and adults with body weight ≥[ADDRESS_973060] 3 months, followed by a quarterly 
maintenance regimen thereafter , as described in Table  9, which also shows the predicted 
glycolate oxidase suppression per body weight category . 
At steady state, these dose regimens are expected to achieve approximately 90% target 
suppression and reduce hepatic oxalate production to normal or near normal levels .  Because 
renal function is a minor pathway for the elimination of lumasiran, the lumasiran dosing regimen 
in patients with advanced renal impairment will be the same as in patients with normal renal 
function.

The physicochemical properties of lumasiran and the available preclinical, clinical, PK, PD, and 
safety data indicate renal impairment is not expected to influence the systemic exposure, PD, 
safety, or efficacy properties of lumasiran.  Based on these findings the Sponsor has determined 
that no dose adjustment is required in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, and the 
weight -based regimen described in this study is therefore appropriate for patients of all ages with 
advanced renal disease . 
1.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
PH1 is a rar e autosomal recessive disease characterized by [CONTACT_439084], 
progressing to end -stage renal disease.  Systemic accumulation of calcium oxalate results in 
severe end -organ damage.  Without treatment, the disease progresses, and patients die from end -
stage renal disease and/or complications of systemic oxalosis.  
Lumasiran is designed to reduce hepatic production of oxalate.  Based on the available data from 
nonclinical studies and the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_973061] -GO1 -001, lumasiran, administered 
subcutaneously, demonstrated a potent, dose -dependent inhibition of glycolate oxidase resulting 
in decreased urinary oxalate and increased plasma and urinar y glycolate.  Unlike oxalate, 
glycolate is highly soluble and readily excreted in the urine.  Thus, by [CONTACT_714505], lumasiran is expected to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of PH1 and alter the clinical 
course in patients across th e spectrum of disease, irrespective of age, disease stage, and status of 
dialysis dependence.  
Based on the available safety data from the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_973062] adverse events (AEs ) have been mild or moderate 
in severity.  There have been no severe or serious adverse events related to study drug.  
Transient, mild injection site reactions (ISRs) have been observed but have not resulted in any 
treatment discontinuations.  No clinicall y significant laboratory or hematologic changes have 
been observed.  
Given the biological target of lumasiran , the available nonclinical and clinical data, and mode of 
administration, important potential risks for lumasiran are injection site reactions and liver 
function test abnormalities.  During the study, patients will be closely monitored, including 
evaluation of injection sites, laboratory monitoring for liver function test abnormalities, along

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol 
procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, 
without penalty to their continuing medical care.  The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue stud y drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  Any discontinuation of treatment or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_439073]’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the elec tronic case report 
form (eCRF) and should be followed up by [CONTACT_737].  
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section 4.3.1 , 
while the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2 . 
4.3.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug or  Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug may include any of the following:  
• Significant violation of the protocol

Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  46 • AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Other reason (non -AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by [CONTACT_714508], the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient.  Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting and follow -up of pregnancy).  A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to 
discontinuing the stud y drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as 
described in Section  6.5.[ADDRESS_973073] be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who discontinue study drug 
and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their 
disease per Invest igator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6 -month primary analysis period (defined 
as the time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the 
Month 6 assessments) will be enc ouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments 
(including 24 -hour urine collections, but excluding PK assessments) through Month 6 (see 
Table  1).  They will also be asked to complete safety follow -up visits, once every 3 months, per 
the safety follow -up schedule (see Table  3 or Table  4) for up to [ADDRESS_973074] dose of 
lumasiran.  
Patients who discontinue study drug after Month 6 will be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit to complete early termination (ET) assessments and complete safety follow -up 
visits, once every 3 months, per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table  3 or Table  4) for up to 
[ADDRESS_973075] dose of lumasiran.  
4.3.2.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time.  A patient or 
legal guardian considering stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] p articipation in the study prior to the Month 6 visit should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month [ADDRESS_973076] early the assessments scheduled to be performed 
at the Month 6 visit (see  Table  1). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973077] and process his/her data (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), as applicable, patient data up to the withdrawal of  consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study.  In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as 
appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where a vailable and allowable by [CONTACT_1769].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by [CONTACT_1769], the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required.  The Sponsor will continue to 
keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of 
the patient’s biological samp les until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law.  The 
process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per 
local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study  
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue stud y assessments and follow -up through 
Month  6 even if study drug is discontinued.  
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recording Reason for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Patient’s Study Participation  
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be mad e to 
complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient’s study participation 
is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described  in 
Section  6.5.[ADDRESS_973078] be taken if a patient  misses  a required study visit:  
• The s ite must attempt to contact [CONTACT_714509] [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue 
in the study.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  48 • Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_714510] 3 telephon e calls 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods.  These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s 
medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreach able, the patient will be 
considered to have stopped participation in the study.  
• For patients who are lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee should  search 
publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) to ascertain 
survival status.  This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as 
possible.  
4.3.4.  Replacement of Study Patients  
Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study prior to Month 6 may 
be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  Patients who crossover from Cohort A to Cohort B due 
to progressing to dialysis prior to Month 6 also may be replaced  at the Sponsor’s discretion .  
Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after Month [ADDRESS_973079] clinical laboratory assessments 
(see Table  13) from the Week [ADDRESS_973080] be reviewed prior to administration of the Month 1 
dose, as specified in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table  1).  The LFT criteria for withholding,  
monitoring, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_714492]  [IP_ADDRESS] .  Patients will receive 3 loading 
doses, once monthly (at Day 1, Month 1, and Month 2) at a dose based on body weight category.  
At Month 3 and beyond, patients will receive lumasiran either monthly (patients weighing 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973081] dialysis weight t aken at the dialysis 
center may be used.  
Patients with weight increases crossing the threshold for the next weight -based dosing category 
(<10 kg to ≥10 kg or <20 kg to ≥20 kg) will follow the new dosing regimen for the remainder of 
the study or until the n ext dosing category threshold is reached (ie, patients will not switch back 
to the lower -weight dosing schedule if their body weight subsequently decreases).  
Patients in maintenance dosing who transition from <10 kg to ≥10 kg will continue to receive 
month ly doses at 3.0 mg/kg until the next visit that coincides with Table  4, whereby [CONTACT_714511] -3-months dosing as per  Table  [ADDRESS_973082] the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered.  
If a patient misses multiple consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor, will discuss whether the p atient will be able to continue the study (see Section  4.3). 
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.   In addition, instructions and 
procedures related to the administration of lumasiran by a patient or caregiver will be provided in 
the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions.  
5.2.3.  Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications are not permitted.  
If a study drug -related AE occurs in  a patient that the Investigator judges as presenting a 
potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the study drug dose may be held at the discretion 
of the Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Liver Function Test Criteria for Wi thholding, Monitoring and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_714486]  
1. Liver function test (LFT) results (see Table  13) are to be obtained within 7  days prior to 
dosing  and results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of lumasiran.  During periods of 
time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study 
site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes and  LFT assessments are not 
feasible within [ADDRESS_973083] based on patient weight.  Central  laboratory 
results are preferable.  If not available, local laboratory results may be used; however, if a 
local assessment is drawn, a serum chemistry sample mus t also be drawn for analysis at 
the central laboratory . 
2. For any ALT or AST elevation >3 × ULN, central laboratory results should be used to 
guide subsequent monitoring as detailed in Table  11. 
3. For any ALT or AST elevation >3× ULN:  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973084] elevation >3× ULN without alternative cause  that is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_144696] (eg, nausea, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, jaundice) or elevated bilirubin to ≥2× ULN or international normalized 
ratio (INR) ≥1.5, permanently discontinue dosing.  
5. For confirmed ALT or AST elevations >3× ULN without alternative cause  and not 
accompanied by [CONTACT_439092] ≥2× ULN or INR ≥1.5, see Table  11. 
Table  11: Monitoring and Dosing Rules for Asymptomatic Patients with Confirmed 
Isolated Elevations of ALT and/or AST >3× ULN, with No Alternative Cause

• Coagulation (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, 
international normali zed ratio)  
• Monitor at least every two weeks : LFT per Table  13 
• If elevation persists for ≥[ADDRESS_973085] discuss with the Medical Monitor 
before continuing dosing  
>5× to 8× ULN  • Hold lumasiran dosing until recovery to ≤1.5× ULN or baseline; may 
resume do sing after discussion with the Medical Monitor  
• Evaluate the initial elevation in LFT per the following assessments:  
• Table  14 (all assessments to be perf ormed once)  
• Hematology, serum chemistry, and LFT per Table  13 
• Coagulation (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, 
international normalized ratio)  
• Monitor at least weekly:  LFT per Table  13 until ALT and/or AST is 
declining on 2 consecutive draws, then may decrease monitoring to 
biweekly  
• If ALT or AST rises to >5× ULN following resumption of dosing, 
permanently discontinue dosin g

5.4. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified by [CONTACT_464].  
5.5. Other Requirements  
5.5.1.  Contraception  
Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective  method of 
contraception from [ADDRESS_973089] dose administration or until study completion.  Pediatric/adolescent female patients 
must initiate one of the birth control methods below, w hich includes true abstinence, at menarche 
or must discontinue study drug.  
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include:   
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal o cclusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient).  
• Established use of oral (except low -dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or 
transdermal hormonal methods of contraception.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  54 • True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above -mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and f or up to [ADDRESS_973090] experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]).  A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by [CONTACT_144705].  
For male patients, no contraception is required.  However, use by [CONTACT_714514] (condom) may be required in some countries, eg, [LOCATION_009], in order to comply with 
local requirements as described in the corresponding patient informed consent forms.  Males 
with partners of child -bearing potential must agree t o use a condom throughout study 
participation and for [ADDRESS_973091] dose of study drug or until study completion . 
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_144707].  The Investigator will ensure that adolescent 
patients, and their legal representatives if applicable, are adequately inf ormed about 
contraceptive requirements and the need for contraception once a patient initiates heterosexual 
intercourse.  The need for contraception and compliance with contraception requirements will be 
assessed at every visit for adolescent patients, and  pregnancy testing will be performed before 
every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).   
5.5.2.  Dietary  Restrictions  
Patients should refrain from consumption of foods with high oxalate content, including, but not 
limited to, chocolate, rhubarb, spi[INVESTIGATOR_87957], and beet root, for 1 week prior to assessments of urinary 
and plasma oxalate . 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4.  
Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study 
Manual.  
Urine collection assessments are not required for  patients who are  anuric (ie, produce <100 ml 
per day ). 
Where applicable country and loca l regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, 
home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site  to perform study 
assessments , which  may include collection of blood and urine sample s, measure ment of  vital

and preparation and administration of  study drug (at the discretion of the Investigator).  
6.1. Screening Assessments  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor before screening pa tients to allow an assessment of the 
ability of the site or any new trial participant to comply with the protocol given COVID -19 
limitations.  
An informed consent form (ICF) or assent form in the case of patients under the age of legal 
consent that has been  approved by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) must be signed by [CONTACT_102] (or legal guardian if under the age of legal 
consent) before the Screening procedures are initiated.  All patients (or their lega l guardians if 
under the age of legal consent) will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and/or assent 
form.  In the case when a patient reaches the legal age of consent during the study, the 
Investigator must obtain the patient’s informed consent , and assent if applicable,  prior to 
performing any further study interventions and/or procedures involving that patient (see 
Section  8.1.1 ).  
Patients  will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria (see Section  4.1 and Section  4.2).  Rescreening of patients is permitted with 
consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2 ). 
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained.  Non -serious 
events occurring after signing of the ICF and prior to study drug administration will be captured  
as medical history.  Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment 
and Day [ADDRESS_973092] documented PH1 genetic analysis to confirm eligibility.  
For all patients who are not anuric, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected 
during screening to establish baseline.  Also, in patients who are able to produce urine, 24 -hour 
collections will be performed during Screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate levels 
(Section  6.1.2 ). 
The timing of samples collected durin g Screening for plasma oxalate  and plasma glycolate will 
be as shown in Figure  1. 
The three most recent screening plasma oxalate samples collected prior to Day 1, which may 
include the pre -dialysis sample from the plasma oxalate profile collection for Cohort B patients, 
will be used to assess eligibility.  If all 3 plasma oxalate assessments are obtained >60  days prior 
to Day 1, one additional plasma oxalate will be performed (at least 7 days prior to Day 1).  
For subjects in Cohort B, there must be [ADDRESS_973093] 1 week apart.  
If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of con sent is interrupted during screening for 
≤[ADDRESS_973094] 2 weeks.  If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is

6.2. Efficacy Assessments  
The efficacy of lumas iran will be assessed in all patients in bo th cohorts by [CONTACT_714515] ; and plasma oxalate profile assessment  in Cohort B only  (Section  6.2.1 ); 
urinary oxalate (in non -anuric patients, Section  6.2.2 ), and measures of systemic oxalosis 
(Section  6.2.3 ).   
In Cohort A patients, all blood and urine samples will be collected predose, when applicable.  In 
Cohort B patients with a dialysis session  on the day of dosing, samples will be collected prior to 
the dialysis session.  
The efficacy of lumasiran on renal function will be assessed by [CONTACT_67889]  (Section  6.3.4 ). 
Change in the frequency and mode of dialysis will be assessed  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
In both cohorts, change in levels of urinary and plasma  glycolate will be assessed.  
6.2.1.  Plasma Oxalate  
Plasma oxalate levels will be assessed from blood samples collected in all patients ; levels will be 
measured via central laboratory using a validated assay.   The collection timing during Screening 
is detailed by [CONTACT_714516]  1.  During the treatment period, s amples will be collected as 
specified in  the Schedules of Assessments (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4) and i n

28 days will be collected  to assess eligibility .  Up to 2  of the blood samples may originate  from  
the pre -dialysis  samples collected at the beginning of  the plasma oxalate profile  assessments 
performed during Screening  (described below) .  See Figure  1.   
Plasma Oxalate Profile  
Plasma oxalate profiles will be performed as specified in the Schedules of Assessments  to permit 
calculation of the AUC between dialysis sessions .  The plasma oxalate profile assessment 
consists of an overnight visit requiring collection of up to [ADDRESS_973096] -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  58 facilities ; blood sample collection schedule  is described  in Table  6, which includes collections 
before, during, and after the dialysis session.  During Screening, t here will be [ADDRESS_973097] 7 days apart .  See Figure  1. 
During Screening, the blood sample timepoints described in Table  6 are relative to when d ialysis 
is performed.  During the treatment period, the timepoints described in Table  6 are relative to 
dialysis or when the dose is administered , as specified .  The 24 -hour postdose sample will be 
collected prior to beginning the next hemodialysis session, or 24 hours (±3 hours) postdose if 
there is no hemodialysis session on the day following dosing.  
In patients with ≥ 1 systemic oxalosis  manifestation  during the study, additional plasma oxalate 
profile assessments will be performed at the Month 36 and Month 48 visits , and blood sample 
collection timepoints are the same as described above . 
6.2.2.  Urinary Oxalate  
In patients in both Cohort A and Cohort B who ar e not anuric (ie, patients who are able to 
continue to produce urine ≥100 ml per day) and are able to complete the collection procedure, 
24-hour urinary oxalate excretion will be assessed.  Since not all patients will be able to provide 
24-hour urine sampl es, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected throughout the 
study in all patients who are not anuric.  Table  12 shows the 24 -hour uri ne collection procedure 
by [CONTACT_15449].  
In patients who are able to comply with 24 -hour urine collection procedures, urinary oxalate 
excretion will be determined from 24 -hour urine sample collections to be completed at the time 
points specified in the Sche dules of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  
Urinary oxalate concentrations will be analyzed centrally using a validated assay.  [ADDRESS_973098] meet pre -specified validity criteria (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).   
For patients who are able to comply with the 24 -hour urine collection procedure, three 24 -hour 
urine collections will be sc heduled during screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate 
excretion.  For Month  6, three 24 -hour urine collections will be scheduled within 14 days prior to 
dose to evaluate changes in oxalate concentrations over the 6 -month interval.  A single 24 -hour 
collection will be scheduled at Month 3, Month 12 , and then every 6 months thereafter  as 
specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  In 
patients undergoing dialysis, the timing of the collections relative to patients’ weekly dialysis 
schedule should remain consistent for each patient, when possib le. 
Patients able to comply with [ADDRESS_973099] 3 single -void urine samples collected during Screening 
(first morning voids are preferred, when feasible).  Following screening, single -void collections 
are performed within 7 days predose, as specified in the Schedules o f Assessment (see Table  1, 
Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  Samples may be collected as an outpatient prior to the visit or 
collected during the study visit prior to dosing, as applicable.

Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  60 In addition to safety assessments described in Section  6.5.4 , as a measure of systemic oxalosis, 
ECGs will be monitored to identify conduction disorders if normal at baseline or change in  
conduction disorders if present at baseline.  
Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be collected using standardized machines at the timepoints 
specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and  Table  4 ).  During 
periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the 
study site,  ECG assessments may be completed up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, up 
to 5 months after the Month 6 timepoint, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint.   
12-lead ECGs will be centrally read.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dermatologic  
In cases where skin manifestation s due to systemic oxalosis are reported during the course of the 
study, (eg, patient presenting with skin lesion during physical examination) photographs of the 
lesions should be obtained.  The Investigator may engage a local  dermatologist’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_714493].  When a skin manifestation of systemic oxalosis is observed, at each succeeding visit, 
photographs of the affected area will continue to be collected to record the resolution or 
worsening of the manifestation.  Further details will be provided in th e study manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Skeletal  
Radiographs ( X-rays) of hands, hip, knee, and chest will be obtained and read centrally for 
features of skeletal oxalosis, where local IRB/IEC permits  at the timepoints specified in the 
Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and  Table  4 ), whe re feasible  based on 
patient compliance .  During periods of tim e when the COVID -[ADDRESS_973100] not yet reached skeletal maturity.  Results will 
be interpreted using a scale developed in conjunction with the central reading core laboratory, as 
detailed in the study manual.   
Optional bone scans will be performed in only Cohort B patients ≥18 years of age to assess 
calcium oxalate systemic deposition, where local IRB/EC permits and if patient consents to the 
bone scan.   During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemi c impedes the ability of patients 
to travel to the study site,  optional bone scans may be completed up to 1 month after Day 1, and 
up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ocular  
Ophthalmology  
The following ophthalmologic exams will be performed: Color Fundus Photography ( CFP), 
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and , where available at select sites , Fundus 
Autofluorescence (FAF).  
Ophthalmologic exams with fundus photography will be standardized and the fundus 
photographs will be read centrally.  OCT assessments will also be standardized and read 
centrally.  For young children unable to cooperate , examinations will be optional.  Anesthesia 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973101] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  
Where available, BCVA using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts will 
be assessed longitudinally throughout the course of the study to evaluate for changes which 
correspond to changes in retinal oxalate deposition.  Exams will be standardized across 
applicable sites.  In younger patients <[ADDRESS_973102] practice may be performed (eg, LEA symbols) .  In sites where ETDRS testing is not 
available, Snellen or LEA symbol charts may be used for BCVA.  Testin g is not required  in 
preverbal infants.  
6.3. Renal Assessments  and Additional Pharmacodynamic Measurements  
Renal assessments and additional pharmacodynamic assessments include:  nephrocalcinosis as 
assessed by [CONTACT_233526] (Section  6.3.1 ); frequency of renal stone events (Section  6.3.2 ); 
urine oxalate:creatinine ratio (in available urine collections; Section  6.3.3 ); and eGFR  
(Section  6.3.4 ).  
Glycolate concentrations may be collected at the same time as the plasma oxalate sample 
collection (Section  6.2.1 ) as specified for Screening ( Figure  1) and as per  the Schedules of 
Assessments  (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  Additional colle ctions may be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
In Cohort A patients, all samples will be collected predose, when applicable.  In Cohort B 
patients with a dialysis session on the day of dosing, samples will be collected prior to the 
dialysis  session.  
All PD assessments will be analyzed centrally.  Details regarding the processing and aliquoting 
of samples for storage and analyses will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Where local regulations allow, and infrastructure is in place, home nur sing may be used to 
collect urine and blood samples.  
6.3.1.  Renal Ultrasound  
Renal ultrasounds will be obtained locally, as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see 
Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4) when feasible ; anephric patients are exempt from renal 
ultrasound assessments .  Renal ultrasound wil l be performed according to instructions provided 
in the Study Manual in a standardized manner.  Renal ultrasounds will be reviewed centrally.    
During periods of time when the COVID -[ADDRESS_973103] one of the following:  
• Visit to healthcare provider (eg, outpatient clinic, urgent care, emergency department, 
procedure) because of a renal stone  
• Medication for r enal colic  
• Stone passage  
• Macroscopic hematuria due to a renal stone  
All relevant clinical information pertaining to the event should be obtained, including laboratory 
values, medical records, discharge summaries, and medical test results.    
Since renal sto ne events are recorded as an efficacy assessment for lumasiran, these will not be 
treated as AEs or SAEs.  However, if a patient experiences other AEs or SAEs during a renal 
stone event, they should be reported (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
6.3.3.  Urinary Oxalate:Creatinine Ratio  
Urine oxalate:creatinine ratios will be calculated from the oxalate and creatinine levels measured 
in the available [ADDRESS_973104] of lumasiran on urinary 
oxalate:creatinine ratio.  Urinary oxalate:creatinine ratios from single -void urine collections will 
also be measured.  
6.3.4.  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate  
In patients not undergoing dialysis, b lood sampl es for the assessment of eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 
will be obtained at the time points specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, 
Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).   
In patients ≥12 months to <18 years at consent,  eGFR will be calculat ed based on the Schwartz 
Bedside Formula  [Schwartz 2009 ] (Appendix  10.1).  In patients ≥18 years of age  at consent , 
eGFR will be calculated based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. 
[Levey 2009 ; Schwartz 2009 ] 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of lumasiran PK parameters and possible 
metabolite analysis (as necessary) at the time points in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, 
Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  Plasma PK parameters, maximum plasma concentration (C max), 
time to maximum plasma concentration (t max), elimination half -life (t ½β), area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distri bution 
(V/F) , will be calculated for the lumasiran plasma concentration profiles.  A detailed schedule of 
time points for the collection of blood samples for PK analysis in patients in Cohort A is 
provided in  Table  5.  In patients who are able to produce urine, a urine sample for PK analysis 
will be collected as on Day 1.  
Also, a detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for PK analysis in 
Cohort B patients is provided in  Table  6.  Plasma oxalate profile assessment during Screening 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  63 should be conducted as explained in Section  6.2.1 .  PK and plasma oxalate blood samples should 
be collected before the start of the next dialysis session.  
In patients who are not on dialysis at c onsent but start dialysis prior to Month 6 visit, PK and 
plasma oxalates blood samples should be collected  as per Table  6 at the next scheduled protocol 
assessment in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, Table  4) and then 
continue per the timepoints in Table  [ADDRESS_973105] of the study.  
In addition, if an SAE occurs associated with dosing, an additional PK sample may be collec ted 
at 4 to 8 hours postdose on the day of dosing, where blood volume limits permit (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Lumasiran plasma concentrations will be determined using a central laboratory with a validated 
assay.  Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, sample processing , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_714494].  
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, 
including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight 
and heigh t/length, ECG findings, and laboratory tests.  Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination will be recorded.  
6.5.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, 
Table  3, and Table  4) and include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862].  On dosing days, vital signs will be measured predose.  On Day 1 only, vital signs will also 
be measured 30  ± 10 minutes postdose.  When vital signs and blood sample collecti on occur at 
the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible.  
Vital signs should be measured after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes, when 
feasible.  Blood pressure should be taken using the same  limb, when feasible.  Body temperature 
in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods.  Heart rate will be 
counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_714495] a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the 
Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2.  Weight and Height/Length  
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedules of 
Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4) and will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Height/length will be measured in centimeters.  Standing height should be captured for patients 
≥24 months old who are able to stand independently.  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_714496] <24 months old or those unable to stand independently.  All height/length measurements 
should be performed in triplicate for patients <[ADDRESS_973106] -GO1 -005 lumasiran

dialysis.  In patients ≥6 years of age, body weight collected within 3  months prior to the study 
drug dose or the predose weight collected on the study visit day or d osing day will be used for 
dose calculations (see Section  5.2.2 ). 
6.5.3.  Physical Examination  
Full and abbreviated physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedules of 
Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  If a physical examination is scheduled 
for a dosing visit, it should be conducted prior to dosing.  In Cohort B patients, the physical 
examination should be conducted after dialysis is completed.  Full physical examinations will 
include the examination of the following:  general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointest inal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; 
thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status.  
Abbreviated physical  examinations will include examination of at least  the following:  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems.  
If a visit is conducted offsite (eg, at the patient’s home), a body system assessment may be 
performed in lieu of a physical examination.  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on  
the medical history or AE eCRF as appropriate.   Abnormal f indings from dermatological 
examinations will be recorded via photography (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
6.5.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be obtained predose, when applicable, as specified in the Schedules 
of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  Electrocardiograms may be 
completed up to [ADDRESS_973108] of lumasiran on 
systemic oxalosis, as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
6.5.5.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory, except in cases 
where it is not feasible to perform all tests centrally due to blood draw volume limits, ie, in 
infants and very young patients, hematology, and biochemistry panels may be performed locally, 
with central laboratory confirmation of any abnormalities.  Specific instructions for transaminase

Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  65 elevations are provided in Se ction  [IP_ADDRESS] .  For any other unexplained clinically relevant 
abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated 
and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, until it has returned 
to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the 
abnormality.  For any safety event or laboratory abnormality , additional laboratory assessments, 
imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with 
the Medical Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the clinical database.  
Clinical laboratory assessme nts are listed in Table  13 and will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedules of Assessment (see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of visit 
assessments,  all laboratory assessments specified in Table  13 which are performed at a local 
laboratory should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory except in cases where it is not 
feasible to perform all tests centrally due to blood draw v olume limits, ie, in infants and very 
young patients.  Central laboratory results (once available) should be used for subsequent clinical 
and dosing decisions in the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples 
drawn on the same day.  
Consult the Laboratory Manual for the blood draw priority list based on patient weight (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical site or at a location other than the 
clinical study center by a trained healthcare professional.

Dialysis modality evaluations will be performed in all patients in Cohort B.  To prevent potential 
confounding of study results for the primary analysis, e lective changes to dialysis regimen are 
not permitted during Screening or the 6 -month primary analysis period, ie, decreasing dialysis 
frequency in response to lowered plasma oxalate , or elective changes to dialysis frequency, 
duration, filter size or type , and blood flow .  Changes in dialysis due to management of renal 
failure (eg, electrolyte content, fluid withdrawal settings), will be performed throughout the 
study according to Investigator judgement in consultation with the patient’s treating physician . 
Dialysis parameters may include, but are not limited to, duration  and frequency.  The dialysis 
regimen will be monitored according to the Schedules of Assessments (see Table  1, Table  2, 
Table  3, and Table  4). 
6.5.6.  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
[ADDRESS_973110] a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Renal stone events (as defined in Section  6.3.2 ) are recorded for efficacy assessment of 
lumasiran.  These events will not be treated as AEs or SAEs.  Other AEs or SAEs occurring 
during a renal stone event are reported.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SA E is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not be  immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144678] (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensiv e treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973111]:  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit 
of normal (ULN)  
• Severe or serious injection site reactions (ISRs); ISRs that are associated with a recall 
phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or 
those that lea d to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of study 
drug.  
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection.  “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a 
reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma).  A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like 
lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR.  
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
AEs are to be graded according to the categories detailed below:  
Mild : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, pr eparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money).  
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life -
threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to 
an AE.  
Changes in seve rity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of a n AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
AE severity  and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).

Amendment 1, 06 May 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceut icals  Confidential  71 Relationship o f the Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_144716] a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]?”  A “ yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to 
the study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient or legal guardian should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s 
health since the last visit.  The patient or legal guardian should also be asked if the patient has 
been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant 
medication routines (both prescription and over -the-counter).  In addition to pati ent observations, 
AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination 
findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety.   
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reco rding non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
[CONTACT_714517].  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
Even ts occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured 
as medical history (see Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and 
baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by [CONTACT_439097] d consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_439098], as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable).  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the eCRF and the SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical inter est (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), the supplemental AEs 
of Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed.  Additional clinical and laboratory information 
may b e collected.  Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.   
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording ad ditional information regarding each injection site reaction that is 
entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow -up actions taken, etc ).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electron ic 
system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the 
study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Co mmittee  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported to the IRB/IEC per 
their institutional policy by [CONTACT_9304] (or Sponsor designee) according to 
country requirements.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16211]/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through study completion, the Investigator 
must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_973114] dose 
of study drug.  
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the ou tcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exc eeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol for the patient’s weight category.  The Investigator will decide whether a dose is to be 
considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor.  In the event of an o verdose, the actual 
dose administered must be recorded in the eCRF.  
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within [ADDRESS_973115] of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patient's participation in the study will be 
collected.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly spec ific targeting of investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144664].  It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect.  More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogen eous manifestations of disease in patients with PH1, as well as their 
responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and legal guardian 
consent (and patient assent, where applicable), samples will be colle cted as part of this study to 
permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that 
may further elucidate the outcomes of this study, or potentially advance understanding of the 
safety, mechanism of action, and/or ef ficacy of lumasiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedules of Assessment 
(see Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  Potential exploratory investigations may include 
DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, 
efficacy or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran  
Amendment 1, 06 May 2020

6.8.1.  EQ-5D 
The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of QOL outcome. [Herdman 2011 ]  
It consists of a questionnaire pertaining to 5 dimensions.  There is also a visual analog scale, 
scoring of which is based on a visual scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginab le health state) to 100 
(best imaginable health state).  Higher scores indicate better health status.  Patients ≥18 years of 
age at time of assessment will complete the EQ -5D adult version of the questionnaire using the 
5-level (5L) value set, and patients  ≥2 to <18 years of age at time of assessment will complete 
the youth version of this questionnaire, the EQ -5D-Y.  Legal guardians may complete 
questionnaires on behalf of younger infant to pediatric patients, as appropriate.  
6.8.2.  PedsQL  
Peds -QL is a modular a pproach to measuring QOL in healthy children and adolescents and those

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973134] -GO1  (lumasiran)  
Amendment  [ADDRESS_973135] -GO1 -005 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  1 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES D ATED 06 MAY  2020  
 
ILLUMINATE -C:  A Single Arm Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, 
and Pharmacodynamics of Lumasiran in Patients with Advanced Primary Hyperoxaluria 
Type 1 (PH1)  
1. RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to incorporate Urgent Safety Measures (USMs) that 
were communicated to investigators in a Dear Investigator Le tter dated [ADDRESS_973136] of clinical trials during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. [EMA 2020; FDA 2020 ] 
This protocol amendment also incorporates the following changes that are not related to USMs.  
After ongoing review and assessment of t he safety data from studies conducted with lumasiran, 
modifications are designed to enhance patient safety, reduce patient burden regarding blood 
sampling, and clarify a study procedure pertaining to urine collection.  These changes are 
summarized in Secti on 1.2 in Table 2 and will not be implemented until appropriate Health 
Authority and Ethics Committee ( EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.  
1.1. Urgent Safety Measures due to the Impact of the COVID -19 
Pandemic  
The USM modifications and new procedures are outlined below, and a detailed summary of the 
protocol changes is provided in Section  2 (Table  1).  These measures were to be adopted 
immediately by [CONTACT_714522] . 
• Screening period (notification of new patients)  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor before screening patients to allow an assessment 
of the ability of the site or any new trial participant to comply with the protocol given 
COVID -19 limitations.  
• Screening period and pl asma oxalate eligibility (expanded windows)  
To ensure adequate time to complete screening assessments, t he screening window will 
be expanded from 60 days to 120 days; screening assessments previously obtained within 
[ADDRESS_973137] -GO1  (lumasiran)  
Amendment  1 Summary of Changes, 06 May  2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  2 • Lumasiran dosing outside the study center  by [CONTACT_714523], d osing 
will be permitted at a location other than the study center ( eg, home) , by [CONTACT_714524]’s caregiver with the oversight of the Investigator, provided the patient has 
tolerated at least 1 dose of lumasiran administered in the clinic.   In addition, references to 
patient/caregiver instructions for administration and storage of study drug are now 
included within the protocol . This measure is intended to remain in effect only during 
periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to 
the study site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes  for dosing.   
In order to assure uniform and comprehensive training and to assure compliance with the 
dosing instructions, the sponsor has prepared both Investigator and caregiver -facing 
written materials. The caregiver materials will provide detailed guid ance on the scope of 
the self -administration allowance and detailed instructions on procedures surrounding 
dosing. These materials serve as a supplement to virtual training that caregivers will 
receive. The site -facing materials outline the investigator re sponsibilities under the self -
administration scheme and provide a guide to the expectations around caregiver training. 
In addition, investigators will make verbal contact [CONTACT_714525].  
• Study visit window  
Except for assessments with other specified timing requirements (as noted below), study 
assessments and dosing are to be performed within a visit window of ±14 days 
(previously ±7 days)  for all patients through Month 6, and for patients who weigh <10 kg 
from Month 7  through the end of study, and within a visit window of ±28 days 
(previously ±14 days)  for patients who weigh ≥[ADDRESS_973138] 21 days apart.  
• Assessment of adverse events, concomitant medications, renal stone events, and 
healthcare utilization  
In situations where a study visit is unable to be completed (either at the site or offsite by a 
healthcare profess ional visit), the study Investigator  (or delegate) may verbally contact 
[CONTACT_714526], concomitant 
medications, renal stone events, and healthcare utilization.  
• Liver function tests  
Liver functio n test (LFT) results are to be obtained within 7◦days prior to dosing and 
results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of lumasiran.  During periods of time when 
the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site and 
healthc are professionals to go to patients' homes, when LFT assessments are not feasible 
within [ADDRESS_973139] results up to 6◦weeks prior to the planned 
monthly dose or up to [ADDRESS_973140] -GO1  (lumasiran)  
Amendment  [ADDRESS_973141] been 
observed.  Based on available data, lumasiran has an acceptable hepatic safety profile.    
• Time period to obtain weight for dose determination  
If the current procedure (weight obtained within 7 days  or within 3 months  prior to 
monthly or quarterly dose, respectively ) is not possible due to the COVID -19 pandemic 
impacting activities at the study site or patient ability to access the site, dose will be 
based on weight obtained within 6 weeks prior to dosing for patients who are <10 kg and 
within 4 months for patients who are ≥[ADDRESS_973142] dialysis weight taken at the study center is not available 
within the  above specified timeframes, weight taken at  the dialysis center may be used.   
• 24-hour urine sample collection  
To avoid risks associated with use of urinary catheters and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the 
option to use catheterization for 24 -hour urine sample  collection has been removed.  
• Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Patient/Caregiver Experience and 
Impact Questionnaire  
The Vineland Behavior Scale, Quality of Life questionnaires, and Patient/Caregiver 
Experience and Impact questionnaires may be com pleted up to 4 months after the 
intended timepoint.  
• Systemic oxalosis assessments  
Broader windows will be applied for systemic oxalosis assessments:  
− 12-lead ECGs may be completed up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, 
5 months after Month 6 , and 11 m onths after Month 12   
− Renal ultrasound s may be completed up to 1  month after Day  1, 5 months after 
Month 6 , and 11 months after Month 12  
− Echocardiogram may be completed up to 5 months after Month 6, and up to 
11 months after Month 12  
− Radiographs, ophthalmo logy evaluation, and optional bone scan may be 
completed up to 1  month after Day 1 and up to 11 months after the Month 12 
timepoint  
• Plasma oxalate profile  
Plasma oxalate profile samples can be collected up to 2 months after the Month 3 
timepoint, up to 5 m onths after the Month 6 timepoint, and up to 11 months after the 
Month  12 timepoint.  
If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is interrupted during screening 
for ≤[ADDRESS_973143] -GO1  (lumasiran)  
Amendment  1 Summary of Changes, 06 May  2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  4 If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is interrupted for >[ADDRESS_973144] 4 weeks.  
If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is permanently changed during 
screening, plasma oxalate should not be collected until the new dialysis regimen has been 
established for at least 4 weeks.  Any plasma oxalate profiles and pre -dialysis  plasma 
oxalate samples collected prior to this point will not be used for the study.  A total of 
2 plasma oxalate profiles and a pre -dialysis plasma oxalate sample need to be collected 
AFTER the new stable dialysis regimen has been established for at leas t 4 weeks.  
The sampling times for plasma oxalate profile samples in protocol Table 6 are listed 
relative to dosing.   If plasma oxalate profile samples are taken on a non -dosing day, these 
times (2:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00 and 24:[ADDRESS_973145] -dose) should correspond to the end of 
dialysis.  
• Assessments required to be performed in clinic  
Where applicable country and local re gulations and infrastructure allow for home 
healthcare, healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to 
perform study assessments including blood and urine collection, vital signs, weight, 
administration of study drug, an abbr eviated physical examination/body system 
assessment , and a height/length measurement .  
• Pregnancy tests  
Given the expanded use of offsite dosing, p regnancy tests will be permitted at an offsite 
location (eg, home) by a healthcare professional or the patient /patient’s caregiver at all 
timepoints as of Month 1.  
• Pharmacokinetic assessments  
In situations where  the full PK profile (2, 4, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_973146] -dose plasma PK 
samples) cannot be drawn on the Day 1 visit, PK samples should be collected at 2, 4, a nd 
24 hours.   The next full PK profile will be drawn at Month 6 with a window of ±3 
months.  
• Impact of COVID -[ADDRESS_973147] of the COVID -19 global 
pandemic on clinical trial data.  
• Updates to study administration text  
Text was updated to provide clarification of Investigator responsibilities regarding 
communication of new study information to patients and IRB/IECs.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -[ADDRESS_973148] -GO1  (lumasiran)  
Amendment  [ADDRESS_973149] (outlined below) will not be implemented until appropriate 
HA and EC/IRB  approval .  The removal of the requirement to perform  routine  coagulation 
studies  after screening  reduces  patient burden regarding the frequency of blood samples and the 
volume of blood collected, while ensuring patient safety.  No safety signal pertaining to 
coagulation has been identified to date in any clinical study conducted with lumasiran.  This 
modification is particularly important for pediatr ic patients  given the greater limits placed on 
blood collection volumes .   
• Remove the collection of blood samples to assess pyridoxine (Vitamin  B6) levels 
after Month  12 and after discontinuation of pyridoxine therapy.  After a patient 
discontinues pyridox ine therapy, measurement of pyridoxine is no longer medically 
indicated to verify medication compliance.  
• Increase sample size based on feasibility ; additional patien ts were  identified since 
original protocol was implemented.   
• Revise renal ultrasound and ur ine collection assessments as anephric patients are 
exempt from renal ultrasound and procedures requiring urine samples, and anuric 
patients are exempt from procedures requiring urine samples.  
• Clarify ophthalmologic exams : Fundus photography (FP), Optical Coherence Test 
(OCT) and Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) will be performed for all patients at 
specified timepoints; however, FAF will not be  performed if unavailable at the study 
site. 
A detailed summary of these changes is provided in  Section  Section  2 (Table 2).  Corrections to 
typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and  formatting (including 
administrative changes between the original protocol  and protocol  amendment 1) are not 
detailed.

Revised text: Study drug injections will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator.  The site of injection may be the 
abdomen, the upper arms or thighs .  If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photog raphs may be obtained.  Detailed 
instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Dosing will be permitted at a location other than the study center (for example, the patient’s home) by a healthcare 
professional with the oversig ht of the Investigator at all time points, provided the patient has tolerated at least [ADDRESS_973152] ongoing stud y drug -related AEs, worsening injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or for anyone in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_439078].  
If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a h ealthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances 
related to the COVID -19 pandemic, lumasiran may be administered by [CONTACT_156344]’s caregiver under the oversight 
of the Investigator, and following consultation with the Medical Monitor, as allowed by [CONTACT_714528].  In such cases, the patient/caregiver must receive appropriate training on lumasiran administration prior to 
dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the 
ability of patients to travel to the study site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  In addition, instructions and procedures related to the  administration 
of lumasiran by a patient or caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions .

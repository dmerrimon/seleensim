1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS  
 
We are interested in evaluating a multifaceted preven tion protocol for ICU delirium. Delirium affects  
45-80% of elderly ICU patients, 60-80% of mechanic ally ventilated ICU patie nts, and 20-50% of non- 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients (1-4). About 30-40% of cases are preven table (1, 2). Without  
routine screening, delirium is of ten undiagnosed (5-7). Numerous st udies have consistently shown 
 that ICU delirium is associated with a worse prognosis (8). The a nnual cost of delirium and its  
ramifications in the U.S., is estimated to be $4-16 billion (1).  Delirium impacts emotional well-being, as delirious pa tients experienced delusi onal memories and had 
less factual recall than non-delirious patients (9-11) . A meta-analysis performed by [CONTACT_338452]. found 
delirium to be associated with a higher mortalit y rate, longer ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l lengths of stay, longer 
duration of mechanical ventilati on, and higher probability of discharg e to a skilled placement facility. 
(9) ICU-acquired delirium is independently associated with increased cognitive and physical impairment and health care costs (6, 12). Deliriu m was also found to be associated with more 
complications (9,13). Patients who develop delirium have a 2-3 times increased risk of dying during 
ICU admission (8, 14), with ICU mort ality ranging from 1-16% (15-17), and an in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338442] 25% to 33%. (12, 18). It is  also associated with increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (13, 19) and 
each additional day of delirium increases post-discha rge mortality up to a year  after discharge (14, 16, 
19).  Patients with ICU delirium had a higher incidence of cognitive impairment at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and 
up to [ADDRESS_418324]-discharge (20, 21) A longer duration of delirium in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338443] 3 and 12 mo nths (22), and it is associated 
with the development of new-onset dementia, or wors ening of existing dementia (2, 22).  In addition to 
cognitive problems, delirium was found to be associ ated with more problems in activities of daily 
living and worse scores on sensorimotor function tests at follow-up (3).  Anxiety, depression, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder are common in survivors of critical  illness (20, 21). 
 Recent studies evaluating interventions to prevent delirium have focused on “care bundles”, which are comprised of several care procedures incorporated into routine clinical care, that improve patient 
outcomes. “Bundling” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_338444], ventilator-associated pneumonia, and 
central line infections have demonstrated im proved clinical outcomes (12). The ABCDEF bundle 
(daily awakening and breathing coor dination trials, delirium monitori ng and treatment, early mobility, 
and family involvement), a multidisciplinary and mu lticomponent intervention strategy, is increasingly 
being used in ICUs to decrease length of stay, m echanical ventilation time, complications, and improve 
outcomes (23). The purpose is to minimize exposur e to sedating medications  and facilitate early 
extubation and mobilization (23). It has also been ev aluated in the prevention and treatment of delirium 
and found to decrease delirium inci dence and duration, mortality, mechan ical ventilator days, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491], and improve functiona l status and overa ll outcomes (12). 
 Psychiatric interventions have been evaluated in trauma patients (24), post-CABG patients who 
develop a psychiatric disorder posto peratively (25) post-intensive care  syndrome (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599]) patients (26), 
and inpatients with delirium (27, 28)  and were shown to have beneficial  effects. The role of psychiatric 
interventions in the ICU has not b een extensively studied. There are only 3 studies which evaluated the 
role of psychiatry in  the ICU aimed at: 1. minimizing PTSD /anxiety/depression incidence in ICU 
patients (29), 2. providing a support system for ICU patients (30), and 3. improving the mental health

4 of ICU patients (31). Additionally, the presence of  a psychiatry team rounding with a medical ICU 
team on nursing and resident education improvement was examined (32). No studies have evaluated 
the role of psychiatry rounding with the ICU team to prevent delirium and improve long-term 
outcomes.    The aim of our study is to determine the effect of delirium prevention care bundle protocols and a 
multi-disciplinary care model rounding with a psychi atry team (intervention group) on the incidence of 
delirium as compared to a group undergoing standard  care without psychiatry  participating in ICU 
rounds (control group). The psychiatric intervention entails a multidisciplinary approach to patient care 
during rounds, working with the ICU team to make recommendations on non-pharmacological and 
pharmacological prevention and treatment strategies  for patients who are positive for delirium, and 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_338445], that the IC U team may not have the 
training background to easily identify. Since the incidence of ICU deliriu m is so high and it has 
negative ramifications on patient survival, long-term outcomes, c ognitive function, and places a heavy 
burden on the healthcare system and cost, preventative strategies ar e desperately needed. Using bundle 
care protocols and multidisciplinary rounding with psychiatry may be a feasible and cheap measure to 
help prevent delirium in ICU patients.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_418325] of delirium prevention care bundle protocols, and a 
multi-disciplinary care model rounding with a psyc hiatry team (interven tion group) on ICU delirium 
and patient outcomes as compared to a group under going standard care without routine psychiatry 
team participating in ICU rounds (control group). Si nce the incidence of ICU delirium is so high and it 
has negative ramifications on patient survival, long-term outcomes, cognitive function, and places a 
heavy burden on the healthcare syst em and cost, preventative strategi es are desperately needed. Using 
bundle care protocols and multidisciplinary rounding with psychiatry may be a feasible and cheap 
measure to help prevent de lirium in ICU patients.  
 The primary objective is the incidence of ICU delirium.  The secondary objectives are:  -duration of delirium -ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] -days of mechanical ven tilation (if applicable) 
-in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338446] a decreased in cidence of delirium compared to 
standard care without routine ps ychiatry team involvement.  Ou r secondary hypothesis is that 
psychiatric team participation in multidiscipl inary ICU rounds will decrease delirium duration, 
decrease ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], decreas e mechanical ventilation dur ation, and decrease in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338447]. 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a prospective, single institution, contro lled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_338448] s admitted to the 7W ICU 
which will compare the incidence and delirium ra tes among patients undergoing routine care before

5 intervention (no routine psychiatri c involvement) (control group) and patients after the intervention 
(psychiatry team rounding with th e ICU team daily) (interventi on group) . Randomization is not 
possible for this study; although block randomization wa s considered, it will result in sub-optimal data 
subject to bias. 
 A sample size of 104 (52 per gr oup) is targeted based on an a priori  sample size calculation. Patients 
will be screened on a daily basis for study eligib ility by [CONTACT_338453], 
before delirium develops. Patients in both groups w ill be given and information sheet, verbal consent 
will be obtained, and the patient’s agreement to pa rticipate will be documented in the medical record. 
For patients who are unable to make  their own decisions, the informati on sheet will be given to  their 
designated healthcare decision maker, verbal consen t will be obtained, and the healthcare decision 
maker’s agreement will be documented in the medical record. 
 The control group will receive stan dard care, including the use of the ABCDEF bundle (Appendix 1) 
daily, which involves delirium sc reening using the Conf usion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit 
(CAM-ICU) score (Appendix 2), but will not have r outine psychiatric involvement in care. The CAM-
ICU is performed by [CONTACT_338454] a daily basis.  It consists of several questions that assess 
patient’s mental status, if the change in mental status fluctuates, the se dation score (using Richmond 
Agitation Sedation Score [RASS]), and the patient’s attention span and if di sorganized thinking is 
present by [CONTACT_338455] . The CAM-ICU can be performed in intubated patients by [CONTACT_338456], or squeeze the nurse’s hand in response to a question.  
The CAM-ICU will be done every morning, but may also be repeated later on in the day if the patient’s 
mental status changes from the mo rning-this will be the same fo r both the control and intervention 
group. Enrollment and data collection will continue for as long as it takes to reach the target sample 
size of [ADDRESS_418326] care (including ABCDEF bundle 
implementation, which is standard practice in 7W ICU) and provide routine psychiatric care, which 
entails a member of the psychiatric team (attending, resident, and/or fellow) participating in daily 
(Monday-Friday) multidisciplinary rounds with the ICU team (intervention group); the psychiatry team 
will help provide nonpharmacological and pharmacol ogical intervention strategies in patients 
diagnosed with delirium and help di stinguish delirium from other ps ychiatric disorders which may be 
missed by [CONTACT_338457] c onditions. This study phase will 
continue until the target sample  size of [ADDRESS_418327] administered  by [CONTACT_102]’s nurse on a daily basis (which is 
standard practice in 7W ICU) in the morning and may be repeated later on in the day if the patient’s 
mental status changes.  Data on the incidence of IC U delirium, duration of delirium/mechanical 
ventilation, in-house mortality, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338449].  
Additionally, we will collect the following data: ag e, gender, body mass index, history or alcohol or 
substance abuse, admitting diagnosis, dementia, comorbid conditions, adm itting Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, deliriogenic medications used during study enrollment, the 
interventions/medications used to treat delirium as designated by [CONTACT_338458] (in 
intervention group) and the ICU team  (control group), and the number of days from ICU admission to 
study enrollment. We will input data  into a secure, password protecte d, encrypted, electronic database, 
RedCap.

6.0  STRATIFICATION/DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME 
This is a prospective, single institution, controlle d, pi[INVESTIGATOR_338450] 7W ICU. A 
sample size of 104 (52 per group) is targeted. Patients will be screen ed for study eligibility on a daily 
basis The control group will undergo standard ICU care, which includes th e use of the ABCDEF 
bundle (Appendix 1) daily, which in volves delirium screening using the CAM-ICU tool (Appendix 2), 
but will not have routine psychiatri c involvement in care. Enrollment and data collection will continue 
for as long as it takes to reach the target sample si ze of [ADDRESS_418331]  care (including ABCDEF bundle 
implementation, which is standard practice in 7W IC U) in addition to a psyc hiatric team intervention, 
which entails having a member of the psychiatric t eam (attending, resident, and/or fellow) participate 
in daily (Monday-Friday) multidisciplinary round s with the ICU team; th ey will help provide 
nonpharmacological and pharmacological intervention stra tegies in patients diagnosed with delirium 
and help distinguish delirium fr om other psychiatric disorders which may be missed by [CONTACT_338459] t of these conditions. This study phase wi ll continue until the target sample 
size of 52 patients is reached.  
 
Data will be collected for both the control and intervention groups (see Section 12) and compared. 
 Randomization is not possible for this study; although block rando mization was considered, it  
will result in sub-optimal data subject to bias.   
7.[ADDRESS_418332] care (ABCDEF bundle, which includes daily CAM-ICU screening for  
Delirium by [CONTACT_338460]), the intervention will be daily  multidisciplinary ICU rounds with a psychiatry  
team member, who will collaborate w ith the ICU team in implementing pr eventative strategies, assist  
in the pharmacological and nonpharmaco logical treatment of patients wi th delirium, and assist in  
differentiating delirium from other psychiatric disorders which may not be detected by [CONTACT_338461],  
thus, identifying, addressing, and treating th ese illnesses at an earlier time.

12. DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING  
Data which will be collected includes: age, gend er, body mass index, history or alcohol or substance 
abuse, admitting diagnosis, dementia, comorbid conditions, admitting Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, deliriogenic medi cations used during study enrollment, the 
interventions/medications used to treat delirium as  designated by [CONTACT_338462] (in intervention group) and the ICU team  (control group), and the number of days from ICU 
admission to study enrollment. Data on the incidence of ICU delirium, duration of delirium/mechanical 
ventilation, in-house mortality, and lengt h of stay will also be collected. 
 
Data will be collected using RedCap, a password protec ted website. No patient identifiers will be used. 
A copy of the information sheet will be provided to the patient and be placed in the patient’s chart. We 
will retain a copy of the information sheet  in a double locked storage office.  
 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], sample size c onsiderations were based on obtain ing sufficient patient numbers to 
assess feasibility of the intervention and data coll ection on the surgic al unit, as well as to obtain 
estimates of incidence of delirium in the current ca re model (the base incide nce) and the magnitude of 
effect of introduction of psychiat ric involvement on the unit.  All of these data are required for 
determination of feasibility of and sample size estimation for a larger definitive trial that would likely be a multi-centered cluster randomized trial.  Base d on our clinical experience in the 7W ICU, the 
incidence of delirium over the past year was r oughly 40%; from the literat ure, a large intervention 
effect would be on the order of 25% reduction in  incident delirium.  We used these initial 
approximations to determine the pr ecision (i.e., width of a 95% confid ence interval) with which we can 
estimate these two parameters for use in future tria l planning.   Given a sample size of 94 patients (47 
in each group), we will be able to estimate the actua l difference in the incidence of delirium in our 
proposed intervention group (compared to SOC) with  a precision (95% conf idence interval) of 8%-
42%.  In the 47 in the SOC group, we will be able to es timate the base rate of delirium incidence with a 
95% confidence interval of 26%-55%.  The effect size and base rate estimated from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_338451]-cen ter, larger population studies.
 
 A sample size of 104 will be targeted  to account for a 10% drop-out rate.  
 
Descriptive statistics, including Stud ent’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U-te st, for continuous variables and 
χ2 or Fisher’s exact test, for categorical variables,  will be used to summarize the data and compare

Version date: 03/20/[ADDRESS_418335] and 
multivariable logistic regression. Differences in  the duration of deliriu m and MV between the 
intervention and control groups will be analyzed by [CONTACT_338463] (ANOVA). The length of stay 
will be compared by [CONTACT_338464], while mortality rates will be compared 
via logistic regression. A sensitivity analysis wi ll be performed in orde r to assess the possible 
confounding effect of the non-randomized nature of  our study design. A propensity score model for 
receipt of standard care vs. psyc hiatric involvement will be perf ormed in order to approximate a 
balanced covariate distribution be tween the [ADDRESS_418336] COMTAINMENT

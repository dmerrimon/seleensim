INTRODUCTION Dailies® Total1 for Astigmatism  (DT1fA) contact [CONTACT_585343] A, a silicone hydrogel material with water gradient technology that allows the water content to approach 100% at the lens surface.[ADDRESS_769662] previously failed with toric lenses.  6.  OBJECTIVE(S) To determine the percentages of past toric CL wearers (who dropped out of contact [CONTACT_585341]) who are satisfied with the comfort and vision of DT1fA contact [CONTACT_13276].  7.  SUBJECTS 7.1. Subject Population  Eligible test subjects will be [ADDRESS_769663] meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will be provided information on the study and asked to sign a patient information and consent form to participate. The patient information and consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_140284]. 7.2. Inclusion Criteria Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria: Note: Ocular criteria must be met in both eyes. • Gender: Males and Females.   • Subjects will be 18-39 years old. • History of previous unsuccessful astigmatism contact [CONTACT_585344]: o I used to wear astigmatism correcting (toric) soft contact [CONTACT_13276].   § (YES) o I stopped wearing my previous astigmatism correcting soft contact [CONTACT_585345]: § Poor or fluctuating vision § Discomfort § Other • Subjects must have 20/[ADDRESS_769664] correction. 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 7 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  • Good general health (defined by [CONTACT_585346]). • Ability to give informed consent.  • Willing and able to spend time for the study (Subjects will be required to attend three study visits and wear contact [CONTACT_20938]).   7.3. Exclusion Criteria If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the subject or either eye, the subject should not be enrolled in the study. • Previous ocular surgery. • Inability to be fit with the DT1fA lens design. • Subjects that should be wearing a toric contact [CONTACT_585347]. • History of Accutane use. • Ocular surface disease that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_585339]. • History of comorbidities, including autoimmune disorders and diabetes. • Irregular astigmatism as identified by [CONTACT_585348]. • History of Amblyopia. • History of Strabismus and/or history of eye muscle surgery. • History of Monovision. • Potential subjects who are pregnant.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_98132] a patient ineligible or non-evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.   Pregnancy has a known effect on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such, subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may be excluded from analyses of effectiveness. 8.  STUDY DESIGN 8.1. Study Design  This is a single arm, prospective, non-comparative, open-label post market clinical study of statisfaction of past toric CL wearers, with DT1fA contact [CONTACT_13276]. Subjects will be assessed at a screening visit, and [ADDRESS_769665] refraction, and administration a questionnaire.  The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of patients with positive ratings (>50 out of 100) for satisfaction of comfort and vision.    Exploratory outcome measures are as follows: 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 8 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  • Percentage of patients reporting satisfaction of overall and end of day (EOD) comfort and vision; comfort and vision under real-world conditions related to computer (or tablet) usage and cellphone usage (based on a Likert scale). • Desire to remain in DT1fA lenses after study is concluded (based on a Likert scale). 8.2. Methods Used to Minimize Bias  As a single-arm study there is no expected bias. Patient selection will be based on the patient’s interest and the surgeon’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_140279] a suitable candidate for DT1fA contact [CONTACT_13276].  The measurement of visual acuity will be conducted in a systematic fashion to minimize bias. Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will be instructed to perform the same testing in the same fashion for all subjects, with the same level of encouragement to subjects. Questionnaire instructions will be provided to all patients in a similar manner.  All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs) or computer files generated by [CONTACT_140285]. All site personnel involved in the study will be trained in regard to conducting study-specific procedures. 9.  STUDY PROCEDURE  9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signed documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_1694] a permanent part of the subject's medical records. A signed copy will be provided to the subject.  9.2. Visits and Examinations  Subjects will participate in 3 study visits. Visits will include an uptake visit and 2 follow up visits (Visit numbers 1-3 below).  The visit schedule, complete with window and associated CRF forms, are displayed in Table 9.2-1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be conducted, are provided below.   Table 9.2-1.  Visit Schedule  Visit Number Visit Name [CONTACT_140295] 1 Recruitment Day 0  1 2 Follow-Up Visit 1 Up to 60 days after Recruitment Visit 2 3 Follow-Up Visit 2  30 ± 3 days after Follow-Up Visit 1 3   9.2.1. Recruitment  
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 9 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  At the recruitment visit, subjects will be consented, qualified for the study (compared with inclusion/exclusion criteria), and assigned a study ID/subject number.  Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially at each site in the order of enrollment.   A medical history will be taken and exams will include the tests described below: § manifest refraction, § visual acuity, § ocular surface disease assessment. In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Measurements should be made as described in section 9.3 below.   9.2.2. Follow-Up Visit 1  Exams will include the tests described below: § visual acuity, In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   9.2.3. Follow-Up Visit 2  Exams will include the tests described below: § visual acuity, § questionnaire. In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   9.2.4. Exit Procedures In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting that the subject did not complete the study and the reason for premature study 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 10 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  exit.  If no premature exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be completed at the end of Visit 3.   9.3. Study Methods and Measurements All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section.  Specific study examination procedures are outlined below.    9.3.1. Manifest Refraction Perform a manifest refraction with a high contrast Snellen chart under photopic lighting conditions.  Document refraction results with sphere, cylinder and axis readings.  If uncorrected visual acuity is not improved by [CONTACT_263175], use zero for sphere and cylinder and draw a line through the blank for the axis.   Note:  Each subject should be manually refracted to his/her best correction by [CONTACT_4674], optometrist, or a skilled technician using a phoropter or trial lenses.     9.3.2. Visual Acuity (VA) Distance VA Measure distance visual acuity using a high contrast Snellen chart under photopic lighting at a distance of [ADDRESS_769666] an exit visit or who come into the office to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], their continued participation in the study poses a risk to their health. The reasons for discontinuation include: a. Adverse event; b. Lost to follow-up; 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page [ADDRESS_769667] decision unrelated to an adverse event; d. Protocol violation; e. Treatment failure; f. Other.  To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 3, investigators should assess each subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical procedures that might be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured. 10.  ANALYSIS PLAN 10.1. Analysis Data Sets All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses will be performed based on data from those eyes that complete the study.   10.2. Statistical Methodology A summary of the data will be prepared for all measurement time points.   For variables measured on a continuous scale, these summaries will include the sample size, as well as the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. For variables measured on a categorical scale, summaries will provide the number and percentage of subjects in each category. These summaries will be provided for all eyes completing the study.  10.2.1. Within-treatment Changes For variables measured on a continuous scale, the statistical significance of each parameter will be investigated using a paired t-test for parametric data, Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-parametric data, and the Chi-squared statistic (for categorical data). 10.3. General Statistical Considerations The statistical analyses will be performed using R, version 4.1.2 or higher.  Any statistical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05. 11.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION Since the statistics are descriptive in nature, the subjects studied only need to be sufficient to have an adequate number of each available power adequately represented.  The distribution will be:

CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons outside of the Study. Results will be submitted for publication and presentation at national and/or international meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer-review journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs). No protected health information will be included on the forms. CRFs will be retained in the patient’s file for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_769668] access to your study records:   •    Study Doctor and staff involved with the study  •    Study Monitor or Auditor  •    Sponsor Company or Research Institution  •    Review boards or accrediting agencies  •    Other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies  The de-identified data may be shared with other researchers for future analysis. 13.  QUALITY COMPLAINTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS All subjects will be monitored for adverse events over the course of the study. A place to record any adverse event is included on each case report form. 13.1. General Information An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered. a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 13 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical studies, an AE can include an untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_140286].  13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be documented on an Adverse Event Form (AEF). A separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity), any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverse event’s relationship to the study treatment. Nonserious Adverse Events A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that does not meet serious criteria noted below (e.g., is not life-threatening, does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], does not prolong a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is not disabling, etc.). All adverse events must be reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study treatment.  For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be collected on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the study.   Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. NOTE: Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140280]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page 14 of 19 v 1.0  17 May 2023  event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. • Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE, if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the Medical Monitor immediately (i.e., within one working day of the Investigator’s or site’s knowledge of the event) as follows: o In studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC system.  o Additional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.  In addition to the reporting of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor, the SAE must be reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  The investigator must document all adverse device events (serious and nonserious but related) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints will also be documented.   • Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form must be e-mailed immediately to the study coordinator (Melissa Hamann Wright). • Additional relevant information is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.    Study coordinator contact [CONTACT_76533].

The investigator must also report all adverse events and quality complaints according to the relevant IRB requirements.  12.3.[ADDRESS_769669] assess the causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation. An assessment of causality will also be performed by [CONTACT_140288], as shown below:  Causality Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event or quality complaint was caused by [CONTACT_140289].   Not Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality complaint).  Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:   Intensity (Severity) Mild An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom. Moderate An adverse event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities. 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page [ADDRESS_769670]’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint when applicable. 13.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up procedures are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow-up procedures must be documented and available to the study coordinator who, with the Medical Monitor, will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.  13.5. Safety Analyses The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment-related.   14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, consistent with the [ADDRESS_769671] regulations.  The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB/ethics committee approval prior to initiating the study.  The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.  14.1 Confidentiality The data collected will be data typi[INVESTIGATOR_140281](s) when performed on eyes outside the study. Any data collected will become part of the patient’s clinical record. The data will be subject to the same privacy and confidentiality as other data in the clinical record.  Only the principal investigator, research consultant and clinic staff will have access to the data collected. All data shared outside the practice will be de-identified; patients’ protected health information will not be available and will not be reported in any analyses or publications. No data will be sold to third parties. De-identified data may be used for future research.

CONFIDENTIALITY No protected health information (PHI), including the patient’s name [CONTACT_18131], will be collected; to ensure this, no PHI information is permitted to be entered on any of the Case Report Forms (CRFs). Subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_140290]. Collected information will only be used for purposes of this study and no information will be sold to third parties. The non-PHI information collected may be used for future research, though there is currently no plan to do so.  17. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE INFORMATION/STUDY RELATED INJURIES Every effort to prevent study-related injury will be taken by [CONTACT_140291]. In the event a patient is injured as a direct result of the study while following the Study Doctor’s instructions and the study requirements, the patient will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_140292]. The Study Doctor is to treat the injured subject as needed for those injuries caused directly by [CONTACT_98139]. In the event of injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_140293] a subject’s participation in this research study, all charges for medical care provided to the subject will be billed to his or her insurance company. The Study Doctor or Sponsor does not offer to cover the medical care costs for injuries or illnesses that are not caused directly by [CONTACT_67300]. The Sponsor does not offer to provide any other compensation, unless specifically agreed to elsewhere in this 
Success of DT1fA in patients previously failed with toric lenses Page [ADDRESS_769674] before the start of the study in the consent form. 18. STUDY ENDPOINT CRITERIA 18.1. Patient Completion of Study  If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 3) of the study, he/she is considered to have completed the study.   18.2. Patient Discontinuation  Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time they choose.  Study patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., non-compliance, failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discontinued from the study.  Study patients discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be replaced.   18.3. Patient Termination  A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe adverse event that may be related to the study.  A study patient will receive appropriate treatment at the discretion of the investigator.  Notification of termination will be clearly documented.  These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be replaced.   18.4. Study Termination The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, after clinical observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he may stop the study.   18.5. Study Completion  The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit [ADDRESS_769675] lenses provide quality of vision and ocular comfort significantly higher compared to the subjects’ habitual spectacles during the day, at the end of the day, and overall.1  Patients who participate in the study receive $[ADDRESS_769676] lens wearers.

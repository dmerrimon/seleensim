Table 3-1 and Table  3-2 provide the schedules of assessments. All visits are to be scheduled 
relative to the Day  1 Visit in each Part.  
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnai re-Revised (CFQ -R) must be completed before any other 
assessment (except informed consent form [I CF] signing) at relevant clinic visits. Multiple 
breath washout (MBW) assessments should be performed before spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and ECG should be 
performed before any  assessments that may affect heart rate (such as blood draws). Remaining 
assessments may be performed in any order when more than 1  assessment is required at a 
particular time point. All assessments will be performed before study drug dosing 
(Section  9.6.1 ), unless noted otherwise.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. CF affects more than 70,000  individuals worldwide1 
(approximately 30,000 in the US2 and 45,000  in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies 
as an orphan disease.4, 5 
CF is caused by [CONTACT_155412]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene.[ADDRESS_715002] common disease -causing CFTR  mutation is F508del , which accounts for 
approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF.10 Approximately 40% to 45% of 
people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% have at least 
[ADDRESS_715003] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR  protein 
delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport . With differing mechanisms of acti on, a 
combination of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR -mediated chloride transport 
more than either type of modulator alone.  
The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by 
[CONTACT_546566]: ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (Kalydeco ), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi ), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA 
(Symdeko , Symkevi). 
VX-445 is a next -generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX -445, 
TEZ, and IVA (VX -445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual 
combinations (VX -445/TEZ, VX -445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components (VX -445, 
TEZ, and IVA) when added to human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells der ived from 2  groups of 
CF patients: those  heterozygous for F508del with a second CFTR  allele carrying a minimal 
function (MF) mutation that is not responsive to TEZ, IVA, and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); 
and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes).  
Additi onal information about VX -445/TEZ/IVA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

• VX-445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of 
medicinal products  that are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, 
glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution.  
• IVA is a weak inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Administration of IVA may increase 
systemic exposure of medicin al products that are sensitive substrates of P -gp, which may 
increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin or other substrates 
of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimu s, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  
• IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, during coadministration with warfarin, additional 
monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal products 
that are CYP2C9 subst rates for which exposure may be increased include glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_168781]; these should be used with caution.  
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator should have thei r spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393]  11.3.[ADDRESS_715026] “CF” 
meal or snack or a standard meal . 
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30  minutes of the start of the  meal or snack.  
2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed -dose combination  VX-445/TEZ/IVA tablets in the 
morning and as [ADDRESS_715027], doses of study drug should be 
taken at approximately the same time (±  2 hours) each day.  
3. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA will be administered at 
the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by 
[CONTACT_546567] -445/TEZ/IVA.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_715028] ’s scheduled c linic visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines 
should be used:  
• If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_715029] ’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA and the morning 
dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_715030]’s scheduled morning 
dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA , the subject should take the morning dose  of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA  at home.  
5. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
9.6.[ADDRESS_715031] shou ld take 
the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.  
Morning dose: If more than [ADDRESS_715032] 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening do se. 
Evening dose:  If more than [ADDRESS_715033] interrupted study drug for >[ADDRESS_715034]’s clinical stability and should consider resumption of study 
drug only after the subject is clinically stable  and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in 
administering study drug to the su bject.  
The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for 
any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. In subjects for whom 
study drug was previously interrupted, the medical monitor should be notified of any plan to 
discontinue study drug, before the discontinuation has occurred, if possible.  
9.8.1  Liver Function Tests  
The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of alanine transaminase (ALT) or 
aspartate transaminase (AST) >3  × upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin >2  × ULN 
that are derived from centrally submitted samples.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2  × ULN, must be followed closely, including  confirmatory testing performed by 
[CONTACT_546568]19 -445-107, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_715035] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72  hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued  if the following criteria are met:  
• Subsequent ALT  or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have im proved  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to 
baseline.  
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase ele vation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminase levels return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified before resumption of study drug. 
Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 
4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_155421] 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_715036] develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), or 
a rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical 
monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade  3 or higher, or is an SAE. 
Investigators should consider additional evaluatio n including laboratory testing (e.g., complete 
blood count with differential, liver function tests), photographs of the rash, and dermatology 
consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically 
appropriate.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_715037] meets any of 
the following criteria:  
• Meets any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (discontinuation) criteria (Section  9.8) 
• Becomes pregnant (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable  effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational product( s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety 
Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section  9.1.2 ), and follow  up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs.  
If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be 
performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is 
over, and may use the samples and information in the develo pment of the study compounds, and 
for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If 
the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of 
the study. A subject will no t be able to request the withdrawal of his or her information from the 
study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him or her during 
the study as long as those samples can be identified as his or her samples.  
9.10 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the study drug Treatment Period will not be 
replaced.

local regulations and/or requirements.  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged by [CONTACT_252865] .  
For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the 
central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local 
investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a loca l laboratory test value is found to 
be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_546572]. If it is not possible to send a 
timely specimen to th e central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the 
investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_715054] study visits. At 
other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments can be 
performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider .

indicated. Any clinically significant abnormal find ings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
Weight, height, and BMI (derived) will also be assessed ( Section  11.3.4 ). 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following at least a [ADDRESS_715055] 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be done before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood 
draws.  
• The subject will b e instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through completion of study participation  will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an abso lute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_715056] and will 
include:  
• measurement of best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
Ophthalmologic examinations are required at select study visits in the Treatment Period s (Table 
3-1 and Table  3-2). These examinations should be completed within 4  weeks of the relevant 
study visit. An ophthalmologic examination is also required at the ETT Visit for subjects whose 
cumulative VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (in the parent study and current study) is at least

mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxic ology studies of 
VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception  
Contraception requirement for a couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual li festyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the date of informed consent through [ADDRESS_715058] dose of study 
drug.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examinat ion of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_155425]).  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postme nopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consecutive months and a serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory’s reference range for 
postmenopausal females  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy  
Note: A ll other females (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be 
of childbearing potential.  
• Same -sex relationships  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subje ct that at least [ADDRESS_715059] be in successful use from signing of consent (or

Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive m ethods listed in 
Table  11-2. 
• If over the course of the study the subject’s status changes and the subject does not meet the 
criteria for waiving the co ntraception requirements, the subject must begin following the 
contraceptive methods listed in Table  11-2.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm during the period starting from the first dose of study 
drug until [ADDRESS_715063] dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects should not nurse a child during the period starting from the first dose of 
study drug until [ADDRESS_715064] dose of study drug.  
• For male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential, the couple should not plan 
to become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_715065] dose of study drug or sperm from another source . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_715066], becomes pregnant during study participation, 
study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 1) notify the 
medical monitor and Vertex Global Pat ient Safety (GPS) within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge 
of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form 
to Vertex GPS. Male subjects with female partners who become pregnant during the study must 
use a mal e condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal 
fluid.  
Provided informed consent is obtained, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of 
the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1  year after t he birth. A separate ICF will be 
provided to explain these follow -up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the 
clinical data lock for the study.  
12.1 Sample Size  
The primary and secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long -term safety,

subjects who complete study treatment in the parent study and meet eligibility criteria. 
Approximately 56 subjects are expected to enroll in this open -label study.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets will be defined for Part A and Part B separately:  
The Open -label All Subjects Set  for Part A or B is defined as all subjects who were enrolled 
(defined as subject having data in the corresponding clinical database) in the corresponding Part. 
This analysis set will be used for individual subject data listings and disposition summary tab les 
unless otherwise specified.  
The Open -label Full Analysis Set (OL -FAS)  for Part A or B is defined as all enrolled subjects 
who have received at least [ADDRESS_715067] demographi cs and baseline characteristics and for all efficacy 
analyses unless otherwise specified.

at least 1  dose of study drug in the corresponding Part. The OL -SS will  be used for all safety 
analyses unless otherwise specified.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value  (min), and maximum value 
(max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the 
SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as 
the units of the raw data. The mean, med ian, and SD will be reported to [ADDRESS_715068] units (metric or SI) will be converted 
with the appropriate precision.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. P ercentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_715069] recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
parent study. For assessments c ollected in replicates, the baseline will be defined as the average 
of non -missing values.  
Change (absolute change)  from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value  – baseline 
value.  
The Efficacy Analysis Period  for each Part will include the time f rom the first dose of study 
drug to the last scheduled efficacy visit in the corresponding Part, unless otherwise specified.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  for each Part will include the time from the first dose of 
study drug to [ADDRESS_715070] dose of the study drug or to the date of completion of study 
participation in the corresponding Part (as defined in Section  9.1.5 ), whichever occurs first.  
Part A and Part B data will be analyzed separately, using the respective analysis set, efficacy 
analysis period, and TE period for each Part. For analysis of the number of PEx, events in the 
parent study and this study (Parts A and B, as appl icable) may also be combined.  
12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summarized separately for each Part for the Open -label All Subjects 
Set. The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summ arized as

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and Preferred 
Term (PT) for the OL -FAS.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be coded using WHODrug and categorized as follows:  
• Prior medica tion:  any medication that was administered within the [ADDRESS_715071] 
dose of study drug in each Part  
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period in 
each Part  
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the TE  Period in 
each Part  
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post -treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing, 
concomitantly during the TE Period, or beyond the TE Period, it will be considered in all 
[ADDRESS_715072] data listing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized separately for each Part based on the OL -SS, defined as 
the last day of study drug in each Part  minus the f irst day  of study drug in each Part plus  1, 
regardless of study drug interruption.  
Study drug compliance will be summarized based on the OL -FAS, and will be calculated as: 
100  [1 – (total number of days of study drug interruption in each Part) / (duratio n of study drug 
exposure in days in each Part)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an 
interruption of any study drug on that day.  
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized based on the OL -FAS, and will 
be calcula ted as: 100  [(total number of tablets dispensed in each part) – (total number of tablets 
returned in each Part)] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day  duration of study 
drug exposure in days for each Part).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Important Protocol Deviation s 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s 
rights, safety, or wellbeing. The rules for identifying an IPD wi ll be described in the SAP.

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATO RY, AND ADMINISTRATI VE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increas e in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Si gnificant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the  study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemog lobin).  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_715076] has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A ch ange in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whethe r the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_715077]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the completion of study 
participation (Section 9.1.5 ). 
All subjects’ parents or legal guardians will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the 
occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptom s 
will be identified as 1  overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded 
in the CRF and source document. The following  data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severi ty of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
February  2019 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” When 
considering the severity of an AE in  a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those in the 
CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be 
determined accor ding to the definitions in Table  13-1.

Life-threatening 
(Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_715078] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  Ther e is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics  of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to th e AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_715079] to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be u sed in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when de ath is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of ca use, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or bi rth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treat ment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_546559], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_546560]19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 51 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_546561] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is  based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_546573] 2 4 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety 
Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS 
within 24  hours of identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent  and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to 
report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report 
follow -up information as so on as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:

Fax: +1 -[PHONE_11313]   
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact [CONTACT_756]: +1 -[PHONE_11314]  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_252870](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to reso lution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and

13.7 Publications and Clinical Study Report  
13.7.1  Publication of Study Results  
Vertex is committed to reporting the design and results of all clinical studies in a complete, 
accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely manner, consistent with Good  Publication Practices 
(GPP3).23  
Publication Planning : Vertex staff along with the lead principal investigators, the stee ring 
committee, and/or the publication committee will work together to develop a publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship of publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in  Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria24: 
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; and  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.  
All authors must meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. All persons designated as authors should qualify 
for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Contributions such as medical writing, 
enrollment of subjects, acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the 
research group, alone, do not justify authorship.  
Contributors : Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors criteria for authorship will not be listed as authors, but their contribution will be 
acknowledged and specified either as a group (e.g., “study investigators”) or individually (e.g., 
“served as scientific advisor”).  
Publication Review : As required by a separate clinical study agreement, Vertex must have the 
oppo rtunity to review all publications, including any manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide 
presentations, and book chapters regarding this study before submission to congresses or journals 
for consideration.  
13.7.2  Clinical Study Report  
A CSR, written in accordance with the ICH E3 Guideline, will be submitted in accordance with 
local regulations.

2 INTRODUCTION
2.1      Study Rationale  
At-home intracervical insemination (ICI), folklorickly known as the “turkey-baster” method, has
been used for decades to increase likelihood of pregnancy. This method works by [CONTACT_338141]. While there are several devices such as over the counter
syringes and silicone caps, the creator of the Mosie Baby [CONTACT_338142] a woman’s body, easy and safe to use, a nd r esults in
depositing the semen at or near the cervix opening. The Mosie Kit provides people with an
at-home intracervical insemination option which could be used before resorting to more invasive
and expensive options such as Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization. There is
vast evidence of Mosie’s success in the form of happy users who have conceived. There is a
desire to learn more about the safety, useability and experience of using the Mosie kit.
This r etrospective study will examine the experience of people who have voluntarily chosen to
purchase and use the Mosie Kit. The Mosie Kit consists of [ADDRESS_417898] chosen to
use it.
2.2 Background
Infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant after one year of unprotected sex. About                  
6% of married and overall 12% of women ages [ADDRESS_417899] infertility issues. Infertility issues                 
can be of male or female origin. According to the CDC, in 35% of the infertility cases a male                   
factor was found along with a female factor and in 8% of the cases the only identifiable cause                   
was a m ale factor. Fertility is affected by [CONTACT_200801], one of which is the female’s age. For                  
this reason it is recommended that people anatomically female under the age of [ADDRESS_417900] documented case of artificial insemination w as d one in the 1770s by [CONTACT_338143] (Obmelet & Robays 2015). Subsequently J. Mario Sims reported his findings in the               
mid-1880s. Sims describes 55 inseminations. Unfortunately since he believed ovulation           
occurred during meneses, only one pregnancy was reported (Obmelet & Robays 2015).             
Research has come a long way since the early 18th century. Artificial insemination is now a                 
much mo re f requent occurrence. Initially used by [CONTACT_338144] (low sperm count              
and inherited Y-chromosome disease), later for couples with physiological and psychological           
dysfunction, such as retrograde ejaculation, vaginismus, hypospadias and impotence, and now            
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 9  
is very commonly used by [CONTACT_338145] (both single and those in lesbian                
relationships).  
Since [CONTACT_338171]’s sperm freezing success in 1953 with a subsequent live birth, collecting and                
using sperm for insemination in humans was made possible. However, it would be more than a                
decade before it became legally possible as it was initially ruled as contrary to public policy and                  
good morals . I n the 1960s and 70s, sperm selection and washing techniques led to Intrauterine                
insemination (IUI) which placed the sperm even further into the woman's body by [CONTACT_338146]. By [CONTACT_941] 1970s sperm banks in the US became popular. Also in the 1970s,                   
Steptoe and Edwards introduced the world to In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). More recently,             
techniques such as intratubal insemination, a nd i ntraperitoneal insemination have been added            
to the available conception methods. During the last decades the popularity of Intrauterine             
Insemination (IUI) increased because it was safer, painless, and more cost-effective.            
Additionally, more information has become available about sperm selection techniques and now             
there is a greater understanding of many of the causes of infertility. The mo st p
opular method of insemination is to use the husband's sperm (Artificial Insemination              
by [CONTACT_338147] (AIH)). In some cases anonymous donor sperm is used.             
Intracervical (ICI) or intravaginal insemination (IVI) are terms used interchangeably to describe             
the insemination technique colloquially known as the “turkey baster method”. This method            
consists of placing the semen into the vagina at or nea r t he cervix. In the [LOCATION_002], IUI is                    
the most frequently doctor assisted technique. Some researchers have examined the success            
rates of each technique. ICI/IVI has been found to have a per cycle pregnancy rate of 10-15%                  
while IUI has been found to be slightly higher up to 10-35%. Meanwhile techniques such as IVF                  
can be as high as 31% in people under 35 years of age and as low as 3% for those above [ADDRESS_417901] $250-[ADDRESS_417902] of IVF was approximately $24,373 (for just IVF) to $38,015 (for IVF-donor egg). Voorhis et al. [ADDRESS_417903] 
$
7.800-10,300 while Assisted Reproductive Therapy (ART) cost $37,[ADDRESS_417904] 
difference between IVI/ICI, IUI and ART therapi[INVESTIGATOR_338118]. This makes cost a consideration for people attempting to conceive.  
The good news is a number of studies such as Cohlen and Ombelet 2014 and Banerjee and                 
Singla 2017, demonstrate the viability of using IVI/ICI as a means of AIH. The b enefits o
f ICI is                   
that it can be done in the privacy of the home, is relatively low cost, and over a [ADDRESS_417905] comparable rates to its more expensive counterparts.  Cohlen and Ombelet 2014 showed that for many couples with cervical factor infertility,              
psychological sexual dysfunction, physiological dysfunction, unexplained infertility and mild to           
moderate male su bfertility u
sing artificial insemination with a husband's sperm (AIH) was a              
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 10  
preferred treatment option. Banerjee and Singla (2017), tested couples with unconsummated            
marriages due to vaginismus, erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. They found 69%             
of couples ages 20-32, 43% ages 33-36, and 25% over 36 years old conceived using IVI. This is                  
comparable to the expected 10-35% pregnancy rate of IUI. 
Additionally, Kop et al. 2018 conducted a literature review to dete rmine if there was a difference 
b
etween pregnancy rates and live births of IUI versus ICI. They reported that out of six trials 
totalling 708 women. They concluded that there was not enough evidence to determine that IUI 
resulted in more live births or pregnancies than ICI.  
Carroll and Palmer (2001) conducted a prospective randomized cross over control study on 62 
single fertile women choosing to  use donor sperm. They had a total of 189 cycles (94 IUI and 95 
I
CI). The resulting pregnancy rate was 15% and 9% respectively (p=0.04) which indicated that 
IUI was more effective than ICI. On the other hand, Hogerzeil et al. (1988) studied 53 women who either had at home ICI (n=29) or in clinic ICI (n=24). In the first 6 cycles 13 pregnancies resulted in the home ICI group while only 11 pregnanci es resulted in the clinic group. 
A
dditionally, they followed 138 couples who did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of these 45 had 
opted for at home insemination and 20 of them ended up with a pregnancy.  
In conclusion, there is a lot of room to learn more about the pregnancy rates of ICI and the                   
experience of at-home artificial insemination. With 12% of women of child bearing age              
experiencing infer tility t here is an important contribution to be made to the fertility field. Using                
the Mosie Baby [INVESTIGATOR_136]-home artificial insemination kit is a low cost option that could potentially be a                 
first line alternative for many people seeking to conceive. Therefore, it is important to              
understand the experience and pregnancy rates of people who have chosen to use the Mosie                
Kit to get pregnant at home. This study will p rovide v aluable information for the fertility industry                 
as a whole, as well as, will provide information for a follow up study where people choosing to                  
use the Mosie Kit will be prospectively followed to capture their data in real time. Together these                 
studies will provide a better understanding of at-home insemination success, safety and             
perception.  
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
2.3.[ADDRESS_417906] already used the Mosie Kit,                 
there is no potential additional physical risk from participating in the study. In some cases,                
because fertility is a sensitive issue, some people might become a bit emotional in recalling                
unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant. Otherwise, there are no known additional r isks for              
participating in this study.  
This retrospective study will be conducted as an anonymous one-time self-report survey that will              
contain no personal information that will allow the participant to be identified. This is done to                 
MOSIE-001 © [ADDRESS_417907] of about $89. This is less than 20% of the cost                     
of IUI which can range between $500-1500/ procedure before labs, ultrasounds, and additional            
expenses, and around 5% once all costs are added up. The study will provide valuable                
information to people trying to conceive about the efficiency of using the Mosie Kit for ICI, how                  
that efficiency m ight c ompare to the effectiveness of IUI, and how the cost of each compares.                 
This will help the user decide whether the Mosie Kit is the right conception tool for them. The                  
study will also provide valuable information about the safety and usability of the kit. The                
research will let Mosie know if they have successfully communicated how to use the kit, if the                  
instructions are clear or if any changes are n eeded, a nd whether anything else should be                
considered in future design changes. The study might also provide information on the timing of                
the insemination that might lead to a positive pregnancy outcome. Additionally, this knowledge            
might provide Mosie Baby [CONTACT_338148].. 
The participant themselves will only benefit by [CONTACT_338149] e xperience a bout                
the Mosie Kit. While they might receive a discount code towards the purchase of a future Mosie                 
Kit, this is not considered a benefit but a thank you for participation. Note the discount code will                  
be a standard code used for other marketing purposes in order to ensure there is no way for                  
Mosie staff to know if the participant obtained it for completing the survey or obtained it via othe r                   
m
arketing avenues. The participant may feel good because they shared their experience and              
provided input into the Mosie Kit which will in turn help others. The information obtained through this study will allow Mosie Baby [CONTACT_338150].  
2.3.[ADDRESS_417908]’s previously chosen voluntary behavior to purchase and use
the Mosie Kit. There are also minimal to no benefits to the participants for completing the
survey except for their personal satisfaction of having shared and contributed to the research
via their experience(s). The benefit will mainly be for people wh o w ill use the Mosie Kit in the
future and who will benefit by [CONTACT_338151]. It is believed that the good of many and
future possibility of having an acceptable method of artificial insemination at home outweighs
the risk of participation in the study.

ENDPOINTSPUTATIVE
MECHANISMS OF
ACTION
Primary      
The primary 
objective is to understand the outcome of using the at-home intracervical insemination Mosie kit, i.e. pregnancy rate after its use.   The primary endpoints is: Pregnancy Rate after up to 6 cycles.   Another primary end point is to understand the rates of pregnancy in people who desire to get pregnant without intercourse
(
i.e. both single and 
those in LGBTQ relationships.  The ultimate objective of 
using the Mosie Kit is to end up pregnant. Thus pregnancy rate is a primary endpoint. Specifically, pregnancy rate in up to 6 (six) cycles will be examined as it is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_338119]. 
People who have no kno wn 
f
ertility issue who are trying 
to conceive without 
intercourse such as those who are in LGBTQ relationships or those who are not in any relationship at all will likely have higher pregnancy rates than those with known fertility issues of female origin.
Women in LGBTQ 
relationships wishing to conceive might also have a higher pregnancy rate than those in heterosexual relationships where infertili ty 
m
ight be caused by [CONTACT_338152], sperm motility issues or erectile dysfunction (ED). The Mosie Kit is 
intended to be used to deposit semen at or near the cervix where the sperm will have an increased likelihood of entering the uterus and pairing up with the ovum resulting in a pregnancy.  Pregnancy rates increase when sperm reaches the ovum and fertilizes it. In people with no kn own 
f
ertility issues, the 
Mosie kit deposits the semen where it is able to fertilize the ovum.   People without infertility issues who want to get pregnant without sex by [CONTACT_338153]. 
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 14  Secondary      
The secondary 
objective(s) are to understand the user’s experience with the Mosie Kit and it’s safety.   Secondary endpoints are: perceived ease of use and perceived safety.  
  The perceived ease of use is being examined as a secondary endpoint because being able to follow the instructions and use the kit as designed will directly affect whether the semen is deposited at or near the  cervix having a 
d
irect effect on the results. 
Perceived ease of use is viewed as a mediating variable. 
Finally, perceived safety 
of the Mosie Kit will be examined. It is expected to be a moderating variable.   In order for the delivery of sperm at or near the cervix, the user needs to maximize the sperm drawn up into the Mosie syringe, insert it into the vagina, and deposit the sperm at or near t he cervix. 
B
ecause the Mosie 
syringe is inserted into the vagina, it is important to understand any perceived issues or concerns related to safety and use of the syringe. 
Tertiary/Exploratory
The tertiary 
objective will be to examine the pregnancy rate of people with different self-reported sources of infertility.  Given the Pandemic, exploratory effect of COVID-19 on family planning, stress and pregnancy results 
w
ill be examined. Because the reason for a person’s or couple’s infertility might affect pregnancy rates, the reason for the infertility will also be examined. This will provide information as to whether the Mosie Kit is more effective given a specific source of infertility.  
 The pandemic has caused an overall increase in stress, higher stress can affect fertility. The source of i nfertility 
m
ay play a mediating role 
in a successful pregnancy. For example, it might be more likely that a couple with a woman with no known infertility issue using Mosie might be more likely to get pregnant than a woman with a specific known infertility issue.  
Stress can play a 
mediating role in pregnancy. Concern over future stability and Women who do not have a fertility issue might be more l ikely

o get pregnant when 
the sperm is successfully deposited at or near the cervix. For example, this would help if the infertility was rooted in Erectile Dysfunction (ED).  Stress hormones can affect pregnancy outcome. Stressful and uncertain times make people more

will be invited to participate in the study. For the primary hypothesis 1, all study participants will
be treated as one group initially. Subsequently, the study participants may be divided into
groups according to their age, the type of relationships (heterosexual or LGBTQ), and/or source
of infertility to examine the hypothesis as it re lates t o these subgroups if sufficient sample size
indicates this is appropriate; this analysis corresponds to the tertiary hypothesis.
Primary hypothesis 1: Pregnancy rates using the at-home insemination Mosie Kit to
deposit semen near or at the cervix (i.e. intracervical insemination) are equivalent orbetter than traditional in doctor’s office intrauterine insemination.
Given the participants can either be people with fertility issues or people in LGBTQ relat ionships
w 
ithout known problems conceiving or single women wishing to conceive, another primary
hypothesis that will be examined is the difference of pregnancy rates in each of these groups.
Specifically, the primary hypothesis related to this is as follows:
Primary Hypothesis 2: Pregnancy rates of LGBTQ people or single women using the
Mosie Kit where the female has no know fertility issues will be higher than that of
heterosexual people with a known fertility cause or t hose t hat are designated as having
an unexplained fertility issue.
The secondary hypothesis will examine the use of the Mose Kit and its safety as perceived andreported by [CONTACT_36801]. For these hypotheses the participants will be examined as
one group as well as categorized by [CONTACT_338154]. Specifically, the
secondary hypothesis will be as follows:
Secondary Hypothesis 1: The participants perceived the Mosie Kit to be easy to use forits intended p
urpose.

Secondary Hypothesis 2: The participants were able to use the Mosie Kit as instructed               
using the instructions contained in the kit. 
Secondary Hypothesis 3: The participants reported they used the kit as intended,             
specifically, using it within 24 hours of initial signs of ovulation and again 24-48 hours                
after ovulation was confirmed or expected. Secondary Hypothesis 4: Participants reported they perceived the M
osie Kit to be a safe               
way to conceive. Secondary Hypothesis 5: The majority of participants indicate they have little to no safety               
concerns related to using the Mosie Kit. 
The tertiary hypothesis for this study dives further into the primary hypothesis by [CONTACT_338155] c ohort specific pregnancy rates.  
T 
ertiary Hypothesis 1: There will be higher pregnancy rates when using the Mosie Kit               
when the source of infertility is male-based than when infertility is female-based.  Tertiary Hypothesis 2: There is a difference in pregnancy rates of people or couples with                
known fertility issues depending on the source of their infertility. Specifically, the             
following sources of  infertility will be examined if sufficient data is available.  
○ P 
COS 
○ Endometriosis 
○ Low AMH or low ovarian reserve ○ Low sperm count ○ Sperm motility issues ○ Unexplained infertility ○ Erectile dysfunction  
○ Performance issues or sexual anxiety, or inability to orgasm with partner. ○ Vaginismus or vulvodynia ○ Tilted uterus ○ Multiple uterus/cervix ○ Loss of a fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_338120] 3: There  will be a difference between individuals who perform [ADDRESS_417911] on family expansion plans.

Tertiary Hypothesis 4: COVID-19 has affected people’s family expansion plans. 
Tertiary Hypothesis 5: There will be a decrease in pregnancy rates in those using the 
Mosie Kit during the Months of March - June. 
This study does not use randomization. While no control group will be examined for the study,               
determining the result of some of the hypotheses is based on using the reported pregnancy rate
of IUI in the literatur e. S pecifically, the reported rate of pregnancy with IUI is as high as 20% in
one cycle according to the American Pregnancy Association. According to the CDC, it can
range between 10-35% across [ADDRESS_417912] fertility rates. Women ages 20-30 are more likely to get pregnant than                 
those in their 40s. The source of infertility may also indicate underlying biological or physical                
issues that might m ediate t
he pregnancy rates causing different rates of success in each of the                 
groups. All the information obtained through this study will be used to benefit people who are                 
trying to get pregnant and are experiencing infertility issues. Specifically, the study will examine               
the viability and success rate of at-home insemination. Another benefit of conducting a retrospective study is being able to examine the natural u
se of                 
the Mosie Kit. While instructions are provided as to how and when to use the Mosie Kit for                 
MOSIE-001 © [ADDRESS_417913]              
information related to timing and dosing (with dosing being the instance of insemination). This is                
important because the results will help provide information that will help ensure future studies               
have clearer instruc tions a nd so that all users regardless of study participation optimize the use                
of the Mosie Kit in order to get pregnant.

potential participants will be invited who have purchased the kit at least 2 full months prior to                  
being invited to participate in the study. 
5.1      Inclusion Criteria 
In order to be included in the study, the following inclusion criteria will be used. 
Inclusion Criteria: 
● Provide implicit consent by [CONTACT_338156]. 
● Used a Mosie Kit to conceive during at least one cycle. 
● At least 18 years old. ● Has an active email on file (presumed or they would not have received an invitation to

completely anonymous.) 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria
The following exclusion criteria will be used.

receive multiple emails requesting their participation in the study. Specifically they will receive
emails according to the following schedule:

new deadline will be sent. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_338122] 5-30% for e mail s urveys. The rate of response is higher                
when people have a connection with the company or product. They also go up with repeated                 
reminders and incentives to participate. A good survey response rate is about 50%.  Participants who complete the survey will receive a code to purchase a future Mosie Kit at a
discount. This discount code will also be a code used in other marketing efforts in order to help                   
reduce the likelihood a participant’s status of participating in the study will remain masked.  
T
he expected response rate for this study is between 30-50%.This response rate is expected              
because the potential participants will have all previously purchased a Mosie Kit. Additionally,              
the Mosie Newsletter has about a 20% open rate so it is expected that participation might be                 
slightly higher than thi s. 
B
ecause participants will only be selected from people who have previously purchased a Mosie
Kit there will be a limit in the mix of people available for selection for study participation. This                  
means the results might not be generalizable to the public in general, nonetheless it is a                 
representative sample of the people who would do at-home insemination.

respondents and cycles. It is one of the goals of this study to f
ind out if there might be any
adverse events due to the use of the Mosie Kit.
Nonetheless, the definitions and classification for adverse events are outlined below.
8.3.1 Definition of an Adverse Event 
This protocol uses the definition of adverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untowardmedical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not
considered intervention-related. However, as a cross-sectional study, only retrospec tive
i 
nformation will be available if provided by [CONTACT_68302].
8.3.[ADDRESS_417924] or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. ER visits without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338123] a serious a dverse event. 
8.3.3 Classification of an Adverse Event
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Event 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity. 
●Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s               
daily activities. 
●Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic               
m
easures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
●Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic             
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or            
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to Study Intervention/Expe rimental Manipulation 
A
ll adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the
intervention, assessed by [CONTACT_9152]-trained clinician based on temporal relationship andhis/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using thecategories below.
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 23  
●Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship,             
and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event,            
including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time            
relationship to study procedures administration and cannot be explained by           
[CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of             
the study procedur es s hould be clinically plausible. The event must be            
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive. 
●Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the              
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal             
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the             
study procedures, is unlikely to be attributed to concu rrent d isease or other drugs              
or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal. 
●Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship             
(e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study             
procedures). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the             
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant e vents). A lthough an AE may           
rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring              
more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely            
related”, as appropriate. 
●Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test              
result, whose temporal relationship to study procedures administration makes a           
causal relationship im probable ( e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable             
time after administration of the study procedures) and in which other drugs or             
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the          
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
●Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study procedures            
administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is de finitely r elated to            
another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by            
[CONTACT_15370]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Expectedness  
There are no expected adverse events for this study.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_417925]. Due to the nature of this study, it will not be possible to follow-up with participants reporting these AEs.

                   [CONTACT_3490] 24  
8.3.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
It is unlikely that there will be any SAEs related to the Mosie Kit. Even if a participant reveals an 
SAE, because identifying information will not be collected, it will be impossible to follow up. 
8.3.7 Reporting Events to Participants

8.3.9 Reporting Pregnancy 
Pregnancy status will be obtained during the survey. It is not used as an exclusion factor. It is

sed as an outcome measure. 
8.4 Unanticipated Problems 
Given the nature of a cross-sectional one-time survey no unanticipated events are expected.
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1      Statistical Hypotheses and General Statistical Approach 
The primary objective is to understand the outcome of using the Mosie kit for Intracervical
insemination, i.e. pregnancy rate after its use. Specifically the hypothesis is as follows.
Primary hypothesis 1: Pregnancy rates using the at-home insemination Mosie Kit to             
deposit semen near or at the cervix (i.e. intracervical insemination) are equivalent or              
better tha n t raditional in doctor’s office intrauterine insemination (IUI). Conversely the           
null hypothesis is that the pregnancy rates using the at-home insemination Mosie Kit to              
deposit semen near or at the cervix do not have higher rates of pregnancy than in                 
doctor’s office IUI. 
Analysis: Comparison of total rates of pregnancy using the Mosie Kit to the 10-20% rate               
reported for IUI by [CONTACT_338159].  
P
rimary Hypothesis 2: Pregnancy rates of LGBTQ couples or single women using the              
Mosie Kit where the female has no know fertility issues will be higher than that of                 
heterosexual couples with a known fertility cause or those that are designated as having               
an unexplained fertility issue. The alternative hypothesis is that people with no known             
MOSIE-001 © [ADDRESS_417927] less pregnancies than heterosexual couples              
with known fertility issues. 
Analysis: Rate of pregnancy using the Mosie Kit will be obtained for the following groups:                
LGBTQ couples where carrying female has no known fertility issues, LGBTQ couples             
where carrying female has a known fertility issue, Heterosexual people with no known              
fertility issue, Heterosex ual p eople with a known fertility issue, Single females with no              
known fertility issue and Single females with a known fertility issue. The rates of each                
group will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and the aggregate of the 3 groups with                
fertility issues will be compared with the aggregate of the 3 groups without fertility issues.                
An ANOVA will be used to compare the differences between gr oups.
S
econdary Hypothesis 1: The participants perceived the Mosie Kit to be easy to use              
for its intended purpose. The alternative hypothesis is that the participants perceive the             
Mosie Kit to be difficult to use for its intended purpose. Analysis: Descriptive statistics surrounding the ease of use on a 5-point likert (very easy               
to very difficult) will be analyzed on five different aspects of use. Specifically, the s
teps of                 
using the Mosie Kit (collecting a sperm sample, drawing up the sample in the Mosie                
syringe, inserting the syringe, and depositing the sperm at or near the cervix) and overall                
ease of use will be examined. Additionally questions related to use such as comfort,               
ease and safety of the process, enjoyable and intuitiveness of use (able to use it without                 
instructions) will allow t he u ser to rate their experience from Strongly agree to strongly               
disagree (5 point scale). The data will be plotted and examined as part of the analysis. Secondary Hypothesis 2: The participants were able to use the Mosie Kit as instructed               
using the instructions contained in the kit. The alternative hypothesis is that the              
participants were not able to use the kit using the instructions containe d in the kit. 
A 
nalysis: Descriptive analysis of perceived overall success rate will be analyzed.            
Additionally, descriptive analysis of the frequency of each expected behavior related to             
use of the kit will be examined.  Secondary Hypothesis 3: The participants reported they used the kit as intended,             
specifically, using it within [ADDRESS_417928] to timing (within [ADDRESS_417929] ovulation). Analysis: Frequency rates related to timing of insemination at all reported cycles will be               
analyzed. The data will be reported in both total number of attempts at each time po int                 
a
s well as percentage of attempts at each time point in comparison with total cycles               
where the Mosie Kit was used. T-tests will also be used in this analysis. Additionally,                
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 26  
amount of time lying after insemination and position of lying will be analysed using               
descriptive statistics and correlations with pregnancy rate.  
Secondary Hypothesis 4: Participants reported they perceived the Mosie Kit to be a             
safe way to conceive. The alternative hypothesis is that participants did not perceive the              
Mosie Kit to be a safe way to conceive. Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to a
nalyze perceived safety. Qualitative            
analysis will be used on any comments made related to safety. Rates of vaginal               
infections will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Secondary Hypothesis 5: The majority of participants indicate they have little to no              
safety concerns related to using the Mosie Kit. Alternative hypothesis is the majority of               
participants will be very concerned or extremel y c
oncerned about the safety of using the               
Mosie Kit. Analysis: Descriptive statistics of self-reported level of concern. Additionally, safety           
measures such as hand washing, disposing of the syringe after use, and reading the               
instructions will be examined using descriptive statistics. Tertiary Hypothesis 1: There will be higher pregnancy rates when using the Mosie Kit               
when the source of infertili ty i
s male-based than when it is female-based. The alternative               
hypothesis is there will be lower pregnancy rates when using the Mosie Kit when the                
source of infertility is male-based than when it is female-based. Analysis: In addition to the descriptive statistics a t-test will be run to examine this                
hypothesis. Tertiary Hypothesis 2: There is a difference in pregnancy rates of people with known               
f
ertility issues depending on the source of their infertility. Specifically, the following             
sources of infertility will be examined if sufficient data is available.  
○ PCOS 
○ Endometriosis ○ Low AMH or low ovarian reserve ○ Low sperm count ○ Sperm motility issues ○ Unexplained infertility ○ Erectile dysfunction  
○ Performance issues or sexual anxiety, or inability to orgasm with partner. ○ Vaginismus or vulvodynia 
○ T
ilted uterus 
○ Multiple uterus/cervix ○ Loss of a fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_338124]-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 27  
The alternative hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the fertility rates 
associated with different sources of infertility. 
Analysis: Descriptive statistics, t-test, correlations and multiple ANOVAs will be used to 
examine this hypothesis.  
Tertiary Hypothesis 3: There will be a difference between individuals who perform 2 
insemination instances as described in the instructions and tho se that follow a different 
s
chedule or dosage number. The alternate hypothesis is that there will be no difference 
between the individuals that perform the minimum 2 insemination instances and those that follow  difference dosage schedule. 
Analysis: Descriptive statistics of pregnancy rates for groups with 1, 2, 3 and 4 or more 
inseminations per cycle will be used. These rates will then be compare d to determine if 
t 
here is a difference. 
Tertiary Hypothesis 4: COVID-19 has affected people’s family expansion plans. The alternate hypothesis is that COVID-[ADDRESS_417930] on people’s family expansion plans. 
Analysis: Descriptive analysis and a t-test will be conducted to examine this hypothesis. Tertiary Hypothesis 5: There will be a decrease in pregnancy rates in those using the 
Mosie Kit  during the Months of March - June. 
A
nalysis: Descriptive statistics, graphing, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis will 
be used to examine this hypothesis. 
Additional Analysis will also be conducted to explore why people might choose to use 
the Mosie Kit, how they actually use it, additional things they do when using the Mosie Kit to complement the experience, and whether they think their heal th care provider 
s 
hould recommend Mose as an conception option. Most of this analysis will be achieved 
using descriptive statistics, correlations, and t-tests. 
9.2      Sample Size Determination 
The desired final sample size for this study is 500 completed surveys. This will produce a 95%
confidence interval with +/- 4.4% within larger populations. In order to obtain that rate of
respondents, the study will invite about 50% people who have ordered a Mosie Kit in the prior
2-8 months to the study start date. It is expected that approximately 4000 people will be invitedto participate. By [CONTACT_309176] 4000 potential participants, i t i
s expected that with a response rate of
15% approximately 600 will complete the survey. Currently Mosie has about a 20% open rate
on their general emails. For this reason, all people who purchased a kit within the last 2-8
months will be invited to participate.
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 28  
According to the sample size tables, a response rate of 384 is sufficient to provide a 95%                  
confidence interval with a 5% margin of error rate. While the total number of respondents can                 
not be controlled, every effort will be made via the reminder emails to obtain at least 500                 
participants but no less than 384. 
9.3    Populations for Analyses 
The population to be analyzed include any one using the Mosie Kit in the full 2-8 months prior to
study commencement. Respondents can be male or female. Overall the data will be analyzed
as a whole and stratified by [CONTACT_4321] (having ovaries and a uterus as indication of being a female),
age and type of relationship .
9.4 Statistical Analyses
9.4.1      ​General Approach 
Statistical analysis will commence with descriptive statistics for each survey question and 
plotting of the individual data into scatter plots to understand the data distribution.If any information suggests corrective procedures should be employed, the appropriate transformation or non-parametric test will be used. 
Categorical values will be report ed using descriptive statistics and frequency of occurrence. Key 
c
ategorical values will also be converted into a percentage of total responses in order to allow 
an understanding of the prevalence of the response in the sample. For continuous variables, the 
means with standard deviations, median and range will be reported. 
Qualitative data is only expected as a response to two questions, an open e nded safety 
q
uestion and an additional comments question.The responses will be evaluated and 
categorized. Then the frequency of each category will be provided. For inferential tests such as t-tests and ANOVAs, a p-value of 0.05 and a confidence interval of 
95% will be used for statistical significance. The type of hypothesis will determine whether the specific tests will be one-tailed or two-taile d. Hypothesis seeking to understand whether there is 
o
r is not a difference will use a two-tailed test while those seeking a greater than or less than 
relationship will use a one-tailed test. Correlations among some of the variables will also be examined as appropriate. 
Statistical analysis process for each hypothesis has already been described in section 9.1. No 
baseline analysis is used for cros s-sectional studies. No interim analyses are planned for 
c 
ross-sectional one survey studies. 
9.4.2 Sub-Group Analyses 
All endpoints (primary, secondary and tertiary) will be analyzed based on age, sex, race.ethnicity, SES, relationship preference, male/femaile infertility issues. Only aggregate

Frequently Asked Questions 
Study Name: ​Retrospective Study on the Use, Efficiency, and Safety of the at-home Mosie 
Kit Short Study Name: ​Mosie Kit Survey Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_338116], Ph.D., MBA, CCDM Contact [CONTACT_7171]: [PHONE_7029] or [EMAIL_6561] 
Why am I being asked to participate in this study? 
You are being asked to participate because we are interested in learning about you r experience 
u
sing the Mosie Kit for at-home insemination. Since you have purchased at least one kit, we 
hope that you have had an opportunity to use it and can share your experience. 
How long will the survey take? 
It is expected that most people will be able to complete the survey in about 15-[ADDRESS_417939] to participate? 
No. Participation is optional, although we would really appreciate your help! The feedback you 
p
rovide is crucial for us to improve the experience for others in the future. 
Will the survey be anonymous or will I have to identify myself? The survey is completely anonymous. While we will ask some questions about your demographics (ex. race, age, income, preferred relationship), nothing will be able to identify you as the person submitting the responses. In fact, Mo sie will be sending the invitations, but our 
e
xternal primary investigator will be the one receiving the results in a completely separate 
database that can never be linked. 
Do you want both of us to participate by [CONTACT_112644] a survey? Or do you have a preference 
about who fills it out? We would prefer to have the person who was inseminated respond to the survey. But if they are not able to fill i t out, you are welcome to fill it out on their behalf. 
C 
an I forward the link to a friend? 
Please only forward to friends who have used the Mosie syringe. One of the reasons we are using a general link is to allow you to share it if you desire and the other is to make sure we keep your responses anonymous. 
I noticed the survey is being conducted in a google form. Is my data safe? 
Yes. The information you provide is transmitted safely into our Principal Investigator’s custody. 
A
ccess to it is password protected. The only person who will be able to access the survey data 
during the data collection period will be the principal investigator, who does not have access to the email list. 
MOSIE-001 © 2020 Mosie Baby                    [CONTACT_3490] 81  
Is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_338134]?  
No, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_338135]. 
Will I be compensated for my time? 
There is no cash compensation for participating in the study. However, in appreciation for sharing your experience and your time, Mosie will provide you with a discount code to be used on your next purch ase. Using this discount code will not identify you as having participated in 
t
he study as we have used it before in a prior marketing campaign. We selected this code 
because it will help keep your participation anonymous. 
What do you hope to learn from our responses? 
We hope to learn about your experience using the Mosie Kit. We are studying how well people understand our instructions and the eff ectiveness of doing at-home insemination with Mosie 
B 
aby.  
Are there any risks involved in participating in the study? There are no known risks for participating in the study. You will be asked about your conception history which can be a trigger for some folks, and if this is too much, please know you do not have to complete the survey and can exit at any time. Please know that by [CONTACT_338163] 
y
our answers will not be submitted at all. 
Why is Mosie Baby [CONTACT_56761]? Mosie Baby [CONTACT_338164]-home insemination. This study will provide us some valuable information about the product and your experience. 
How is this clinical research study different from a marketing survey? 
Marketing surveys focus on p eople’s purchasing behaviors. This clinical research study focuses 
o
n your experience with Mosie and the experience of others like you. The purpose is to 
understand your interaction with and use of the kit, the ease of use, identify any concerns over safety, understand the rates of pregnancy, and what if anything people are doing that could be beneficial when doing at-home insemination. 
Additional ly, this study has been reviewed by [CONTACT_338165] 
d

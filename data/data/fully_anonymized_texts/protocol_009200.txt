Accrual Objective  N=5-8 for phase 1  
N=24 for phase 2  
N=22 for phase 3  
Primary Study Objective  To compare antibody titers  after vaccination with Rabies vaccine in adults 
with or without use of antibiotics  
Study Design  Single center, mechanistic study with 3 phases in which subjects will be 
randomized to receive  one dose of Rabies vaccine at day 4 of a 5 day course 
of a specific ant ibiotic regimen (Group A) or Rabies vaccine  alone (Group B)  
followed by a second dose [ADDRESS_603323] strategy for sampling the 
lymph node (either by [CONTACT_470899][INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) or by [CONTACT_204808] 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
6 biopsy); phase 2 of the study will determine  if there is a difference in 
antibody response in the blood in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or 
without antibiotics. Phase 3 will compare the difference in immune resp onses in the blood and lymph node in subjects receiving rabies vaccine 
with or without antibiotics.    
Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D -35 to D -2 ), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day), D10 ( -2/+4), 
D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28  (+/- 5 days) , D29,  D35 (+/- 1 day), D38( -2/+4), D56 ( +/- 
5 days ), D180 (+/ - 14 days), D365 (+/ -14 days) post vaccination for both 
groups to study innate and/or adaptive immune responses. 
 
Stool samples will be collected in both groups at screening (from D - 35 to D 
-2), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day), D10 ( -2/+4), D14 (+/ - 2 
day), D28 ( +/- 5 days), D29, D35 (+/- 1 day), D38( -2/+4),  D56 ( +/- 5 days ), 
D180 (+/ - 14 days), D365 (+/ -14 days)  post vaccination to study the gut 
microbiome.  
Antibiotics received by [CONTACT_26374] A will be started 3 days prior to vaccination (D-3) and continued on day of vaccination (D0) and for one day after 
vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days . 
• Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
• Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
• Neomycin sulfate ® 500mg po tid  
The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each antibiotic. 
 
The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria); has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the regimen (Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® ); and  part of the regimen is used to treat 
Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin® and Flagyl®).  
 
Subjects in Group A a re asked to avoid all ethanol and any ethanol -
containing drugs while taking antibiotics and for 48h before and after taking the antibiotics.
 
Blood samples for safety laboratory testing (including CBC with differential, creatinine, potassium) will be collected at screening (from D -35 to D -2 ) and 
D 7 (+/ - 1 day) for both g roup s (phases 2 and 3) .
 
For Group A, stools will be screened for Clostridium difficile  carriage by [CONTACT_470900] (from D -35 to D-2).  
Lymph node sampling will be done once in phase 1. Lymph node sampling will be done in phase [ADDRESS_603324] vaccination in both groups .

A study on trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) done by [CONTACT_470905]. (Immunity, 2014) 
demonstrated the possible role of microbiota in enhancing vaccine immunity, supporting that the microbiome might be a determinant of vaccine efficacy.
4 They show that the immune response to 
TIV is reduced in mice that lack toll -like receptor 5 (TLR5), which is not a known sensor of viral stimuli, 
but is usually needed to respond to bacteria’s flagellin. This raised the question of the role of bacteria in modulating the immune response against viral vaccines. Therefore, they studied the immune response in germ -free mice and those that were treated with antibiotics, and found that the 
concentration of TIV -specific IgG and antigen- specific plasma cells in mice exposed to antibiotics was 
fairly reduced as compared to mice who were not exposed.
[ADDRESS_603350] the immunogenicity of rabies vaccine, and to assess the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms r esponsible for that phenomenon. Imovax ® is an inactivated rabies vaccine 
harvested from infected human diploid cells. The reason behind choosing rabies vaccine in this study is using an antigen  that people are naïve to, unlike influenza vaccine which was used in our previous 
study. To track the response of the immune system to the vaccine, we will draw blood for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) isolation and perform a fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) or core needle 
biopsy  (CNB) of the draining lymph node, before and after vaccination. Sampling of the draining 
lymph node has been shown to be a sensitive way to analyze the effector memory T cell repertoire from the skin after administering an intradermal antigen.
[ADDRESS_603351](s)/Intervention (s)  
The vaccine used in the study will be the Imovax ® rabies vaccine manufactured by [CONTACT_35346]  
(PA, [LOCATION_003]).9 Imovax ® is an inactivated rabies vaccine harvested from infected human diploid cells. 
Subjects in the study will receive the routine adult dose of 1.0 mL  given by [CONTACT_125620] (IM) 
route , in the deltoid muscle since vaccination in the gluteal area results in less neutralizing 
antibodies .[ADDRESS_603352] -exposure prophylaxis , where multiple doses of 
Imovax® rabies vaccine are recomme nded, o nly two 1.0 mL dose of Imovax ® will be given to 
participants, since seroprotection  is often obtained with only one dose  and the subjects are at no 
risk for acquiring rabies .9,10 Imovax ® will be obtained from the Emory Investigational Drug Service.  
The antibiotic regimen will be given 3 days prior to vaccination, on the vaccination day, and one day 
after vaccination for a total for 5 days.  The regimen will include the following antibiotics:  
Flagyl ® (11) ([COMPANY_007], [LOCATION_001], NY) 500 mg po tid . 
Vancocin® ( 12) (ViroPharma, Exton, PA) 125 mg po qid . 
Neomycin sulfate ® (13) (X -Gen Pharmaceuticals, Big flats, NY) [ADDRESS_603353](s)/Intervention(s) 
and Regimen  
The majority of studies demonstrating that antibiotic -mediated depletion of host microbiota 
influence s the development and homeostasis of the immune system employed a specific cocktail of 
antibiotics consisting of Ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312] (1 g/L), Neomycin (1 g/L), Vancomycin (0.5 g/L), and 
Metronidazole (0.5 g/L).  
The basis for using this particular combination of antibiotics is to enable a wide spectrum of microbial 
communities to be targeted for depletion. Indeed, at the indicated doses, this cocktail has been shown to effectively deplete more than 90% of the existing flora in the gut and drastically alter the compo sition of the microbiota.
14,[ADDRESS_603354] spectrum antibiotic regimen affecting all bacteria in the gut flora 
based on our mice experiments that includes:  Vancocin® (with activity against gram positive 
bacteria), Flagyl® (with activity against anaerobes) and Neomycin sulfate® (with activity against gram 
negative bacteria).  
Additional characteristics of antibiotics selected in the regimen include:  
- Poor sy stemic absorption for Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® (3%) when given orally which 
should result in less systemic side effects.  
- Good safety profile for all 3 of these antibiotics used for more than half a century (Flagyl® was developed in 1960, Vancocin®  in 1953 and Neomycin sulfate® in 1949).  
- Although any antibiotic can cause Clostridium difficile -associated colitis, the current regimen 
includes Vancocin® and Flagyl®, both used at the same cumulative daily dosage to treat Clostridium difficile  infectio n but administered in a shorter course of 5 days. For Neomycin 
sulfate®, the cumulative daily dosages are less than half of the minimum daily dosage used to treat adult hepatic encephalopathy and a 5- day course is same as that required for treating 
adult hepatic encephalopathy.  
This antibiotic regimen (Vancocin®, Flagyl® and Neomycin sulfate®) will be administered three days before vaccination with rabies vaccine , on the day of vaccination and one day post -vaccination in 
subjects randomized to the antibioti c group . This short course reduces the potential risk of bacterial 
and fungal superinfection, as well as preventing the development of antibiotic resistance.  
1.[ADDRESS_603355](s)/Intervention(s)  
Rabies vaccine (Imovax ®) 
The potential risks of receiving the rabies vaccine include but are not limited to: local reactions such as pain, erythema, soreness, swelling or itching at injection site (25%), systemic reactions such 
as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches and  dizziness (20%) and anaphylactic 
reactions.
[ADDRESS_603356] been reported in persons receiving booster dose (7%) ; this 
protocol will  provide [ADDRESS_603357] been reported, which resolved without sequ ela in 12 weeks, as well a 
focal subacute central nervous system disorder temporally associated with rabies vaccine. All 
systemic neuroparalytic or anaphylactic reactions to a rabies vac cine should be immediately 
reported to VAERS or [COMPANY_011] Pasteur Inc .9  
There may be other unknown side effects.  
Antibiotics  
Exposure to antibiotics poses a risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), typi[INVESTIGATOR_470857] a mild illness with diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. Severe cases of CDI have resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], colectomy, and deaths, mostly in patients with co -morbidities or the elderly. We 
excluded antibiotics with which CDI has been highly associated with, such as fluoroquinolon es. 
Flagyl®: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Flagyl® have been 
convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy.
[ADDRESS_603358], particularly nausea, reported by [CONTACT_3450] 12% of patients, and can be accompanied by [CONTACT_12704], anorexia, and occasionally vomiting; diarrhea; epi[INVESTIGATOR_22624]; and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
11   
Vancocin®: Nephrotoxicity (renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred 
following oral Vancocin ® therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur eit her 
during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >[ADDRESS_603359] common (>10%) adverse reactions associated with the use of Vancocin® in clinical trials 
included nausea (17%), abdominal pain (15%) and hypokalemia (13%). Other adverse events (>5%) included peripheral edema, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence, urinary tract infection, back pain and headache. Also, imp ortant/life -threatening side effects are rare (<1%) and include vasculitis, 
thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity.
12   
Neomycin sulfate®:  Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuromuscular blockage have been reported 
with the use of Neomycin sulfate®.13 Manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin 
tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of hearing loss continues after drug withdrawal. Subjects concurrently receiving other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs may have can have a possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin.
13 Concurrent or serial 
use of other aminoglycosides and polymyxins may enhance neomycin’s nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate’s neu romuscular blocking effects.  The most common 
adverse reactions to oral neomycin sulfate are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
13   
All three antibiotics in this regimen can lead to the overgrowth of non -susceptible bacteria.  
Lidocaine16:  
Complications of lido caine ( 1%) injection used for local anesthesia are rare, mostly seen if a major 
vessel is inadvertently injected, the recommended dose is exceeded, or as an idiosyncratic response. The immediate side effects are related to the central nervous system ( light headedness, 
confusion, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_310888] ) and cardiovascular system (decreased 
myocardial contractility, vasodilation, arrhythmias and  cardiac arrest). Allergy to lidocaine either 
immediate (urticaria or anaphylaxis) or delayed (contact [CONTACT_8748]) has been described.  In adults , 
the recommended dose is 7 mg/kg with a maximum of 500 mg.  
1.5.2 Risk of Study Procedure  
The potential risks to subjects are those associated with intramuscular administration of the rabies vaccine, possible reactions to the vaccine, having blood drawn, the risks associated with fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_470858],  and exposure to antibiotics.  
Blood draws:  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_603360] lie down prior. The blood draw site may bruise, and this can be ameliorated by [CONTACT_470906]. The sites of blood draw are potential sites of infection, but this risk is made very unlikely by [CONTACT_470907].  
Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (FNA)  or core needle biopsy (CNB) of the lymph node:  
The potential risks for fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_470859]. They include, but are 
not limited to: tenderness around aspi[INVESTIGATOR_106756], bruising, bleeding and hematoma formation, as 
well as much rarer complications: infection, allergic reaction to anesthetic, vagal reaction, numbness caused by [CONTACT_470908], and pneumothorax .
17-19 
1.5.3 Risk of Concomitant Medications, Prophylactic Medications and Rescue 
Medications  
We do not anticipate the use of any other medication; however, should anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000) and diphenhydramine injections are readily available at the Hope Clinic during vaccine use.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_470860], arrhythmia, lightheadedness, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The frequency of these side 
effects is not defined. Diphenhydramine injection may be required to treat possible allergic reactions and its use can be associated with low blood pressure, arrhythmia, confusion, dizziness, sedation , 
restlessness, diarrhea, nausea and urinary retention. The frequency of these side effects is also not defined.  
When facing a medical emergency, the clinic staff will follow the institutional SOP by [CONTACT_3379] [ADDRESS_603361]  
(Hope Clinic) or a code t o the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l on call team ( Winship Cancer Institute ). If needed, the subject 
will be transferred to Emory University Emergency Department for further care.  
Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen if they experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effect s after vaccine administration . Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen if they 
experience a moderate to severe local or systemic side effects after lymph node sampling .

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
26 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single center, mechanistic study with 3 phases in which subjects will be randomized to 
receive one dose of r abies vaccine at day 4 of a 5 day course of a specific antibiotic regimen (Group 
A) or r abies vaccine alone (Group B) ; all subject will re ceive a second dose of rabies vaccine [ADDRESS_603364] strategy for sampling the lymph node (either by [CONTACT_470910] ). The best timing of sampling is determined by [CONTACT_16303] 2 of the study and if there is a 
difference in antibody response in the blood in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or without antibiotics. Phase 3 will compare the difference in immune responses in the blood and lymph node in subjects receiving rabies vaccine with or without antibiotics.    
Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D - 35 to D - 2), on D0 
(at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day),  D10 (-2/+4), D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28 (+/ - 5 days), D29,  D35 
(+/-1 day), D 38(- 2; +4) D56 (+/ - 5 days), D180 (+/ - 14 days) , D365 ( +/- 14 day s) post vaccination 
for both groups to study innate and/or adaptive immune responses.

vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day),  D10 (-2/+4),  D14 (+/ - 2 day), D28 (+/ - 5 days), D29,  D35 (+/ -
1 day), D 38(- 2; +4); D56 (+/ - 5 days), D180 (+/ - 14 days) , D365 ( +/- 14 day s) post vaccination to 
study the gut microbiome.  
Antibiotics received by [CONTACT_26374] A will be started 3 days prior to vaccination (D -3) and continued 
on day of vaccination (D0) and for one day after vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days . 
o Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
o Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
o Neomycin sulfate® 500mg po tid  
The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each antibiotic. 
 
The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria); has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the  regimen (Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate®); and part of the regimen 
is used to treat Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin® and Flagyl®).

All medications and vaccines received by [CONTACT_470918].  This includes, but is no t limited to, the following:  
• blood products, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy (including anti -INF therapy), 
and radiation therapy (administered at any time after study vaccination).  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
39 • inactivated vaccines  (administered before the day 14  blood draw ). 
• live-attenuated vaccine  (administered before the day 28  blood draw) .  
• any antibiotic aside from the study antibiotic (taken before the day 28  blood draw).  
• any probiotics and preb iotics (taken before the day 28  blood draw).  
• any proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers, or antacids (taken before the day 28  
blood draw).  
Any of the above medications could affect the innate , adaptive , or microbiome  assay results and 
should not be used unless medically indicated.  
Upon the discretion of the PI, subjects receiving concomitant medications may still continue with 
scheduled study blood draws. Subjects receiving concomitant medications and early terminated subjects may be replaced as needed to preserve the statistical power needed to substantiate t he 
primary endpoint (refer to section 9.1 ). 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_603385] will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening study procedures. Subjects who are deemed eligible for the study (see sections 4.1 , 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4) will be enrolled 
and assigned a unique subject number. Enrollment will occur over an appro ximate [ADDRESS_603386] is approximately 13 months . 
Approximately  54 subjects will be included in the study, which occurs in three phases:  
Phase 1  
Five to eight  subjects will u ndergo both fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) and core  needle biopsy (CNB ) of 
the axillary lymph node  during one single visit  after screening . No vaccine will be given to these 
participants. A phone call will be done to ensure subject did not have significant adverse event from 
the procedure. This will help determine the preferred method of lymph node sampling that will yield the greatest amount of information on the immune response to the vaccine with the lowest rate of adverse events.  
Phase 2  
Approximately eighteen subjects will be randomized to Group A (receiving antibiotics) o r to Group B 
(not receiving antibiotics) in a 1:1 ratio. All eligible subjects will receive Imovax®  at D0  and D28. No 
FNA was performed as part of Phase 2 . 
Phase 3  
Approximately t wenty -two subjects will be randomized to Group A (receiving antibiotics) or to Group 
B (not receiving antibiotics) in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 6 subjects in each arm will undergo lymph node sampling at ( [ADDRESS_603387] and second vaccination s). 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
41 7.2 Screening Visit(s) (F rom D -35 until D -2) 
Subjects responding to study ads will contact  [CONTACT_470919] a telephone screening where the 
eligibility criteria of the subject will be reviewed. If the subject is found to be eligible and continues 
to be interested in participating after reading the informed consent (emailed or mailed to him/her), a screening appointment will be scheduled. Study staff will review the informed consent form with the subject and will answer all questions related to the study.  
Once the subject signs the informed consent, a study participation number will be assigned. The volunteer will be asked to provide demographic information and information related to his/her medical history, including current medication use and vaccination history. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded, and a targeted physical exam will be conducted as indicated, based on review of the subject’s health status. For female volunteers who are of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a negative urine pregnancy test  will be enrolled 
in the study.  
All other study procedures will differ depending on the group (A vs B) and if lymph node sampling is planned or not.  
Phase 1:  No safety labs . 
Phase 2 : Eighteen subjects will be randomized  into two groups in a 1:1 ratio.  Group A will be the 
group receiving antibiotics, and Group B will be the group  not receiving antibiotics . All subjects 
(Groups A and B) will have blood drawn for safety labs (CBC with differential, creatinine, pot assium). 
All subjects (Groups A and B) will have a stool sample collected from them . Nine subjects (Group A ) 
will be given the three antibiotics and instructed on when and how to start taking the antibiotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (D-3 until D1) . Subjects in Group A are asked to call the Hope Clinic for any symptom while on 
antibiotics.  
Phase 3 : Twenty -two subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. A ll subjects (Groups 
A and B) will have blood drawn for safety labs (to measure CBC with differential, creatinine, potassium ) and approximately [ADDRESS_603388] and second vaccinations /. 
All subjects will have a stool sample collected from them. Subjects in Group A will also be given the 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
42 three antibiotics and instructed on when and how to start taking the antibiotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (D -3 until D1). 
Subjects in Group A are asked to call the Hope Clinic for any  symptom while on antibiotics.  
This visit will last approximately 60 minut es to 120 minutes . 
7.3 Procedure (screening period or other time  points)  
Study personnel will first review the subject’s current health status, list of medications being taken, 
and note any change since the screening visit. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded. For female 
volunteers of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a 
negative urine pregnancy test will get the procedure. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be also verified before procedure . Subject will have a lymph node sampling (subjects in phase 1 will undergo both 
CNB  and FNA, subjects in phase  3 a FNA, as determined by [CONTACT_16303] 1 ). 
Phase 1: All subjects will undergo both FNA and CNB  at D0 after screening.  
Phase 2: No lymph node sampling  
Phase 3: A pproximately 6 subjects  from e ach group  (Groups A and B) will undergo lymph node 
sampling  at [ADDRESS_603389] and second vaccination s). 
 Tissue sampling of an axillary lymph node will be carried out percutaneously. The subjects will undergo FNA and/or CNB . Both procedures involve obtaining informed consent, performing a pre -
procedure “time out” with the team and subject present to confirm identity subject and the nature of the procedure. Both axillae  will be scanned with ultrasound to identify the most accessible node 
for biopsy.  Once this has been identified, the skin will be sterilely prepared, and l idocaine 1% will be 
injected intra -dermally and subcutaneously to the margin of the node in question, to confer local 
anesthesia. A small skin incision will be made. Under real- time sonographic guidance, a 21 -gauge 
needle (FNA) or an [ADDRESS_603390] Marquee automated core biopsy device (core biopsy) (Bard Biopsy, 
Tempe, AZ) will be placed. For FNA, [ADDRESS_603391] will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she develops 
any of the following: 
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department ; and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a 
complication from the lymph node sampling;  
• Development of any adverse event that limits self- care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek medical care.  
Refer to section 8.[ADDRESS_603392] be recorded and reported.  
Note:  Subjects calling the site for any of the above will receive further instructions on the proper course of action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation, if appropriate.  
This visit will last approximately 120 minutes.  
7.4 Vaccination  visit (D0 and D28 ) 
Study personnel will first review the subject’s current health status, list of medications being taken, and note any change since the screening visit. The subject’s vital signs will be recorded and a targeted physical exam will be conducted, as indicated by a review of the subject’s health status. For female volunteers of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a negative urine pregnancy test will receive the vaccine. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be also verified 
before vaccination. Subjects receiving antibiotics  will be asked if they have had any symptoms since 
starting antibiotics , and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_470868] . 
Blood for immunological assays will be drawn at this visit before administration of the vaccine as well 
as stool collection . The inactivated rabies vaccine ( Imovax® ) will be administered intr amuscularly in 
the deltoid region of the preferred arm of the participant. To ensure safety, each subject will be observed  for a minimum of [ADDRESS_603393] will be provided with a written description of local and systemic vaccine reactions of mild, 
moderate and severe intensity (Refer to Appendix B and Appendix C ).  
At the end of the visit, the subject will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she develops any of the following: 
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department; and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470869]; 
• Development of any adverse event that limits self- care activities of daily living (e.g. bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek  medical care;  
• For subjects receiving antibiotics: development of any of the following symptoms while on 
antibiotics and throughout the duration of the study:  
o diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain*  
o tinnitus**  
o vertigo**  
o decrease hearing**  
o numbness/tingling**  
• Beginning or  discontinuing any medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_470870].  
Refer to section 8.[ADDRESS_603394] be recorded and reported.  
Note: Subjects calling the site for any of the above will receive further instructions on the proper 
course of  action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation, if appropriate.  
This visit will last approximately 60 minutes.  
Note:  
*If C difficile  infection is suspected, C difficile  PCR testing will be performed. If positive, treatment 
and follow u p for C difficile infection will be facilitated.  
** if tinnitus, vertigo, decrease hearing, numbness/tingling are present, medical referral will be facilitated.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
45 7.5 In-Person Follow- Up Visits  
Phase 1: No follow -up visits are required for subjects from phase 1.  
Phases 2 and 3: All subjects will return for the study -related blood draws (innate and adaptive assays)

50 8.2 Adverse Events  
This section defines the types of adverse events that may occur, and outlines the procedures for 
appropriately adverse event collecting, grading, recording, and reporting.   
Information in this section complies with 21CFR 312; ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice; and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [Published: May 28, 2009; revised version 4.03; 
June 14. 2010, http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html]  
These criteria have been reviewed by [CONTACT_470922].  
8.2.1 Safety Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding),  symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off- label use, use in combination with another drug) and from 
any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Any grade 2 adverse event until D28 will be recorded  and reported .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug c aused the adverse event.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
51 SARs after vaccine administration may include:  
• Local reactions: hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, 
injection site swelling, pain at the site of injection, bruising of the skin at the injection site.  
• Systemic reactions: aching muscles, headache, fever, nausea/vomiting, dizziness .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) OR SERIOUS SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTION  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adver se event . 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of 
the outco mes listed in this definition.  Serious adverse events will  be reported and recorded for 
the entire duration of the study.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
52 [IP_ADDRESS] Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adve rse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of 
the investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a mor e 
severe form, might have caused death.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics or is not l isted at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if the Summary of Product Characteristics is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and c erebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Safety Monitoring  
The ISM is a physician with relevant expertise in vaccine trials whose primary responsibility will be to provide independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion and to provide recommendations regarding the safe continuation of this study.  
The ISM will evaluate safety data generated from study subjects including all SAEs against the 
known safety profile of the study vaccine to assess for possible changes to the overall risk of the study.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_603402] 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_470874]. The study has provisions for a back -up ISM to ensure that independent 
safety monitoring  happens at all times during the study. Additional roles and responsibilities of 
the ISM are described in section 8.2.4 below.  
8.2.2 Collecting and Recording Adverse Events and Pregnancy  
Adverse events may be identified during this study through any of these methods:  
1.  Examination of the subject during study visits.  
2.  Questioning the subject during study visits.  
3.  Receiving a safety report from the subject at any time during the study  
Note: subjects will be asked to call the site if they develop any of the  following:  
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department the entire duration of the study;  
• Diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain  
• Any adverse event that limits self -care activities of d aily living (e.g . bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) even if he/she decides not to seek medical care;  
• Local REs and/or systemic REs of grade 2 or higher severity after the previous visit (only until 
Day 7 Visit  or at day 35 or 7 days after lymph node sampling ). 
4. Receiving a safety report from subject in Group A if they:  
• Develop any symptoms while on antibiotics  
• Develop any of the following for the duration of the study: 
o diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or abdominal pain  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
54 o tinnitus  
o vertigo  
o decrease d hearing  
o numbness/tingling  
A complete recording of safety events in the CRF will include event term,  date(s) of onset and 
resolution/stabilization, assessment of severity, relationship to study vaccine or 
procedures/intervention(s) such as phlebotomy, expectedness, determination of whether the AE 
qualifies as serious or non -serious, treatment required, action taken with study participation, and 
outcome. AEs qualifying as serious also require a narrative of the event. Updates in safety events 
will be recorded as additional information becomes available.  
Information on pregnancies will be collected from the  time a subject signs the consent until the 
subject completes study participation.  Cumulatively monthly reports of safety data will capture any pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes at least on a quarterly basis.  
If a subject becomes pregnant after study entry, the investigator will discuss with the subject and/or the treating physician the known possible risks to the fetus.  
Subjects becoming pregnant after study entry will be withdrawn from the study and followed until the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy resulting in congenital anomaly/birth defect will be considered a SAE. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will also be reported and assessed as an SAE as needed.  
8.2.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Grading Criteria  
Adverse events will be graded according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [May 28, 2009;  revise d version 4.03; 
June 14. 2010, http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html]  
This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to 
describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
55 All adverse events whether or not listed in the NCI -CTCAE w ill be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 
according to the following standards in the NCI -CTCAE manual (A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within 
the description of the grade):  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470875]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470876], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care Activities of Daily Livin g (ADL)  refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, 
using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs; therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade selection.  
Anaphylaxis is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_364307] -like substances from mast cells, causing a hypersensitivity 
immune response. Clinically, it presents with breathing difficulty, dizziness, hypotension, cyanosis 
and loss of consciousness and may lead to death.  
Severity grading of anaphylaxis as per the NCI -CTCAE manual is as follows:  
Grade 1= not ap plicable  
Grade 2= not applicable  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
56 Grade 3= Symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral intervention 
indicated; allergy -related edema/angioedema; hypotension  
Grade 4= Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5= Death   
Severity grading of AEs of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed as per the NCI -CTCAE manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Attribution  
The site investigator will initially determine the relationship of an adverse event to the study 
vaccine or study procedures (blood draw). The investigator’s determination of causality will be 
used for FDA reporting purposes.  
The relationship of an AE to study participation will be determined using definitions in the table 
below:

subject’s clinical status and/or underlying disease  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
57 4 Probable  The adverse event is likely related to study.  There is (1) an association 
between the event and the administration of study product or study 
intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product, and (3) the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical status and  or an alternative etiology is not apparent  
5 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to study.  There is  (1) an association 
between the event and the administration of the study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the related to the study product, and (3) causes other than the study product

8.3 Protocol Deviations  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
58 Deviations occur when the Investigator, site study staff, or subjects fail to adhere to protocol 
requirements or when there is non -adherence to GCP as delineated in ICH E6 (R1) guidelines.   
Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the st udy staff will a) notify the 
Principal Investigator, and b) will complete the Protocol Deviation form. There could be a discussion between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_470880] (if needed) to determine the effect of the protocol deviation on the study subject and his/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_470881], per IRB regulations.   
Identification of protocol deviations will be done through the quality manager at the study site. Reviewing and reporting of minor protocol deviations will be discussed at the Hope Clinic monthly meetings. Major protocol dev iations will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_470880], as indicated .

59 9 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICAL PLAN  
This is a mechanistic study . Subjects with early termination status are replaced as needed to preserve 
the statistical power needed to substantiate the primary endpoint  
9.1 Sample size and power calculations  
The comparison of antibody  titer s will be based in two ways: direct comparison of antibody titers 
expressed  in international units (IU), and seroprotection rates. Phase [ADDRESS_603406] the null hypothesis of equal means with 80% 
power if the true effect size ((mean0 -mean1)/sigma, assuming equal variance) is 0.[ADDRESS_603407].  
Based on a previous study of Imovax ®, we expect the probability of  subjects without antibiotics 
treatment reach seroprotection  is close to [ADDRESS_603408] equal 
proportions of subjects who will reach seroprotection, and the alternative hypothesis is the antibiotic 
treatment lowers the proportion of subjects reaching seroprotection. The sample size of 2 0 subjects 
per treatment group will allow us 80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 0. [ADDRESS_603409] squares may be used to fill missing values. Unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA, PLSDA, clustering, and factor analysis will be used for the visualization and identification of global patterns. For descriptive endpoints, we will generate summary statistics, and visualize the data using histograms and boxplots when applicable. For the identification of innate signatures, the two treatment groups will be analyzed separately.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
60 9.1.1 Analyses of Primary Endpoint : Comparison of antibody titers at D28 post 
vaccination in both groups  
Comparison of Antibody  Titers at D28  and D56  Post -Vaccination in Both Groups  
We will take two  alternative routes for data analysis. The first is directly comparing antibody  titers 
between the treatment groups;  and the second is comparing the proportions of subjects achieving 
seroprotection from each group .  
The first data analysis route is directly comparing the means/medians of the antibody  titers between 
the two groups at D28 and D56 . The antibody  titers of each group will be summarized and presented 
using histograms and strip charts for visual comparison. We will use the t -test to compare the 
mean /median  antibody  titers between the two groups. The Wilcoxon test may also be used 
depending on the distribution of th e data.  
In addition, we will compare the two groups based on the proportion of achieving seroprotection. 
For seroprotection, we will dichotomize the outcome into D28 and D56 antibody titer ≥0.5 IU or 
D28, D56 antibody titer <0.5 IU . We will then compare t he two treatment groups by [CONTACT_14664] a 
Fisher’s exact test. We will also report the estimated proportion of seroprotection  and its 95% 
confidence interval for each group.  
9.1.2 Analyses of Secondary Endpoint : Frequency, severity, and causality of all adverse 
events in Group A subjects and all adverse events related to sampling of the 
lymph node.  
Descriptive analysis, e.g. tables and histograms, will be conducted to present severity and causality 
of all AEs. The frequency will be tabulated. Comparison between the two treatment groups will be made using Fisher’s exact test on contingency tables.  
Ad hoc analyses of correlations of reactogenicity events with innate and adaptive immune responses may be conducted.

61 9.1.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
Explorato ry Endpoint 1: Analyses of microbiome at D0, D1, D3, D7, D14, D28 , D35, D56, D180, and 
D365 and comparison to baseline screening in both groups  
Sequence results will be analyzed using the open source software package called Quantitative 
Insights  into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) .[ADDRESS_603410], which is based on a pair -wise identity threshold of 97 %.
21 Clustered sequences will be 
assigned to operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) .[ADDRESS_603411] to enable taxonomic classification and generation of phylogenetic trees for subsequent analyses .
20,23,24 
OTUs with taxonomic assignments will allow QIIME to assemble a matrix of OTU abundance in each sample. This matrix will then be used to summarize communities by [CONTACT_470924], which can be visualized together as area/bar graphs or hea tmaps. Information from 
phylogenetic trees will be used to compute distances or levels of dissimilarity between microbial 
communities using Unifrac .
25 This tool will enable compositional comparisons between samples 
(beta diversity) to be conducted. For thi s purpose, we will use the OTU matrix to calculate distance 
or dissimilarity of samples between experimental groups using weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics. Q IIME will then generate [ADDRESS_603412] of 
Independence to identify OTUs that are differentially represented across experimental groups. This tool will also be conducted and applied to the beta diversity Principal Coordin ate Analyses to help 
explain which OTUs are significantly associated with a particular experimental group.  
For longitudinal analyses of samples within each group, semivariogram plots will be generated using dissimilarity metrics over time (Euclidean) plott ed against community dissimilarity (UniFrac) .

62 Exploratory endpoint 2: Analysis of the repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from plasmablasts in 
a subset of vaccinees at D7 and D35 in both groups  
The repertoire and monoclonal antibody levels will be presented as descriptions of the actual values. 
Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize the data.  
Exploratory endpoint 3: Identification of innate immune signatures (traditional immune parameters 
measurements + array -based gene expression) at D1, D3 and D7 in both groups  
We will take the measurements on the day of vaccination as baseline. For traditional immune 
parameters, we will test if an immune parameter shows significant change over baseline at day 1, 3, 
and [ADDRESS_603413]. Fold -change (ratio between the mean 
values of the two groups) will be combined with the test p -value in a selection criterion as 
appropriate. Based on previous studies similar in nature, the tentative selection cr iterion is p -value 
≤ 0.01 and fold change ≥ 3.  
For the gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with paired design to find differentially expressed genes .
27 False discovery rate (FDR) will be used as 
selectio n criterion . The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
Exploratory endpoint 4: Correlation of innate immune signatures at days D1, D3 and D7 with antibod y 
titers at D28 and D56 in both groups  
For traditional immune parameters, we will calculate the c orrelation coefficient between the 
immune parameter and the adaptive immune response ( antibody  titers at D28  and D56) . The p -
values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune parameters that are associated with the respective adaptive immune responses. The tentative 
selection criterion is p -value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data,  we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with 
quantitative outcome to identify genes that are significantly associated with the respective adaptive 
immune responses ( antibody titers at D28  and D56 ). False discovery rate (FDR) will  be used as 
selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
63 Exploratory endpoint 5: Description of immune profiling in the blood and the lymph node at different 
time point s   
Data will be presented as descriptions of the actual values.  Summary statistics, boxplots and 
histograms will be used to summarize the data.

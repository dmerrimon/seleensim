 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:  A window  of opportunity  trial of cetuximab in patients  with head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC): examining the role of 
receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in HNSCC therapy resistance  
Précis:  This is a window of opportunity trial evaluating the hypothesis that AXL levels correlate with clinical response to cetuximab i n head and 
neck  patients.  Patients  with head and neck  squamous  cell carcinoma 
who are scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their tumor and 
are candidates for cetuximab chemotherapy are eligible to 
participate.  
 
 
Objectives:  Primary:  
1. To test the hypothesis  that low AXL correlates  with clinical 
response to cetuximab in head and neck cancer patients  
 
 
Secondary:  
1. To further  describe the safety  of pre-operative administration 
of cetuximab  
 
Correlative:  
1. To correlate  AXL expression with change  in Ki67 following 
cetuximab in HNC patients  
2. To examine  other  putative  markers  of cetuximab sensitivity 
such as HER3 and change in circulating tumor cells  
3. To establish the first panel  of patient -derived  xenografts  from 
patients with known sensitivity or resistance to cetuximab 
 
 
Population:  36 adult patients (≥ 18 years) of either sex and of any race or 
ethnicity,  who have  a biopsy  proven,  squamous  cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck, are candidates for pre- operative therapy with 
cetuximab, and are scheduled for res ection of the tumor.  
Patients  with advanced  cutaneous  head  and neck  squamous  cell 
carcinoma are excluded.

 Description of 
Intervention:   
Following informed consent, tumor tissue from the research biopsy 
and a blood draw for circulating tumor cells will be obtained. The 
patient will then receive two weekly doses of pre -operative 
cetuximab  during  the interval  between  diagnostic  biopsy  and surgery 
ensuring that no delay in standard of care (SOC) will occur.  
For dose #1, patients will receive cetuximab 400 mg/m2 via 
intravenous infusion over 2 hours (maximum infusion rate 10 
mg/min)  as per the standard of care loading regimen for cetuximab 
monotherapy.1 
For dose #2, patients will receive cetuximab 250 mg/m2 via 
intravenous  infusion over 1 hour (maximum infusion  rate 10 mg/min) 
as per the standard of care dosing regimen for cetuximab monotherapy.
1 
At the time of surgery, another blood draw will be obtained for 
analysis  of circulating  tumor  cells,  and a portion of the resected 
tumor will be obtained for study analysis.  
Correlative studies will include the measurement of proteins hypothesized to be involved in cetuximab resistance such  as AXL, 
Ki67, EGFR, and HER3 expression from both the biopsy and the surgical  specimen.  Blood will be analyzed for correlative analysis  of 
circulating tumor cells. Tissue from the research biopsy will be utilized for patient -derived xenograft (PDX) development.

 2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION  AND SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
Head  and neck  squamous  cell carcinoma,  and identification  of potentially 
actionable mutations  
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer 
worldwide with over 600,000 new cases diagnosed annually.2 In the [LOCATION_002] 
alone,  in 2017,  there were  approximately  63,000  newly  diagnosed HNSCC,  with roughly 
13,300 deaths.3 
 
Head and neck cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease that arises from various sites including the oral cavity, tongue, pharynx, larynx and salivary glands. Over 90% of tumors that originate in the oropharyngolaryngeal axis are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Treatment for HNSCC patients includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in various  combinations.  Cure  rates  have improved only marginally  over the last 30 years.
4 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], local or regional disease recurs in 30% of patients, and distant metastases appear  in 25% of patients.  The 5-year overall  survival  rate is 40%.
5 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_236897], there is a significant unmet ne ed for 
treatment of patients who undergo surgical resection of their head and neck cancer.  
 
To identify molecular driver mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the 
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network profiled 279 HNSCC tumors and identified a 
series  of mutations  and amplifications.  However,  only a handful  of identified oncogenes 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are immediately targetable with agents in 
clinical development, namely epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR), fibroblast 
growth factor receptor (FGFR), MET, cyclin D1 (CCND1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-  
kinase (PI3K)  CA13.[ADDRESS_286713]  radiation improves  absolute 
survival rates for newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients by [CONTACT_3450] 10%
7,8 and is also valuable in the metastatic/recurrent setting where 
approximately 36% of patients experience response to cetuximab based combinati on 
therapy (vs. 20% to standard therapy).9 
 
Although cetuximab offers a significant advance for many patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, nearly two- thirds of EGFR expressing patients do not 
respond to cetuximab -based therapy.  The response rate to cetuximab  alone for patients 
with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is only 10- 20%, highlighting 
the need for improved treatments.
10,11 Virtually all patients who initially respond 
eventually become refractory to cetuximab. Intrinsic  and acquired resistance to 
cetuximab is therefore a significant clinical problem in the treatment of HNSCC.12

Protocol UW18098  6/26/2020  
18 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.[ADDRESS_286714]  of cetuximab  would  be highly  valuable 
for the head and neck squamous cell cancer patient population.  
 
Primary  head  and neck  tumor  sites  and cetuximab  usage  
FDA approval  has been  issued  for cetuximab  (CTX) in the following  settings:  
i) locally  or regionally  advanced squamous  cell carcinoma of the head  and neck 
in combination with radiation therapy,  
ii) recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck  in combination with platinum -based therapy  with 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU), and  
iii) recurrent  or metastatic  squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head  and neck 
progressing after platinum -based therapy.  
 
Cetuximab is approved for squamous cell carcinomas of all head and neck sites. This 
approval includes usage in the adjuvant, recurrent or metastatic settings. In the landmark  study  of cetuximab  in combination with concurrent  radiotherapy  for treatment 
in the locoregional setting, 424 patients were randomized. Sites of primary tumor 
represented by [CONTACT_57669] 424 patients included oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. A predominance of oropharyngeal primaries was enrolled with 56% of patients randomized to the conc urrent cetuximab plus radiotherapy arm having oropharyngeal 
primaries. Sixty three percent (63%) of patients within the radiotherapy monotherapy arm had oropharyngeal primaries.
8 
 
In the EXTREME trial that led to approval of cetuximab in combination with 5- FU and 
platinum chemotherapy, 442 patients were enrolled with primary tumor sites including the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and a category of “other” unspecified squamous  cell carcinomas  of the head and neck.  Again,  the predominant  prima ry tumor 
site was the oropharynx with 36% of patients randomized to chemotherapy plus cetuximab having primary oropharyngeal cancer. Thirty one percent (31%) of patients randomized to chemotherapy without cetuximab had an oropharyngeal primary.  
Squamous  cell carcinomas  originating from “other” head and neck  sites accounted for 4 
and 10% of primary  tumors  within  the chemotherapy  plus cetuximab and chemotherapy 
alone arms respectively.
[ADDRESS_286715] commonly enrolled, accounting for 38% of enrolled patients. Laryngeal primaries acc ounted for 20%.  
Primary paranasal sinus cancers accounted for 3%, while “other” and “unclassifiable” sites accounted for the remaining  39% of enrollment.
10 Other  trials  studying 1-3 weeks 
of anti -EGFR therapy demonstrated a significant decrease in tumor si ze in operable 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.13,14

of intrinsic kinase activity. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_236899], HER3 is phosphorylated by [CONTACT_236927]-  
dimerization with other family members.
30 HER3 has 
multiple binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail for the  
regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K) to be rec ruited and thus 
transmit signals to the PI3K/Akt/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) survival pathway.
31,32 Recent  work  by [CONTACT_236928],  has found  a strong  role for HER3 
activity in therapeutic resistance.24-30,33 (Figure 1)  
 
To identify drivers of CTX resistance in HNSCC, University of Wisconsin (UW) investigators  have utilized  HNSCC human tumor  specimens,  patient -derived xenografts 
(PDXs) and a series of acquired and intrinsically resistant in vitro and in vivo model

cetuximab resistance has generated several significant findings.  
 
Tissue analysis of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient cohort (n=63) 
identified that the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL was overexpressed in both human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) positive and HPV -negative head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma tumor s and was significantly  associated with higher  pathologic  grade,  distant 
metastases, and shorter relapse free survival.

Models ( in vitro and de novo (in vivo)) of acquired resistance showed increased 
expression and activity of AXL.35,37,39 Models of intrinsic ally resistant HNSCC lines 
showed increased AXL expression and activity.35,37 Genetic ablation or therapeutic 
inhibition (antibody or small molecule inhibitors) of AXL led to increased sensitivity to 
cetuximab,  both in vitro and in vivo.35,37 Overexpression of AXL in cetuximab  sensitive 
HNSCC lines rendered them resistant, whereas a kinase dead AXL retained 
sensitivity.35 Proteomic analysis within cetuximab resistant models indicated a strong 
linkage between AXL, Src Family Kinase (SFK) and HER 3 activity; a novel pathway 
leading  to therapeutic escape from cetuximab therapy driven by [CONTACT_236929] (data 
not shown).  
 
To correlate AXL expression with clinical response to CTX, we will use both change in tumor  dimensions  as measured  by [CONTACT_236930]67 expression (% 
cells with Ki67 staining).  Ki67 staining has been  used  successfully in HNSCC (and other 
tumor types) window trials as a surrogate marker of response to cetuximab and to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of novel target ing agents and can serve as a 
surrogate for clinical response.

Highly Sensitive CTC Capture Assay  
Utilizing  several  biomimetic  technologies  at the University  of Wisconsin  (UW),  we have 
developed a novel and highly sensitive assay to capture circulating tumor cells, as illustrated in Fig. 2. First, it has a biomimetic surface that induces cell rolling. The biofunctional surface is engineered by [CONTACT_236931].

In prior work at the University of Wisconsin, the surfaces of the highly sensitive assay captured a high number of circulating tumor cells (221 circulating tumor cells per mL of blood, ranging from 36 to 1,135) from all [ADDRESS_286722] circulating tumor cells from 1 of every three HNSCC patients.
53 Importantly, when the UW results were compared to the 
previously  reported  clinica l data from similar  groups  of cancer  patients  with comparable 
or worse cancer stages using CellSearch,53,58 -60 the UW surfaces apparently achieved 
three orders of magnitude higher counts of circulating tumor cells than CellSearch (1,613 vs. 4.7 circulating tumor cells in 7.5 mL of blood). One can argue that the cells we captured could be non- circulating tumor cell s; however, the UW device captured 
only 2.1 circulating tumor cells (could be epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]) per mL from healthy donors’ blood (n=8), mitigating the concern of potential false- positive detection.

Overall Goal  and Importance  of the Study  
This clinical trial seeks  to obtain baseline tissue from a research biopsy  and circulating 
tumor cells to determine whether AXL expression pre- treatment correlates to clinical 
outcomes after two doses of cetuximab. The importance of this study is to describe if 
AXL expression can be used as a biomarker to predict clinical response to cetuximab treatment.

3 OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1 Study Objectives  
 
Primary:  To evaluate the hypothesis  that low AXL correlates  with clinical 
response to cetuximab in head and neck cancer patients  
 
Secondary:  To further  describe the safety  of pre-operative administration of 
cetuximab  
 
Correlative:  
1. To correlate AXL expression with change in Ki67 following  cetuximab  in 
HNC patients  
2. To examine other  putative markers  of cetuximab  sensitivity  such  as HER3 
and change in circulating tumor cells and other biomarkers  
3. To establish  the first panel  of patient -derived xenografts  from patients  with 
known sensitivity or resistance to cetuximab

4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This clinical trial is a single- site, single arm, open  label,  window  of opportunity  study  for 
patients  with squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head and neck. Subjects  (targeted  N=36) 
are patients who have biopsy -proven, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 
excluding advanced cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, who are 
anticipated to undergo surgical resection of the tumor, and who are candidates for cetuximab pre- operative therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed cancer or those who 
present with recurrent disease are eligible for this trial. All patients will undergo a research biopsy (in clinic or at the time of panendoscopy —not standard of care) and a 
staging workup with cross -sectional imaging of the neck (standard of care).

 Research- related procedures include a separate research biopsy of the tumor at the 
time of the diagnostic biopsy for analysis of Ki67, putative markers of CTX sensitivity, 
and research- related blood draws for collection of circulating tumor cells at five 
timepoints: screening visit, within 24 hours prior to surgery, and at follow -up visits:

definitive care. The tissue obtained for research biopsy will be placed in culture medi a 
or saline and provided to the biologic correlate study team. If pathology confirms a diagnosis other than HNSCC, the patient will be removed from the study, and the research biopsy tissue will be released to the University of Wisconsin Translational Science BioCore (TSB) Biobank. If the clinical biopsy is inconclusive, the research 
tissue will be released  back  to University  of Wisconsin Surgical  Pathology  department  to 
aid in a clinical diagnosis. The research- related blood draws will be given directly to the 
biologic correlate study team for quantification of circulating tumor cells and/or other biomarkers.  
 
Cetuximab Administration  in the Pre-operative Setting  
Cetuximab is an FDA approved chemotherapy agent for the treatment of (a) locally or regionally  advanced squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head and neck  in combination  with 
radiation therapy, (b) recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum -based therapy with 5- FU, 
and (c) recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progres sing after platinum -based therapy. Treatment with cetuximab prior to surgical 
resection is considered the investigational portion of this study, as neoadjuvant cetuximab is not considered standard of care. However, treatment with cetuximab as a monotherapy  may offer a benefit to patients as cetuximab is a known and approved 
chemotherapy agent for the treatment of head and neck cancer. In patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC with progression on platinum -based chemotherapy, 
those patients who were treated with cetuximab monotherapy had overall response rates  from 10-13% and disease control  rates  from 46-56%.
[ADDRESS_286733] of care time interval between diagnosis/consult and 
curative surgical resection is approximately 4- [ADDRESS_286734]  of care

the pathology team to access the specimen in the gross room and then will be given a portion of tissue that will not be required for diagnosis (i.e., remnant). The study team will then process  and embed  that fresh  tissue to an FFPE  block  for downstream  studies. 
Alternatively, the biologic correlate study team will request [ADDRESS_286736] -surgical complications (readmission, wound  healing, 
infection) at 1 month +/ - [ADDRESS_286737]. Receiving the two doses of cetuximab in the pre- operative 
setting  will not be grounds  for exclusion of cetuximab use at a later point.  Such  usages 
would include concurrent chemoradiotherapy,

and/or palliative monotherapy with cetuximab.10 
 
Distant  metastatic  disease and/or  unresectable recurrent  locoregional  disease will be 
managed as per the institutional standard of care.  
 
Expected duration of subject participation  is approximately  13 to 16  months. The time  to 
complete  study  enrollment  is estimated  to be 18 months.  The time to complete  the study 
analysis is estimated to be 30 months (from time of first patient enrolled to the time of last patient completed treatment).

outcome in 1 patient [Cetuximab FDA prescribing information].
8,10,62,63 
 
Approximately  90% of severe infusion reactions  occurred with the first infusion 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_236904]. Thus, patients must be monitored for at least 1 hour following cetuximab infusions in a setting with resuscitation equipment  and other  agents  necessary  to treat anaphylaxis  (e.g.,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
corticoster oids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen). For 
any subjects who experience an infusion reaction, longer monitoring may be necessary and is appropriate to confirm resolution of the event.  
 
In the event  of an infusion  reaction,  
• For NCI CTC grade 1, grade 2, and non- serious grade 3 infusion 
reaction,  cetuximab will be temporarily  held with administration  of 
emergency medications as appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]. Upon resolution of the infusion reaction, subjects may be rechallenged  with cetuximab at a reduced infusion rate.  
• For serious  grade 3 and all grade 4 infusion reactions,  cetuximab  will 
be permanently discontinued.  
• All subjects  should receive appropriate medical  intervention as 
appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]  
• Emergency  medications  to be available in the event  of an infusion 
reaction include:

• Subjects  who develop acute  onset  pulmonary  symptoms  should have the 
cetuximab withheld and be evaluated by [CONTACT_1963].  
• Subjects  who have  confirmed interstitial lung disease  after treatment  with 
cetuximab will be permanently discontinued from cetuximab treatment.  
 
Dermatologic  Toxicity  
Dermatologic toxicities, including acneiform rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial  inflammation,  infectious  sequelae  (for example,  S. aureus  sepsis, 
abscess formation, cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis/ulcerative 
keratitis  with decreased visual  acuity,  cheilitis),  and hypertrichosis  occurred  in 
patients receiving cetuximab therapy. Acneiform rash occurred in 76 –88% of 
1373 patients  receiv ing cetuximab.8,10,62,63 Severe acneiform  rash occurred  in 
1–17% of patients. Acneiform rash usually developed within the first two 
weeks of therapy and resolved in a majority of the patients after cessation of treatment, although in nearly half, the event continued beyond 28 days.  
 
• Study  subjects  will be monit ored for dermatologic  toxicities  and infectious

8 STUDY PROCEDURES /EVALUATIONS  
 
8.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations 
Criteria  for Disease  Assessment  
Assessment of Clinical  Benefit  Rate 
Response assessment of cetuximab on clinical lesions will be determined by [CONTACT_236941]- treatment 
and at the time of surgery. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  1.1 Committee
65 criteria  will be used  to define clinical response prior 
to surgery.  
 
Assessment of Disease  Recurrence 
Participants  will be evaluated for evidence of recurrence  on 2 occasions: [ADDRESS_286775] -definitive treatment (recorded for the study from medical 
records maintained as part of standard clinical car e). 
 
Given  that all known disease will be surgically  resected at the time of surgery, 
the only measure of relevance for this study will be recurrence of disease.  
Recurrence will be evaluated in this study  using the new international  criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_39694] 1.1 Committee.65 Note: Lesions are either 
measurable or non- measurable using the criteria provided below.  
 
Measurable Disease  
At baseline,  tumor  lesions/lymph  nodes  will be categorized measurable or non- 
measurable as follows (per RECIST 1.1).65 
 
Tumor  lesions:  
Measurable lesions  are defined as those that can be accurately  measured  in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
o [ADDRESS_286776] scan (CT  scan slice thickness no  greater  than 5 mm) 
o 10 mm measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately  measured  or are <10mm  should be recorded as non- 
measurable)  
o [ADDRESS_286777] X -ray.as >20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI,  x-ray) or as >[ADDRESS_286778] scan. All tumor  measurements

44 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.[ADDRESS_286779] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  To 
be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥ [ADDRESS_286780] scan.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:  
To be considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable,  a lymph  node must 
be ≥ [ADDRESS_286781] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. The measurements will be recorded for the study from medical records maintained as part of  standard 
clinical care.  
 
Non-measurable disease  
All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including small lesions  (longest  diameter  
<10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis)  as well as 
truly non- measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable 
include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly  identified by [CONTACT_236942].

8.2.2  Special  Assays  or Procedures  
Research  Biopsy  
Collection  of specimen:  In order  to participate in this study, the tumor  must  be 
large enough to allow for the correlative study endpoints to be achieved. The minimum amount of tissue to achieve this is 2 -3 core samples from the 
research biopsy with a strong preference for a cut -forceps biopsy (minimum 
recommended size: 2 x 2 x 2mm) . 
 
Remnant  Tumor  Tissue  
Collection of surgical specimen:  All specimens will go directly to the UWHC 
pathology department for diagnosis and processing. The biologic correlate study  team  will wait for the pathology  team  to access the specimen in the gross 
room and then will be given a portion of tissue that will not be required for 
diagnosis (i.e., remnant).

Collection  of specimen : the research biopsy  will also be used for correlative 
analysis of putative biomarkers of CTX sensitivity.  
 
8.2.3  Specimen  Preparation,  Handling,  and Storage  
Research  Biopsy  
Processing of specimen:  The tissue obtained for research biopsy  will be placed 
in culture media or saline, stored at room temperature and provided to the 
biologic correlate study team within [ADDRESS_286784] -surgery. The samples will be 
identified with the research study number and “research biopsy”. The label will be stripped of all patient identifiers, such as MR number or dates. If squamous cell carcinoma is NOT confirmed, the tissue from the research biopsy will be relinquished to the TSB Biobank or surgical pathology based on clinical need.  
 
Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_286785] panel of PDX from patients with known sensitivity or resistance to cetuximab.  
 
Tumor  Tissue  
Processing of specimen:  The study team will process and embed the fresh 
tissue obtained from the pathology department to an FFPE block for downstream  studies. Alternatively,  the biologic  correlate study  team  will request 
20 x 5 µm unstained FFPE slides from the diagnostic tissue  after surgical 
pathology clinical review is complete. The specimens will be labeled with the research study number, “surgical resection,” and section number, if applicable. The label will be stripped of all patient identifiers, such as the medical record number or dates.  
 
Research Tissue samples  and PDXs  within  the context of this protocol  will be

Determination  of putative  biomarkers  of CTX sensitivity  
The biologic correlate study team will formalin fix and paraffin embed (FFPE) 
approximately one third of the research biopsy tissue to be used to assess putative biomarkers of CTX sensitivity (e.g. total and phosphorylated AXL, EGFR  and HER3  expression usi ng immunohistochemistry  assays). The FFPE 
research and surgical specimens will be used to establish the change in Ki67 (ΔKi67).  
 
Correlations between the change in Ki67 index (ΔKi67) and AXL expression and HER3 expression in the research biopsy will be performed. Further correlation between  other  biomarkers  and AXL expression will be performed.  
 
Determination  of circulating  tumor  cells  
We hypothesize that changes in circulating tumor cells detected using the described head and neck cancer optimized capture approach (section 2) will correlate with response as determined by [CONTACT_97605]67. Circulating tumor cells will be quantified at each time point.  In addition,  we plan to utilize  captured 
circulating tumor cells to establish the first reported circulating tumor cell - 
derived head and neck  cancer  patient  derived  xenografts  and to compare  these 
PDXs to those established using standard techniques.

Protocol UW18098  6/26/2020  
47 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.[ADDRESS_286789] step is to identify the event using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  The CTCAE  document  provides  descriptive terminology  for adverse 
event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term.  
 
Adverse events, Serious adverse events and unanticipated problems will be recorded  on the study  eCRF’s  and reported  per section 9.4. Certain  toxicities 
are known and can be expected.  
 
Cetuximab:  
Common: Change in nails, rash, itching, dry skin, acne, dehydration,  
weight loss, loss of appetite, sores in mouth which may cause difficulty swallowing, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache,  tiredness,  pain,  fever,  infection,  especially  when  white  blood cell 
count is low, cough, shortness of breath, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia  
 
Occasional: Allergic  reaction which  may cause rash,  low blood  pressure, 
wheezing, shortness of breath, swelling of the face or throat, confusion, depression, worry, fainting, severe blood infection, blood clot which may cause swelling, pain, shortness of breath  
 
Rare:  Scarring  of the lungs,  kidney  damage  which  may require  dialysis, 
cardiac arrest  
 
Additional risks from study procedures  
Biopsy  
Possible  risks from a tissue biopsy  include  bleeding and infection.  There 
can also be some degree of pain associated with the biopsy.  
 
Blood draw  
Possible  risks include:  pain,  bleeding  and/or  bruising,  feeling faint,  infection 
with redness, irritation, and, more rarely, a blood clot in the vein at the site where the blood is drawn.

48 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.0 - 20140103   
 In addition to physical risks there is also the risk of “breach of 
confidentiality”.  If this occurs,  it will be reported  as an unanticipated 
problem.  
 
9.1.1  Unanticipated  Problems  
The Office  for Human Research Protections  (OHRP)  considers  unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the 
research procedures that  are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent  document;  and (b) the characteristics  of the subject  population 
being studied;  
• related or possibly  related to participation in the research (“possibly 
related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests  that the research  places  subjects or others  at a greater  risk of 
harm (including physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than 
was previously known or recognized.  
 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_286790], including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s  participation in the research,  whether  or not considered  related to 
the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
9.1.3  Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  is one that meets  one or more  of the following 
criteria:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening (places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death  from 
the event as it occurred)

Protocol UW18098  6/26/2020  
49 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.0 - 20140103   
 • Results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
• Results  in a persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_236907], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
9.2 Time  Period and Frequency  for Event  Assessment  and Follow -Up 
Unanticipated problems will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the duration of the study.  
 
All AE’s will be recorded from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_286791]. SAE’s wi ll be recorded 
from the time of informed consent  through [ADDRESS_286792] an attribution of possibly, probably, or definitely related to cetuximab (or other research procedures such as biopsy or 
blood draws) require reporting per table 1.  
 
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since  the last visit. Events  will be followed  for outcome information  until resolution 
or stabilization.  
 
9.3 Characteristics of an Adverse Event  
Any adverse event,  inclusive  of all related study  procedures,  will be examined 
(section 9.1).  
 
9.3.1  Relationship to Study Intervention  
The causality, or attribution, of AEs refers to the relationship of the AE to the 
experimental  intervention (drug/biologic).  The investigator,  using the following  points, 
makes the assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship:  
1. Related  (Possible,  Probable,  Definite)  
 
a. The event  is known  to occur  with the study  intervention.  
b. There is a temporal  relationship between  the intervention  and event  onset.

Protocol UW18098  6/26/2020  
50 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.0 - 20140103   
 c. The event  abates  when  the intervention is discontinued.  
d. The event  reappears  upon a re-challenge with the intervention.  
2. Not Related  (Unlikely,  Not Related)  
 
a. There is no temporal  relationship between  the intervention  and event 
onset.  
b. An alternate etiology  has been established.  
 
Based on the aforementioned points,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_236908]. Attribution categories are as follows:  
• Definite : The AE is  clearly related to the study treatment  
• Probably : The AE is  likely  related to  the study treatment  
• Possible : The AE may be related to the study treatment  
• Unlikely : The AE is doubtfully  related to the study  treatment  
• Unrelated : The AE is clearly  NOT related  to the study  treatment  
9.3.[ADDRESS_286793] been previously  identified  as resulting 
from administration of the intervention. An adverse event is considered 
unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:  
• Current  known adverse events  listed  in this protocol  
• Drug  package  insert  (for commercially  available  agent)  
 
 
9.3.3  Severity of Event  
This study will utilize version 5.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute for toxicity  and performance reporting.  A copy  of the CTCAE  version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the NCI website at: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTC AE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.pdf.  
 
9.4 Reporting Procedures  
Procedures  for Recording Adverse Events  
• AEs will be recorded from time of informed  cons ent until [ADDRESS_286794].  
• AEs will be recorded regardless  of whether  or not they are considered 
related to the study intervention.  
• AEs will be recorded in the subject’s  medical  record  and in the research 
study records.

Procedures  for Recording and Reporting Serious  Adverse Events 
• SAEs  will be reported  from time of informed  consent  until 28 days  after 
discontinuation of cetuximab or definitive surgery, whichever is later.  
• Any SAEs experienced after this 28- day period will only be reported if the 
investigator  suspects  a causal  relationship  (possibly,  probably  or definitely 
related) to the study treatment.  
• SAEs  will be reported  on the SAE Submission  Form  and entered  in SAE tab 
in OnCore within 1 business day of discovery of the event.

• SAEs  will be recorded  in the subject’s  medical  record  and on the appropriate 
study specific eCRF form within OnCore.  
• All SAEs,  regardless  of relation to study  drug,  will be followed  until resolution 
to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and/or deemed clinically insignificant and/or until a 
new anti -cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first.  
• Recurrent  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  complications,  or progression of the initial SAE will be 
reported as follow -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] [ADDRESS_286795] also be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any sponsor/funding agency not already included in the list.

Protocols subject to intermediate monitoring generally include UW Institutional Phase  I/II and Phase II Trials. These protocols  undergo review  of subject  safety 
at regularly scheduled DOT meetings where the results of each subject’s

 treatment  are discussed  and the discussion  is documented in the DOT  meeting 
minutes. The discussion includes the number of subjects enrolled, significant 
toxicities, dose adjustments, and responses observed. Protocol Summary Reports  are submitted  on a bi-annual  basis  by [CONTACT_236952].  
 
Review  and Oversight  Requirements  
• Study Progress Review 
o Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC 
in the timeframe determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quarterly; semi - 
annually;  or annually).  The PSR provides  a cumulative  report  of SAEs,  as well 
as inst ances of noncompliance, protocol deviations, and unanticipated 
problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the 
timeframe specified. PSRs for those protocols scheduled for review are 
reviewed at each DSMC meeting.  
o Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether significant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study 
suspension or closure. This information is evaluated by [CONTACT_236953] (e.g., reports  
from Internal Audits, Quality Assurance Reviews, etc.) occurring since the 
prior review  of the protocol  by [CONTACT_6802].  Additionally,  the DSMC  requires  the 
study team to submit external DSMB or DSMC reports, external monitoring findings for industry -sponsored studies, and any other pertinent study -related 
information.  
o In the event that there is significant risk warranting study suspension or 
closure, the DSMC will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15160] (e.g., suspension or closure). The 
DSMC  ensures  that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_236914] 
a clinical trial to the appropriate agenci es. DSMC findings and requirements 
for follow -up action are submitted to the CRC.  
 
 
11 CLINICAL  SITE  MONITORING 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights of human subjects are 
protected, that the study is implemented in accordance with t he protocol and/or other 
operating procedures,  and that the quality  and integrity  of study  data and data collection 
methods  are maintained.  Monitoring  for this study  will be performed  by [CONTACT_100825]’s  Clinical 
Research Operations and Management Support (CROMS) contractor. The monitor will evaluate study processes and documentation based on NIDCR standards and the International  Conference  on Harmonisation  (ICH),  E6: Good Clinical Practice  guidelines 
(GCP ).

Protocol UW18098  6/26/2020  
60 Based  on NIDCR  Clinical  Trial (Interventional)  Protocol  Template  v4.0 - 20140103   
 Details  of clinical site monitoring  will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring  Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_100826], in collaboration with the NIDCR Office of Clinical 
Trials and Operations Management (OCTOM) and the NIDCR Program  Official. The 
CMP  will specify the frequency  of monitoring,  monitoring procedures,  the level of clinical 
site monitoring activities (e.g., the percentage of subject data to be reviewed), and the distribution of monitoring reports. Some monitoring activiti es may be performed 
remotely, while others will take place at the study site(s). Staff from the CROMS contractor will conduct monitoring activities and provide reports of the findings and associated action items in accordance with the details described in the CMP. Documentation of monitoring activities and findings will be provided to the site study team,  the study  PIs, OCTOM,  and the NIDCR.  The NIDCR reserves  the right to conduct 
independent audits as necessary.  
 
[ADDRESS_286807] cetuximab resistance (CTXR)  in head and neck  cancer  patients.  Following  informed  consent,  tumor 
tissue from the pre- treatm ent/research biopsy will be obtained for further 
analysis. The participant will then receive two weekly doses of cetuximab during the interval between research biopsy and surgery, ensuring that no delay in standard of care (SOC) will occur. At the time of surgery, additional tumor tissue will be obtained for study analysis.  
 
Correlative studies will include the measurement of AXL and HER3 expression from the pre-treatment/research biopsy  as well as collection  of circulating  tumor 
cells. Tissue from the pre- treatment/research biopsy will be utilized for patient - 
derived xenograft (PDX) development.  
 
12.2 Sample Size Considerations  
We plan to enroll 36 HNSCC patients, powered on the basis of the primary study endpoint:  the clinical response rate to cetuximab according to RECIST 
criteria in low AXL vs. high AXL patients (measured using VECTRA/inForm software).  Previous  data show  that [ADDRESS_286808] (21/57 or 37%) of HNSCC patients have high AXL 
expression.
37 This sample  size is based  on 90% power  to detect  a difference 
between a response rate of 20% in the high AXL (2+ or 3+) group  vs. 65% in 
the low AXL (0 or 1) group, with an expected ratio of 2:1 low vs. high AXL expression participants. One- sided type I error was fixed at 5%.  
 
For evaluation of safety endpoints, any participant that undergoes a research 
biopsy  will be included.  For evaluation of efficacy,  molecular/correlative studies, 
and creation of PDXs, participants must receive both cetuximab doses in their

for these endpoints, then the patient will be replaced at the discretion of the 
principal investigator.

Analy sis of Correlative  Endpoints  
Summary statistics of the change in Ki67 (ΔKi67), as established by [CONTACT_236954],  will be reported  for the response to cetuximab endpoint. 
Correlation between ΔKi67 and putative biomarkers will be analyzed as a continuous variable and will be tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Correlation between two biomarkers such as AXL and HER3 expression as continuous variables wil l be investigated using Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient.  
 
Summary statistics will be used to report circulating tumor cells at each time 
point and the changes between time points. The association of change in 
circulating  tumor  cells with ΔKi67  (early  response)  will be explored graphically 
and with Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  
 
 
13 SOURCE  DOCUMENTS  AND ACCESS  TO SOURCE  DATA/DOCUMENTS  
Study staff will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in compliance with ICH E6, Section 4.9  and regulatory and institutional requirements for 
the protection of confidentiality of subjects. Study staff will permit authorized representatives of NIDCR and regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by [CONTACT_1289], to copy)  research  records  for the purposes  of quality  assurance reviews,

 2. Time  between  doses:  7 days (+/-3 days)  
3. Informed  consent  to be obtained  within  28 days of starting  treatment.  
4. If screening/baseline procedures  are within  7 days prior  to cetuximab  dose 1, they don’t  need  to be repeated  on day of dose 1. 
5. Serum  chemistry  should include:  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  bicarbonate,  BUN,  creatinine,  glucose,  AST,  ALT,  alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, calcium, magnesium, protein, albumin.  
6. A negative  serum/urine  pregnancy test is required  within  7 days prior  to cetuximab  dose 1. 
7. For subjects  with unresolved treatment -related  toxicity,  follow  as medically  appropriate  until resolution  or stabilization.  
8. Pre-surgical  blood draw  for circulating  tumor  cells in serum  should be done  within  1 day prior  to surgery.  
9. Prior  to dose 2, required  labs:  magnesium,  calcium  and potassium  
10. Definitive  therapy  is defined  as surgery  alone,  surgery + XRT  or Surgery  + chemoXRT

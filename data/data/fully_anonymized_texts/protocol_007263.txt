Study Title: Randomized Controlled Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38940]’s Disease  
 
Objectives  
1. Examine the effect of 12 weeks of 10mg dapagliflozin once daily on cerebral n-
acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) . 
2. Explore the effect of dapagliflozin on 
a. Systemic NAA levels in blood and urine.  
b. Cerebral metabolism (fluorodeoxygluc ose [FDG] PET).  
c. Systemic metabolic biomarkers that indicate and quantify secondary 
metabolic effects.  
d. Cognition 
3. Examine the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in individuals with AD  including 
Mild Cognitive Impairment due to AD) . 
 
 
Design and Outcom es   
 
This is a double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, parallel group, 12- week study performed 
at a single site (KU ADC) to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin in participants with probable AD  or MCI due to AD .  A total of 48 participants will be enrolled with 2:1 randomization to 10mg 
dapagliflozin once daily (n=32) for 12 weeks vs matching placebo (n=16).   
 The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of 12 weeks of 10mg dapagliflozin 
once daily on cerebral NAA (a proxy measure of mitochondrial mass) in participants with AD  or 
MCI due to AD .   
 
Exploratory outcomes will be assessed with phlebotomy, urine collection, MRI/MRS, FDG -PET, 
cognitive testing, DEXA scanning, and indirect calorimetry at baseline and 12 weeks.  These 
procedures will allow us to assess:  
• N Acetyl -Aspartate (NAA)  
o Cerebral NAA (as measured by [CONTACT_38692])  
o Systemic NAA levels (in blood and urine)  
• Cerebral metabolism (by [CONTACT_38967])  
• Systemic metabolic effects  
o Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL)  
o Plasma beta -hydroxybutyrate  
o Insulin resistance (Hemoglobin A1c, glucose and insuli n during tolerance 
testing)  
o Catabolic/Anabolic state [activated AKT and MTOR]  
o Mitochondrial function measures [platelet cytochrome oxidase and citrate 
synthase]  
o Inflammatory mechanisms [MCP -1, eotaxin, TNF alpha, CRP]  
o Body composition (DEXA scanning for fa t and lean mass)  
o Resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry).   
• Cognitive effects will be assessed at baseline and week 12 using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS -Cog14) and individual 
tests of Logical Memory I and II,  Trailmaking A and B, and Stroop Word Color Test.  
• 12 participants will be enrolled in an optional MRI/MRS sub- study with repeat 
MRI/MRS prior to randomization to assess scan- rescan reliability of the NAA 
measure.   
 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  5 Safety and tolerability of dapagliflozi n (10mg daily) will be monitored throughout the study and 
formally at every study visit by [CONTACT_38968] (AE’s), measuring vital signs 
and body weight, and performing safety labs (including a comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP] 
and compl ete blood count [CBC] with differential).  In addition, we will conduct physical and 
neurological examinations at screening and at end of treatment (EOT). We will examine the 
incidence and severity of AEs and the rate of discontinuations due to AEs.   
 
Interventions and Duration  
Participants will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to either dapagliflozin 10mg a day vs matching 
placebo for a treatment duration of 12 weeks.  The total study duration for participants will be 
will be up to 18 weeks.  In- person screening and baseline assessments will occur within a 4-
week time -window prior to randomization.  Study drug (or placebo) will begin at randomization 
(time 0) and in person assessments will occur at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks (when study drug is stopped) and an end of study visit at 14 weeks.  
  
Sample Size and Population  
A total of 48 participants with probable AD  or MCI  due to AD  will be enrolled in the study with 
2:1 randomization to 10mg dapagliflozin (n=32) vs matching placebo (n=16) for 12 weeks. To minimize potential risks that may associate with weight loss we will only enroll participants 
whose BMI is greater than or equal to 23.0.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
 
2.1.1  Alzheimer’s Disease  
 
Increased life expectancy in the US has fueled an unprecedented growth in the 
prevalence of AD, with over [ADDRESS_40733] the disease by 2050. AD is now America’s most expensive disease (~$259 
billion), more costly than cancer and heart disease.[ADDRESS_40734] led, in part, to a diversifying portfolio of 
approaches that includes targeting neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, synaptic activity, 
vascular function, and mitochondrial and metabolic function.   
 
2.1.2  AD and Energy Metabolism  
 
Abundant evidence demonstrates aberrant energy metabolism occurs in AD.2-26   Energy 
metabolism  research constitutes a major component of our federally supported 
University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center (KU ADC) (P30AG035982), with 
investigators focused on defining the nature, causes, and consequence of altered 
energy metabolism in AD.  The KU ADC supports an Alzheimer’s Treatment Program (ATP) that conceptualizes, translates, and tests approaches that target energy 
metabolism for AD treatment and prevention.
27-33 
 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and mitochondria studies 
demonstrate perturbed energy metabolism in AD.
[ADDRESS_40735] measures of metabolism in brain tissue homogenates from 
individuals with AD show less glucose consumption than control homogenates.44  
Electron microscopy reveals perturbed mitochondrial structures6, 45- 47 and increased 
mitochondrial fission.48-50 Several mitochondria- localized enzymes, including pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex,51 α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex,14 and cytochrome c 
oxidase (COX) demonstrate reduced activities.12, 13, 52- [ADDRESS_40736] partly depends on 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).34, 63, 64 Additionally, asymptomatic individuals at higher risk 
of AD (both due to the presence of an APOE4 allele or an AD -effected mother) also 
show AD -like gluco se utilization patterns on FDG -PET.23, 24, [ADDRESS_40737] of exercise and diet,30, 32, 69- 74 the causes and 
consequences of altered insulin signaling,75-77 developi[INVESTIGATOR_38941],78 and developi[INVESTIGATOR_38942].27-29, 33, 79, 80   
 
To date, clinical trials that intentionally target energy metabolism in AD include coenzyme Q and idebenone (to enhance electron transfer through the electron transport 
chain),
81-84 rosiglitazone (promote mitochondrial biogenesis),85, 86 and latrepi[INVESTIGATOR_38943] 
(claimed to stabilize mitochondrial membranes).87, [ADDRESS_40738] no physiologic engagement of their 
intended targets (coenzyme Q, idebenone), concentrations insufficient to alter targets (rosiglitazone), or a profoundly limited understanding of their mitochondrial effects 
(latrepi[INVESTIGATOR_38943]). This experience underscores why rational bioenergetic medicine design 
must consider existing mechanistic data and pursue new mechanistic insight.

2.1.3  Dapagliflozin and Metabolic Effects  
 Dapagliflozin is a sodium -glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to treat Type 2 
diabetes.  The SGLT2 inhibition results in a loss of glucose and its associated energy via 
the urine.  This has prominent systemic metabolic effects in Type 2 diabetes, resulting in reduced HbA1c and body weight.  In a 2- year study, dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c by 
0.3%, weight by 4.5kg and fat mass by 2.8kg (Bolinder et al 2013). The reduction in body weight is faster over the first few weeks, followed by a more gradual decline that plateaus between 24 and 50 weeks of therapy (Bolinder et al 2012). Insulin sensitivity 
increased, as measured by a 20% increase in glucose disappearance rate , after 12 
weeks of 5mg dapagliflozin (Mudaliar S et al 2014), a finding that was also repeated in a 2 week study (Merovci A et al 2014).  Dapagliflozin also results in increased hepatic 
glucose production, increased fasting glucagon levels, and decreased fasting insulin levels (Merovci A et al 2014). An increased glucagon/insulin ratio is expected to reduce 
hepatic de novo lipogenesis and in parallel increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation that 
results in reduced liver fat content.    
 Additionally, chronic dapagliflozin treatment led to robust increases in systemic measures of NAA, which is synthesized within mitochondria and considered a biomarker 
of mitochondrial mass (confidential Metabolon data).  Inducing mitochondrial biogenesis 
to mitigate or reverse failing AD bioenergetics is increasingly considered a rational AD 
therapeutic goal, and dapagliflozin represents a logical agent for achieving this goal.

dapagliflozin 10mg daily for 12 weeks on cerebral and systemic NAA, secondary 
metabolic effects (glucose, insulin, ketones, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], mitochondrial function, inflammation), cognitive function, and safety and tolerability.  
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_40740] on cerebral NAA (a proxy 
measure of mitochondrial mass), explore other metabolic effects, and to collect information to further understand and establish its safety and tolerability in our target 
population.  
 
Participants will be randomized to either 12 weeks of 10mg dapagliflozin once daily vs 
placebo to examine potential effects on cerebral and systemic NAA (reflective of mitochondrial mass or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]- related carbon flux) and other potentially beneficial 
secondary metabolic effects.  This study will be conducted in individuals with AD or MCI  
due to AD with a BMI greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_40741] to diet and exercise to improve glycemic 
control in patients with type 2 diabetes.  The recommended dose is 10 mg orally once daily at any time of the day regardless of meals.  There are no dose adjustments 
required or recommended for individuals with renal impairment, geriatric patients, or 
those without diabetes.  Thus, the dose of dapagliflozin 10mg daily will be used in this study.   
 2.3 Benefit/Risk and Ethical Assessment  
 This study will provide important data on the potential role of dapagliflozin in treating individuals with AD or MCI due to AD .  Additionally, it will provide data to better 
understand the role of therapeutically targeting metabolic processes as a treatment strategy for individuals with AD  or MCI due to AD .  Advancing these scientific themes 
benefits humankind though it may not provide clear clinical benefits to those enrolled.   
 There are, however, potential clinical benefits for those enrolled in this study, including 
potentially beneficial effects on glucose and insulin levels, blood pressure, and body weight.   
 
Establishing the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in AD  and MCI due to AD  is a goal 
of this study.  Dapagliflozin is associated with small increases in AEs including urinary tract and genital infections (dysuria, polyuria, vulvovaginitis, balanitis) and back pain which occurred more commonly in placebo- controlled studies in the dapagliflozin group 
versus placebo.   Other potential AEs include orthostatic hypotension and volume 
depletion. The risk for hypoglycemia is low even in diabetics treated with mono therapy.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
 
4.3.1  Recruitment  
Participants for this trial will be recruited through the KU ADC’s Recruitment program.  
Methods include referrals from KU Memory Disorders Clinic, referrals from outside physicians, regular community outreach / education seminars about KU ADC currently 
enrolling trials, and posted IRB- approved advertisements on social or other traditional 
media.  
 
Once an individual contacts the KU ADC indicating interest in the trial, a full intake of information for recruitment consideration is obtained through the KU ADC Recruitment 
and Eligibility program, with the potential participant’s consent.  During the initial pre -
screening process, if it is determined that medical records are needed to assist in making an initial eligibility determination, the potential participant (or their legally 
authorized representative) is asked to complete a Release of Medical Information form and records from the potential participant’s applicable physicians are requested and 
obtained.  If the potential participant appears to be a good candidate for the trial, their 
recruitment intake information is provided to the study team for further review and 
discussion with the potential participant and his/her study partner.  
 
4.3.2  Informed Consent, Screening, and Enrollment  
The potential participant and his/her study partner are provided with the informed 
consent form (ICF) for their review prior to scheduling a study screening visit. Any initial 
questions they may have are addressed.  It is explained to potential participants and 
their study partners that, although some eligibility criteria (such as age and medical conditions) can be determined ahead of time, many eligibility criteria cannot be 
determined until after all screening procedures take place.  
 It is also explained to the participant that, due to the nature of this trial enrolling 
individuals with known cognitive impairment, there may be a need for the participant’s 
legally authorized representative to actually provide the consent for their participation 
using a surrogate consent form, with the participant providing his/her assent.  The assessment and determination of whether the participant has sufficient capacity to 
provide his/her own consent is made during the consenting process at the first study visit 
by [CONTACT_38969].   For this reason, it is established with the 
potential participant prior to the screening visit who has legal authority to serve as 
his/her representative per the state of Kansas, the state in which all study procedures take place.   If any legal documents, such as durable power of attorney, are available, 
these will be requested to be brought with t he participant to the first study visit.  
 Following the screening visit, the results of all eligibility testing are provided to the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_38944]. The investigator documents review and whether the participant met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria.  A clear 
statement of the investigator’s determination for the participant’s suitability to be enrolled 
in the trial is documented prior to any subsequent baseline procedures taking place.  
 Participants who fail to meet the eligibility criteria will be excluded.  Participants who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_40747] their final disposition, including whether they were determined to be 
ineligible/screen failed, were enrolled and completed the study, and whether they were 
enrolled but withdrew or their participation was stopped early.  The reason for screen 
failure and for withdrawal/early termination will also be recorded.  
  
Eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 10 mg dapaglifozin (n=32) 
or matching placebo (n=16). Randomization will be completed by [CONTACT_38970] a randomization table to create the order of dispensing active vs. 
placebo. This unblinded staff member will use the table to create code numbers for the bottles of study medication and will be responsible for labeling the bottles in a manner to 
ensure blinding of all other study staff.  A second unblinded staff member will assist in 
labeling of the bottles to provided second verification of correct labeling and will also 
serve as a back -up to provide randomization bottle numbers to blinded staff if needed.  
 When each participant has been determined to be eligible for the trial, the blinded staff 
member will submit a request to the unblinded staff member for randomization.  The unblinded staff member will provide the blinded staff member with a document listing 
only the participant identification number and the bottle numbers to be dispensed.

Protocol Version [ADDRESS_40752] of 7 study visits.  The more intensive baseline and week 12 visits will 
require 3 to 5 trips to different locations.  Primary study visits will be conducted at the 
Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CTSU), 2 MRI sessions will be conducted at the 
Hoglund Brain Imaging Center to acquire MRI/MRS data, and 2 FDG PET sessions  will be 
conducted at the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The visits and detailed study procedures 
are outlined below.   
 
6.2.1 Screening Period (Visit 1)  
 The initial screening visit will occur in the Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CTSU) as a single visit to complete the following procedures:    
• Informed consent  
• Medical history  
• Review of concurrent medications  
• Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) administered by a trained psychometrician  
• Blood and urine collection for safety labs  
• Vital signs  
• Height measurement using a standard stadiometer  
• Body weight measurement using a calibrated scale  
• A physical and neurological examination.  
• If the participant is a female of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted.   
• Adverse event (AE) review/check  
• Review of inclusion / exclusion criteria  
 The screening period lasts up to 4 weeks and includes the time from signing of the 
consent form until enrollment.   At or before Visit 1, the study details will be explained to 
the participant (or his or her legally authorized representative) and the study partner.  Before any study procedures take place, full informed consent will be obtained and 
documented.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Description of Screening Procedures  
 
Review of Medical History:  A complete medical history will be obtained, including a history 
of cognitive impairment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
Review of Concurrent Medications:   Ongoing concurrent medications taken by [CONTACT_2416] (including prescription and over -the-counter/vitamins/herbal supplements) and 
any medications taken within 30 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) will be recorded.  
 
Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE):  The MMSE will be completed at screening and Week 
12 (Visit 6).   The MMSE is a brief, 30- item questionnaire that is widely used to provide an 
estimate of the severity of cognitive impairment at any given point in time.  Lower scores indicate greater impairment.   
 
Vital Signs:  Body temperature, sitting and standing blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart 
rate, and body weight will be measured at every study visit.  At the screening visit, height 
will also be measured.  
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  20  
Physical and Neurological Examination:  The study clinician will conduct a physical 
examination  at screening and all visits,  of the participant’s skin, head, neck, nose, throat, 
eyes, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, and muscles to check for signs of disease. During the 
neurological examination, the study clinician will check the participant’s ment al status, 
cranial nerve function, motor system, sensory system, reflexes, coordination, gait, posture, 
and stability.  If any abnormal signs are detected in these examinations that the 
investigator determines to be clinically significant, the participant will not be eligible for the 
trial. 
 
Clinical Safety  Urine and  Laboratory Tests:    Approximately 8 ml of blood will be drawn at 
Screening Visit 1 and all subsequent visits  to assess a comprehensive metabolic panel 
(CMP) and complete blood count with diffe rential (CBC) in the fasting or non- fasting state.  
Fasting state will be recorded at time of collection. Baseline and Week 12 blood draws will 
be done in the fasting state at the same time as the collection of blood for the biomarker 
outcome assessments.  A urine sample will also be collected for routine safety tests at all 
subsequent visits.  
 
On screening labs, if eGFR is < 45 mL/min /1.73m2 , the participant will not be eligible to 
enroll in this trial.  If AST is  >3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or ALT  is  >3x ULNand/or  
total bilirubin  is >2.0 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L), the participant will not be el igible for this trial.  If 
any other clinical laboratory findings from this screening visit are abnormal and determined 
to be clinically significant, the participant will not be eligible for this trial.  
 
Urine Pregnancy Test:   Female participants who are still of child- bearing potential must 
undergo a urine pregnancy test at the screening visit.  Any participant with a positive 
pregnancy test will not be eligible for the trial.  
 
Review of Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria:   Once all screening visit procedures are complete, 
the principal investigator, or his/her delegate in his absence, will review the findings to 
make a determination of whether the participant has met  all inclusion criteria and not met 
any exclusion criteria and whether the participant is suitable to enroll in the trial.  This review will be conducted before any Visit 2 / Baseline procedures are conducted.  
 
 
     6.2.2   Baseline and Enrollment Visit (Visit 2)  
 
Baseline procedures may begin anytime following completion of all screening 
procedures and determination that the participant meets entry criteria.  Baseline measures may be completed in any order to accommodate the participant and 
scheduling limitations of ancillary support facilities with the exception that the dispensation of the study medication occurs last.  This final baseline procedure must be 
completed within 30 days of Visit 1/ Informed Consent.   
 Baseline measures to be completed include:  
• Review of concurrent medications  
• Review of adverse events  
• Vital signs  
• Weight  
• Blood and urine collection for clinical safety laboratory tests  
• Blood collection for blood biomarker outcome measures  
• Urine collection for N AA testing  
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  21 • Physica l examination  
• Cognitive battery  
• MRI/MRS  
• FDG -PET 
• Metabolic assessments  
• Study medication dispensation and instruction  
 
Description of Baseline Procedures  
Prior to administering any study medication, the following baseline measures will be 
completed:  
 
Blood Biomarker Outcome Measures:  Blood will be collected in the AM (after an 
overnight fast to assess biomarker outcomes at Baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 12 
(Visit 6).   Approximately [ADDRESS_40753] the following 
biomarker assessments. Specific blood collection and processing instructions will be 
defined in a separate laboratory manual.  
• Apolipoprotein E genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (at Baseline only) using a validated allelic discrimination PCR assay (Swerdlow Lab) . 
• NAA using UPLC -MS/MS method sent to Reed Laboratory to quantify .  
• Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (LDL, HDL, triglycerides) at the KU Clinical Lab  
• Serum β -hydroxybutyrate levels at the KU Clinical Lab 
• HgbA1c at the KU Clinical Lab 
• Mitochondrial, inflammatory, catabolic/anabolic state biomarkers and banking of 
additional fluid for future potential purposes will be collected and sent to the 
Swerdlow lab for processing.  
o The platelet fraction is used for platelet mitochondrial COX activity and CS measurements.  
− COX Vmax activity is determined as a pseudo first order -
rate constant (sec
-1/mg protein) by [CONTACT_38973] c  at 550 nm.12, 89- 91    
− The CS Vmax assay is performed spectrophotometrically by [CONTACT_38974] 5- thio-2-nitrobenzoate (412 
nm) following the addition of 100 μM oxaloacetate at 30°C,
89, 91, 92 and when referenced to protein yields a value 
in nmol/min/mg protein.  
o The lymphocytes are used to prepare protein lysates that w ill be 
immunochemically analyzed to assess the catabolic/anabolic 
state by [CONTACT_38975]. 
o The platelet free plasma will be used to perform ELISA measurements of the inflammatory biomarkers: Monocyte chemotactic protein 1( MCP -1; also called CCL2), eotaxin- 1 (also 
called CCL11), and plasma tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and C-reactive protein.  
o Samples will be banked for future potential uses (metabolomics, exosome analyses, etc).   
 
Urine n -acetyl aspartate (NAA):  A urine sample will be collected at Baseline (Visit 2) 
and at Week 12 (Visit 6) to assess NAA in the Reed Laboratory.    
 
Metabolic Assessments:   This 3- hour visit will occur in the CTSU after a [ADDRESS_40754] and the following metabolic assessments  will be completed:  
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_40755] Calorimetry: Resting metabolic rate will be assessed using indirect 
calorimetry which measures CO2 production and O2 consumption to calculate 
total energy produced. The subject will rest quietly for 10 minutes in an isolated 
room with the temperature controlled to 18- 22 degrees centigrade. Subsequently,  
an Oro- Nasal Mask (Hans Rudolph- 7450 Series Silicone V2 ) will be placed over 
the subject’s nose and mouth.   The subject will continue to rest quietly while the measurements are taken for up to 30 minutes. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_38951] a Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 system. Criteria for a valid metabolic rate is a 
minimum of 15 minutes of steady state with steady state determined as less than 
10% fluctuation in minute ventilation and oxygen consumption and < 5% fluctuation in respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] . RMR will be calculated using the Weir 
equations.
215 
 
Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry (DEXA):  Body composition will be assessed 
using dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (GE Lunar iDEXA) to determine fat -free 
mass, fat mass, and percent body fat at baseline, and week  12. DEXA uses very 
low X -ray doses (0.02mREM) to detect changes in body composition on the 
order of 1.6 -3.8%.177, [ADDRESS_40756]:   An Oral Glucose Tolerance test (OGTT) will be 
conducted in the CTSU to determine glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Participants will be provided a standard 75g oral glucose bolus  followed by [CONTACT_38976] 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120min, a time  course that 
allows for accurate estimation of both insulin secretion and action.
93  Glucose will 
be assayed with a YSI 2300 Analyzer. Whole blood will be collec ted into EDTA -
plasma Vacutainer tubes for analysis of insulin using plasma ELISA assay (Alpco).  We will calculate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.
 
 
 
MRI / MRS: MRI/MRS scans will be obtained during a 1.5- hour visit to the KUMC 
Hoglund Brain Imaging Center.  Given the theoretical issue of diurnal variations in cerebral NAA, we will obtain longitudinal MRI / MRS scans at approximately the same time of day (+/ -) 2 hours at baseline and week 12.  MRI/ MRS data is obtained using a 
3T system (Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]) equipped with a [ADDRESS_40757] scout MR images 
are acquired followed by [CONTACT_38977]. We will acquire MRS data from a 
chemical shift imaging (CSI) slab oriented oblique- axial, parallel to the AC -PC line,  in 
the fronto- parietal area, superior to the lateral ventricles.  From this CSI slab, we will 
determine concentrations of NAA, creatine, choline, and  myo- inosit ol, and glutathione 
(GSH)   from the same location using a multiple- quantum filtered CSI sequence 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Choi (Co- Inv). Both NAA (the study’s primary outcome measures) 
and GSH are known to represent mitochondrial and neuronal integrity. MR spectra will 
be analyzed using the LCModel package and in- house MR data processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_38953].  
 
Optional MRS Sub- study:  A total of 12 participants will be enrolled into an optional 
MRI/MRS sub -study.  These participants will undergo an additional MRS scan during 
the baseline period. The scan will be conducted within 2 weeks of the original baseline 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  23 scan, at approximately  the same time of day  (+/-) [ADDRESS_40758] prior to any study drug dosing. This second scanning session will be used to 
assess scan -rescan reliability of the NAA measure compared to their baseline 
measure.   
 
 
FDG PET :   FDG PET images will be obtained during a 1.5 -hour visit to a satellite 
location of the University of Kansas Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38954] (Visit  2) and at Week 12 (Visit 
6).  The scanner is accredited by [CONTACT_38978] (ACR), and our 
physicists perform annual required testing by [CONTACT_38979] 
18F to assess SUV range, contrast resolution, spatial resolution, and uniformity. In addition to the ACR annual testing, the nuclear medicine department routinely 
performs quality control procedures on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis.  Subjects 
will arrive for FDG PET after having fasted for a minimum of [ADDRESS_40759] a 
catheter placed for IV administration of FDG.  Subjects will receive a single IV bolus of FDG.  After the appropriate amount of time has elapsed, frames are reconstructed to a 
single PET image in native space. Adverse events will be continuous ly monitored 
during the imaging session. The radiation dose from the two FDG PET scans our 
subjects will receive will not exceed 2100 mrem. While this amount of radioactivity 
obviously exceeds the amount obtained through normal background exposure, it is s till 
considered by [CONTACT_38980].  
 
Cognitive Battery:  A cognitive battery will be conducted at Baseline (Visit 2) and at 
Week 12 (Visit 6).  The battery will include the ADAS -Cog 14, Stroop Color Word test, 
Trailmaking test (A and B) and Logical Memory I and II.  It will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete these measures.  The ADAS- Cog is a measure of cognition that is 
widely used in clinical trials.  The 14- item version includes measures of delayed recall, 
attention, and executive function and is considered more sensitive to change than the original 11- item version.  We are also performing additional individual tests of verbal 
memory (Logical Memory I and II) and executive function (Stroop Color -Word test and 
Trailmaking).  
  
Study Medication Dispensation and Instruction:   The final baseline procedure to be 
completed will be dispensation of the study medication.  The participant will receive a 
one-month supply of study medication.  Both the participant and the study partner will 
be instructed in study medication dosing, as the study partner will oversee that the medication is taken per instruction.  The participant will be instructed to take one 10  mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_38955], starting at the baseline visit. The study 
medication can be taken anytime during the day and with or without meals but should 
be taken at about the same time every day.   
 
 
 
6.2.3    Treatment Period  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Week 1 (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5) Safety Assessments  
 At each of these visits, participants will return to the CTSU to assess for safety and 
tolerability of the study drug.  Participants will undergo a review of concurrent 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  24 medications, a physical examination, review/check for any adverse events, vital signs 
including body weight and clinical safety laboratory tests .  
 
Procedures (described above) completed at these visits: 
• Review of concurrent medications  
• Review/check for any adverse events  
• Vital signs  
• Physical examination  
• Body weight  
• Blood and urine collection for clinical safety laboratory tests  
• Study medication c ompliance check (Week 4 & Week 8 only)  
• Dispensation of study medication (Week 4 & Week 8 only)  
 
At weeks 4 and week 8 visits, compliance will be assessed and study medication will be 
dispensed.   
• Study Medication Compliance Check:  The participant will be asked to return 
all used and unused study medication containers for an assessment of 
study medication compliance.  A percentage compliance will be calculated 
for each of these time points.  
• S tudy Medication Dispensation:   (Week 4 &  Week 8) At these visits, 
another 30- day supply of study medication will be dispensed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Week 12 (Visit 6) Safety and Other Outcome Assessments  
 
Safety assessments and outcome measures will be completed after 12 weeks (Visit 6) of 
intervention, including the following:  
• Review of concurrent medications  
• Review/check for any adverse events  
• Vital signs  
• Body weight  
• Physical and neurological examination  
• Blood and urine collection for clinical safety laboratory tests and biomarker 
outcomes  
• Urine collection for NAA levels  
• Cognitive battery  
• MRI/MRS  
• FDG PET  
• Metabolic assessments  
• Study medication compliance check  
 
The Week 12 (Visit 6) procedures may be completed in any order depending on ancillary 
facility scheduling availability and participant convenience, but all Week 12 procedures 
will be completed while the participant continues to take the study drug (+/ - 7 days of the 
12-week time point).  As a result, participants may take the study drug for up to 13 
weeks in duration.   
 
A description of each procedure listed can be found above under Screening or Baseline 
Visit procedures.  
   
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  25 6.2.4 Follow Up Period: End of Study Visit (Visit 7)  
At week 14, two weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743], participants will return for a final visit to 
the CTSU to assess for a final safety check.  
The following procedures will be conducted:  
• Review of concurrent medications  
• Review of adverse events  
• Vital signs, including body weight  
• Physical examination  
• Blood and urine collection for clinical safety laboratory tests (fasting not required, 
but is acceptable. Fasting status will be recorded) ) 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_40760] infections, genital 
infections, and weight loss.  When used as monotherapy, the risk for hypoglycemia was 
low and similar to those taking placebo.  Higher rates of hypoglycemia were seen when 
dapagliflozin was used in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin therapy.  A s mall 
reduction in blood pressure has been seen in patients treated with dapagliflozin.   
 
 
Hypoglycemia:  Dapagliflozin promotes glycosuria. Hypoglycemia has been reported with 
dapagliflozin, especially with dapagliflozin as an add- on to sulfonylureas or insulin. In 
studies with dapagliflozin used as monotherapy, or as add- on to metformin or pi[INVESTIGATOR_38956] 102 weeks (ref).  
 
Increase in hematocrit and serum phosphorus:  Other AEs reported with dapagl iflozin 
include an increased hematocrit (+2.3% compared to Baseline versus -0.33% in the 
placebo group) and serum inorganic phosphorus (+0.13 mg/dL vs - 0.04 mg/dL in the 
placebo group).   
 
Ketoacidosis:  Ketoacidosis has been reported in post -marketing studies in patients with 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes.   
Infections: Treatment with dapagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract and genital 
infections. The most frequently reported genital infections are vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females, and balanitis in males. Most patients responded to an initial course 
of standard treatment, and these infections rarely caused discontinuation from the study.  
 
Weight loss:  Urinary glucose excretion induced by  [CONTACT_38981].  The majority of weight reduction is body -fat loss (rather than 
lean tissue) and fluid loss.  In a [ADDRESS_40761] a higher risk of hypoglycemia with dapagliflozin and GLP -1 agonists may influence cognitive outcomes and will be excluded. Ketoacidosis 
has been reported with dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes and patients with type 1 diabetes will be excluded from the study. Since the efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal 
function, we will exclude individuals with an eGFR below 45 ml/min/1.73m2 .   
 
In addition, participant safety will be ensured through education, clinical assessment, and 
laboratory testing.  
 
Education:  Dapagliflozin has been associated with reduced blood volume.. Participants 
will thus be educated on symptoms of volume depletion such as lethargy, fatigue or dizziness.  Before initiating dapagliflozin, volume status will be assessed and suspected 
hypovol emia will be corrected through increased oral intake.   
 For early diagnosis of infectious AEs associated with dapagliflozin, participants will also be 
educated on the signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections, vaginal yeast infections, 
and balanitis,  such as dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary frequency, tenderness, 
pruritus or erythema in the genital areas.  
 
Clinical assessment:  Assessment of fluid status with vitals and physical exam will be 
performed at baseline visit before initiating dapaglifl ozin. Symptoms of hypovolemia will be 
assessed at all visits during therapy.  Sitting and standing blood pressure and body weight 
will be assessed at every visit. At each visit, participants will be evaluated  and provide a 
urine sample for signs and symptom of urinary tract or genital infections , and treated 
appropriately as indicated.  Participants will be encouraged to increase fluid intake in 
those with evidence of hypovolemia.   
  
Laboratory testing:  Safety laboratory testing will be conducted at baseline, week 1, week 
4, week 8,  week 12, and week 14 to monitor for acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, 
dehydration, infections, ketoacidosis, and hypo - or hyperphosphatemia. Laboratory tests 
included will be: complete blood count with differential (hemoglobin,  hematocrit, red blood 
cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophil count, basophil count), comprehensive metabolic panel (blood 
urea nitrogen, creatinine, eGFR, albumin, calcium, bicarbonate, glucose, potassium, 
sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,  and 
aspartate aminotransferase) and serum phosphorus. Fasting lipid panel will be checked at 
baseline and week 12 to monitor cholesterol including LDL-C .   
 In addition to these labs, a safety urinalysis  will be performed at every visit . 
 
Weight Loss: Body weight will be assessed at baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, week 12, 
and week 14/end- of-study.  If total weight loss reaches 5% of total body weight compared 
to baseline and is associated with any concomitant clinical symptoms (fatigue, weakness, reports of cognitive worsening, etc), the study drug will be held or stopped per the judgment of the investigator.   
 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_40762] (IP) will be considered 
for individuals per the judgment of the investigator for those who develop orthostatic 
hypotension or other symptoms of volume depletion, renal impairment, weight loss greater 
than 5% total body weight at baseline, ketoacidosis or other AEs judged to be related to 
the study drug.   
Overdose:   An overdose is defined as a patient receiving a dose of IP in excess of that 
specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.  
Any overdose of a study patient with the investigational product., with associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the 
sponsor and [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e -
mailbox (see Section 1.[ADDRESS_40763] information). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE 
must also be recorded as an AE. Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, 
but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE (see Section 1.6 ).  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE)  is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended 
diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease, 
which occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, 
appears to worsen.  Adverse events are to be recording regardless of their relationship to 
the study intervention.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence,  occurring after the signing of the informed consent through the follow- up 
period that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  that results in death, is life 
threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, ,
 an important medical event that may 
jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.. or is a congenital anomaly.  
 All SAEs will be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.  The causality of SAEs (their 
relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008].  
 AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent until end of study (week 14). 
 The following variables will be collected for each AE;  
• AE term, using the diagnosis if known, or signs or symptoms when  diagnosis is not known  
• The date when the AE started and stopped  
• Maximum intensity (mild, moderate or severe)  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to investigational product 
• Outcome.   
• In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  28  Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
 Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
 Criterion that classifies AE as serious  
 Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Date of discharge  
 Probable cause of death  
 Date of death  
 Autopsy performed  
 Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
 Description of AE.  
 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
 All AEs (related or unrelated to the study intervention) will be reported quarterly to the 
Safety Officer for review.  A summary of these quarterly reports will be provided to the KU 
IRB on an annual basis.  In addition, expedited reporting to the KU IRB will follow IRB 
guidelines.   
 
Serious Adverse events i.e. Suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse, reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
will also be reported to the FDA in an expedited fashion, following these guidelines:  
• Within 7 calendar days  
Any adverse event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
• Within 15 calendar days 
Any adverse event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life- threatening 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when 
event was deemed reportable).  
The investigator must inform the FDA, e.g. via a MedWatch form, of any serious or 
unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of [ADDRESS_40764] be emailed concurrently to 
[COMPANY_008] (TCS vendor) at the time the event is reported to the FDA. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to compi[INVESTIGATOR_38957] a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines and to ensure that 
these reports are also submitted to [COMPANY_008] at the same time.  
• Sponsor must also indicate, the causality of events in relation to all study 
medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression, as determined by 
[CONTACT_458].  
• Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by [CONTACT_38982]’s designated mailbox: 
[EMAIL_661]  
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  29 • If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow- up 
information must also be provided to [COMPANY_008] and the FDA.  
• Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still 
need to be reported to [COMPANY_008].  
• The investigator will report to [COMPANY_008] any unblinding that occurs due to critical patient safety concern related to an SAE.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_40765] dose administration. Any  unresolved AEs considered probably  study  drug 
related, will be followed up by [CONTACT_38983].   
 
 7.6    Safety Monitoring  
 
A safety officer with expertise in clinical trials and in use of SGLT2 inhibitors will be appointed to monitor drug safety.  The safety monitor will review AE’s and study data 
quarterly and advise the study team on additional monitoring if needed  or need f or 
termination of study in case of unexpected serious AE’s.  
 
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the safety officer, study participants are 
placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that are assessed to be  
causally related to the study drug.  
  
Safety measures to be reviewed by [CONTACT_38984], laboratory abnormalities, AEs, and discontinuations.  These safety measures will be carefully collected and 
recorded by  [CONTACT_38985].   
  
 
[ADDRESS_40766] (IP) in the following situations:  
• Participant withdrawal of consent. The participant is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment.  
• Adverse Event. The investigator may elect to discontinue the participant from treatment if he feels it is in the best interest of the participant.  
• Significant noncompliance (<80% medication compliance) on the part of the participant with the study protocol 
 
At any time, participants are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e. IP and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A participant that decides to 
discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse 
events  (AEs). If the participant is discontinued from IP, the participant will be asked to 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  30 return to site for an optional safety follow- up visit. The study drugs should be returned by 
[CONTACT_38986].  
 
If a participant withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her 
enrolment/randomization code will not be reused. Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.  All data available for the participant at the time of discontinuation of follow -up will 
be recorded.  All reasons for discontinuation of treatment will be documented.  
  
 
[ADDRESS_40767] of the study drug on cerebral NAA.  
Secondary and safety and tolerability measures will also be collected and compared 
between treatment groups.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Forty -eight (48) subjects will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to either treatment (n=32) or 
placebo (n=16).  Our sample size of 48 subjects was determined consistent with our 
primary objective of estimation rather than hypothesis testing; the latter (hypothesis 
testing) we deemed more appropriate for confirmatory studies that we anticipate will f ollow 
this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  We anticipate the results of this study will inform the power 
calculations of those subsequent trials.  Thus, we base our sample size justification on 
providing sufficient precision for estimating our effect with a 95% conf idence interval.  
Assuming 32 subjects in the active group and 16 subjects in the placebo group  and allowing for up to 15% attrition  our sample size of [ADDRESS_40768] deviations for a 95% 
confidence interval.  This magnitude of the half- width of the confidence intervals (0.[ADDRESS_40769] deviations) was derived from the confidence interval formula for estimating a difference between two treatment means using quantiles from a t distribution, using the 
pooled variance formula for a common variance, and post -attrition group sizes of 27 and 
13 subjects. From Kalra, Cashman, Genge, and Arnold (1998, NeuroReport  9, 1757 -61), 
estimated standard deviations for changes in NAA/Cr both in treated and control 
conditions were approximately 0.2.  For the regression techniques to apply that we 
described below, we anticipate our results will produce similar sized magnitudes for 
estimating the standard deviations for this study (i.e., we anticipate our confidence 
intervals to be within a magnitude of approximately 0.14).  
 
9.2.1  Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment or placebo based on the randomization 
schedule developed by [CONTACT_38987].  This procedure will be balanced 
within random block s to increase the balance between treatments over the recruitment 
period.  Treatment order within blocks will be determined by [CONTACT_38988] a uniform distribution using a pseudo -random number 
generator on a statistical software package.  
9.3 Interim analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_38958]. 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  31 9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1  Primary outcome   
MR spectra will be analyzed to determine the concentration of NAA (as a continuous 
measure) using the LCModel package and in- house MR data processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_38959].  
 
9.4.2  Exploratory outcomes   
MRS Measures :  In addition to NAA, we will assess the concentration (as continuous 
measures) of several other neurochemicals including glutathione, creatine, choline, myo-inositol, and glutamate+glutamine from the same location using a multiple- quantum 
filtered CSI sequence. 
 
Cerebral metabolism by [CONTACT_38967]:  PET images will be analyzed using custom software 
written for Statistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SPM12). Pre- and post -intervention P images 
will be co -registered. A priori regions of interest  masks from the Automated Anatom ic 
Labeling series will be inverse warped to match native space images. The PET images will be standardized to the uptake value of the cerebellum and standardized uptake 
value ratios (SUVR) will be calculated from native -space ROIs.  
 
Systemic metabolic measures  will be continuous measures.    
o Systemic NAA levels (in blood and urine)  
o Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL)  
o Plasma beta -hydroxybutyrate  
o Hemoglobin A1c  
o Glucose and insulin Area Under the Curves (tolerance testing) 
o Catabolic/Anabolic state [activated AKT and MTOR]  
o Mitochondrial function measures [platelet cytochrome oxidase and citrate synthase]  
o Inflammatory mechanisms [MCP -1, eotaxin, TNF alpha, CRP]  
o Body composition (DEXA scanning for fat and lean mass)  
o Resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry).   
 
Cognitive performance will be assessed using the ADAS -cog 14 (total score) and 
individual performance scores on Trailmaking A and B, Stroop Word Color test, and Logic al Memory I and II.  
 
9.4.3  Safety Outcomes  
 
We will examine the incidence and severity of AEs and the rate of discontinuations due 
to AEs.  Additionally, we will examine changes in cognitive performance, body weight, 
and laboratory values observed during the course of the study.  
9.5 Data Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be carried out on all subjects 
enrolled. Continuous variables will be summarized (using number of participants, mean, 
standard deviation, and percentiles) by [CONTACT_6982]. For baseline, all end- of-
study measurements, the changes, or relative changes from baseline will be presented by 
[CONTACT_38989].  Categorical variables will be 
summarized, by [CONTACT_1570], using frequency count and the percentage of 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  32 participants in each category.  This will facilitate assessment for independence in these 
baseline measures across treatment groups, which we anticipate given treatment will be 
allocated at random.  (Notably, this inference of independence is equivalent to testing for no difference in proportional distributions across treatment groups.)  
 The primary objective is estimation, so we will generate 95% confidence intervals  for 
“adjusted” treatment means and their differences based on the formulas analogous to an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)/ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model hypothesis testing procedure.  For these models we will use the baseline measure as a 
covariate , including assigned treatment as a fixed effect, and change from baseline 
measure  (i.e., follow- up minus baseline)  as the response/outcome measure.  To deem the 
adequacy of normal distribution quantiles for confidence interval estimation we will carry out the residual analyses to assess the assumptions of that test for each measure.  In the 
event that the residual diagnostics (including residual vs. predicted value plots, quantile-
quantile plots, etc.) do not conform to the underlying normality and other assumptions of 
this test, we will revert to nonparametric rank-based approach using ANCOVA as 
described above with ranks used instead for the response to derive model -based p -values .  
For categorical measures, we will use confidence intervals based on the Wald estimat e of 
the standard error in comparisons of proportions between assigned treatment for 
dichotomous responses/outcomes  if the expected cell counts (under the hypothesis of 
independence) for corresponding contingency tables are at least five in most (>80%) cel ls.  
If the expected cell counts are not sufficiently large, we will instead estimate using exact, 
Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals.  
 
To assess scan -rescan reliability for NAA on the 12 subjects, we will estimate the variance 
in the difference scores between each of these 12 subjects ’ pre-randomization MRI/MRS 
scans.  This will provide information on intra- individual scan- to-scan variation for 
consideration as we interpret differences (time one minus time two) estimated between 
treatment groups.  
 
As on ly pre - and post -treatment measures are obtained, subjects missing post -treatment 
follow- up measures will be excluded from these analyses.  
 
 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
10.1 Data Collection  
Data collection will initially be captured on paper case report forms (CRF’s) in real time by 
[CONTACT_38990].   
 
10.2 Data Management  
Data from paper CRF’s will be entered into a secure electronic database, accessible only by [CONTACT_38991], housed on an institutional server.  
 
Designated study staff will review the data entered into the eCRFs for completeness and 
accuracy and make any required corrections or additions.  
 
Protocol Version 8 .0, 22JAN2021  33 10.3 Quality Assurance  
 
10.3.1  Training  
 
Study staff will complete Good Clinical Practice and HIPAA training prior entry on the 
study roster. Training and certification will be completed based on study role as 
appropriate.  
 
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
 
No Quality Control Committee will be appointed for this single- site trial. Quality will be 
assured through trained staff following Good Clinical Practice standards and appropriate data validation of the eCRF through range limits, data audit trails and appropriate role-based access to forms. The study Statistician will review these metrics quarterly.  
 
10.3.3  Metrics  
 
Missing and out -of-range values will be queried in the eCRF and reported on a quarterly 
basis to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_38960].  
 
10.3.4  Protocol Deviations  
 
Protocol deviations and adverse events will be captured at all study contacts by [CONTACT_38992], recorded on eCRFs, and reported to the PI. Documentation of the deviation or 
adverse event will be kept in the participant’s paper chart. 
 
10.3.5  Monitoring  
 
The Data Monitoring plan for this trial focuses on monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_38961].  Before study initiation, the study team will review the protocol and eCRFs. During the study, the study team will employ several methods of ensuring protocol and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance and the quality/integrity of the data. The 
Investigator will maintain source documents for each participants in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and 
medical information, laboratory data, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on the eCRFs will be traceable to these source documents in the 
participant’s file. The Investigator will also keep the original informed consent form  
signed by [CONTACT_2299] (a signed copy is given to the participant). Checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs will be performed using validation tools in 
the eCRF software. Review of the rate of participant accrual and adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur during the recruitment phase to assure that 
participants meet eligibility criteria.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_40770] (IRB) Review

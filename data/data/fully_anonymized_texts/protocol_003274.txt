TITLE : Retrospective Experience of CIED Implantation with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_484863] t o retrospectivel y gather inform ation on 
patients who underwent a CIED pro cedure with either a CanGaroo,  
Tyrx envelope, or no envelope.   
DESIGN  A single center will retrospect ively review up to 700 subjects who 
underwent implantation of a C IED with CanGaroo, Tyrx, or no 
envelope.  All sets of subjects en rolled will also be examined for any 
follow-up visits and/or advers e events that occurred up to [ADDRESS_623086]-surgery. 
STUDY 
POPULATION  Male or female patients who underwen t a CIED implantation utilizing 
CanGaroo hydrated in saline, Can Garoo hydrated in Antibiotic, T yrx, or 
no envelope. 
ENDPOINTS  The endpoints will be defined as: 
1. The incidence of major i nfection post procedure. 
2. Any pocket related issues that prompted an office visit 
CLINICAL 
PARAMETERS  The following clinical data will be collected  
 Demographic information 
 Risk factors for infection 
 Surgical procedure 
 Type of device implanted 
 Envelope soak solution used 
 Post procedure information on m ajor infections as defined 
below 
 Post procedure information on pocket related issues 
 Post procedure information on hematoma 
DURATION  Data will be collected for a minimum of one post-surgical visit  after CIED 
implant for all groups.  If more v isits are available, data fro m those visits 
will be collected up to [ADDRESS_623087]-procedure.

according to U.S. and international standards of Good Clinical Practice in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and 
institutional researc h policies and procedures. 
 
Broader indications for the imp lant of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) and 
population aging are the main reas ons for the continuous increa se in the use of pacemakers, 
implantable cardioverter-defibr illators, and devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy.  
The rate of infection is out of proportion to the increase in implantation rate. T his is primarily 
due to the comorbidities in CIED patients, the greater complexi ty of the devices, and the 
increased duration of procedures.1,2,[ADDRESS_623089] will  be excluded from the stud y based on gender, racial, or 
ethnic origin. Patients will not  be contact[CONTACT_484865]-identified data will be collected. A 
waiver of Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization will be requested from the IRB.   
 
Each patient’s medical records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_484866], incl uding demographic information, ris k factors for infection, 
information about the surgical procedure, type of device implan ted, and post procedure 
information on infection, pocket related issues, and hematoma information will all be 
collected for each subj ect. Data will be collected retrospectiv ely using Electronic Data 
Capture (Medrio). 
 
CIED infections are defined as (1 ) superficial cellulitis in th e region of the CIED pocket with 
wound dehiscence, erosion, or purulent drainage, (2) deep incisional or organ/space 
(generator pocket) surgical site  infection that meets the Cente rs for Disease Control and 
Prevention criteria, independent f rom time of surgery, (3) pers istent bacteremia, or (4) 
endocarditis. 
Major CIED infections are defined as a CIED infection resulting  in one or more of the 
following: 
 CIED system removal 
 Any invasive procedure (e.g., pocke t opened) without system rem oval

3. Study Objectives 
 
The objective of the study is to: 
1. The objective of this study is to retrospectiv ely gather inf ormation on patients who 
underwent a CIED procedure with either a CanGaroo, Tyrx envelop e, or no envelope.   
Endpoints 
The endpoints are defined as: 1. The incidence of major post proced ure infection (as defined abo ve)  
2. Any pocket related issues that pr ompted an office visit which i nclude but are not limited 
to pain, swelling, redness, mi gration and/or hematoma 
4. Risks and Benefits 
4.1.Risks 
As this is a retrospective study, there are no physical potenti al risks to research subjects.   
There may be risks associ ated with loss of privacy. 
4.2. Benefits 
As this is a retrospective s tudy, there are no physical benefit to individual research subjects; 
however, society and physicians w ill benefit from the knowledge  gained. 
 
5. Data Analysis   
Since this is a retrospective study, analyses will consist of tabulated data and descriptive 
statistics. Subject data listi ngs and tabular and graphical pre sentations of the summary and 
statistical results will be pr ovided. Additional quantitative and qualitative comparisons will 
be made between the groups of subjects, contemporary literature , and similar studies.  
Statistical comparisons betwee n treatment groups (CanGaroo vers us Tyrx versus no 
envelope) will be performed using Fisher’s exact test or Chi-sq uare tests for categorical 
variables.  Continuous variables  will be analyzed using ANOVA.   A log rank test will be 
performed to compare the time to infection between the CanGaroo , Tyrx, and no envelope 
treatment groups at all of the follow-up visits.

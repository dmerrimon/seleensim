 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Study purpose and description 
Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring the AdaptResponse study; a prospective, randomized, controlled, 
interventional, single-blinded, multi-center, post-market, global Cardiac Resynchronization 
Therapy (CRT) in heart failure (HF) clinical study. The purpose of this clinical study is to test the 
hypothesis that market released CRT devices which contain the AdaptivCRT® (aCRT) algorithm 
have a superior outcome compared to standard CRT devices in CRT indicated patients with 
normal atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction and left bundle branch block (LBBB). 
To assess the superiority of CRT devices containing the aCRT algorithm, the primary objective 
of the AdaptResponse study is to test the hypothesis that AdaptivCRT® reduces the incidence of 
the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and intervention for heart failure decompensation, 
compared to standard CRT therapy, in patients with a CRT indication, LBBB and normal AV 
conduction. The secondary endpoints will include the components of the primary endpoint, 
Clinical Composite Score (CCS) and time to atrial fibrillation (AF).  
Intervention for heart failure decompensation (HF event) is defined as an event requiring 
invasive intervention (i.e. IV diuretics, ultrafiltration, or equivalent) or  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Following enrollment and baseline assessment, eligible subjects will be implanted with a CRT 
system containing the aCRT algorithm and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either treatment 
(aCRT ON, Adaptive Bi-V and LV) or control (aCRT OFF, Nonadaptive CRT) groups. All 
subjects, independent of randomization assignment, will receive a CRT system. Study subjects 
will be followed until the minimally required number of endpoint events is reached or until study 
closure, whichever occurs first. 
1.[ADDRESS_148368], Taiwan and the US. 
Approximately 3500 subjects will be randomized in the study. Proposed study start date is 01 
June 2014. 
To ensure a widespread distribution of data to minimize bias in the study results, the maximum 
number of subjects randomized at a single center is 200 subjects. There is no specific minimum 
number of randomized subjects required, except where stated in the clinical trial agreement 
between the sponsor and the individual center. 
The study utilizes an “event-driven” study design. Enrollment will end when approximately 3500 
patients are randomized or there is reasonable certainty that the required number of events will 
be reached, as determined by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC), whichever occurs first. 
The study may be stopped early if the average enrollment rate is less than 0.[ADDRESS_148369]

 been satisfied per the Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) and/or a decision by [CONTACT_13735], Ethics 
Committee, or regulatory authority, whichever occurs first.  
Accordingly, the expected total study duration is approximately [ADDRESS_148370] participation will vary based on timing of their enrollment; however, at a 
minimum, participation of an individual subject is expected to be 30 months unless early study 
exit occurs. 
1.3 Study oversight 
The Steering Committee  (SC) is responsible for the scientific content of the study and provides 
input for the execution. The SC will also approve requests for crossovers and will review 
accuracy rates of LBBB (as determined by [CONTACT_131454]). 
The Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) provides oversight for the overall conduct of the study, 
and specifically for subject safety and scientific validity. The DMC will review interim results of 
the study. 
The Endpoint Adjudication Committee  (EAC) will adjudicate the HF- and AF related 
endpoints. 
The ECG Core Laboratory  will review all baseline ECGs for presence of LBBB and normal AV 
conduction. Feedback on accuracy rates will be presented to the Steering Committee and to the 
sites.  
  
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148371] commonly achieved by [CONTACT_131455] (BiV) pacing, multiple acute5 and 
randomized chronic6 studies have demonstrated that left-ventricular (LV) pacing can be at least 
as efficacious as BiV pacing.  In patients with sinus rhythm and normal AV conduction, pacing 
only the LV with appropriate AV delays can result in even superior LV5,7 and right-ventricular 
(RV)8,[ADDRESS_148372] BiV pacing.  
Optimization of the AV and inter-ventricular (VV) intervals during BiV pacing is another option to 
maximize the positive effects of CRT.10,11 Optimization is usually accomplished by [CONTACT_131456]. However, these methods can be resource-intensive and 
only a minority of clinicians routinely optimizes AV and VV delays. 
The AdaptivCRT (aCRT) algorithm has been developed to provide RV-synchronized LV pacing 
when intrinsic AV conduction is normal or BiV pacing otherwise. The algorithm also adjusts AV 
and VV delays based on periodic automatic evaluation of intrinsic conduction intervals. The 
algorithm is intended to provide ambulatory CRT optimization and allow more physiologic 
ventricular activation and greater device longevity in patients with normal AV conduction by 
[CONTACT_131457].  
The Medtronic Adaptive CRT pre-market approval study has demonstrated that aCRT-optimized 
CRT is at least as effective as echo-optimized BiV pacing in terms of CCS (73.6% improved in 
aCRT arm vs. 72.5% in echo optimized arm, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%, p=0.0007)12.  
Additionally, a comparison with a historical echocardiographic AV-optimized CRT cohort 
indicated that the aCRT algorithm increased the proportion of patients with an improved CCS by 
11.9% (95% CI: 2.7% to 19.2%).[ADDRESS_148373]-hoc sub-analysis of the Adaptive CRT study showed that in patients with sinus rhythm, 
normal AV conduction and LBBB, more aCRT patients improved in their CCS compared with the 
echo arm (80.7% vs. 68.4%, p=0.04). In this subgroup the aCRT patients received LV-only 
pacing 64.0% ± 32.8% of the time.12  
Additionally, in an unpublished analysis on extended follow-up duration in patients with normal 
AV conduction, 
. Also, a greater proportion of aCRT patients improved in CCS at 6 
months (81% vs.69%, p=0.041) and 12 months (77% vs. 66%, p=0.076) than echocardiography-
optimized control patients.14  
Use of the aCRT algorithm is associated with a significant reduction in the probability of a 30-day 
readmission after both HF and all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131411] 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 16 of 115

 the Adaptive CRT study. For HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], the 30-day readmission rate was 19.1% (17 of 
89) in the aCRT group and 35.7% (15 of 42) in the Echo group (odds ratio: 0.41; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.19 to 0.86; p = 0.02). For all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the 30-day readmission 
rate was 14.8% (35 of 237) in the aCRT group compared with 24.8% (39 of 157) in the Echo 
group (odds ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.94; p = 0.03). The risk of readmission after HF or all-
cause index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131412] [ADDRESS_148374]-hoc sub-analysis results

Furthermore, over the longer-term follow-up (20.2 + 5.9 months ) the aCRT algorithm has been 
shown to reduce the risk of the incidence of 48 consecutive hours in AF (HR=0.54 [95% CI 0.31-
0.93]; p=0.03) and aCRT patients without history of AF were less likely to develop persistent AF 
(HR=0.44 [95% CI 0.19-1.03]; p=0.05).15  
Birnie D. et al compared in a sub-analysis of the Adaptive CRT study, the long-term effects of 
aCRT versus conventional CRT pacing on the incidence of AF. During the follow-up period, 
8.7% of patients with aCRT and 16.2% of patients with conventional CRT experienced the 
primary outcome of an AF event of >48 hours, which was a 46% reduced risk with aCRT (hazard 
ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.31–0.93; P = 0.03) compared with conventional CRT 
patients. [ADDRESS_148376] the hypothesis that the aCRT 
algorithm reduces the incidence of total mortality and heart failure decompensation events, 
increases the proportion of patients with an improved CCS and reduces the incidence of AF in 
CRT patients with normal AV conduction and LBBB.25

 3. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE 
The study will be conducted using market released CRT-P and CRT-D devices containing the 
aCRT algorithm, Medtronic market released LV leads, and any market released RA and RV 
leads. All system components will be implanted per intended use as specified in the respective 
manuals. Medtronic may incorporate additional Medtronic CRT-P and/or CRT-D devices 
containing the aCRT algorithm, or devices containing an update of the aCRT algorithm, LV 
leads, programmers and software into this clinical study as they become commercially available, 
provided the scientific soundness is not adversely affected as assessed by [CONTACT_131458]. Additional commercially available devices should not be used until notification from 
Medtronic is received. Instructions for use of the devices used in this study are provided in their 
respective manuals. 
3.1 Medtronic CRT-D and CRT-P devices  
Medtronic commercially available CRT-D and CRT-P devices containing the aCRT algorithm are 
required.

Medtronic commercially available LV transvenous pacing leads that are compatible with the CRT 
devices containing the aCRT algorithm are required. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_131414] a 
transvenous lead cannot be placed. If investigators wish to use a non-Medtronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_131415], 
it is recommended that they confirm device compatibility with a Medtronic representative. 
3.3 Market released right ventricular (defibrillation) lead 
Commercially available RV (defibrillation) leads that are compatible with the CRT devices 
containing the aCRT algorithm are required. Medtronic commercially available RV (defibrillation) 
leads are recommended.  
3.4 Market released right atrial lead

 Medtronic Confidential 
 and performs any required file translation functions necessary for data transfer. It executes data 
file transfer and collaborates with the appropriate Medtronic server to confirm data file transfer 
through the Internet connection with the server. The CareLink Monitor 2490C is not a 
programmer and cannot be used to program implanted device parameters. CareLink monitors 
are not a substitute for appropriate medical attention in the event of an emergency and should 
only be used as directed by [CONTACT_131459]. 
Medtronic CRT devices used in this study qualify for use with the Medtronic CareLink Monitor 
and Medtronic CareLink Network; however, the use of CareLink in this clinical study is optional 
and does not replace the need for in-person follow-up visits.  
Medtronic may incorporate additional home monitors as they receive regulatory approval.

5.2 Primary endpoint 
5.2.1 Primary endpoint definition 
Intervention for heart failure decompensation (HF event) is defined as an event requiring 
“invasive intervention (i.e. IV diuretics, ultrafiltration, or equivalent) or inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”. 
The primary endpoint is the composite of all-cause death and any intervention for heart 
failure decompensation as adjudicated by [CONTACT_131461]. The date of the endpoint will be the date 
of death or the date of initiation of treatment for decompensation as determined by [CONTACT_131461].  
The EAC will determine if an endpoint has been met. Sites may adhere to their standard 
practice diagnosing heart failure, but are required to report all diagnostic assessments, tests 
and procedures done with supporting material as appropriate to allow the EAC to 
adjudicate.  
5.2.2 Endpoint Adjudication Committee 
All potential endpoints will be reviewed by [CONTACT_131462] (EAC). 
Please refer to Appendix D for an overview of the EAC’s tasks.  
  
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148382] meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to participate in the study: 
• Subject is willing to sign and date the study Patient Informed Consent (PIC) Form. 
• Subject is indicated for a CRT device according to local guidelines. 
• Subject has, minimally: 
o Sinus Rhythm at time of enrollment. 
o Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) as documented on an ECG (within 30 
days prior to enrollment). Criteria16 for complete LBBB must include: 
/square4 Intrinsic QRS duration ≥140 ms (men) or ≥130 ms (women),  
/square4 QS or rS in leads V1 and V2, 
and

despi[INVESTIGATOR_51495]. Optimal medical therapy is defined as 
maximal tolerated dose of Beta-blockers and a therapeutic dose of ACE-I, 
ARB or Aldosterone Antagonist. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_148383] not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible to participate in 
the study:  
• Subject is less than 18 years of age (or has not reached minimum age per local law). 
• Subject is not expected to remain available for at least 2 years of follow-up visits. 
• Subject has permanent atrial arrhythmias for which pharmacological therapy and/or 
cardioversion have been unsuccessful or have not been attempted. 
• Subject is, or previously has been, receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy. 
• Subject is currently enrolled or planning to participate in a potentially confounding drug or 
device trial during the course of this study.  Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is only 
allowed when documented pre-approval is obtained from the Medtronic study manager. 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 23 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • Subject has unstable angina, or experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or 
received coronary artery revascularization (CABG) or coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 
30 days prior to enrollment. 
• Subject has a mechanical tricuspid heart valve or is scheduled to undergo valve repair or 
valve replacement during the course of the study. 
• Subject is post heart transplant (subjects on the heart transplant list for the first time are 
not excluded). 
• Subject has a limited life expectancy due to non-cardiac causes that would not allow 
completion of the study. 
• Subject is pregnant (if required by [CONTACT_1769], women of child-bearing potential must 
undergo a pregnancy test within seven days prior to device implant). 
• Subject meets any exclusion criteria required by [CONTACT_1769]. 
5.[ADDRESS_148384] a successful CRT 
implant will be randomized within 7 days of completing the implant procedure. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment (aCRT ON, with AdaptivCRT programmed to “Adaptive 
Bi-V and LV”) or control (aCRT OFF, with AdaptivCRT programmed to “Nonadaptive CRT”) 
group. Subjects will be randomized using the randomization schedule determined by a 
Medtronic statistician. The randomization schedule will be stratified by [CONTACT_131463]. Centers will receive this assignment electronically in the study database from Medtronic 
upon completion of the randomization case report form.  
Once a subject is assigned to a study group (treatment or control), he/she will remain in that arm 
and all efforts will be made to provide the optimal therapy specified for that treatment 
assignment. In the circumstance this is clinically or technically not feasible, the subject will 
remain in the assigned treatment arm for statistical analysis based on the intention-to-treat 
principle, as it represents a normal medical situation of success and failure of delivering the 
planned medical therapy. 
5.[ADDRESS_148385] be approved by a 
member of the study’s Steering Committee. The study center must make reasonable effort to 
contact [CONTACT_131464]. Failure to gain prior approval for 
reprogramming of aCRT therapy (even if required urgently) constitutes a deviation and should 
be reported as such. Every reasonable effort should be made to prevent unblinding of the patient 
prior to and after reprogramming, unless clinically necessary. In the case of a permanent 
crossover (i.e. the programming will not be corrected to the original randomization assignment) 
to the other study arm, a Crossover CRF and Study Deviation CRF must be completed. Full 
device interrogation data will be collected reflecting the final programming, and a copy of the 
interrogation files must be sent to Medtronic with a copy being maintained at the center in the 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148386]’s file. Subjects will be analyzed per their randomly assigned treatment in accordance 
with the intention-to-treat principle. 
5.6 Blinding 
The study will be single-blinded (i.e. subjects are blinded to randomization assignment) to 
reduce the effect of bias. Every effort must be made to ensure the randomization assignment is 
not revealed to the subject.  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will regularly review summarized adverse event data to 
address potential safety issues. The DMC will be unblinded to subject treatment assignments. 
However; the EAC will be blinded to the treatment designation when reviewing case files, 
wherever reasonably achievable.  
After all study tests and procedures have been completed just prior to subject exit from the 
study, the subject may be informed (verbally or in written form) of their randomization 
assignment. 
5.7 Minimization of Bias 
Selection of subjects, treatment of subjects, and evaluation of study data are potential sources of 
bias. Methods incorporated in the study design to minimize potential bias include (but are not 
limited to): 
• Patients will be evaluated at baseline to confirm eligibility for enrollment with defined 
inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to implant and randomization. 
• An ECG Core Laboratory will be used to confirm presence of LBBB and normal AV 
conduction. 
• Subjects will be randomized to ensure comparable treatment groups. 
• Subjects will be blinded to their treatment group. 
• Subject demographics will be collected at baseline and differences that may affect 
primary endpoints will be identified. 
• To ensure a widespread distribution of data between centers, the maximum number of 
randomized subjects allowed per center is no more than 200. 
• All implanters in the study will be experienced in the implant of CRT devices. 
• Data collection requirements and study procedures will be standardized across all 
centers and geographies. 
• All study center personnel and Medtronic personnel will be trained on their respective 
aspects of the study using standardized training materials. All study clinicians will be 
trained on and required to follow the CIP. 
• Monitoring visits will be conducted for adherence to the CIP and to verify the CRF data 
against the source data.  
• HF events and deaths will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_131465]. 
• An independent DMC will review endpoint and other data to monitor the overall integrity 
of the study. 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 25 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • The Steering Committee members will not have influence on the HF treatment decisions 
by [CONTACT_131466], except for approval for crossover, as described in 
Section 5.5. 
• The analysis will be intent-to-treat, following pre-defined statistical methods specified in 
this Clinical Investigation Plan and the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
• Registration of the trial on clinicaltrials.gov and the publication plan will ensure that study 
results will be reported. 
In summary, potential sources of bias that may be encountered in this clinical study have been 
considered and minimized by [CONTACT_54415]. 
  
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148387]’s heart failure must be qualified practitioners and 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of subjects with heart failure. All implanting 
physicians must be experienced and/or trained in the handling of CRT devices. Center 
personnel training and delegation will be completed prior to participation in this clinical study. 
Medtronic personnel or their representatives may perform the following activities at the study 
sites during the study, under supervision of site personnel: 
• Technical support at all visits (e.g. programming of the CRT device according to study 
requirements, performing device interrogations) 
• Monitoring activities 
6.1 Site activation  
During the activation process (prior to enrollment of subjects in the study), Medtronic will train 
site personnel on the CIP, relevant standards and regulations, informed consent process, written 
Clinical Trial Agreements (CTAs) and on data collection and reporting tools. If new members join 
the study center team, they will receive training on the applicable clinical study requirements 
relevant to their role before contributing to the clinical study. 
A CTA shall be entered into effect by [CONTACT_13735], the participating investigation site and/or the 
principal clinical investigator at each investigation site as per the local legal requirements, and 
returned, fully executed, to Medtronic prior to the commencement of any study activities. 
Financial aspects of conducting and reporting a study will be specified in the agreement. By 
[CONTACT_131467].  
Prior to performing study related activities, all centers must have Ethics Committee approval, as 
applicable for that geography.  
All local and regional regulatory requirements will be fulfilled prior to center activation and 
enrollment of subjects into the study. Each study center must have written documentation of 
center and investigator readiness before beginning any study-related activities. Requirements for 
activation vary by [CONTACT_13736], and may include, but are not limited to:

All records and other information about subjects participating in this study will be treated as 
confidential. Data will be transferred and processed by [CONTACT_13757] a third party designated by 
[CONTACT_54452] a key coded form, unless it’s impossible to make it anonymous, for instance, where 
the patient’s name [CONTACT_131514], such as x-rays. Participating 
subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_131468]. 
6.4 Patient informed consent process 
Patient informed consent (PIC) is defined as a legally effective, documented confirmation of a 
subject’s (or their legally authorized representative or guardian, per local requirements) voluntary 
agreement to participate in a particular clinical study after information has been given to the 
subject on all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s decision to 
participate. This process includes obtaining a Patient Consent and a/an Authorization to Use and 
Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/HIPAA/other privacy language as 
required by [CONTACT_131469]’s Ethics Committee and signed 
and personally dated by [CONTACT_423] (or their legally authorized representative or guardian, per 
local requirements). A subject may only consent after information has been given to the subject 
on all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate. 
Informed consent may be given by [CONTACT_131470].  
Prior to enrolling subjects, each study center’s applicable Ethics Committee will be required to 
approve the PIC Form, and Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health 
Information/Research Authorization/HIPAA/other privacy language as required by [CONTACT_2371]. The 
document(s) must be controlled (i.e. versioned and dated) to ensure it is clear which version(s) 
were approved by [CONTACT_20601]. Any adaptation of the sample PIC Form must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_131471]. Geography specific Informed Consent form templates will be provided under 
separate cover. 
Prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures, patient informed consent must be obtained 
from the subject (or their legally authorized representative or guardian, per local requirements). 
Likewise, privacy or health information protection regulation may require subjects to sign 
additional forms to authorize centers to submit subject information to the study sponsor. The 
informed consent process must be conducted by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_131417], and the PIC Form and Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health 
Information/Research Authorization/HIPAA/other privacy language as required by [CONTACT_131472] (or their legally authorized representative or guardian, per local 
requirements) in a language he/she is able to read and understand. The process of patient 
informed consent must be conducted without using coercion or undue improper influence on or 
inducement of the subject to participate by [CONTACT_131473]. 
The process of obtaining patient informed consent shall: 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 30 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • Ensure that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee conducts the 
informed consent process 
• Include all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to the subject's decision 
to participate throughout the clinical investigation 
• Avoid any coercion or undue improper influence on, or inducement of, the subject to 
participate 
• Not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights 
• Use language that is non-technical and understandable to the subject 
• Provide ample time for the subject to read and understand the informed consent form 
and to ask questions, receive answers and consider participation 
• Include a personally dated signature [CONTACT_81835] (or legally authorized representative 
or guardian, per local requirements) acknowledging that their participation in the study is 
voluntary 
• Include a personally dated signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_131418] (not applicable in US and 
Canada) 
• Include any other locally required signatories, such as witnesses, as indicated by [CONTACT_131474]  
• Provide the subject with a copy of the consent form, the Authorization to Use and 
Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/HIPAA/other privacy 
language and any other written information, signed and dated if required by [CONTACT_1769] 
• Ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout 
the clinical investigation 
If the PIC Form is obtained on the same day the subject begins participating in study-related 
procedures, it must be documented in the subject's case history that consent was obtained prior 
to participation in any study-related procedures. It is best practice for the informed consent 
process to be documented in the subject’s case history, regardless of circumstance. 
In the event the subject cannot read and/or write, witnessed (impartial third party) patient 
informed consent will be allowed, provided detailed documentation of the process is recorded in 
the subject’s case history and the witness signs and dates the patient informed consent. The 
PIC shall be obtained through a supervised oral process. An independent witness must be 
present throughout the process. The PIC and any other information must be read aloud and 
explained to the prospective subject (or his/her legally authorized representative, per local 
requirements). The witness signs and personally dates the PIC attesting that the information was 
accurately explained and that informed consent was freely given. The subject should “make his 
mark” (sign or otherwise physically mark the document so as to indicate consent) on the PIC 
Form as well. The PIC Form should document the method used for communication with the 
prospective subject and the specific means by [CONTACT_131475]. 
The original of the signed PIC Form must be filed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinical chart and/or with the 
subject’s study documents.

 The PIC Form (in Japan, the signature [CONTACT_131515]) and Authorization to Use and Disclose 
Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/HIPAA/other privacy language as required 
by [CONTACT_131476]. Any Medtronic Field personnel who 
support the implant must be able to review the subject’s signed and dated PIC Form and verify 
its completeness prior to proceeding with the implant. In the event that Medtronic Field 
personnel identify patient informed consent as being incomplete, study procedures will not be 
allowed to occur until the consent of the subject can be adequately and appropriately obtained. 
In Japan, only the monitor assigned to this study may be able to review the signed informed 
consent prior to the implant procedure. 
Any changes to a previously approved PIC Form throughout the course of the study must be 
approved by [CONTACT_131477] a prospective study subject. The document(s) must be controlled (i.e. versioned and 
dated) to ensure it is clear which version(s) were approved by [CONTACT_131478]. All important new information should be provided in written form to new and existing 
subjects throughout the study. If relevant, all affected subjects must be asked to confirm their 
continuing informed consent in writing.

calcium channel blockers, diuretics, digitalis, inotropes, nitrates, digoxin, and vasodilators.  
For CV medications, daily dose is collected at baseline. Apart from CV medications, the use of 
insulin is collected. There are no medication restrictions in this study unless they are 
investigational and may confound the study results. 
6.6.1 Baseline ECG 
LBBB needs to be diagnosed using the Strauss criteria16. Criteria for complete LBBB should 
include QRS duration ≥140 ms (men) or ≥130 ms (women), QS or rS in leads V1 and V2, 
and mid-QRS notching or slurring in ≥[ADDRESS_148393] enrollment. 
The implant will be performed according to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard implant practice. Implant 
guidelines can also be found in the device manuals. The following data are required to be 
collected at the implant visit: 
• Final system configuration (CRT-P or CRT-D device and lead models, serial numbers 
and locations) 
• LV lead placement optimization method 
• Adverse Events, Health Care Utilizations, and Study Deviations (as they occur) 
• Final device interrogation 
At implant, it is recommended that the device is programmed to CRT OFF until the subject is 
randomized. Full device interrogation (Interrogate ALL) data will be collected following the 
implant procedure, and a copy of the interrogation files must be sent to Medtronic with a copy 
being maintained at the center in the subject’s file. 
Note:  An unsuccessful implanti is not considered an adverse event. Events occurring during an 
unsuccessful implant (e.g. dissection, perforation) are adverse events and will be recorded and 
classified. Subjects experiencing unsuccessful implant procedures must be followed for [ADDRESS_148394] implant attempt or until all implant and procedure-related AE’s are resolved, whichever 
comes last. A second attempt may be made, but is not required, after inclusion and exclusion 
criteria have been re-verified.

occur within 7 days after a successful implant. Centers will receive this assignment electronically 
in the study database from Medtronic upon completion of the randomization case report form.   
At the time of the randomization device programming, a device check will be conducted and the 
default settings will be verified. If subjects are assigned to the aCRT ON group, “Adaptive Bi-V 
and LV” will be programmed. If subjects are assigned to the aCRT OFF group, the delegated 
person will ensure that “Nonadaptive CRT” is programmed. Control group subjects will be 
optimized per physician’s discretion. The method of AV and VV optimization in the control group 
will be collected. Full device interrogation (Interrogate ALL) data will be collected reflecting the 
final programming, and a copy of the interrogation files must be sent to Medtronic with a copy 
being maintained at the center in the subject’s file.  
The following procedures will be completed / data will be collected at the randomization visit: 
• Device programming according to assignment 
• AV/VV optimization method (control group only, if optimization occurs per standard of

6.10 Device Interrogation (Interrogate All) 
For the implant, randomization and follow-up visits, a final full “Interrogate ALL” device 
interrogation file (.pdd) must be obtained and saved in a digital format (e.g., USB). Store one 
copy at the site and send a copy to Medtronic. It is recommended that data are not cleared 
during any interrogation. 
6.11 Adverse Events 
The primary objective depends on complete reporting of HF events, including interventions for 
heart failure decompensation and cardiovascular adverse events (AEs). These are reported 
upon center awareness and assessed at scheduled follow-up visits to ensure all applicable 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131419]’s have been reported. Refer to section 8 for adverse events details.  
6.12 Healthcare Utilization 
Healthcare Utilization (HCU) information should be reported upon center awareness and 
assessed at all follow-up visits to ensure all applicable Healthcare Utilizations have been 
reported. All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department visits, outpatient treatment involving 
overnight stay, cardiovascular-related urgent care and cardiovascular-related clinic visits will be 
considered reportable Healthcare Utilizations for this study. Any visit where changes occur to 
protocol-required programming parameters will be considered cardiovascular-related. For HCU’s 
involving changes to protocol-required programming parameters, both an initial and final device 
interrogation will be required, and a copy of the interrogation files must be sent to Medtronic with 
a copy also being maintained at the center in the subject’s file. Additionally, collection of current 
cardiovascular medications will be required for all HCU’s. Any remote transmissions via the 
Medtronic CareLink® system will also be collected.  
Healthcare Utilization information will be included in the review of potential HF related events 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131420] (EAC). Supporting source 
documentation may be requested if needed for study or endpoint evaluation. Relevant 
documentation may include but is not limited to: a copy of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131421], and medical records such as chest x-ray reports, echocardiogram reports, medication 
documentation, lab results related to the event and consultation reports (e.g., Heart Failure, 
Renal, Cardiology, Pulmonary, etc.). 
6.13 System Modification 
A system modification will be reported in the event the device and/or leads require invasive 
modification (e.g., device or lead explant, device or lead replacement, lead repositioning). In the 
event of a system modification, the follow-up schedule for the subject will remain unchanged. 
The following information is required to be collected for a system modification: 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 39 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • Report reason for modification 
• Report the details of the system modification procedure 
• Device programming according to randomization assignment (aCRT ON for treatment 
group and aCRT OFF for control group)  
• Device interrogation (initial and final “interrogate ALL”; a copy of the interrogation files 
must be sent to Medtronic with a copy also being maintained at the center) 
• Report the associated AE 
It is recommended that all explanted Medtronic products (device, leads, etc.) are returned to 
Medtronic for analysis when permissible by [CONTACT_10976].  
In the event that a subject has a re-attempt after a previous unsuccessful system modification, 
the subsequent attempt(s) must be reported via CRF as separate system modifications. 
6.[ADDRESS_148399] has not revoked consent, or exit when study 
participation is completely ended. In randomized subjects, modified data collection is always 
preferred over exit. 
Subjects may be conditionally disengaged from study procedures for any of the following 
reasons: 
• Subject chooses to disengage (e.g., follow-up schedule cannot be adhered to, study 
burden too large, relocation to another geographic location but telephone follow-up still 
acceptable)  
• Investigator deems conditional disengagement necessary (e.g. medically justified)  
If the subject wishes to disengage from the study, or the investigator deems it necessary, the 
center is required to document the reason. Prior approval from the study team is required and a 
Limited Data Collection CRF needs to be completed. Data collection requirements no longer 
apply, but sites are encouraged to collect as much data as possible on the regular CRFs. 
6.15 Study Exit 
Subjects will be exited from the study for any of the following situations: 
• Study completed 
• Subject lost to follow-up 
• Subject death 
• Subject did not meet eligibility criteria and was not randomized 
• Subject did not have a successful implant and no attempt at re-implant is made 
• Subject did not provide consent or data protection authorization 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 40 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • Subject chooses to exit (i.e. revokes consent)  
 
Prior to exiting a subject from the study, it is recommended to follow the subject until all ongoing 
system- and procedure-related AEs are resolved or are unresolved with no further actions 
planned. After all study tests and procedures have been completed just prior to subject exit from 
the study, the subject may be informed of their randomization assignment. Following exit, 
subjects will continue to receive standard medical care. There will be no further required study-
related follow-up visits for these subjects. All data available through the time of the subject’s exit 
will be used for the study analyses. The following procedures are required to be collected at the 
exit visit: 
• Report the reason for exit 
• Vital status check 
• Current CV medications 
• Current heart failure symptoms status 
• Initial and Final device interrogation, if available (Interrogate ALL) 
• Report AEs, Study Deviations and Healthcare utilization (as they occur) 
 
Subjects will not be replaced with newly enrolled subjects upon exit. As described in Section 
11.3.4, the sample size accounts for attrition.  
6.15.[ADDRESS_148400] may 
be informed (verbally or in written form) of their randomization assignment. Subjects in the 
control group may have aCRT turned ON. For subjects within a visit window upon study 
closure, the exit visit and scheduled visit may be combined. For other patients a separate 
exit visit must be planned. For all subjects, a Study Exit CRF including Vital Status 
information will be completed. 
6.15.[ADDRESS_148401], and the method of attempt (e.g., one letter and one phone 
record or two letters) must be recorded. In addition, regulations set forth by [CONTACT_131479].  
6.15.[ADDRESS_148402] chooses to exit (i.e. revokes consent)  
If the subject wishes to exit from the study (i.e. the subject revokes consent), the center is 
required to document the reason for exit.  
In addition, study centers shall follow the regulations set forth by [CONTACT_131480]. Adverse events, healthcare utilizations and study deviations should be 
assessed at the time of exit and recorded on the appropriate case report forms. In addition, 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 41 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 whenever possible, an initial and final full device interrogation (Interrogate ALL) should be 
collected prior to subject exit, and a copy of the interrogation files should be sent to 
Medtronic with a copy also being maintained at the center in the subject’s file. 
  
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148403] in 
an emergency or in unforeseen situations beyond the investigator’s control (e.g. subject failure 
to attend scheduled follow-up visits, inadvertent loss of data due to computer malfunction, 
inability to perform required procedures due to subject illness). 
For medically justifiable conditions which preempt a subject’s ability to complete a study-required 
procedure, it may be permitted to report only one deviation which will apply to all visits going 
forward. This may also apply for other unforeseen situations (e.g. the subject permanently 
refuses to complete a study required procedure and the data will not contribute to the primary 
end point analysis). However, prior approval from Medtronic is required for such situations.  
All study deviations must be reported to Medtronic regardless of whether medically justifiable, 
pre-approved by [CONTACT_13735], an inadvertent occurrence, or taken to protect the subject in an 
emergency. In the occurrence of a corrupted device interrogation file, Medtronic may request a 
deviation to document that a readable interrogation file is unavailable. 
In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect 
the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the 
Ethics Committee as well as Medtronic within five (5) working days, or according to local 
requirements.  Reporting of all other study deviations should comply with Ethic Committee 
policies and/or local laws and deviations must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible 
upon the center becoming aware of the deviation. Refer to Table 11 through 18 for geography-
specific deviation reporting requirements and timeframes for reporting to Medtronic and/or 
regulatory bodies. 
Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying 
any additional corrective and/or preventive actions (e.g. amend the Clinical Investigation Plan, 
conduct additional training, terminate the study). Repetitive or serious investigator compliance 
issues may result in initiation of a corrective action plan with the investigator and site, and in 
some cases, necessitate suspending enrollment until the problem is resolved or ultimately 
terminating the investigator's participation in the study. Medtronic will provide center-specific 
reports to investigators summarizing information on deviations that occurred at the 
investigational site on a periodic basis.

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS   
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting of clinical events is of crucial importance for success of 
the study. To assess the superiority of CRT devices containing the aCRT algorithm, it is 
important that all information related to heart failure decompensation events, atrial fibrillation 
status, and other cardiovascular adverse events are reported. Additionally, reporting and review 
of safety information for clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects. Sections below 
define the clinical event reporting requirements for the study, and the geography specific safety 
reporting requirements.  
8.1 Adverse Event definitions 
8.1.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse Event (AE) definitions are provided in Table 8. All serious and all system, 
procedure, and/or cardiovascular related AEs will be collected throughout the study 
duration, starting at the time of signing the PIC form. Reporting of these events to Medtronic 
will occur on an AE Form, including a description of AE, date of onset of AE, date of site 
awareness, signs and symptoms, treatment, resolution, and investigator assessment of both 
the seriousness and the relatedness to heart failure, the procedure, and to the system. Each 
AE must be recorded on a separate AE Form.  
Health Care Utilization will be reported on the Health Care Utilization Form. 
Subject deaths are also required to be reported. Refer to section 8.[ADDRESS_148404]-implant. For AEs 
that require immediate reporting (see Table 10), initial reporting may be done by [CONTACT_648], fax, 
or on the CRF completing as much information as possible, with missing or follow-up 
information provided as soon as it becomes available. The AE CRF must be completed as 
soon as possible.  
8.1.2 Processing Updates and Resolution 
For any changes in status of a previously reported adverse event (i.e. change in actions 
taken, change in outcome, change in relatedness), information needs to be updated on, or 
added to the original AE form. All adverse events must be followed until the adverse event 
has been resolved, is unresolved with no further actions planned, the subject exits the study 
or until study closure, whichever occurs first.  
In the event that a subject has conditionally disengaged or is exited from the study prior to 
study closure, all efforts should be made to continue following the subject until all 
unresolved system or procedure related adverse events, as classified by [CONTACT_093], 
are resolved or they are unresolved with no further actions planned.  
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 44 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 At the time of study exit, all cardiovascular-related adverse events with an outcome of 
“Unresolved, further actions or treatment planned” must be reviewed and an update to the 
original AE must be reported. At a minimum, if there are no changes to the description, 
relatedness, test and procedures or actions taken, the outcome must be updated to reflect 
“Unresolved at time of study closure”.

The DMC will monitor adverse event rates and evaluate risk-benefit. 
The EAC will review all applicable Healthcare Utilizations and all study reportable events 
during the study, assessing outpatient treatment and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], to determine HF 
relatedness and AF relatedness for the study objectives. 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148408]’s death, it is recommended that the implanted system is explanted 
and returned to Medtronic for analysis whenever possible. Local laws and procedures must 
be followed where applicable. 
System Interrogation Data Recommendations: 
• After the subject has died but prior to explant, the system shall be interrogated and a full 
summary interrogation (Interrogate All) performed when possible.   
• Make the interrogation file before any programming to prevent overwriting information in 
the CRT device’s memory and/or distinguishing between events detected during versus 
before the explant procedure. 
If the system is not interrogated, an explanation must be entered on the Subject Death 
form. For CRT-D systems, the VT and VF detection capabilities must be disabled to 
avoid inadvertent shocks. If any system component is returned to Medtronic, internal 
return product reporting systems may be used to gather additional information about the 
returned device/component. 
A copy of the death certificate, if available and allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local law, should be sent 
to the Medtronic clinical study team. When a death occurs in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a copy of the 
death summary report and all relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131422], if available. If an autopsy is conducted, the autopsy report should 
also be sent to the Medtronic clinical study team if available and allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local 
law. When the death occurs at a remote site, it is the investigative center’s responsibility 
to attempt retrieval of information about the death. In summary, the following data will be 
collected: 
• Adverse Event leading to death 
• Date of death 
• Detailed description of death 
• Cause of death  
• Relatedness to system and/or procedure 
• Device interrogation (Interrogate ALL) (if available) 
• Death summary/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (if available and allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local 
law) 
• Autopsy report (if available and allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local law) 
• Death certificate (if available and/or allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local law) 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148409]’s death. The 
Investigator shall classify each subject death per the following definitions: 
• Cardiac Death: A death directly related to the electrical or mechanical dysfunction of the 
heart. 
• Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD): Natural death due to cardiac causes, indicated by [CONTACT_131486]; preexisting heart 
disease may have been known to be present, but the time and mode of death are 
unexpected. If time of onset cannot be determined, SCD will alternatively be defined as 
any unexpected cardiac death occurring out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131423]. 
• Non-sudden Cardiac Death: All cardiac deaths that are not classified as sudden deaths, 
including all cardiac deaths of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54382]. 
• Non-cardiac Death: A death not classified as a cardiac death. 
• Unknown Cardiac Classification: Unknown death classification is intended for use only 
when there is insufficient or inadequate information to classify the death. 
Regulatory reporting of Subject Deaths will be completed according to local regulatory 
requirements. Refer to Table [ADDRESS_148410] of required investigator and sponsor reporting 
requirements and timeframes. 
 
8.4 Adverse Event Records and Reporting Requirements 
Adverse Events should be recorded and reported according to local regulatory requirements. It

demonstrated through previous pre-clinical testing and previous clinical studies. Specifically, 
safety of the AdaptivCRT® algorithm was demonstrated in the Adaptive CRT study. All products 
used within this study are market-released. Therefore, it is not anticipated that subjects enrolled 
in this study will be exposed to any risks beyond those normally associated with CRT systems, 
transvenous and subcutaneous lead systems, or their implant procedure.   
With the exception of the risks associated with the device and implant procedure, there are no 
risks associated with study-related procedures (e.g. quality of life questionnaires), since these 
are not incremental to standard of care treatment and monitoring of patients with symptomatic 
heart failure. Therefore, the risk analysis in this section is specific to the implantation, 
management and therapy from the implanted CRT-P/D system. 
The potential risks to subjects implanted with CRT-P or CRT-D system include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
Air embolism 
Cardiac dissection or perforation 
Cardiac tamponade 
Coronary sinus dissection 
Death 
Endocarditis or pericarditis

 11. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS 
11.1 General 
Medtronic employed statisticians will perform the statistical analyses described in this section. 
Interim analyses will be performed by a Medtronic statistician other than the lead statistician for 
the study. The lead study statistician will be blinded to all interim analyses. All tests of treatment 
effects will be conducted in order to preserve an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05 unless 
otherwise stated. An Intention-to-Treat analysis will be performed and will serve as the primary 
analysis for all objectives in this study. The Intention-to-Treat cohort will include all randomized 
subjects. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be created before the first interim analysis to specify 
analyses in further detail. In case the SAP deviates from this Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP), or 
the actual analysis deviates from CIP and/or SAP, this will be explained in the Final Report.  
11.[ADDRESS_148424]-market, global Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in heart 
failure (HF) clinical study. Patients will be randomized in equal numbers between a treatment 
arm that will receive CRT therapy with ambulatory optimization and preferential LV-only pacing 
(aCRT ON, programmed to “Adaptive Bi-V and LV”) and a control arm that will receive standard 
bi-ventricular CRT therapy (aCRT OFF, programmed to “Nonadaptive CRT”). Further details are 
given in section 5.4. Study subjects will be followed until the required number of endpoint events 
is reached. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_148425] an achievable sample size and to accommodate 
geographic differences due to differing health care systems. Independent blinded endpoint 
adjudication will ensure an unbiased comparison between randomized arms. 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 65 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 11.2.2 Randomization 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_148426] ratio is unequal 
to 1.  
Let S T(t) and S C(t) denote the proportion of patients in the treatment arm and control arm, 
respectively, that have not experienced a primary endpoint up to time t. Let h T(t) and h C(t) 
be the associated hazard functions. Under the proportional hazards model, h T(t) = HR h C(t), 
where HR is the hazard ratio of treatment compared to control. The null and alternative 
hypotheses can be expressed as: 
H0 :  HR = 1 
HA :  HR ≠ [ADDRESS_148427] (frailty), stratified by [CONTACT_131489]. The hazard ratio for 
treatment arm versus control arm will be reported with its associated p-value and 95% 
confidence interval. The null hypothesis will be rejected when the p-value is below the 
critical value for the (interim or final) analysis, and it will be concluded that aCRT reduces 
the incidence of the primary endpoint when the hazard ratio is below 1. Kaplan-Meier 
graphs for incidence will also be reported, together with an estimate for the absolute event 
rate difference at [ADDRESS_148428]. The risk score will 
be derived from baseline data. Second, an analysis will be done including only the patients 
for whom the ECG Core Laboratory confirmed the presence of LBBB. 
11.3.3 Determination of patients and data for analysis 
The primary analysis will follow the intent-to-treat principle. All randomized patients will be 
included in analysis, and for each patient the endpoints will be attributed to the arm that the 
patient was randomized to irrespective of the actual treatment that the patient received. 
Event dates will be entered in the analysis relative to the date of randomization (which will 
be time zero for the survival analysis). Patients will be censored if no primary endpoint has 
occurred prior to the end-of-study exit visit, or the last documented follow-up visit if the 
patient was exited early. 
11.3.4 Sample size rationale 
A total of 1100 patients experiencing a primary endpoint will give 90% power to show a 
significant reduction of the incidence of the primary endpoint, accounting for [ADDRESS_148429] ratio of 0.82 for aCRT 
ON compared to aCRT OFF. 
Version 1.0 of the CIP specified the total number of patients randomized as follows: With 
the inclusion of 2874 randomized patients enrolled over 3 years and followed for 2.3 more 
years, 1100 primary endpoint events are expected when the true control arm event-free rate 
is 75% at 2 years.  
Version 2.0 of the CIP increases the total number of patients randomized to accommodate a 
lower event rate: With the inclusion of 3326 randomized patients enrolled over 4 years and 
followed for 3.5 more years, 1100 primary endpoint events are expected when the true 
control arm event-free rate is 85% at [ADDRESS_148430] 90% 
power under the following assumptions: 
• 3000 patients randomized in 3 years with a uniform rate 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 67 of 115  
28 Feb 2018 Clinical Investigation Plan 
 Medtronic Confidential 
 • control arm event-free rate is 75% at 2 years 
• LBBB is not confirmed by [CONTACT_131490] 10% of patients 
• aCRT hazard ratio is 0.78 in confirmed LBBB patients, 1.0 in unconfirmed patients 
• crossover rate is 5% at 2 years in aCRT arm and 8% at 2 years in control arm 
• loss-to-follow-up rate is 5% at 2 years in both arms 
• final analysis is done when 1100 events are accrued 
 
For version 2.0 of the CIP, the simulation was updated and the power of 90% was 
confirmed with updated control group event rate expectation. 
11.4 Interim analysis methodology 
The 3 interim analyses will follow a symmetric group sequential design using the alpha-spending 
methodology of Lan and DeMets17 with O’Brien-Fleming18 type boundaries. The statistical 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131432].

control of the family wise error rate, also accounting for the interim analysis plan. Secondary 
objectives will be analyzed when the study has stopped after an interim analysis or has reached 
the final analysis stage. A Hommel procedure20,21 will be applied to the secondary objectives 
(excluding the cost-effectiveness objective) using an overall α-level as determined by [CONTACT_131491] 11.4 above.  
Secondary objectives for which the hypothesis is rejected under the adjusted significance level 
of the Hommel procedure will be reported as significant with strictly controlled family wise error 
α=0.05. 
Secondary objectives include the components of the primary endpoint, patient status at [ADDRESS_148432]-effectiveness.  
11.5.1 Secondary objectives 
To assess all-cause mortality in the aCRT ON arm compared to aCRT OFF. 
Mortality will be illustrated with Kaplan-Meier graphs. A Cox proportional hazards regression 
model will be used to estimate the HR of aCRT compared to control, which will be reported 
with its p-value and 95% confidence interval. The model will include the stratification 
variables also included in the primary objective model. 
To assess the rate of intervention for heart failure decompensation for aCRT ON compared 
to aCRT OFF. 
Incidence of intervention for heart failure decompensation will be illustrated with cumulative 
incidence graphs. A Cox regression model will be used to estimate the cause-specific HR of 
aCRT compared to control, which will be reported with its p-value and 95% confidence 
interval. The model will include the stratification variables also included in the primary 
objective model. Additionally, recurrent event survival analysis will be performed to compare 
rates of interventions for heart failure decompensation.

classified Worsened in case of death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131434], worsened 
NYHA class (using last observation carried forward), or worsened status on the Global 
Assessment Score. Also patients that exit the study or cross over because of worsening 
heart failure are classified Worsened. A patient is classified Improved when not Worsened 
and there is an improvement in NYHA class or Global Assessment Score. Patients that are 
not Worsened or Improved are Unchanged. 
The proportion of patients who Improved will be compared between the arms of the study 
with a logistic regression model, correcting for the stratification variables also included in the 
primary objective model. 
To test the hypothesis that aCRT reduces the incidence of AF compared to aCRT OFF. 
Incidence of AF will be determined from device data, and the endpoint for the primary 
analysis will be the first day after randomization on which there is >6 hrs of AF reported in 
the device’s Cardiac Compass Trends. The analysis will compare incidence of AF using 
survival analysis methods. As secondary analyses device measured AF burden and 
treatment for AF will be analyzed.  
To test the hypothesis that the change in quality of life, measured by [CONTACT_18599], in the 
aCRT ON group is better than the change in the aCRT OFF group. 
The parameter of interest is the KCCQ overall summary score (range, 0 to 100; higher 
scores indicate better health status) which will be assessed at baseline and at the 3, 6, 12, 
18, and [ADDRESS_148435] is the EQ-5D index, which will be assessed at baseline and at the 
3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months follow-up visits. Derivation of the index will follow instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_131492] ( www.euroqol.org ). The index at the follow-up visits will be 
analyzed using a linear mixed effects regression model that will account for the correlation 
of measurements within each patient. The treatment arm allocation will be included as a 
main effect. The baseline EQ-5D index as well as the stratification variables included in the 
primary objective model will be included as covariates in the model. Analysis will be 
corrected for time trends if needed. 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_148436] the hypothesis that aCRT reduces the incidence of all-cause re-admissions after a 
heart failure (HF) admission within 30-days of the index event. 
A negative binomial model will be used to estimate and compare incidence rates of all-
cause re-admissions after an HF admission. For each patient the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131435] 30 days of discharge from an HF admission (as classified by [CONTACT_1275]) will be determined. All patients will be included in the model, with a count of 
zero in case no 30-day readmissions occurred. The model will include an offset based on 
the total follow-up experience of all patients.  
To assess cost-effectiveness of CRT devices with the aCRT algorithm relative to traditional 
CRT devices. 
Analysis method for this objective will be defined in the Economic Analysis Plan. There will 
be no hypothesis test and therefore the objective will not be included in the Hommel multiple 
testing procedure. 
11.5.2 Ancillary objectives 
Analysis methods for ancillary objectives will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Data will be collected using an electronic data management system for clinical studies.  Case 
Report Form (CRF) data will be stored in a secure, password-protected database which will be 
backed up nightly. Data will be reviewed using programmed and manual data checks. Data 
queries will be made available to centers for resolution. Study management reports may be 
generated to monitor data quality and study progress. At the end of the study, the data will be 
frozen and will be retained by [CONTACT_13735]. 
The data reported on the CRFs shall be derived from source documents and be consistent with 
these source documents, and any discrepancies shall be explained in writing. Source 
documents, such as patient charts, ECGs, device interrogation files, worksheets, and lab results, 
must be created and maintained by [CONTACT_131493]. For source documentation, the 
investigational center study team must sign and date any copi[INVESTIGATOR_131436] a statement that this is complete and true reproduction of the original source 
document.  
Device data from CareLink transmissions will be uploaded to secure servers and made 
accessible to the study team.  Device interrogation files collected via electronic media at office 
visits will be sent to Medtronic.  Upon receipt via transmission or electronic media, device data 
will be maintained within secure databases and retrieved for analysis and reporting. 
The sponsor or a regulatory authority may audit or inspect the study center to evaluate the 
conduct of the study. The clinical investigator(s)/institution(s) shall allow study related 
monitoring, audits, Ethics Committee review, and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_76783]/documents. If study site’s documents are electronic, these must be made 
available in their original form (or print outs signed and dated with the statement that this is 
complete and true reproduction of the original source document) if requested by [CONTACT_131494]/or regulatory authority. Study sites should inform Medtronic upon notification of an audit by a 
regulatory body immediately.

 APPENDIX B: PRELIMINARY PUBLICATION PLAN 
Publications from the AdaptResponse study will be handled according to Medtronic Standard 
Operating Procedures and as indicated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 
Publication Committee  
For AdaptResponse the Steering Committee will comprise the Publication Committee. Medtronic 
personnel may serve as members of the committee. This committee will manage study 
publications with the goal of publishing findings from the data. The Publication Committee will 
develop the final Publication Plan as a separate document.  
The Publication Committee’s role is to:  
1) manage elements addressed in the publication plan as outlined in this appendix 
2) develop the final Publication Plan including writing group selection criteria, under 
separate cover 
3) execute the Publication Plan 
4) oversee the publication of primary, secondary and ancillary study results 
5) review and prioritize publication proposals 
6) provide input on publication content, and  
7) determine authorship.  
In addition, the committee will apply and reinforce the authorship guidelines set forth in the 
Publication Plan. Membership in the Publication Committee does not guarantee authorship. The 
committee will meet at regular intervals. 
Management of Primary, Secondary and Ancillary Publications 
The Publication Committee reviews, prioritizes and manages all publications including primary, 
secondary and ancillary publications. Primary and secondary publications are those that address 
analyses of any or all primary objectives or secondary objectives, respectively, as specified in 
the Clinical Investigation Plan.  
An ancillary publication is any publication that does not address the study objectives identified in 
the Clinical Investigation Plan. They include publications proposed and developed by [CONTACT_131502], clinicians participating in this clinical study and clinicians not 
participating in this clinical study. The committee will work with Medtronic to ensure that requests 
do not present conflicts with other proposals, are not duplicative and to determine which ancillary 
publication proposals, if any, will be supported. 
The committee may decide that no publications, including abstracts, will be published prior to the 
end of the study or with individual center data. Requests for publications on study objectives

Relatedness 
definition 
 The category for heart failure relatedness will include worsening heart failure 
signs and symptoms such as hypervolemic and hypovolemic status requiring 
the administration, alteration, adjustment or augmentation of HF therapy 
(diuretics, inotropes and/or vasodilators etc.) or the utilization of certain 
treatment devices.  Intervention for heart failure decompensation (HF event) 
is defined as an event requiring “invasive intervention (i.e. IV diuretics, 
ultrafiltration, or equivalent) or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
Decision 
Boundaries  The EAC will make decisions as to the relatedness of the HF event. They will

 APPENDIX E: STUDY OVERVIEW 
Title AdaptResponse Clinical Study 
Study 
Purpose The AdaptResponse study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional, 
single-blinded, multi-center, post-market, global Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy 
(CRT) in heart failure (HF) clinical study. The purpose of this clinical study is to test the 
hypothesis that market released CRT devices which contain the AdaptivCRT® (aCRT) 
algorithm have a superior outcome compared to standard CRT devices in CRT indicated 
patients with normal AV conduction and left bundle branch block (LBBB). 
Background CRT is an established therapy for patients with HF symptoms, left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, and a wide QRS.1,[ADDRESS_148443] as effective as echo-
optimized BiV pacing in terms of CCS (73.6% improved in aCRT arm vs. 72.5% in echo 
optimized arm, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%, p=0.0007)12. Additionally, a 
comparison with a historical echocardiographic AV-optimized CRT cohort indicated that 
the aCRT algorithm increased the proportion of patients with an improved CCS by 
11.9% (95% CI: 2.7% to 19.2%).[ADDRESS_148444]-hoc sub-analysis of the Adaptive 
CRT Clinical Study showed that in patients with sinus rhythm, normal AV conduction and 
LBBB, more aCRT patients improved in their CCS compared with the echo arm (80.7% 
vs. 68.4%, p=0.04). In this subgroup the aCRT patients received LV-only pacing 64.0% 
± 32.8% of the time.12 Additionally, in an unpublished analysis on extended follow-up 
duration in patients with normal AV conduction, there was a lower risk of death or HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (HR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.40-1.27, p=0.25) with aCRT. Also a greater 
proportion of aCRT patients improved in CCS at 6 (81% vs.69%, p=0.041) and 12 
months (77% vs. 66%, p=0.076) than echocardiography-optimized control patients.14 
Furthermore, over the longer term follow-up (20.2 + 5.9  months) the aCRT algorithm 
has been shown to reduce the risk of the incidence of 48 consecutive hours in AF 
(HR=0.54 [95% CI 0.31-0.93]; p=0.03) and aCRT patients without history of AF were 
less likely to develop persistent AF (HR=0.44 [95% CI 0.19-1.03]; p=0.05).[ADDRESS_148445] the hypothesis that the 
Version 2.0  AdaptResponse Page 90 of 115

 Medtronic Confidential 
 aCRT algorithm reduces the incidence of total mortality and heart failure 
decompensation events, increases the proportion of patients with an improved CCS and 
reduces the incidence of AF in CRT patients with normal AV conduction and LBBB. 
Study 
Components The following components will be used in the clinical study:  
• Market-released Medtronic CRT-P and CRT-D devices containing the AdaptivCRT® 
(aCRT) algorithm.  
• Compatible market-released right atrial, right ventricular, and Medtronic left ventricular 
pacing leads  
• Medtronic Model 2090 CareLink programmer  
Study Design 
 
 Following enrollment and baseline assessment, eligible subjects will be implanted with a 
CRT system containing the aCRT algorithm and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either 
treatment (aCRT ON, programmed Adaptiv Bi-V and LV) or control (aCRT OFF, 
programmed Nonadaptiv CRT) groups. Study subjects will be followed until [ADDRESS_148446], Taiwan and 
the US. Approximately 3500 subjects will be randomized in the study.   The study utilizes 
an “event-driven” study design. Enrollment will end when approximately 3500 patients are 
randomized or there is reasonable certainty that the required number of events will be 
reached as determined by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC), whichever occurs first.  
Study 
Objectives 
 
 
 Primary objective 
To test the hypothesis that AdaptivCRT® reduces the incidence of the combined endpoint 
of all-cause mortality and intervention for heart failure decompensation, compared to 
standard CRT therapy, in patients with a CRT indication, LBBB and normal AV conduction.  
Intervention for heart failure decompensation (HF event) is defined as an event requiring 
“invasive intervention (i.e. IV diuretics, ultrafiltration, or equivalent) or  inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”. 
Secondary Objectives  
• To test the hypothesis that aCRT ON reduces all-cause mortality compared to aCRT 
OFF. 
• To test the hypothesis that aCRT ON reduces the rate of intervention for heart failure 
decompensation compared to aCRT OFF. 
• To test the hypothesis that aCRT ON increases the proportion of patients that improve 
on the Clinical Composite Score (CCS) compared to aCRT OFF, at 6 months of follow-
up. 
• To test the hypothesis that aCRT ON reduces the incidence of AF compared to aCRT 
OFF. 
• To test the hypothesis that the change in quality of life, measured by [CONTACT_18599], in 
the aCRT ON group is better than the change in the aCRT OFF group. 
• To test the hypothesis that the change in health outcome, measured by [CONTACT_20367]-5D, 
in the aCRT ON group is better than the change in the aCRT OFF group. 
• To test the hypothesis that aCRT reduces the incidence of all-cause re-admissions 
after a heart failure (HF) admission within 30-days of the index event. 
• To assess cost-effectiveness of CRT devices with the aCRT algorithm relative to 
traditional CRT devices.

 APPENDIX G: FORESEEABLE ADVERSE EVENT LIST 
The information provided in this section pertains to foreseeable adverse events that may be 
observed in AdaptResponse subjects and may assist in identifying those events for a given 
device or therapy that are unexpected in nature. The implantation of the CRT devices involves 
surgery, therefore, standard adverse events associated with a surgical procedure may be 
experienced (e.g. anesthesia complications, injury, infections, bleeding, exacerbation of pre-
existing conditions, healing complications, etc). However, the focus of this section is to 
specifically address in more detail, those events that are foreseeable due to the implantation, 
use, performance, and/or presence of the CRT system.  
Potential risks associated with the implantation of the CRT devices as well as risk minimization 
are discussed in section 9. Treatment required for procedure and/or system related adverse 
events that are experienced may include medication, device reprogramming, device modification 
(e.g. repositioning, surgical abandonment, surgical removal), or other surgical and medical 
remedies. The adverse events associated with the use of CRT systems include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

Previous Clinical Data 
The listing below provides an example of reported system and procedure related adverse 
events associated with the use of CRT systems reported in the Adaptive CRT clinical study. It 
summarizes more commonly occurring adverse events ( ≥1% prevalence) by [CONTACT_84220]. The adverse event relatedness adjudications are not mutually exclusive. Adverse events 
can be adjudicated as being related to multiple causes (e.g. an event can be related to both a 
lead and an implant procedure).  Table [ADDRESS_148448] frequently occurring event 
(218 events in 129 subjects). 
All events were collected and reviewed during the study phase and have been reclassified 
utilizing MedDRA, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, to allow coding to a standard 
set of medical terms. The MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT) and the Preferred Terms (PT) are 
provided. The LLT is the specific granular term or verbatim term, and the PT is the linked parent 
term for the LLT that is the single medical concept.

2. Dickstein, Kenneth, et al. The European Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Survey; European Heart 
Journal (2009) 30, 2450–2460 
The primary aim of this survey is to describe current European practice associated with CRT 
implantations. A total of 140 centers from 13 European countries contributed data from 
consecutive patients successfully implanted with a CRT device with or without an ICD between 
November 2008 and June 2009. The total number of patients enrolled was 2438.

resynchronization therapy devices; European Heart Journal (2010) 31, 203–210 
This study included an evaluation of the prevalence of CRT device-related infections (DRI). 
Between January 2001 and May 2007, the study included CRT implantations performed in 303 
patients (247 men, 82%). Thirteen patients developed a DRI: endocarditis in four, pocket 
erosion in three, pocket abscess in five and septicemia in one. The prevalence of DRI was 4.3 
at 2.6 years (1.7% per year incidence). The study results showed the risk of CRT infection is 
twice that of a standard pacemaker implant risk.

AdaptResponse Study 
The AdaptResponse study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional, single-
blinded, multi-center, post-market, global Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in heart 
failure (HF) clinical study. The study is being conducted to test the hypothesis that market 
released CRT devices which contain the AdaptivCRT®  (aCRT) algorithm have a superior 
outcome compared to standard CRT devices in CRT indicated patients with normal AV 
conduction and left bundle branch block (LBBB).

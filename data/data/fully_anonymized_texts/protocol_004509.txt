 2.0      STUDY SYNOPSIS         
Title of Study:  Immunologic Efficacy of Heplisav  B Vaccine in Patients Undergoing 
Treatment with Immunosuppressive Medications   
Sponsor:  Baylor Scott and White  Research Institute  
Phase of Development:  Phase 1 (Medically immunosuppressed subjects)  
Objectives:  Preliminary trial of Heplisav -B vaccine in medically 
immunosuppressed patients  with co -primary objectives of 
vaccine immunogenicity and patient safety   
Study Design:  This is an  open label  exploratory study of the immunologic efficacy 
and safety of an FDA licensed HBV vaccine that contains HsAg -
[ADDRESS_460536] properties (Heplisav -B).   
It will be used  in patients  treated with long term 
immunosuppressive drug therapy .  The patients will b e given two 
doses of Heplisav -B, the first delivered at th e baseline visit and 
the second  at week 4.   Anti-HBs titers will be determined at 
baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, [ADDRESS_460537] booster dose  at week 12 .  
Study Population:  A total of 18 patients will be entered  into th e study including 3 
evenly sized groups of 6 as follows: Group A  patients are taking 
tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin inhibitor therapy for 
underlying chronic inflammatory disorders; Group B patients are 
taking chemotherapy for solid organ malignancy; and Group C 
patients are either recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368188] -HBc positive 
donors or individuals t ransplanted for chronic HBV infection 
without recurrent hepatitis B at the time of  enrollment .    
Serologic  Characteristics Per Group : All patients  in Groups A  and 
B must be HBsAg negative  but anti -HBc positive  to qualify  
indicating that they have serologic evidence for resolved hepatitis 
B.    Those with low titer (<20 mIU) antibody will not be specifically 
excluded permitting observation of a possible anamnestic anti -
HBs response .  Patients in Group C will have either a remote 
history of liver transplant for HBV or receipt of an anti -HBc 
positive donor liver.  Eligibility requires HBsAg to be negative 
w/wo anti -HBc reactivity.  
6 
 Safety Evaluation:  Yes 
Efficacy Evaluation:  Yes 
Schedule of Events:  In the absence of appropriate documentation, all patients will 
initially be screened for HBsAg, anti- HBc, and anti -HBs status  by 
[CONTACT_368208] a screening visit .  Patients in Group A and B 
found to be anti -HBs positive will be tested for anti- HBs quant 
within one week to confirm final eligibility .   Two dose s of 
Heplisav -B will be administered at a baseline visit and 4 weeks 
later.  Anti -HBs levels will be assessed at the baseline visit and 
again at weeks 4,  8, 12, 24 and 60 .  All p atients who fail to respond 
with seroprotective anti -HBs levels (≥ 10 mIU/mL) at week [ADDRESS_460538] dose  of vaccine at week 12  and followed until 
week  60.  Liver transplant patients (Group C) will be vaccinated 
and followed in  the same manner as Groups A and B.

HBsAg -[ADDRESS_460540] limited efficacy in this situation 
even when given in higher dosage.2,3  In addition, the relatively cumbersome 3 dose regimen with 
traditional HBV vaccines has been associated with disappointi ngly low rates of vaccine 
completion.4 
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has licensed a new HBV vaccine (Heplisav -B®) which 
incorporates HBsAg particles bound to [ADDRESS_460541] .  The incorporation of the HBsAg -1018 adjuvant makes the vaccine considerably more 
immun ogenic  than traditional HBV vaccines that contain a solid phase alum adjuvant .  In addition, 
Heplisav -B offers the advantage of only requiring  two dose s given at 0 time and 4 weeks later.    
This vaccine stimulates a directed immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
instead of the multi -pathway, broad immunostimulatory response induced by [CONTACT_368209].  
Two randomized controlled clinical trials in immunocomp etent adults and a third randomized, 
controlled study in patients with chronic kidney failure have shown Heplisav -B to be considerably 
more immuno genic  when compared to a traditional recombinant vaccine (Engerix®).5-8 Heplisav -
B given in two doses 4 weeks apart induced significantly higher seroprotection (anti -HBs ≥ than 
10 miU/ml) rates when compared to Engerix given in a 3 dose regimen at 0, 4 weeks and 24 
weeks.   Increased immunogenicity was evident by 8 weeks  after the second dose of Heplisav -B.   
Also , geometric mean titers of anti -HBs were significantly greater with Heplisav -B doses starting 
at week 12.   In a  randomized, controlled trial in patients with chronic kidney failure,  a group that 
demonstrates attenuated responses to traditional vaccine,  patients were randomized to 3 
injections of Heplisav -B or to Engerix given in a double dosage at four intervals.   While 
seroprotection rates were only slightly higher in the Heplisav -B group (89% vs 81.9%), geometric 
mean titers of anti- HBs were significant ly higher in the Heplisav -B group (587 miU/ml versus 156 
miU/mL ) by [CONTACT_5875] 28 .  
It is important to note that adverse event profiles did not differ between the vaccines used in these studies.
5-8  One case of granulomatosis with polyangitis  was reported 170 days after the 
second dose in the Heplisav B group but the collective data from these trials demonstrated that 
the vaccine did not induce autoimmune disorders at a higher than expected frequency (Dynavax 
Technologies, data on file)   More over, the frequencies and titers of ANA and anti -dsDNA were 
comparable in the two vaccine treatment groups in these studies.   
Potential Clinical Utility of a More Immunogenic HBV Vaccine  
The development of a more immunogenic vaccine that induces rapid protection against HBV has 
particular relevance  in situations where timely induction of neutralizing anti -HBs is desirable and 
9 
 whenever attenuated responses to traditional HBV vaccine may otherwise be anticipated.  Both 
of these issues are relevant in patients who are immunosuppressed due to medication.  This is 
especially relevant in patients with resolved hepatitis B due to long term persistence of the 
genomic template for viral transcription in liver tissue and an inherent risk that hepatitis B viral 
reactivation may occur when immunosuppressed (see 1, below) . 
Thus, th is protocol is an exploratory trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of Heplisav -B in 
three common clinical situations where patients are medically immunosuppressed: (1) in patients given tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin inhibitor therapy for chronic inflammatory 
disorders; (2) in patients placed on cancer chemotherapy for solid organ malignancy; and (3) in 
patients who are immunosuppressed after liver transplan tation  either d one for a) chronic 
hepatitis B or for b) the same or other indications during which they receive a liver from an anti -
HBc positive donor . 
1. Hepatitis B reactivation .  Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) is defined by a sudden increase in HBV 
DNA and ALT/AST l evel, and is most frequently caused by [CONTACT_368210] 
(ISDT) where it is thought to occur because of a loss of immunologic control over HBV replication.  
Many cases of H BVr are subclinical or mild, but it also can be severe enough to cause liver failure.  
Hepatitis B reactivation during ISDT not only occurs in HBsAg -positive patients but also in those 
who are HBsAg negative yet anti-HBc positive .9   This is a serologic profile that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_368190] B.  As many as 60 to 80% of anti -HBc positive persons 
have detectable anti -HBs and this has been associated with a reduced rate of HBVr in several 
observational studies  of HBsAg negative, anti- HBc patients  treated with ISDT .9   
Current management recommendatio ns to reduce the risk of HBV r in HBsAg negative/ anti-HBc 
positive patients during ISDT vary depending on the immunologic potency of the drug(s) used  
and the serologic profile of the patient.   It is currently recommended that persons with resolved hepatiti s B  who are taking tumor necrosis factor or interleukin inhibitor either receive 
prophylactic antiviral therapy or close monitoring of aminotransferase and HBV DNA levels.  This 
dichotomous recommendation Is based on data collected from large observational studies showi ng a relatively low rate (0 to 5 %) of HBV r when anti-HBc positive patients tak e these biologic 
agents without anti-HBV prophylaxis.
[ADDRESS_460542], anti -HBc positive patients undergoing cancer 
chemotherapy are considerably more likely to reactivate (10 to 20%), and standard recommendations call for antiviral prophylaxis during chemotherapy and for as long as 12 
months after discontinuation if rituximab or other B cell depleting agents are used.
10,11   
The protective role of neutralizing anti -HBs has not been well defined in patients receiving ISDT.  
However, there are indications that high titers of anti- HBs may be helpful in preventing 
reactivation during cancer chemotherapy.  In one observational study it was found that patients with non Hodgkin’s lymphoma who had anti -HBs titers >100 mIU failed to demonstrate HBV 
10 
 reactivation during CHOP  combined with B cell depletion therapy whereas those with lower anti -
HBs titers frequently did.13   Furthermore, a more recent meta -analysis of 20 studie s of resolved 
hepatitis B patients with hematologic malignancy documented that anti -HBs positivity was 
associated with reduced HBVr risk (pooled odds ratio of 0.21) when compared to resolved cases 
who lacked anti -HBs.  Unfortunately, qualitative rather than quantitative assessment s of anti -
HBs have been used in the vast majority of studies which makes it difficult to assess the 
relationship between anti -HBs concentration and protection against HBV reactivation or the 
protective benefit of periodic booster d osing in the transplant setting  .14  (See section 2, below).  
2. De novo hepatitis B  after liver transplan tation.   The use of cadaveric  (or living)  donors  
harvested from individuals found to be negative for HBsAg but positive for anti -HBc has become 
a standard practice due to the urgent need for an expanded donor pool .    De novo HBV infection 
in HBV susceptible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368191] 50% of cases if not given 
antiviral prophylaxis.[ADDRESS_460543] reported successful termination of HBIg and long term antiviral prophylaxis in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368192] -HBc-positive livers provided they develop sustained anti-HBs titers greater than 
100 mIU /ml.17     
3. Prevention of r ecurrent hepatitis B  after liver transplant ation .  Patients transplanted for 
chronic HBV infection are treated  with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) for variable periods 
along with a third generation nucleoside analogue with anti -HBV potency  to prevent recurrence 
of HBsAg, HBV DNA, and overt hepatitis B .  The nucleoside analogue therapy must be given 
indefinitely.  HBIg contains high titers of anti -HBs and serum anti- HBs concentrations of 100 
miU/ml or greater were shown to be  partially effective in the prevention of recurrent hepatitis B 
before nucleoside analogue therapy was developed.   Attempts to vaccinate such patients in 
preparation for transplantation often fail due to the immune suppression effect of end stage liver 
disease, the requirement for a second or third dose in patients with short waiting times, and 
because transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368193], 
mycophenolate, rapamycin or other anti -rejection therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
Why is this Study Being Done?   Rationale/Significance of Proposed  Study In Selected Patient  
Groups Receiving Immunosuppressive Drug Therapy  
Chronic ISDT results in an attenuated antibody response to new and repeat antigen exposure.   
B cell depletion therapy further results in rapid att rition of pre -existing anti-HBs.[ADDRESS_460544], as many as 40%  of patients with the serologic profile of 
resolved hepatitis have seroprotective levels  of anti -HBs due to the fact that exposure to HBV 
may have occurred  remote ly in the past .  Second, an anamnestic boost in anti -HBs has been 
reported in a substantial minority of immunocompetent anti -HBc positive individuals after a 
single dose of tra ditional HBV vaccine.[ADDRESS_460545] weak anti -HBs levels (<20 mIU/ml).   Third, 
the medical literature supports a lower frequency of HBVr in anti- HBs positive i ndividuals over a 
broad range of ISDT s.9,[ADDRESS_460546] had age or disease -related subclinical immune deficiency .  
 
Use of Heplisav- B in patients with prior hepatitis B (Groups A and B). 
Prevention of HBVr . 
It is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_368194] -B in patients with 
resolved hepatitis B is an  extremely  important clinical area to study because it offers the potential 
to change current management r ecommendations for the prevention of HBVr during ISDT.19  This 
is very relevant in ( a) persons undergoing immunosuppressive treat ment  for chronic 
inflammatory disorders which are considered to be  autoimmune in nature and b) individuals who 
are undergoing t reatment  with cancer chemotherapy where the risk of HBVr is particularly high  
due to the higher level of immune suppression.  Further insight into the clinical relevance of a 
more immunogenic vaccin e to prevent HBVr during ISDT  in these two groups is provided below.  
1. Group A (chronic inflammatory disorders).  A rapid  and highly effective response to 
vaccination might supplant any concern about the need for antiviral therapy  in patients treated 
with  tumor necrosis factor or inte rleukin inhibitor therapy  for chronic rheumatic, intestinal or 
dermatologic disorders .   Taken together this  is a large patient population with current 
estimates of use for TNF inhibitor therapy being [ADDRESS_460547] to 
be given indefinitely . 19 
2. Group B (cancer chemotherapy ).  The rapid induction of high titer anti -HBs following 
vaccination with Heplisav -B either delivered prior to or soon after starting chemotherapy could  
prove helpful in preventing HBVr in resolved hepatitis B patients treated for solid organ 
malignancy .13,[ADDRESS_460548] risk for HBVr when compared with the o ther 
groups (A and C) proposed in this study .  Reactivation frequency varies from 10 to 20% for 
anthracycline based chemotherapy and 20 to 50% for lymphoma therapy that includes rituximab .   
The demonstration of high titers of anti -HBs with Heplisav -B during cancer chemotherapy would 
be a significant breakthrough because anti-HBs levels ≥ 100 mIU/ml  have  been shown to be 
associated with significantly lower rates of HBVr during rituximab treatment.9,13 
3. Group C : susceptible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368192] -HBc-positive livers .  Until recently, HBV susceptible 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368195] B at Baylor Scott 
and White and other programs throughout the [LOCATION_002].   In part, this was done because of 
the possibility that a  high MELD score recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368196] -HBc positive 
donor .   Vaccination completion was often not completed, however, prior to transplant and the 
use of HBIg and long term antiviral prophylaxis ultimately made de novo hepatitis B a treatable 
condition.  To prevent de novo infection, however, requires indefinite antiviral prophylaxis, possibly life long .  Should  Heplisav -B induce high anti -HBs titers in these immune suppressed 
patients , it could limit antiviral drug exposure by [CONTACT_368211] a periodic booster dose strategy .
17 
Group C: patients transplanted for chronic hepatitis B .    These patients currently are treated 
with short duration HBIg and life -long antiviral prophylaxis.   All continue to take anti -rejection 
therapy  indefinitely .   Hepatitis B  vaccine  is not used in these patients  prior to transplant .  
Frequent double dose  inoculations  of HBV vaccin e post transplant have  been  given  in clinical 
trials in an attempt to eliminate antiviral therapy in highly select ed patient groups .  However ,  
most  studies have failed to reliably induc e protective anti -HBs titers  with a few notable 
exceptions .20   Patients with successful prophylaxis remain HBsAg negative , anti-HBc positive , and 
HBV DNA negative  (similar to resolved cases of hepatitis B ), but anti -HBs is almost always non 
detectable  after liver transplantation for hepatitis B .  This suggests that patients without 
recurrent hepatitis B might be at continued risk for recurrence if antiviral therapy w ere to be 
withdrawn.  It would be ins tructive to see if high levels (>100 mIU/ml) of protective anti -HBs 
could reliably be induced in these patients  using a routine booster dose strategy and if this could 
lessen the requirement for life long antiviral treatment .

 4.2. Preclinical Data  
Included in Investigator’s Brochure [ Feb, 2019 , revision 16 ]. 
 
4.3. Risk/Benefits  of Study  
The risk benefit ratio for this study is considered to be low to moderate only.  There are several 
reasons for this presum ed level of risk .  Acute myocardial infarction was reported in [ADDRESS_460549] shown that it is not associated with a disproportionate amount  of immune events, 
including the origination of what are commonly considered to be autoimmune disorders or 
potenti ally immune -mediate medical conditions ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_106286] s).  In those few situations where 
immune mediated disorders appeared to arise after vaccination,  an outside panel of experts did 
not attribute them to vaccination.  Also, Heplisav -B vaccination was not associated with an 
unusual frequency of ANA or anti -ds-DNA antibodies.   Certain relatively commo n immunologic 
disorders such as juvenile  diabetes, hypo or hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis were not 
more common  when compared with those given traditional vaccine.   One reason for this may be 
that the 1018- HBsAg adjuvant is not anticipated to promote innate immunity to host tissue 
proteins  becau se TLR activation is primarily a defense mechanism against infecting microbes  
rather than host tissue antigens .   Also, it has been proposed that the [ADDRESS_460550] immunostimulatory 
response induced by [CONTACT_368212]  [Investigator’s Brochure, February 2019, revision 16].    
Patients receiving chemotherapy are not anticipated to have an unusual frequency of adverse effects  to the vaccine .  In this study it is anticipated that all HBsAg negative, anti- HBc positive 
cancer patients will be placed on the standard of care antiviral prophylaxis which greatly minimizes the chances for HBV reactivation  (HBVr).   Thus, HBV r is very unlikely to interru pt the 
study.   Should the vaccine prove to be highly immunogenic in cancer patients, rapid induction of 
seroprotective anti- HBs could further reduce the risk of HBVr.  
The risk for acute cellular rejection of the liver should be minimal because this r equi res a n 
orchestrated T lymphocyte response to alloantigens expressed on the surface of liver cells .  
Moreover, transplanted patients will have had remote transplantation (> 3 years) and are much 
less likely to undergo acute cellular rejection .  Should the vaccine be highly immunogenic in these 
patients, it might eliminat e the need for the very costly hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) 
immunoprophylaxis and ultimately might decrease the need for life -long antiviral prophylaxis  
after transplantatio n for hepatitis B .  As with anti-HBc-positive cancer patients , all patients 
transplanted for hepatitis B and those given an anti -HBc positive liver organ will receive the 
standard of care antiviral prophylaxis to recurrent hepatitis B and de novo infection, respectively.  
[ADDRESS_460551] dose of the vaccine is unlikely to  result in adverse events.   This has been given to several 
hundred hemodialysis patients in phase III studies and there were no disproportionate adverse 
event outcomes when compared to his torical cohorts who were administered four doses of 
Engerix  [Investigator’s Brochure, Feb 2019, version 16 ].  
Potential benefit. If seroprotective levels of anti -HBs are demonstrated in medically 
immunosuppressed individuals, the potential benefit to soci ety could be very large .   For example, 
there are more than 3 million people in the US who are taking long term biologic 
immunosuppressive therapy for chronic inflammatory disorders and with a population prevalence for anti- HBc alone of 5 percent, this cou ld reduce the need to depend on potentially 
life-long antiviral prophylaxis in 100,000 to 150,000 cases.   This same figure of 5% prevalence of 
anti-HBc in the general population can be applied to individuals undergoing chemotherapy for 
malignancy (estimat ed incidence of 68,760 anti -HBc positive cases undergo chemotherapy in the 
[LOCATION_002] each year) .
 21  Long term antiviral prophylaxis  may be associated with unanticipated 
adverse events and is economically costly.  Taken together, a pproximately 5 to 8%  of all adults 
transplanted  require antiviral therapy either to prevent recurrent hepatitis B or to prevent de 
novo infection.  
4.4. Dose Rationale  
The standard 0.5 ml dose of Heplisav -B will be delivered at baseline (0 time) and 4 weeks later.   
Immunologic efficacy will be compared to historical cohorts in phase III trials of the vaccine.   In 
the event that a seroprot ective level of anti -HBs (< 10 mIU/ml ) does not  develop by [CONTACT_5875] 8, a 
booster dose of Heplisav -B vaccine will be given at week 12.    
4.5. Trial Conduct  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol approved by [CONTACT_4707], and according to Good Clinical Practice standards.  No deviation from the protocol will be implemented without the prior review an d approval of the IRB except where it may be 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research subject.  In such case, the deviation will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible.  
4.6. Population  
This is an exploratory observational study of 18 in dividuals divided into 3 equal sized groups of 
six patients  (Groups A, B, and C) .  Groups A (chronic inflammatory disorders) and B (patients on 
cancer chemotherapy for solid organ malignancy) will be limited to patients with resolved 
hepatitis B  as defined by [CONTACT_368213] -HBc in serum.   Patients 
who have low titer anti -HBs at baseline  (< 20 mIU)  will not be excluded.  Group C (liver transplant) 
patients will be HBsAg negative and anti- HBc positive after transplantat ion for hepatitis B or 
seronegative for all HBV markers if a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368197]- HBc positive donor organ.  
 
[ADDRESS_460552] a one week 
± window.  
In the event of an intercurrent acute illness that either places the patient at added risk or makes 
vaccine adverse event relatedness difficult to interpret, every effort will be made to bring the 
patient back when th e illness  is resolved and preferably no longer than one week of the initially 
specified time . 
  
Heplisav -B vaccine will be de livered at the baseline /enrollment visit (visit # 2 considered to be 
day 0 ) and again 4 weeks later.   In the unlikely event that anti -HBs titer is ≥ 300 mIU/ml after a 
single dose of vaccine, patients will not be given a second dose.    All individuals who do not have 
protective levels of anti -HBs (> 10 mIU/ml) after two doses at week [ADDRESS_460553] identical 
dose of vaccine at the week 12 visit.    
 Adverse events  (e.g, localized skin reactions, fever)  that occur soon after vacc ination will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_368214] a Patient Related Outcome Measurement form.  These will be 
distributed at the enrollment visit and subsequent visits .   They will initially be completed by [CONTACT_368215].     Data 
on all AEs will be recorded on an  Adverse Event Data Capture form  (Appendix 1) .   These will be 
filled out by [CONTACT_368216].  
 
 
5.0. TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
There are two co - primary objective s: (1.) To assess immunogenicity of Heplisav -B and (2 .) to 
assess safety in medically immunosuppressed patients.   The former will require assessing the 
proportion of patients who respond with seroprotective levels (>10 m IU/ml) of anti -HBs and who 
maintain this response until study completion at week [ADDRESS_460554] dose of vaccine  during which time all adverse 
events will be collected.

 6.0. TRIAL DESIGN  
The study is non blinded and exploratory  only .    
The clinical algorithm describing the study  is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1 .   Actions taken at clinic visits 
is depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] 1.  
6.1. Primary Study Endpoints/Secondary Endpoints  
Primary endpoints : determination of (1) adequate safety and  (2) immunologic efficacy of 
Heplisav -B in pa tients taking ISD T. Immunologic efficacy will be determined by [CONTACT_368217] ( SPR) or percentage of patients who have anti -HBs titers greater than 10 mIU/ml at weeks 
24 and 60.   Secondary endpoints  include  (1) determination of the percentage of patients with 
anti-HBs titers ≥  100 mIU/ml at weeks 24 and 60.  Both (1) and (2) as well as geometric mean titer 
of anti -HBs at all study visit intervals  will be will be compared to those observed  with historical 
immune competent cohorts who received identical dosing with Heplisav -B.  An additional 
secondary endpoint will to determine the proportion of patients on ISDT who require  a third dose  
of vaccine  to induce seroprotective level of anti -HBs.  
6.2. Study Design/Type  
This is an open label study of 18  patients taking long term  immunosuppressive drug therapy .

6.5. Trial Treatment  
See Study  Synopsis ( 2.0) and Figure 1  
6.6. Duration 
The protocol includes a 52  week observation period after two doses of vaccine . 
6.7. Premature Drug D iscontinuation  
Further dosing of Heplisav -B will be withheld in the following situations:  
1. For all groups: A grade 3 AE or SAE that is considered to be possibly  or definitely related 
to Heplisav -B.    
2. For Group A patients:  A significant clinical worsening of their inflammatory disorder or 
development of a new onset pI[INVESTIGATOR_368198] .

Footnote s to Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  *There must be evidence of anti -HBc positivity at the 
screening vi sit and if so, documentation that this is chronic in nature will be obtained from a 
review of the electronic record (for example, history of past exposure, past serology 
documentations ).   If documentation is lacking, however, then an IgM anti -HBc test wil l be at 
done at the screening visit to confirm that the patient has not recently acquired hepatitis B . 
 
**Serologic testing for HCV and HIV must be within [ADDRESS_460556] withdrawal (see Section 7.4 below)  will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_368219] n of the grading criteria fo r adverse events as described in the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events as published by [CONTACT_7462]/National Institutes of Health, and the National Cancer Institute  (version 5.0, November 
2017 ).  A three point  scale will be used to judge relatedness: unrelated, possibly related, and 
definitely related.  Possibly  related  will be defined as any AE in which there is a reasonable time 
sequence to vaccination but the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_368220], patient noncompliance with immune suppression medication, or recent switch 
in immune suppression medication.   Definitely related will require a plausible time relationship 
to vaccine administration that cannot be explainable by [CONTACT_368221].  Also, it will be further considered to be definitely related if there is a response to 
withholding further vaccination.  
1. Any patient in Group A who is deemed to have significant clinical worsening of their inflammatory disorder or develop a new onset pI[INVESTIGATOR_368201].  Ho wever, the subject 
will be followed until week [ADDRESS_460557] who has a Grade 3  AE or SAE will 
not receive further vaccination if the adverse event is considered to be possibly or definitely 
related to Heplisav -B.   Each of these patients will continue to be seen at the visits specified in 
the protocol until the end of the study (week 60) so that additional safety data may be collected.  
Additional immunogenicity data may be obtained if the patient had received two doses of vaccine 
before the AE became apparent and if seroprotective levels of anti -HBs were evident when last 
tested.  
3. Transplant rejection suspected by [CONTACT_368222] a Grade 3 AE that requires medical intervention (MAAE).  Each patient with rejection will be withdrawn from further vaccination if the rejection is considered to 
be possibly or definitely related to the vaccine.     Such patients will be followed until the end of 
the study (week 60) so that additional safety data may be collected.  Additional immunogenicity data may be obtained if the patient had received at least two doses of vaccine before allograft rejection became apparent and if seroprotective level s were evident when last tested.  
7.4 Clinical Hold on Further Group Enrollment  
1. If at any time a Grade 3 AE or SAE develops that is considered to be definitely related to 
vaccination, then a n immediate  hold on further enrollment will be placed on the group th e 
patient belongs to .  Also, neither the affected individual n or other participants in that group will 
be given further vaccine inoculation s.  This applies to all groups.    
2. If transplant rejection develops that is considered to be definitely rel ated to vaccination, this 
will be considered as an SAE that is medically attended (MAAE) and a clinical hold on further enrollment will be enacted for the group (C) the patient belongs to.  In addition, no further 
vaccination will be given to the affected i ndividual.  
3. Should [ADDRESS_460558] dose of vaccine.  
2. Patients will be withdrawn from the study if (a) it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_368202] (b) if the patient 
[ADDRESS_460559] vaccine 
inoculation will be 4 weeks after screening.   Patients with malignancy (Group B) will either be given vaccination prior to chemotherapy (depending  on the planned schedule for initiation of 
chemotherapy) or alternatively as shortly as possible after chemotherapy has already begun.  Patients who have been transplanted (Group C) will be receiving ISDT at the time they are first seen.   Those transplant ed for hepatitis B wi ll have been taking ISDT for three  or more years when 
first vaccinated.  The same post -transplant interval will also apply to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_368192] -HBc 
positive organs . 
8.[ADDRESS_460560] C ompliance  
Patients will be called 24 -48 hours before each visit to remind them.  A failure to appear will 
result in a call back by [CONTACT_458]’s coordinator  during work hours  or at times by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_368203].   The patient will be offered a s uitable time for 
reappearance within 3  to 5 working days of the initially scheduled visit.  This has proven to be 
successful in the investigator’s  previous clinical research studies .   At each visit, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_368204] .  
9.0   ASSESSMENT O F EFFICACY  
9.1   Efficacy Parameters  
• Assessment of proportion of subjects with anti -HBs titers ≥ 10 m IU/ml  at each study 
interval.  
• Assessment of percentage of subjects with anti -HBs titers ≥ 100 mIU/ml at each study 
interval.  
21 
 • Assessment of geometric mean titers for all subjects at each study interval.  
• Assessment of reasonable safety in patients who are medically immunosuppressed  
9.2 Method and Timing  
Assessment of efficacy will require quantitative anti- HBs assessments at each of the visits that 
are specified in Table 1 .  This includes week 4,8,12, 24 and 60 week visits.   
10. 0.  ASSESSMENT O F SAFETY  
10.1   Safety Endpoints  
Patient safety is a co -primary objective of the study and the following endpoints will be 
considered and used for future reporting:  
1. Proportion of subjects with unsolicited AEs after inoculation. All adverse events 
including those that are unsolicited will be recorded for a period of 28 days after vaccine 
administration , and at each visit changes in the patient’s state of health will be recorded  
on the Appendix 1 (AE capture form) and as needed on the Appendix [ADDRESS_460561] s with SAEs .   The study will capture all SAEs ( and Grade 3 AEs ) 
that occur through one year after the last dose of vaccine.  To facilitate accurate reporting, 
all patients with these events will be seen within [ADDRESS_460562] dose of vaccine will be recorded. Special attention will be given to new or dose adjusted immune s uppressive medications 
that are need ed to treat adverse events . Data will be captured in Appendix 1 (adverse 
event capture form) under  the header “Type Intervention.”  
 
22 
 10.2 Further Safety Considerations:  
a. C-reactive protein blood testing will be used to assess augmentation of inflammatory disease 
activity  in Group A.  
b. Clinical assessment by [CONTACT_22660] [INVESTIGATOR_368205].   A focused physical exam will 
be part of the safety data base.   Photographic evidence of underlying disorder in Group  A patients 
may be obtained as needed for documentation.  
c. After vaccine administration, patients will be monitored for any immediate or unusual 
injection site reactions.   After leaving the clinic, reactions and AEs will be delineated by [CONTACT_368223] a t which point  photographic evidence of an underlying 
dermatologic disorder may be requested if deemed necessary.

event was considered to be related to administration of the study drug .  All relevant lab s tudies 
will be inc luded in the correspondence .  All Grade  1 and 2 AEs ( for example, such as those 
related to reactogenicity of the vaccine ) will be collected at each visit and reported to the 
sponsor  in a yearly report.

 10.6    Definitions  
An adverse event will be considered as “unexpected” if not included in the Investigator’s Drug 
Brochure (Feb, 2019) or not listed at the specificity or severity observed in the study (Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, April 1, 2018).    Definitions of grade severity of adverse events will 
be considered as follows:    
 Grade 1: mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not needed.  
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated.  
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting se lf care  
Grade 4: Life threatening; urgent intervention needed  
Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
 Adverse event: any untoward medical occu rrence associated with the use of the vaccine  
 Serious adverse event: resulting in any of the following: death, potentially life -
threatening, resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent 
incapacity, substantial disruption of the abi lity to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly.  
 Medically attended adverse event  (MAAE) : any adverse event that leads to an evaluation 
by a healthcare professional.  
 
Potentially immune mediated medical conditions  (pI[INVESTIGATOR_106286] ): A list of these  provided by [CONTACT_368224] 4.  
 
Grading of AEs will be according to  Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
Version  5.0, November 27, 2017  by [CONTACT_941] U .S. Department of Health and Human  Services/National 
Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute .  
 
10.7    Adverse Event Follow -up 
Patients with grade 3 or greater AEs and all with SAEs  including MAAEs  will be seen no later than 
48-72 hours of the time the event occurred.   The patient will be followed by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or referring specialist until resolution has been documented (regardless of 
relatedness consideration ).  Additional safety data will be included until at least week [ADDRESS_460565] dose of vaccine.

 11.0.   STATISTICAL PLAN  
11.1 . Statistical Methods  
The study is exploratory and as such descriptive  statistics will be used .    Continuous variables 
will be expressed as median values, range of values, and mean ± standard deviation while 
categorical variables will be expressed as number (percentage).   Qualitative and quantitative differences between subgroups will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_177610]-square or Fisher’s Exact tests for 
categorical parameters and Student’s t test or Mann Whitney test for continuous parameters as appropriate.    Statistical significance will be taken as p < 0.05.  
11.[ADDRESS_460566] Population(s) for Analysis  
18 patients will be enrolled into 3 equally sized groups of 6.  This is deemed adequate to 
delineate whether further studies are warranted  based on safety and efficacy observations 
made.  
11.3 . Significance  
See above section 11.1  
11.4 . Termination Criteria  
Termination  of the study requires an assessment of the grade and number of SAEs , as well as 
their relatedness to the drug .  A three point scale will be used for relatedness: unrelated, possibly 
related , and definitely related.   Both sets of parameters are defined in Section 7.3, page  18.  
Definitely related will be assessed both temporally in relation to vaccine administration and will require the absence of other possible explaining factor(s).

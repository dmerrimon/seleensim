measured by [CONTACT_11542] 8- P oint Clinical 
Progression Outcome S cale was clarified . 
• Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  (other c linical 
benefit of treatment with CX -4945): Outcome 
measure for changes of SpO2 was updated to 
number of  days to normalization of oxygen 
saturation (categorized as <96% versus ≥96%). 
• Study Duration was changed from 5 months to 12 months due to enrollment challenges. 
4. Section 1.3: SHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES 
• Assessment for the requirement of mechanical 
ventilation, ECMO, non-invasive v entilation, or

deleted as it was the same as clinical status 
assessment using the ordinal 8- Point Clinical 
Progression Outcome S cale. 
• PK collection was removed from the Schedule of 
Activities  (SOA). PK samples will not be collected 
anymore, as enough data have been collected in two 
CX-4945 studies to proceed with PK analysis. 
• Numbers of footnotes were reconciled

2.1. STUDY RATIONALE  
The COVID- 19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic caused by [CONTACT_11550][INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV- 2). It was first identified in December [ADDRESS_10900] people develop mild to moderate 
symptoms. 
The COVID- 19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (https://www.covid19treatmentguideline s.nih.gov) 
that includes representatives from federal agencies, health care and academic organizations, and 
professional societies, continues to review the most recent clinical data to provide up- to-date 
treatment recommendations for clinicians who are car ing for patients with COVID -19. Remdesivir, 
an antiviral agent, is currently the only drug that is approved by [CONTACT_11551]- 19, but it is recommended for use only in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11521]. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been found to improve survival in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11522], but it is not recommended for use in outpatients with 
moderate disease. Preliminary data suggests that outpatients may benefit from receivin g anti -
SARS -CoV- 2 monoclonal antibodies early in the course of infection. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for certain anti -SARS -
CoV- [ADDRESS_10901] of mutations on in vitro susceptibility to different 
anti-SARS -CoV- 2 monoclonal antibodies. Because of t hese limitations, the COVID- 19 Treatment 
Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using anti- SARS -CoV- 2 monoclonal antibody 
combinations only to treat outpatients with mild to moderate COVID -19 who are at high risk of 
clinical progression Ongoing clinical trials will provide further evidence information about the 
safety and efficacy of these agents.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_11523], there are a number of patients not responsive to available anti -COVID- 19 therapy. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 
outpatients with moderate COVID -19. Current standards of therapeutic management of outpatients 
with moderate COVID -19 includes symptomatic and supportive care, such as NSAIDs to relieve 
symptoms (fever, body aches, cough).  
Along with the development of new antiviral drugs, repurposing of existing drugs for COVID -19 
treatment has also been accelerated. At present, the main antiviral strategies currently employed

                                                                                                   Protocol Amendment 1.0  
   Date: 11-May-[ADDRESS_10902] SARS -CoV- 2 can be divided into two types: Strategies directly targeting the virus and 
strategies indirectly targeting the virus via host modulation. Therefore, development of an effective 
antiviral drug for COVID -19 is a global health priority and discovery of novel cellular targets for 
SARS -CoV- 2 has led to novel putative clinical strategies which merit going into clinical research 
in COVID-19.

4.1. OVERALL DESIGN  
This is a phase II multi center, randomized, open- label, 2 arm parallel -group controlled 
interventional prospective study of CX -4945 in patients with COVID- 19. Up to approximately 20 
patients will be enrolled into this study. A screening evaluation will occ ur within 7 days prior to 
Day 1. At the end of screening all qualified patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to one of 
the following two treatment arms:  
• Arm A:   the best supportive  and/or standard of care in combination with CX -4945 1000 mg 
BID PO or  
• Arm B:  the best supportive /standard of care   
The best supportive care is defined as intensive care therapy according to current guidelines, 
evidence, and best practice, including but not limited to lung protective ventilation, thrombosis 
prophylaxis, renal replacement therapy when indicated, and access to advanced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11526].  
The standard of care (SOC)  is not pre -specified  and may vary among patients, and may include 
agents with anti -viral activity, such as remdesivir, among others. Investigator discretion is to be 
applied for any established SOC . Patients pro gressed on treatment with monoclonal antibodies can 
be enrolled, if meet eligibility  criteria.  Active concomitant treatment with other investigational  
antivirals or immunomodulators are not permitted.  
Patients assigned to Arm B will do all the same assessments as Arm A.  
The total duration of the treatment will be 14 days. Patients will be followed up at 28 , 45 and 60 
days from the start of the treatment. The total duration for each patient in the study (including the 
screening) will be up to 67 days.  For details on randomization see Section 6.1.2.  
4.2. JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  
CX-4945 will be administered BID for up to 14 days. The starting dose will be 1000 mg BID (2000 
mg total daily dose). This starting dose is based on three completed Phase I studies where patients were administered CX -[ADDRESS_10910]. A total of 12 patients were treated in single agent studies at the 1000 mg BID dose 
level. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of 28- day continuous dosing of CX -4945 at 1000 mg 
BID was verified during an ongoing Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) study with [ADDRESS_10911] been treated with 1000 mg BID dosing of CX -

status at Day 28, Day 45 and Day 60. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs and Physical Examination  
Patients will have a full physical examination to include an examination of all major body systems, 
height (at screening only), weight, blood pressure and pulse rate, which may be performed by a 
physician, registered nurse or other qualified health care provider, as acceptable according to local 
regulation. Symptom -directed physical examination should be limited to systems of  primary 
relevance (i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and systems associated with symptoms). Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded at each subsequent physical examination. New or 
worsened abnormalities should be recorded as an AE . 
Pulse o ximetry should be collected prior to collection of the blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
temperature. Oxygen levels should be evaluated on the finger in accordance with the site’s  standard 
procedures. All abnormalities will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5989].  
Blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature should be recorded after approximately

recovered, when these symptoms return to the previous (pre- COVID-19) values. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Signs Evaluation to Assess Recovery  
Assessment  of recovery based on clinical signs includes normalization of fever, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
heart rate and resolution of hypoxia: 
• Normalization of fever defined as <36.6°C from axillary site, or < 37.2°C from oral site or 
< 37.8°C from rectal or tympanic site  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 2 0 bpm while breathing room air with no shortness of breath  
• SpO2 ≥ 96% in room air  
• Heart rate <90 bpm 
If some  abnormal signs were caused by [CONTACT_11561] -19, the patient can be considered as recovered, when these signs return 
to the previous (pre -COVID-19) values. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. EQ-D5-5L  
Administration of questionnaires for patient -reported outcomes at the time points described in the 
Schedule of Activities. The 5 -level EQ -5D version (EQ -5D-5L) will be used to assess five 
dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depress ion. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. COVID- 19 8- Point Clinical Progression Outcomes Scale  
Progression is assessed on COVID -19 8- point outcomes scale at the time points described in the 
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).  The ordinal scale of patient health status ranges from: 1) 
Death; 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non- invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 
4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID -19 related or otherwise); 6) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not 
requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing m edical care; 7) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on 
activities .

CONFIDENTIAL      Page 51 of 73 [IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Assessment of Changes and Trend in Inflammatory Markers  
Laboratory tests for IL -6 CRP, LDH, CPK, ferritin and D -dimer levels will be done at the time 
points described in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.3) to evaluate early markers of 
inflammation response.  Laboratory tests will be performed locally, at CLIA certified local 
laboratory following site’s best practices.  
• Ferritin levels may be useful early markers of disease progression  or dysregulated 
immune response. 
• D-dimer level is associated with pro -inflammatory cytokine cascade and development 
of cytokine storm.  
• CRP produced by [CONTACT_11562] -6 is a marker of inflammation and rapid 
increase of CRP level is a marker of inc reased risk of cytokine storm development. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. RT-PCR  
RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab)  will be done at the time points described in the Schedule of 
Activities (see  Section 1.3). A positive RT -PCR test (presence of SARS -CoV- 2 RNA) collected 
within 7 days prior to Day 1 is required at screening for patient eligibility  evaluation. Local, fully 
validated, RT -PCR tests shall be performed at screening in a CLIA -certified and CAP -accredited 
laboratory.

An AE  is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs or is 
reported by [CONTACT_11563], or a worsening of a pre -existing condition. An AE may or 
may not be related to the study treatment.  
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and patien t reports. Any abnormality in physical 
examination findings or laboratory results that the investigator believes is clinically significant (CS) 
to the research patient and that occurred after initiat ion of the first study treatment will be reported 
as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as an AE. 
8.3.2. Definition of SAEs

   Date: 11-May-2021 
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 53 of 73 1. Definitely related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to the study treatment. An AE may be assigned an attribution of 
definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment; (2) i t could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_11564] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it follows a known 
response pattern to treatment with the study tre atment.  
2. Probably related:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the study treatment. An AE may be considered probable if or when (must have 
three): (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_4676] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11531] t. (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
3. Possibly related : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
considera tion at the time they are evaluated, are judged unlikely but cannot be ruled out 
with certainty to the study treatment. An AE may be considered possible if or when (must have two): (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_4676] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11532] . (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follo ws a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
4. Unlikely  related : In general, this category can be considered applicable to those AEs which, 
after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged likely to be 
unrelated to the study treatment. An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must have 
two): (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_4676] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11531] t. (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow a known 
response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
5. Unrelated : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration at the t ime 
they are evaluated, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.) and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
treatment.

                                                                                                   Protocol Amendment 1.0  
   Date: 11-May-2021 
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 54 of 73 [IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness 
The Medical Monitor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the information described in the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
Refer to the Investigator’s  Broch ure for the expected/anticipated events.  
8.3.4. Reporting of AEs  
Report initiation for all AEs and SAEs will begin at the time of the first treatment visit and continue 
until the end of final study visit.  All events will be followed to resolution or until the patient 
completes the study. A final assessment of outcome will be made at that time.  
All AEs must be recorded in the patien t’s study records. AEs will be reported using customary 
medical terminology along with the following information: the onset and end dates,  whether the event is considered to be a SAE  (see Section 8.3.2) , the impact the event had on study treatment  
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]),  the  grade (intensity) of the event (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , the causality of the 
event (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , whether treatment was given as a result of the event (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]),  and the outcome of the event. (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Impact on Study Treatment  
The impact the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: dose increased, dose not 
changed, dose rate reduced, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or 
unknown. The “not applicable” assessment will be used only when the patien t is no longer in the 
Treatment Phase of the protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Given as a Result of the Event  
The event impact in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, non-drug therapy administered, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or other (with a specification).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Outcome Assessment  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: fatal, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving, or unknown. Only one 
AE per patien t is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are multiple causes of 
death for a given patient, only the primary cause of death will have an outcome of death.

   Date: 11-May-2021 
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 55 of 73 The Investigator is required to report all SAEs that occur during  the time period specified in  Section 
8.3.4. Once the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE, he/she must report the SAE to Medical 
Monitor within [ADDRESS_10945] additional supporting documentation as it becomes available, 
such as lab reports, electrocardiogram [ECG] reports, discharge summary, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], etc., if 
applicable. Additional follow -up information as it becomes available must be reported to the 
Medical Monitor.  
The Investigator is also responsible fo r reporting all SAEs to the appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for 
maintaining documentation in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified.  
8.3.6. SAE Follow- Up 
All patients experiencing an SAE, including the discontinued patients , must be closely followed 
until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator  (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further 
improvement expected, or death).  
For each SAE indicated as an unresolved event on the initial report, regardless of whether the 
patients  completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow -up report with updated 
information .

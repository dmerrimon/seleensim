PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/[ADDRESS_902690] interventions that use self -
regulation techniques (goal setting, se lf-monitoring, and feedback) are successful in the short term but do not 
produce the long -term activity maintenance needed for optimal health benefits. Their effectiveness might be 
improved by [CONTACT_668403]’ real -life e xperiences and values. Integrated 
regulation is a form of motivation related to personal values and identity and is strongly related to physical 
activity over time. Increasing this form of motivation could improve upon current intervention strategies, 
particularly in this population. Narrative visualization uses photographic, visual, and text annotation to tell a 
meaningful story with a data chart. This form of visualization can increase reflection, which in turn can predict 
integrated regulation and physic al activity. We hypothesize that an intervention that encourages participants to 
create narrative visualizations from their step self -monitoring data will produce greater increases in physical 
activity than a self -regulation intervention. To test this hypo thesis, we must first investigate the feasibility and 
acceptability of the narrative visualization intervention in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]. We will recruit [ADDRESS_902691] cancer survivors (aged 55 – 79, < 150 minutes of physical activity per w eek) in two phases. In 
Phase I, [ADDRESS_902692] self -regulation intervention for 12 weeks (with 12 weeks of no -intervention follow -up). Both groups will 
receive a wearable activity monitor and feedback  app for use during the intervention period as well as an initial 
orientation/goal setting meeting and workbook. In the self -regulation group, participants will receive a workbook 
in which they will write and log their weekly goals. The narrative visualiza tion group will also receive extended 
workbook content, a photo printer, and art supplies. The expanded workbooks will include spaces for posting 
daily photos and drawing explanations of step charts as well as reflection prompts relating the photos and 
charts to personal values and identity. Participants will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_902693] cancer survivors are at risk for negative health outcomes related to both cancer and its treatment .1,2 
Sustained habitual physical activity (PA) can reduce these risks,3,[ADDRESS_902694] reported that their adherence 
decreases over time because the feedback they are provided is inadequate : without an emotional connection 
to their values and everyday expe riences, individuals are unsure of how to use and interpret reports of their 
step progress .12,[ADDRESS_902695] VISUAL PROTOCOL

intervention to standard self -monitoring.  
• 2a. Determin e the feasibility and acceptability of intervention procedures and materials.  
• 2b. Compare the effects of the interventions on objectively -assessed PA and psychological outcomes 
at 12 and 24 weeks.  
3.2. Primary outcomes  will be feasibility and acceptabili ty. Specifically, indicators of feasibility and 
acceptability will include:  
• Attrition  per intervention condition as measured by [INVESTIGATOR_554748]  
• Adherence to wear of the activity monitor as measured by [CONTACT_668404] 
• Adherence to use  of the workbook as measured by [CONTACT_668405] (number of photographs taken for values clarification activity, completion of written portion of 
values clarification activity, number of days with written entries, number of days with graphic entries, 
photos pasted into workbook, number of stickers pasted into workbook, number of additional drawings, 
number of “tag” annotations added to graphs, coded level of reflection of written entries)  
• Dose delivered  as measured by [CONTACT_3449] l ogs of materials provision  
• Dose received  as measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report  
• Adverse events  as measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report and study records  
• Acceptability will be measured using quantitative items in the 12 week and 24 week questionnaires as 
well as in the brief interv iew during the 12 week assessment  
3.3. Secondary outcomes  
• Steps . PA will be measured objectively using Actigraph wGT3X BT monitors. Wear time will be seven 
days at each assessment point. Because continuous measurement is not feasible, a week -long sample 
will be taken at the three assessment periods. Estimates will be valid if the monitor is worn ≥ 10 hours 
per day on ≥ 4 days . Non-wear time will be determined by 60 or more of consecutive minutes of zero 
activity counts. Because the emphasis of the intervent ion content is on walking, steps will be the 
primary measure of PA. We will also investigate minutes of moderate -vigorous intensity PA. Based on 
criteria used for the NHANES surveys, epoch length will be one minute, and activity counts over 2020 
per minute  will be considered moderate -vigorous intensity.23 
• Anthropome tric measurements  will include height (SECA stadiometer; baseline only), weight (Tanita 
research -grade scale), and waist circumference.  
• Additional psychological variables. Table 1 shows the variables to be included in questionnaires at 
each time point.

5.5. Rationale for inclusion/exclusion criteria  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/202 2 Page 5 of 19 We will not recruit individuals who cannot speak English due to the need to understand the app, which is in 
English.  
Participants will likely be moderate risk as designated by [CONTACT_25986], and thus 
we want to be conservative in  our eligibility criteria. If participants endorse any question on the PAR -Q+, they 
will automatically be ineligible due to unacceptably high risk unless they produce a note from their physician 
clearing them for participation.  
We will focus specifically o n cancer survivors who are at least six months post major treatment to ensure that 
complications do not impact the safety of exercises.  
Other exclusion criteria exist to exclude variables that could potentially affect participation in the trial. We will 
also exclude those with a BMI indicating that they are underweight as we are interested in adults of normal 
weight, overweight, and obese status. Underweight may indicate other health problems that could compromise 
participant safety. We will include obese a dults up to a BMI of 40, but those over 40 are likely to be 
substantially different from our target population and will require independent study in the future.  
Other health exclusions are for the purposes of safety and unbiased data (e.g., substance use d isorder).  
No exclusion criteria or quotas will be related to race, ethnicity, or gender.  
5.6. Recruitment strategies  
Participants will be recruited using several methods:  
1. In-person recruitment at UTMB  and MD Anderson  clinics  
2. Phone  and email  screening of eligible patients at MD Anderson clinics  
3. Referrals from practitioners at both institutions  
4. Flyers and brochures available in treatment and waiting areas of both institutions , community clinics in 
Galveston and surrounding areas.  
5. Mailed lette rs and emails to members of research and cancer registries at both institutions  
6. Targeted Facebook advertisements  
7. Emails to local organization listservs (each institution, local cancer support groups, etc.)  
8. Presentations at local cancer and wellness events  
9. As necessary, newspaper and radio advertisement  
 
Specifically, recruitment of MD Anderson patients may occur by [CONTACT_193858], in -person,  by [CONTACT_6968],  or by [CONTACT_648]. Study 
staff at MD Anderson will review upcoming patient appointments in the clinic via EPIC. Participan ts who look to 
be eligible will be called over the phone to explain to them the study procedures and see if they are interested 
in participating. This procedure is regularly used successfully by [CONTACT_668406]. Whereas 
at UTMB we must obt ain practitioner permission to approach patients, a ll MD Anderson pat ients have provided 
consent to be approached by [CONTACT_79161] -related phone calls.  Reciprocal approval of all screening materials, 
protocols, etc by [CONTACT_668407]. Participants will also be 
screened at that time to ensure that they are eligible to participate in the study. If the patient is interested and 
eligible, UTMB study staff will call to set up an appointment for informed consent, baseline assessment, and 
randomization/study orientation.  MD Anderson staff will assist with this pre -screening but will not be involved in 
intervention or assessment procedures. MD Anderson clinics will be a recruitment site only, not an intervention 
site (i.e., U TMB consent forms will be used , MD Anderson personnel will not have access to any non -
screening -related study data, etc. ). 
 
5.7. Randomization  
A random number generator  will be used  to create a list of group assignments by [CONTACT_79166] . Sheets  
containing grou p assignments (intervention or comparison group) will be placed in envelopes that are labeled 
with the corresponding ID number. The envelopes will be opaque, and foil will be placed inside to ensure that 
the randomizer cannot see inside. Carbon paper will also be included to provide an audit trail. ID numbers will 
be assigned in the order participants arrive to their randomization visit. Upon opening the envelope, the staff 
member undertaking the randomization will sign and write the date on the envelope. T he inner paper that lists 
the group assignment, with the ID, signature, and date written on it via carbon paper, will be kept in the 
participant’s file.  
5.8. Blinding  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/[ADDRESS_902703] the 
safety of participants.  The consent form lists the following potential reasons that participants may be removed 
by [CONTACT_473]:  
• The researchers bel ieve that participation in the research is no longer safe for you.  
• The researchers believe that other treatment may be more helpful.  
• The sponsor  stops the research for the safety of the participants.  
• The sponsor cancels the research.  
• You are unable to keep appointments or to follow the researcher’s instructions.  
5.10. Premature termination or suspension of study  
There is no reason to believe that the proposed intervention  would produce increased risk as compared to 
standard self-monitoring . Because anti cipated risks and benefits t o individual participants are  small, we do not 
anticipate early termination of the study due to excessive risk or differences in anticipated benefits.  
5.11. Participant remuneration  
For the initial formative study, participants (n = 20) will receive $ [ADDRESS_902704], p articipants will receive $50 incentive for 
attending assessments ($25 at 12 weeks and $25 at 24 weeks) and will be ab le to keep the activity monitors 
and other supplies provided. Parking will also be provided.  
 
6. INTERVENTIONS  
6.1. Description of the active control group intervention  
This group will receive only a wearable activity monitor, app, and workbook. We will us e Fitbit.  The workbook 
will contain a weekly calendar with prompts to write in that week’s goal and whether each daily goal was 
achieved. Basic pen supplies will be provided for writing in the workbook. At orientation, instruction will be 
provided on the u se of the materials, and participants will set long -term (24 weeks) goals and their goals for the 
first week. Goals are based on estimates of appropriate step counts for older adults with chronic illness.33 
Goals will be negotiated with each participant, based on their baseline totals. The suggested progression will 
be from 2 days per week at 8,000 steps (week 1) to 5 days per week at 8,000 or more steps (from week 6 on). 
Negotiated goals are critical in an a utonomy -promoting study, to ensure that participants do not feel controlled. 
The standard protocol will include daily reminders to log progress in the workbook negotiated with participants 
and expected to occur via automated phone reminders set to occur ev ery day at a time they choose ). After 
their final assessment, participants in this condition will receive the additional supplies given to the narrative 
visualization intervention participants.  
In summary, the active control group will receive an activity monitor, mobile app, and a workbook. This 
workbook will include simple diary -like calendar pages. Participants will be instructed to enter their step count 
into these calendars every night.  
6.2. Description of the narrative visualization intervention  
This intervention builds upon the standard intervention by [CONTACT_668408]. The orientation meeting will include extended 
instructions on using the additional materi als as well as tips and examples for creating narrative visualizations.  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/[ADDRESS_902705] step chart (taken from the Nike Fuelband app) was annotated with 
emojis to show what was going on that day. Without the annotations, the user would know that she met her 
step goal, but would not know why PA dropped off late in the day. Here, it is clear that a planned running bout 
and a trip to the beach to play with the wharf ca ts were the causes of the early activity. The lack of activity at 
the end of the day coincided with attending a party, drinking too much, and getting sick. This narrative clearly 
offers a starting point for reflection: perhaps in the future, more pleasant trips to do fun things could be 
planned, and the participant could limit drinking at parties. These visuals also relate the steps to personal 
values, such as spending time outdoors and socializing. Visual triggers provide a foundation for figuring out 
how to interpret PA data and what to do to change behavior in the context of one’s values and identity.  
Table C.1  shows examples of daily and weekly reflection questions that can be answered with a combination 
of text and visuals (please note that these promp ts may change based on the results of the Aim 1 interviews). 
We will also include additional one -time prompts to provide context for these reflections. For example, we will 
ask participants in their first week to take photos that represent how they feel ab out themselves and photos 
that represent their values, following the procedures of a published photo values clarification activity.20 
Art supplies will include 
adequate film for one photo 
per day for 12 weeks, 
decorative tape for pasting 
photos into the workbook, 
writing materials , and stickers 
(e.g., emojis or other 
potentially explanatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]).  
In summary, the narrative visualization group will receive an activity monitor, a mobile app, a w orkbook, and an 
art supply kit. This art supply kit will include an instant camera, writing materials , stickers, photo paper, and 
photo corners for pasting photos into the workbook. The workbook will differ from that of the active control 
group. This workb ook will contain a values clarification exercise, which will involve participants taking 10 
photos over a period of about one week. These photos will be of things the participant values and will be used 
as a jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -off point for connecting personal values  to reasons to be physically active. The daily pages for 
entering steps will also be more elaborate than those of the active control group. These pages will include a 
blank graph on which participants will draw their step graph and add text, drawing, and s ticker annotations that 
explain what they were doing at different times. There will also be space for including photos of interesting 
things seen on walks (and sufficient photo paper will be provided for daily photos). Daily and weekly reflection 
questions  will encourage participants to think about why they were active each day and how their behavior 
changed over time.

8. STUDY SCHEDULE  - RCT  
 
During the COVID -19 pandemic, the following consenting/interview methods will be implemented:  
 
In response to the COVID -19 pandemic and related Institutional guidelines, the following modifications are being 
implemented effective immediately:  
 
All visits will be conducted entirely by [CONTACT_338927]. Ongoing participants will receive a phone call by 
[CONTACT_668409]. We will read the modification letter to the 
subject over the phone. If the subject agrees with the modifications, we will document the subject verbal 
response in a note to file. If we are not able to reach the subject, we wi ll mail the subject a letter.   
 
8.1. Screening  
We have collaborated with oncologists at various clinics to expand our effort in recruitment. A HIPAA waiver 
request form has been completed. With the oncologist’s approval, we will pre -screen patients via medical 
records for eligibility. The oncologists w ill refer their patients. We will not approach UTMB patients unless we 
have oncologist’s and patient’s permission.  
For patients at MD Anderson clinics, as discussed above in section x, staff will review upcoming patient 
appointments in the clinic via EPIC and call potentially eligible participants. Whereas at UTMB we must obtain 
practitioner permission to approach patients, all MD Anderson patients have provided consent to be 
approached by [CONTACT_79161] -related phone calls  and emails . If the patient is intereste d and eligible, UTMB study 
staff will later call to set up an appointment for informed consent, baseline assessment, and 
randomization/study orientation.  
Research staff will use the RCT screening guide, either in person or by [CONTACT_648], to determine eligibili ty in the 
study. Should the participant be found eligible, the staff member will schedule an appointment for informed  
consent and enrollment.  
8.2. Enrollment and provision of accelerometer  
Research staff will conduct the informed consent interview. Once th e interview is complete and participants 
have asked any questions they may have, the participant and staff member will each sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_668386]. One copy will be provided to the participant and the other kept for study records. The staff 
member will take the participant’s height , weight  and waist circumference  at this visit and ask several 
demographic questions (age, gender, race) for the purposes of calibrating the accelerometer. Once calibrated 
and activated, the staff member will provide instructions as to wearing the accelerometer for one week. At the 
conclusion of this visit, the staff member will schedule a follow -up appointment for approximately one week 
after the enrollment appointment.  
• Obtain and document consent from participant on study c onsent form

• We will collect the activity monitor and questionnaires during a brief in -person visit. Study staff will wear 
personal protective equipment and sanitize equipment as needed. The gift card will be provided at the 
conclusion of this visit.  
• While reviewing data in January of 2021, we noticed that many follow -up assessments scheduled after 
March of [ADDRESS_902719] only of 
questionnaire, interview, and if possible collection/photography of materials. We have added several 
questions about COVID -[ADDRESS_902720] a new consent interview 
and re -consent them using the new form to ensure that they are fully aware of the updated procedures.  
 
8.6. Additional communications with participants by [CONTACT_648], email/text, and in person  
Study staff will ensure that participants have contact [CONTACT_668410] a question or problem.  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/202 2 Page 12 of 19 Participants will be asked (but may decline) to provide alternative contacts to the study staff. At each study 
visit, participants will be asked if there have been any ch anges in their contact [CONTACT_668411].  
Attempts at contact [CONTACT_668412]’ contact [CONTACT_26500]. Information discussed, provided to, or 
obtained from the participant will be documented in the log.  
Study s taff will provide basic technical troubleshooting with study devices ( Fitbit  monitor, app, camera) during 
business hours by [CONTACT_668413]. If necessary, we will set up one meeting per participant to replace broken or 
lost equipment. We will allow one other  meeting for technical support of other kinds, if necessary.  
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_87074] , text or email  the day before each appointment. If emailed or text 
regarding the appointment and scheduling, staff will respond. Study staff will a lso send generic cards at 
approximately [ADDRESS_902721](s), and attempt a final contact [CONTACT_400867]. A form documenting  
all mailed correspondence will be stored in the participa nts’ file.  
Participants will be notified that study staff may not respond to non -emergency contacts outside of normal 
business hours.

Due to difficul ties from COVID19 additional contact [CONTACT_668415] s, interview, and collection/photography of material. The following steps will take place if we 
contact a subject for this purpose:  
We will ask for their permis sion to re -consent for the purpose of collection/photography of material, 
questionnaires, and interview. This visit may be completed by [CONTACT_2329] a teleconference call or in person.  
  
9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
9.1. Plan for monitoring and safety review  
The Prin cipal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for monitoring the safety environment of participants and 
ensuring that appropriate medical care and coverage is provided to all participants if necessary.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668390], including 
eligibility, enrollment, data collection, evaluation of study outcomes, problems with informed consent, and 
subject safety and well -being.  
The plan will include:  
1. Review of screening results by [CONTACT_976]  
2. Immediate reporting of adverse events by [CONTACT_668416]  
3. Quarterly review of collected data by [CONTACT_976]  
4. Annual review by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_668391]. Ensuring that any values indicating 
ineligibilit y and/or unsafe practices are flagged. Flagged participants may be excused from the study or 
instructed on safer practices, as needed. These decisions will be made in consultation with [CONTACT_668419].  
In the case of adverse events, standard protocol for report ed adverse events will be used. Study data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-I, as needed . Finally, the UTMB IRB will review study progress yearly.  
We do not anticipate a strong ethical imperative to cease one of the arms prior to the planned end of the study, 
and thus we will not perform full statistical analysis during these periodic reviews. The reviews will focus on 
indicators of safety for partic ipants, such as large decreases in quality of life or strength, or large weight gains.  
We will not convene an external Data Safety and Monitoring Board. Should the NCI request that we do so, we 
will take advantage of protocols used in the past by [CONTACT_668417] D. Pepper Older 
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/[ADDRESS_902722].  
Anticipated non -serious adverse events include musculoskeletal  pain or mild injuries, other non -serious injuries 
(e.g., bruises), minor discomfort, cardiac events, fatigue, and possible loss of confidentiality. If an anticipated 
adverse event occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_668392] e vent requires 
reporting to the IRB and/or to the NCI. The attribution and impact of each event on the overall project’s 
risk/benefit ratio will then be determined in consultation with the Co -Is. 
All unanticipated, serious, fatal, and/or life -threatening ad verse events will be immediately reported to the 
UTMB IRB within 24 hours of occurrence. All serious, fatal, and/or life -threatening adverse events will be 
reported to the program officer as well. The IRB and PI [INVESTIGATOR_668393]/or protocol based on the event. If a determination is made that participants are 
exposed to unacceptably high risk in comparison to benefit, the study will be suspended until proper 
modifications are made for partici pant safety. Aggregate reports of adverse events will be prepared in 
consultation with the regulatory key resource of the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB and forwarded 
to the IRB for review.  
Should cessation of study activities be required (te mporarily or permanently), the program officer will be 
notified immediately.  
9.2. Unexpected problems  
Unexpected problems involve risks to participants that meet all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the  nature of the research and population  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the study  
• Suggests that the research places participants at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or 
recognized  
Incidents that meet these criteria will requir e documentation in an unanticipated problem report form submitted 
to the IRB within [ADDRESS_902723]. This population consists of 
women susceptible to adverse events related to age, cancer, cancer treatment, comorbidities, 
overweight/obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Based on these factors and adverse events that occurre d in 
previous similar studies, we anticipate the following potential adverse events:  
• Acute mild activity -related injuries  
• Acute musculoskeletal pain  
• Minor discomfort  
• Fatigue  
• Cardiac events  
• Mild, acute illness  
• Complications of ongoing chronic illness(es)  
• Acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a specific, unrelated illness (e.g., flu)  
9.4. Characteristics and severity of an adverse event  
• Mild events include discomfort without disruption of daily activities. No therapy or only symptomatic 
therapy is required.  This level is equivalent to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 Grade 1 adverse events (mild; asymptomatic or mild 
symptoms; intervention not indicated).  
• Moderate  events include discomfort sufficient  to modify daily normal activity. Specific therapy is 
required. Laboratory test alterations indicate injury without long -term risk. This level is equivalent to NCI 
Grade 2 (moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -approp riate 
activities of daily living).  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/202 2 Page 14 of 19 • Severe  events include incapacity, inability to work, inability to perform normal daily activity, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91536], prolonged emergency treatment required, life -threatening events, laboratory 
tests indicating a ser ious health threat or permanent injury, and death. This level is equivalent to NCI 
Grades 3 (severe/medically significant but not immediately life -threatening), 4 (life -threatening, urgent 
intervention indicated), and 5 (death).  
9.4.1. Relationship to stud y participation  
Attribution will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a scale used by [CONTACT_303033]: 1) not related, 2) possibly related, 
3) probably related, and 4) definitely related to the study interventions.  
9.4.2. Expectedness  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_668394]. An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is not consistent with risk information previously describ ed. We may use de -identified photographic copi[INVESTIGATOR_668395] /or presentations. Photographs including  an individual’s  face will be 
obscured.  
9.5. Reporting  
All unanticipated, serious, fatal, and/or life -threatening adverse events will be immediately reported to the 
UTMB IRB within 24 hours of occurrence. All serious, fatal, and/or life -threatening adverse events will be 
reported to the program officer as well. The IRB and PI [INVESTIGATOR_668396]/or protocol based on the event. If a determination is made that participants are 
exposed to unacceptably high risk in comparison to benefit, the study will be suspended until proper 
modifications are made for participant safety. Aggregate reports of adverse events will be prepared in 
consultation with the regulatory key resource of the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB and forwarded 
to the IRB for review.  
Should cessation of study activities be required (temporarily or permanently), the program officer will be 
notified immediately.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668397]. We do not anticipate 
severe adverse events, though mild and moderate events are possible. The scale to be used is the UTMB 
Clinical Research Center Adverse Event Grading Scale. Examples of each level of adverse event on the scale 
are provided below.  
Table 1 . Reporting of adverse events to IRB   
NCI Adverse Event Grade  Expected  Unexpected  
Grade 1  Reporting not required  Report within 10 days  
Grade 2  Reporting not required  Report within 10 days  
Grade 3 (UTMB level 3)  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  
Grade 4 (UTMB level 3)  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  
Grade 5 (UTMB level 3)  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  Report by [CONTACT_1382] 24 hours  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668398]. All unanticipated, serious, fatal, and/or life -threatening adverse events will be 
reported to the UTMB IRB within 24 hours of occurrence or recognition. Aggregate reports of adverse events 
will be prepared on an annual basis and forwarded to the IRB at annual review.

Aim 2. The narrative visualization intervention will produce , as compared to the self -monitoring intervention at 
12 weeks … 
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL

• Greater functional quality of life  
• Greater emotional quality of life  
Aim 2 feasibility and acceptability  hypotheses:  
• Participants will complete >80% of values clarification activities  
• Participants will complete >80% of daily workbook entries  
• Participants will wear the activity monitor <80% of days  
• Participants will report no serious adverse events related to the study  
• Study records will indicate attrition  did not differ by [CONTACT_70973]  
• Study records will indicate that all intervention materials were provided as intended  
• Study records will indicate that >90% of intervention materials were reported received as intended  
• Participants will rate intervention  materials > [ADDRESS_902724] 80% power to detect a large effect size of approximately F = 0.[ADDRESS_902725] come to a consensus, 
we will apply insights from this sub -study to orientation procedures and intervention materials as needed.  
We will use Fleck’s procedures for coding reflection levels in the workbook text.38 These procedures involve 
creating “chunks” of content surrounding a particular theme, then rating these chunks against a framework of 
reflection levels. We will count the number of instances of each level of reflection within the text w orkbook 
responses. Artistic content will be analyzed using standard thematic analysis, as Fleck’s procedures 
investigate reflective text or verbal responses to art rather than reflection in the art itself.  
10.3.2. Quantitative  
All quantitative analyses wi ll be performed by [CONTACT_4305], who will be blinded to group allocation.  For 
tests of feasibility and acceptability, we will use descriptive statistics only.  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/202 2 Page 16 of 19 A priori benchmark indicators will be used from a variety of similar studies (e.g., 80 % completion, no serious 
related adverse events) to indicate whether feasibility or acceptability were achieved.  
For quantitative hypotheses , we will use analyses of covariance, controlling for baseline values of the 
dependent variable as wel l as time sin ce diagnosis . We will follow the intent to treat principle, and imputation 
methods will be used as necessary to account for missing data. As indicated above, these outcomes will be 
used primarily for the purposes of shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fully powered follow -up study.  
 
11. ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
11.1. Institutional Review Board  and ethical standard  
The protocol, informed consent forms, recruitment materials, screening materials, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_668399]/communication provided to participants will be submitted to the UTMB IRB for review and 
approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before any participant is 
enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require r eview and approval by [CONTACT_668418].  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set forth in the 
Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Huma n Subjects Research, as drafted 
by [CONTACT_265788] 
(April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the ICH E6 . 
11.2. Informed consent process  
All study personnel h ave attended required courses on human subject protection and HIPAA regulations, and 
certificates of Institutional Review Board training completion are on file at UTMB. Participants that are eligible 
based on initial telephone screening will be invited to attend an initial session. They will be given an individual 
orientation to the study, including information on all aspects of the study. They will be able to ask questions at 
any time. Following this explanation, potential participants will be given inform ed consent information and 
forms to sign. Only then will participants engage in assessments, be randomized to a group, and proceed with 
orientation to their study group.  
11.3. Exclusion of women, minorities, children, and vulnerable populations  
We will not  recruit children, pregnant women, or prisoners for this study.  
11.4. Participant risks  
Risks in this study are moderate and include breaches of confidentiality, minor injuries, and safety . The steps 
taken to reduce these risks include surveillance of exer cise patterns (by “friending” participants on the apps 
they are using and reviewing their activity patterns weekly ). We acknowledge that, in addition to these related 
risks, many unrelated and/or random adverse events may occur during the study period. Par ticipants may 
catch colds, flu, or other similar sicknesses and may be injured in ways unrelated to exercise.  
All known related risks will be described in the protocol and consent form.  
Confidentiality  could be breached, as is a risk in all human subjects research. Sensitive personal health 
information or other sensitive information could be divulged inappropriately to outside sources.  
Injury, pain, fatigue.  Participants may experience joint discomfort, muscle soreness, or other minor injuries due 
to increa sed physical activity. There is a low risk of cardiac events during exercise  among deconditioned 
adults, particularly those who are overweight/obese and/or older . 
Psychological stress.  Participants may feel uncomfortable due to some of the questions includ ed in the 
questionnaires.  
There is no reason to believe that the proposed intervention  would produce increased risk as compared to 
standard self-monitoring . Because anticipated risks and benefits t o individual participants are  small, we do not 
anticipate e arly termination of the study due to excessive risk or differences in anticipated benefits.  
11.5. Protection against risks  
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/202 2 Page 17 of 19 General.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will allow us to exclude from the study anyone who is potentially at higher 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_668400]. Participants will be able to withdraw from the 
study at any time if study procedures are  upsetting or painful for them. We will closely monitor all participants 
for adverse events (see data safety and monitoring plan below).  
Confidentiality.  All data collected will be confidential. The  risk of breached confidentiality of potentially sensitive  
data is minimal and comparable to the risk inherent in any human subjects research project. We will take 
standard precautions to ensure that personal health information is not identifiable , including:  
o Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_668401] a locked file cabinet in the 
research coordinator’s locked office. ID numbers will be used on these forms to match them to 
individual participants. The database matching ID numbers to ident ifying information will be 
individually password -protected and kept separately on the password -protected server. We will 
abstract wear and step data from their Fitbit  app accounts weekly into a database kept on this 
server, but we will not otherwise collec t data from the app.  
o Data collected on measurement equipment  will be uploaded to the server as soon as possible after 
collection. Then, it will be erased from the equipment. ID numbers will be used for participant 
identification on all physiologic measurem ent equipment as an added layer of protection. No 
identifying data will be kept on measurement equipment or on portable data storage devices such 
as laptops or USB drives.  
o Transcripts and scans of workbook pages will be saved by [CONTACT_79166], with any identif ying 
information redacted. These files will be kept on a password -protected server.  
Injury, pain, fatigue.  Exercise may  produce minor injuries or, much less likely, adverse cardiac events. Though 
starting an exercise program can be minimally to moderately risky, depending on the individual, when 
participants are properly screened the benefits outweigh the risks. Exercise can improve fitness, quality of life, 
cardiometabolic indicators of health, mood, fatigue, and a number of other outcomes (see research pl an for 
references). The goals that we will suggest will increase slowly to ensure safety. [CONTACT_668419] [CONTACT_832] a physician . She 
will review all adverse events and data abstracted from the apps that indicate potentially dangerous activities.  
Psychological stress.  Participants may refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break, or stop their 
participation.  
11.5. Potential benefits  
Participants may experience improvements in mood and energy levels due to increased physical activity.   
11.[ADDRESS_902726] -protected server.  
For non -UTMB study personnel we will use UTMB SharePoint link to provide de -identified information.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668402].  
12.2. Sources  of data  
Participants will provide verbal and written data specifically for research purposes. We will also scan their 
narrative visualizations and reflections in their workbooks for analysis.  Research -grade measurement 
equipment (activity monitors, etc.) will capture physiological data. The wearable devices and mobile apps will 
PROJECT VISUAL PROTOCOL  
Version 7 06/22/[ADDRESS_902727] 
access to written study data. These data will be confidential.  
12.3. Study records retention  
Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 3 years  from the date of the final financial report is sent to 
the NCI. No records will be destroyed without written consent of the sponsor, if applicable.  
12.4. Protocol deviations  
A protocol deviation will be considered any noncompliance with the clinical study  protocol or good clinical 
practice requirements. The noncompliance may be on the part of the participant, the investigator, or study staff. 
Deviations will be reported to the IRB and corrective actions will be taken and documented as necessary.

Objectives  • To generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_754489] (SPL) 
in patients with dialysis -dependent ESRD.   
• To generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_754490] -dependent 
ESRD.

Duration of administration  36 weeks  
Reference therapy  Placebo  
Major Outcomes  • Safety:  hyperkalemia, hypotension  
• Tolerabi lity:  treatment adherence  
• Efficacy:   change in mitral annular E′ velocity  
• Feasibility:  recruitment   
Statistical Methodology  Mixed effects linear regression models will be used to assess the direction and 
time averaged magnitude of change in efficacy parameters, with and without controlling for baseline covariates, to compare the effects of therapy.   
 
These mixed effects models  will also be utilized to investigate the potential 
shift in overall potassium levels.  The incidence of safety events, especially 
serious hyperkalemia,  in treatment and placebo groups will be compared with 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.

CONFIDENTIAL

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 
and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), appli cable government regulations 
and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1. Background  
End stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by [CONTACT_384112] (CVD)  with a 
unique pathogenesis, the absence of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and an extremely hi gh rate of 
cardiovascular (CV)  death1-8.  Given the predicted growth in the dialysis -dependent ESRD 
population9, the lack of effective therapy represents a critical public health challenge.  N ew 
strategies for treating CVD in this setting are desperately needed.   
The majority of CV deaths in dialysis -dependent ESRD result from sudden cardiac death rather 
than overt myocardial infarction.  Only 5.3% of deaths in ESRD are due to myocardial infar ction 
compared with 26.1% from arrhythmia and cardiac arrest10.  Although an increase in the risk of 
sudden cardiac death is detectable in early stages of CKD, the risk is particularly marked in 
individuals with ESRD.  For example, in a study of individuals with documented coronary artery disease,  the relative risk of sudden cardiac death was 1.[ADDRESS_1032768].  Instead, t he risk appears to be related to changes in the myocardium 
itself ‒ specifically, an increase in the extent of myocardial fibrosis and a decrease in the supply 
of myocardial capi[INVESTIGATOR_754491].   
Experimental models of CKD are characterized by [CONTACT_754560]
12, decreased myocardial capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168], reduced ischemia tolerance, and 
increased infarct size after coronary artery ligation12-17.  These changes are accompanied by 
[CONTACT_144376]- independent increases in left ventricular hypertrophy interstitial collagen, and 
myocardial fibrosis 12-14, 18.  Similar changes have been observed in patients with ESRD.  In an 
autopsy study, ESRD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy but without coronary artery 
disease had fewer myocardial capi[INVESTIGATOR_754492]
19.  Myocardial coronary flow reserve – a measure of microvascular 
supply and function  – also declines in parallel wi th glomerular filtration rate20-23 while coronary 
collateral vessels  – the presence of which reduces the risk of death in CAD24, 25 – are 41% less 
abundant in individuals with mild-moderate CKD than in those without CKD26.  Left ventricular

fibrosis) also increase dramatically as GFR declines and predict an increased risk of death 27-34.  
The combination of left ventricular hypertrophy, increased interstitial collagen content, and microvascular rarefaction increases the distance between capi[INVESTIGATOR_754493]
14, [ADDRESS_1032769].  
Role of Aldosterone .  Aldosterone plays a key role in the development of myocardial fibrosis and 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_754494].  In the L- NAME [CONTACT_754609], for example, 
aldosterone blockade with spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] (SPL) largely reverses left ventricular hypertrophy37.  
SPL as well as  a second aldosterone blocker, eplerenone, prevent both angiotensin- [ADDRESS_1032770] decreased collagen production, 
reduced left ventricular mass and improved left ventricular relaxation (diastolic function) in individuals with stage [ADDRESS_1032771] appears to be associated with reduced myocardial collagen synthesis  as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_754561] I carboxy -terminal 
peptide (PI[CONTACT_50637]) and other collagen fragments , suggesting that beneficial effects of SPL and 
eplerenone are at least partly mediated via the inhibition of myocardial fibrosis and adverse 
cardiac remodeling 51, 52.  Similar effe cts have been observed in a randomized trial of stage 2- [ADDRESS_1032772] (25 mg per day for 40 weeks) reduced left ventricular mass index by 
11.4% and the amino terminal peptide of procollagen 3 by 5%43, and by a recent, open -label 
SPin -D Trial   Page [ADDRESS_1032773] daily to chronic dialysis patients was associated 
with a 60% reduction in death or cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]53.  Analogous changes in

following just [ADDRESS_1032774] administered as a daily dose of 
25 mg is effective for reducing blood pressure and has a good safety profile with a rate of serious hyperkalemia of less than 3% 
53, 55-63.  Furthermore, as noted above,  in a recently  
completed open- label trial comparing SPL and standard therapy in maintenance hemodialysis 
patients , SPL dramatically reduced overall mortality and the combined endpoint of mortality and 
cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]53.  Lastly, two additional trials comparing SPL with placebo have 
been recently initiated in Europe64, 65.  In light of the established body of evidence and emerging 
interest in the use of SPL in dialysis -dependent ESRD, the current protocol is a randomized, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_754496], heart rate variability,  and circulating markers of fibrosis .  The trial will build on existing 
and emerging data about the use and therapeutic potential of SPL in dialysis -dependent ESRD.  
In particular, the study will generate important information about the feasibility of recruiting participants for a mortality -powered SPL trial in the [LOCATION_002]  and about the safety of SPL 
therapy US dialys is population under standard of care hemodialysis practices.  In addition, to 
our knowledge, the proposed trial will be the first in the dialysis -dependent ESRD population to 
prospectively compare the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of SPL and placebo, and it will thereby  [CONTACT_754562]- scale trials testing whether SPL can effectively improve the poor 
cardiovascular  outcomes in dialysis -dependent ESRD . 
1.2. Investigational  Agent   
(Information obtained from the FDA Package Insert66) 
Aldactone (spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]) oral tablets contain [ADDRESS_1032775] spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407],17- hydroxy -7α-mercapto-3- oxo-17α-
pregn -4-ene-21-carboxylic acid γ -lactone acetate, which has the 
following formula:  
SPL is practically insolub le in water, soluble in alcohol, and freely 
soluble in benzene and in chloroform. Inactive ingredients include 
calcium sulfate, corn starch, flavor, hypromellose, iron oxide, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, povidone, and titanium dioxide.

Version 5.0, May 9 , 2016  Introduction  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  Mechanis m of action: SPL is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of  aldosterone, acting 
primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone dependent  sodium -
potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule.  SPL causes increased  amounts 
of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained.  SPL acts both as a  diuretic 
and as an antihypertensive drug by [CONTACT_7652].   It may be given alone or with other  diuretic 
agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule.  
Aldosterone antagonist activity:  Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are 
present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism.  Edematous states in which secondary 
aldosteronism is  usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic  cirrhos is, and the 
nephrotic syndrome.  By [CONTACT_754563],  SPL provides effective 
therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions.   
SPL is effective in lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients wi th primary  
hyperaldosteronism.   It is also effective in essential hypertension, even though aldosterone 
secretion may be within normal limits in essential hypertension.  
Through its action in antagonizing the effect of aldosterone,  SPL inhibits the exchange  of 
sodium  for potassium in the distal renal tubule and helps to prevent potassium loss.  
Pharmacokinetics:  SPL is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_380004].  Sulfur -containing products are 
the predominant metabolites and are thought , together with SPL,  to be primarily responsible for 
the therapeutic effects of the drug.  The following pharmacokinetic data were obtained from [ADDRESS_1032776] (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_754497]-coated 
tablets) daily for [ADDRESS_1032777] and blood was drawn thereafter.

The pharmacological activity of SPL metabolites in man is not known.  However, in a study of 
adrenalectomized rat s, the anti -mineralocorticoid activities of the metabolites C, TMS, and 
HTMS,  relative to SPL, were 1.10, 1.28, and 0.32, respectively.  Relative to SPL, the binding 
affinities of these metabolites to the aldosterone receptors in rat kidney slices were 0.19, 0.86, 
and 0.06,  respectively.   In humans the potencies of TMS and 7-α-thiospi[INVESTIGATOR_754499], fludrocortisone, on urinary electrolyte composition 
were 0.[ADDRESS_1032778].  However, since the serum concentrations of

could not be ruled out  as a reason for their reduced in vivo activities.   SPL and its metabolites 
are more than 90% bound to plasma proteins. The metabolites are excreted primarily in the 
urine and secondarily in bile.  The effect of food on spi[INVESTIGATOR_754500] (two [ADDRESS_1032779] 
tablets) was assessed in a single -dose study of [ADDRESS_1032780] 100%. The clinical importance of 
this finding is not  known.  
1.3. Clinical Data to Date  
Heart Failure:   The RALES trial was a multi -national trial that enrolled 1663 patients with NYHA  
class 4 heart failure and a median creatinine clearance of 57 mL/min to SPL 25 mg daily or 
placebo.  The primary endpoint was time to all -cause mortality.  RALES was terminated early 
because of a significant mortality benefit.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_754501] 30%

Stage 2 -3 CKD :  Edwards et al randomized [ADDRESS_1032781] group (P<0.01).  Similarly, pulse wave 
velocity decreased by 0.2 meter/second in the placebo group compared with a decrease of  
0.8 meter/second in the SPL group (P<0.01).[ADDRESS_1032782] :  Trials including [ADDRESS_1032783]  that it is associated with minimal changes in serum potassium and a se rious 
hyperkalemia incidence  of <3%53, 55-63.   
Gross et al conducted a randomized, crossover trial of [ADDRESS_1032784] 50 mg twice daily 
compared with placebo in 8 hemodialysis patients.  Patients on ACEI  or ARB were excluded. 
The mean change in systolic blood pressure was 11 mm H g (P<0.05) .  Changes in potassium 
were not significantly different in placebo (4.7 ± 0.4 mEq/L to 4.7 ± 0.5 mEq/L) and SPL group 
4.6 ± 0.7  to 5.0 ± 0.8, P>0.05)55. 
Hussain treated [ADDRESS_1032785] 25 mg daily for 28 days56.  Pre-enrollment 
ACE or ARB w as continued throughout the treatment period in 6 of 15 patients.  Mean serum 
potassium levels were 4.6 ± 0.6mEq/ L at baseline and 4.7±0.6 mEq/L  at study completion 
(P=0.19) . Nine patients completed the trial with all serum potassium levels <5.6 mEq/L and 13 
completed therapy with all potassium levels < 6.0 mEq/L.  Of the remaining [ADDRESS_1032786] 50 mg 3x/week for [ADDRESS_1032787] (12.5 mg 3x/weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 25 mg 
3x/weekly for 2 weeks) in [ADDRESS_1032788] therapy resulted in a decrease of potassium from 5.0 ± 0.4 to 4.9 ± 0.4 mEq/L 
compared with a change from 4.8 ± 0.8 to 4.6 ±  0.7 mEq/L in a non- randomized concurrent 
control group.  In a multi -variable, analysis adjusting for baseline potassium concentration, SPL 
therapy was associated with a decrease in serum potassium compared with placebo.  
Taheri conducted a small, randomized trial of 16 hemodialysis patients with an ejection fraction <45%
58.  The treatment group received SPL 25 mg daily for 6 months and the control group was 
treated with placebo therapy.  All patients were treated with ACE I and/or ARB.  
SPL therapy was associated with a significant increase in ejection fraction compared with placebo therapy (6.2 ± 1.64% vs. 0.83 ± 0.49 %, P=0.046) as well as a decrease in left 
ventricular mass compared with a small increase in the placebo group (P=0.02).  Potassium concentrations increased by a mean of 1.02 ± 0.34 mEq/L in the SPL group compared with 0.08 ± 0.45, (P=0.004).  However, only [ADDRESS_1032789] 3x/week or placebo for [ADDRESS_1032790] on blood pressure at 24 months (systolic blood 
pressure change of -[ADDRESS_1032791] group).  Calculated carotid intimal -medial thickness 
progression rate for left and right segments in the placebo group were 0.06  ± 0.07 mm/ year in 
the common carotid artery versus 0.01 ± 0.04 mm/y ear in the SPL group ( P=0.003).  These 
effects were consistent across other carotid artery segments.  Plasma potassium concentration 
increased by 0.012 mEq/L per month during treatment ( P = 0.001) in the SPL group, but did not 
change significantly in the placebo group.  
Matsumoto administered SPL 25 mg daily for 6 months to 61 oligo -anuric prevalent, 
hemodialysis patients60.  ACEI  or ARB was used by 66% of patients during the study period.  No 
patient discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia or required ion- exhange therapy, although 3 
patients discontinued therapy due to gynecomastia, and 3 additional patients discontinued therapy due to possible  side-effects.  Serum potassium rose from 4.96 ± 0.72 to 5.18 ± 0.72 
during therapy.  A serum potassium > 6.8 mEq/L was not observed in any of the patients .

Pre-dialysis potassium levels increased from 4.4 ±  0.2 to 5.5 ± 0.3 meq/L during SPL therapy 
(P<0.05) and [ADDRESS_1032793] was not associated with changes in left ventricular mass, systolic function, or the E/A ratio.  However, there were significant decrements in systolic blood press ure from 145 ±  4.2 to 121 ±

McGill63 studied 30 prevalent dialysis patients (mean time on dialysis 6 years).  Thirteen 
individuals completed [ADDRESS_1032794] 25 mg daily.  ACE inhibitor  therapy  was continued in 
7/13 participants .  The remaining 17 patients failed to complete the trial protocol.  Reasons for 
non-completion were varied.  Although only limited data on reasons for non- completion were 
presented, drug side- effects were not implicated in the published report.  No potassium 
measurement s of >6.0 mEq/L were observed.  Hemodialysis prescriptions were adjusted on 2 
occasions  ‒ for measurements of 5.7 and 5.9 mEq/L, respectively.  There was no detectable 
pattern of change in serum potassium levels during the study.  MRI measurements of LV mass 
did not decrease between baseline and follow -up in the small subset of individuals completing 
baseline and follow -up scans.  However, there were non -significant decreases in relative wall 
thickness ( from 0.60 ± 0.20% to 0.56 ± 0.20% ) and end diastolic volume index (from 99 ± 27 
mL/m2 to 92  ± 33 mL/m2) and a non- significant increase in ejection fraction ( from 59 ± 10% to 60 
± 10%).  
Masumoto53 randomized [ADDRESS_1032795] daily 
or placebo.  During a 3 -year, open- label trial, 5.7% of patients in the SPL group reached the 
primary endpoint of combined death or CV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_754503] 12.5% of patients in 
the  control group  (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.81).  There was also a significant effect on the 
secondary outcome of all- cause mortality with 10 deaths (6.4%) in the treatment group and 30 
(19.7%) in the control group (HR 0.36; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.66).  S erious hyperkalemia requiring 
drug discontinuation was rare and occurred in only 3 (1.9%) participants  during the trial.   
Finally, Ito randomized [ADDRESS_1032796] therapy67.  LVMI assessed by [CONTACT_754564] 6 months (P=0.03) and 2 years (P=0.01) in individuals taking SPL compared with 
control therapy.  There was no detectable impact of SPL therapy on rate of change in residual 
renal function.  Hyperkalemia (K>6.0 mEq/L) occurred in only 2 of 78 patients (2.6%) in the SPL

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  1.4. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
An SPL oral dose of [ADDRESS_1032804] ranged from 25 mg 3x/week to 50 mg 2x/day.  Although, a [ADDRESS_1032805] , representing a low  dose (12.5 mg/day), a medium  dose  (25 mg/day)  
and a high dose (50 mg/day ), with placebo therapy.   Spi[INVESTIGATOR_754504].  O n days in which dialysis is performed the drug will be taken post -dialysis t o minimize 
effects of dialysi s on drug metabolism.   In addition to spanning a range from low to medium to 
high dose, the targeted doses of SPL are consistent with available tablet sizes and standard 
clinically utilized/approved doses for the FDA -labeled indications.  Although additional doses 
could be tested, it is uncertain whether significantly greater knowledge would be generated 
through the addition of medium -high dose (e.g. 37.5 mg/day) compared with the current plan to 
test low, medium and high dosing strategies.  Conversely, addition of an ultra- high dose group 
(e.g. >50 mg/day) is more likely to be associated with a high rate of adverse events 
necessitating drug discontinuation.  Additional dosing arms also have the disadvantage of 
increased logistical complexity.  Furthermore, in the absence of an increase in overall sample size, a smaller cohort size in each dose group could have the undesired effect of limiting power to detect differences in safety or efficacy across doses.  The increase in the overall sample size 
required to increase power across [ADDRESS_1032806] on potassium excretion are 
important , it is noteworthy that extracorporeal (dialytic) clearance, rather than renal or colonic 
clearance, provides the  majority of potassium  excretion in dialysis -dependent ESRD.  This  
extracorporeal  clearance should not be impaired  by [CONTACT_754565] .   
In the current trial, ri sks of hyperkalemia will be reduced through  close monitoring of serum 
potassium concentrations through scheduled study -specific safety labs, and through standard 
clinical prac tice at the treating dialysis unit (monthly to bi -monthly in individuals with normal 
serum potassium, more frequent ly in individuals with hyperkalemia  or hypokalemia ).  
Manipulation of dietary intake of potassium, eliminating, when medically acceptable, concomitant use of medications with hyperkalemic effects , and adjustment of  dialysate

Version 5.0, May 9 , 2016  Study  Objectives  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  potassium will also be used as additional safety measures  (see Section 6.8).   The use of low 
potassium dialysate is currently considered by [CONTACT_754566] , and dialysate potassium concentrat ion may be altered according to 
standard practice of the treating clinicians  throughout the course of the study.  However, the 
study protocol will not mandate or recommend prophyl actic changes to the dialysate 
prescription and calls for lowering dialysate potassium only as a second- line response to 
significant hyperkalemia after other measures fail to resolve hyperkalemia.  T he relative risks of 
arrhythmic death from hypokalemia, hyperkalemia and low dialysate potassium levels in 
hemodialysis patients is an active area of inquiry and uncertainty  and further research into the 
best approach  is warranted68-70.  In the absence of definitive data on the optimal approach to 
dialytic management of serum potassium concentration, evaluation of the relative risks and 
benefits of SPL therapy  within the context of standard c linical approaches to dialysate 
potassium prescription will increase the understanding of the true risks and benefits of SPL 
therapy within the context of standard clinical approaches to hemodialysis in the [LOCATION_002].    
Given these uncertainties and e quipoise regarding the ideal serum potassium concentration and 
ideal dialysate potassium in chronic hemodialysis patients, changes in dialysate potassium 
concentration will be recommended only  as a secondary means of controlling serum potassium 
to be utilized only in the context of significant hyperkalemia.  Use of 1 mEq/L potassium 
dialysate will be  recommended only as a temporizing measure of last resort .  The proportion of 
treatments requiring use of 1 mEq/L dialysate will be monitored as a secondary safety endpoint  
and compared across treatment groups. 
1.4.2.  Benefit s 
Benefits of SPL therapy in the dialysis population remain unproven at this time.  Hypothesized 
benefits of SPL therapy include improved blood pressure control, improvement in cardiovascular 
function and structure , and a decrease in arrhythmias .  
 
2. Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this s tudy is to ch aracterize the safety and tolerability of multiple doses 
of chronic SPL therapy compared with placebo in maintenance hemodialysis patients and to 
assess the feasibility of conducting a full -scale, mortality -powered trial of SPL .  The effects of 
SPL compared with placebo on multiple  cardiovascular efficacy parameters will also be 
analyzed.   The primary efficacy parameter will be the change in the E′ measurement on tissue 
Doppler echocardiography (TDI) as an index of diastolic function and a surrogate for myocardial fibrosis.  Secondary cardiac parameters of interest that will be studied in the overall population 
or in sub -studies include heart rate variability, circulating markers of fibrosis, and coronary flow 
reserve (CFR) as an index of microvascular function.   These parameters are designed to 
broaden insight into the potential effects of SPL on cardiac structure and function in individuals 
with dialysis -dependent ESRD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a full -scale, mortality -
powered trial.

3. Study Design 
3.1. General Design  
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled 4- arm tri al that will compare placebo with [ADDRESS_1032807].  Participants  will be randomized in a 2: 1:1:[ADDRESS_1032808] doses : 12.5, 25 or 50 mg once daily.  As shown in 
Figure 1 , the study will be conducted in 2 phases  ‒ a dose escalation phase and a treatment  
phase.   
All participants randomized to SPL will initiate treatment  at 12.[ADDRESS_1032809] arm will increase the dose to 50 mg i f the 
25 mg dose was tolerated with weekly evaluation s for tolerability, hypotension and hyperkalemia

dose with weekly evaluation for tolerability, hypotension and hyperkalemia until 6 weeks . 
In order to maintain the blind,  during the dose escalation phase all study participants , regardless 
of randomized assignment, will receive new study drug kits  every 2  weeks and will be evaluated 
weekly.   
At the end of the dose escalation phase, participants will continue treatment based on the 
randomized dose assignment for an additional 30 weeks (treatment phase) such that the total 
duration of study medication is [ADDRESS_1032810] or placebo will be decreased during the dose- escalation and follow -up phases for 
hypotension, hyperkalemia or other dose limiting side- effects.

3.2. Study Endpoints  
3.2.1.  Primary Endpoints  
Safety  
The primary safety endpoints are : 
1) The incidence of serum potassium >6.5 mEq/L   
2) The incidence of serious hypotension defined as hypotension requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_754507], acute myocardial 
infarction, or other cardiovascular event (e.g. aortic dissection) . 
Tolerability  
Tolerability will be assessed on the basis of whether participants  can continue the assigned 
dose throughout the entire treatment period.  Any reduction in dose of study medication will be 
considered a failure of primary tolerability.  
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy parameters will be measured between baseline and 36 week s:  
Change in mitral annular E′ velocity will be  measured using Tissue Doppler Index (TDI) 
echocardiography of the left ventricle  as a measure of diastolic function and as surrogate 
measure of left ventricular fibrosis.

Version 5.0, May 9 , 2016  Study  Design  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  E′ has been chosen to be the primary  echocardiographic endpoint because the intra -observer 
coefficient of variation is low71 and multiple studies demonstrate a high correlation with 
myocardial fibrosis72-74, a primary biologic endpoint of interest .  E′, for example, parallels the 
accumulation of myocardial collagen and fibrosis in the senescence prone mouse75,  and 
correlates with endomyocardial fibrosis after human cardiac transplant76 as well as the presence 
of late gadolinium enhancement77 ‒ a highly -validated measure of myocardial scar  ‒ across 
multiple disease states.  Furthermore, abnormalities in TDI have been strongly linked to 
mortality in multiple disease states78-[ADDRESS_1032811] -specific studies show that E′ is highly correlated with LV mass and other 
indices of diastolic function, and that changes in E′ predict mortality34, 81.  
In contrast to other echocardiographic measures, E′ (or the ratio of E/ E′) is minimally affected by 
[CONTACT_754568]82-84 ‒ a critical consideration in ESRD where volume status can vary 
widely.  The adjunctive information on diastolic and systolic function and filling pressures 
generated by [CONTACT_754569]85.  Finally, these measures are known to respond to 
therapeutic interventions that exert anti -fibrotic effects86.  Alternative approaches for assessing 
fibrosis include myocardial biopsy which is considered the gold standard, and cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging with gadolinium.  However, both of these have risks of serious complications 
and thus are not suitable for a research study.  
Feasibility   
An objective of this study is to  assess the feasibility of conducting a full -scale mortality -powered 
trial.  Feasibility will b e assessed based on recruitment, dropout and loss to follow -up rates .

5. Study Drug  
5.1. Description  
Study drug  will be administered as matched, gel -encapsulated capsu les containing 12.5 mg,  
25 mg or 50 mg of  spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], 17-hydroxy -7α-mercapto-3- oxo-17α-pregn-
4-ene-21-carboxylic acid γ -lactone acetate ) or placebo (methylcellulose powder ).  
5.2. Treatment Regimen    
As depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1 , 125 participants  will be randomized in a 2:1:1:[ADDRESS_1032815] ( 12.5, 25, or 50 mg), with an equal proportion in each SPL group. SPL will be 
matched with placebo and administered orally, once daily, post -dialysis .  Participants will be 
instructed that, on days of dialysis treatment, the dose should be taken after the dialysis  
session.  All patients will be started on SPL 12.[ADDRESS_1032816] , and 
participants randomized to 12.5 mg or 25 mg will continue the same dose.  
In order to maintain the blind, all study participants, regardless of randomized ass ignment, will 
receive a new study drug supply every 2 weeks  during the dose escalation phase.  For all 
participants , serum potassium levels will be checked at 3- 5 days and at 2 weeks after the new 
study drug supply is dispensed, and weekly evaluations will be performed for tolerability, 
hypotension and hyperkalemia.   
At the end of the dose escalation phase, participants will continue treatment based on the

(ACEI ) or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB) use.  Randomly permuted blocks of random sizes 
will be used to control the balance of participants assigned to each treatment regimen within 
each stratum.  This method guarantees that at no time during randomization will the number of 
participants in any arm be grossly imbalanced, and ensures that the sites will be unable to 
predict assignments.  Both longer dialysis vintage and use of ACEI or ARB increase the 
likelihood of hyperkalemia through loss of residual renal function and drug effects, respectively, and thus, are potential confounders that should be balanced across treatment groups.  All randomization schedules will remain confidential, and known only to authorized members of 
the DCC staff and the central pharmacy.  
All relevant screening and eligibility confirmation data will be entered into the centralized data management sys tem in advance of randomization in order for an eligible participant to be 
randomized.   When th e study team agrees that the patient should be randomized, and the 
“Ready to Randomize Report” confirm s that all eligibility criteria have been met, the Study 
Coordinator will implement the web- based randomization assignment managed centrally at the 
DCC.  This centralized randomization process will provide a randomized treatment assignment for that p articipant within the relevant  stratum , linked with a specific study drug kit prepared at 
the central pharmacy.  This kit will be provided to the local investigative team for distribution at 
the randomization/baseline visit.  
5.4. Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  and Maintenance of Blind  
Study drug and matching placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_754575] (IDS) which will be the Central Pharmacy for this study.  Study drug 
kits will contain 2 -week supplies during the dose escalation phase, a 6- week supply for weeks 
6-12, and 12 -week supplies for weeks 13- 24 and weeks 25- 36.   
Study drug will be prepared using gelatin encapsulation or equivalent methods such that all 
study drug, regardless of type ( SPL or placebo) and dose are identical in appearance.  During 
encapsulation, SPL tablets will remain intact and will not be altered.  All dose levels will be 
administered as a single capsule.  IDS personnel will have access to the randomization scheme 
and code in order to prepare study drug kits containing the correct dose of SPL or placebo. IDS 
personnel responsible for preparation of study drug will not have access to study data or results 
and will not participate in analyses of study data or publications.  Randomized treatment 
assignments and the dosages provided in study drug kits will not be known by [CONTACT_754576].   Only the Investigational 
Drug Service personnel and the database programmer at the DCC will be unblinded.  
SPin -D Trial   Page [ADDRESS_1032818] 
the next supply of study drug.  Unless there is a contraindication to a dose increase  (e.g. 
hypotension or hyperkalemia) , the investigator will indicate on the  request form  approval for 
dose escalation.  The Data Management System will generate a unique kit number based on 
the randomized treatment assignment and the prior dose.  If  up-titration to the next dose is 
contraindicated , the Clinical Center investigato r will indicate this on the study drug request form 
and a kit number corresponding to the current dose of SPL (or placebo) will be generated .  At 
the end of the dose titration period, participant s will be provided with a [ADDRESS_1032819] (or placebo) will be provided.  In the event that a participant  is already 
receiving the lowest dose of SPL, placebo will be substituted  for the first two down- titrations .  
As only [ADDRESS_1032820] (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/day) are specified, study  medication will be 
discontinued in the event that a 3rd down titration of dose is required (see Table 1) .  For 
participant s already on placebo, a new supply of placebo will be provided in order to maintain 
blinding. Un -blinding to preserve patient safety will be considered  via a formal request to the 
DCC.   
If the dose escalation schedule is interrupted (e.g., if a participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_754511]), 
dose escalation will be delayed until the participant has had access to the current dose of 
study drug  for a total of two weeks.   If, due to considerable delays in dose escalation, a  
participant has not reached the final dose assignment by [CONTACT_754577] 12 visit, the participant  
will remain at the current dose of study drug for the remainder of the study  and the treatment 
phase (i.e., the 30- week post -escalation period) will be shortened  accordingly such that the 
total duration of study participation is not increased as a result of the delay . For example, if 
dose escalation is not completed until week 10, the treatment phase will be [ADDRESS_1032821] Down Titration  Discontinue  Discontinue  Discontinue  Discontinue

Study drug  containers will be returned to site investigators at the conclusion of each 2-week 
period during dose escalation (weeks 2, 4 and 6), and at the Week 12, 24 and 36 visits . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_754512].    
5.6. Concomitant Therapy  
Medication use (both oral and intravenous) will be collected at baseline and throughout the 
course of the study.  Digoxin use, dual ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy and non -selective beta 
blocker use are exclusion criteria.  If these medications are initiated during follow -up the treating 
clinician will be contact[CONTACT_81299].  For  digoxin or dual ACEI/ARB use, if the 
prohibited drug cannot be discontinued, study medication will be withdrawn and participants will 
continue to be followed.  For non -selective beta blocker use, it is anticipated that the treating 
clinician will be comfo rtable substituting a selective beta blocker but if not, study drug will be 
discontinued and the participant will continue to be followed.    
5.7. Packaging  
Study drug  will be dist ributed in patient -specific containers with 17 capsules for every 2- week 
period during the dose escalation phase, 49 capsules for the weeks 6- 12, and 91 capsules for 
weeks 12- 24 and weeks 24- 36.  The extra capsules allow for continued dosing in the event of a 
short delay in dispensing the subsequent study drug supply.  Labeling will in clude patient name, 
patient ID, protocol number, study -center, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], and prescribing physician (study 
investigator) .  
5.8. Blinding of Study Drug  
Generic SPL will be purchased, and matching placebos will be prepared by [CONTACT_754578].  The IDS will send study drug to the Clinical Center research pharmac ies 
and the identity SPL and matched placebo  will be concealed from both investigators and 
participants.  Only the ID S and the database programmer will be unblinded.   See Section 8. [ADDRESS_1032822] and matched placebo will be stored at <25º C.  Study supplies will be stored in the central 
IDS pharmacy at the University of Pennsy lvania  until shipment to the Clinical Center research 
pharmacy .  Study drug will be stored at the Clinical Center’s research pharmacy until distribution 
to the pa rticipant.      
5.9.3.  Dispensing Study Drug  
The Clinical Center pharmacist or trained site designee will dispense study drug to the 
participant  and complete a dispensing/accountability log for each participant .  Designated site 
personnel with responsibility for dispensing and reconciling study drug will have appropriate 
training and documentation of this training will be maintained in the site′s regulatory binder.  
5.9.4.  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
Study drug  containers will be returned by [CONTACT_754579] 2-week , 6-week,  or  
12-week  perio d and remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_754513].  Unused supplies of 
study drug will be destroyed by [CONTACT_754580][INVESTIGATOR_754514].  In the event that a participant does not return study dru g 
containers  he/she will be instructed to stop taking any study drug from the non- returned 
container.   
 
6. Study Procedures  
A schedule of study visits and procedures is  provided in the Study Procedures Table in  
Section 15 .1 (Attachments ). 
6.1. Pre-screening Activities  
Dialysis unit records and study center medical records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_754581].  The treating nephrologist for a potentially eligible patient  will be 
contact[CONTACT_754582] .  Patients  
remaining eligible after these procedures will be approached in person at the dialysis unit to 
confirm eligibility for and interest in participation.  Participants  signing IRB -approved 
informational flyers  that indicate willingness to be called by [CONTACT_754583]-screened by [CONTACT_756].   
6.2. Screening Visit  (Day ‒ 30 to Day  0) 
Potential  participants  expressing interest in enrolling in the study  will be scheduled for a 
Screening visit.  This visit may  take place at the local dialysis unit or at the Clinical Center  and 
may take place over more than [ADDRESS_1032823] be completed within 30 days prior to the baseline visit .   
Informed consent will be obtained and documented before any study procedures are performed.

count), and dialysis prescription will be collected during Screening .  Blood will be drawn for 
serum pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential . Participants will perform an inter-
dialytic urine collection  prior to or within seven days following the baseline visit , for assessment 
of residual renal function.   The urine collection will begin immediately after dialysis and continue 
until the start of the next dialysis session, and will be performed during one of the 44- hour 
(approximately) inter -dialytic periods rather than during the 68- hour (approximately) inter -dialytic 
period.   
Potential participants will be excluded if there is any serum potassium value of ≥6.5 mEq/L 
within 3 months prior to the Baseline/Randomization visit  or if there is any serum potassium 
value ≥6 mEq/L within 2 weeks prior to the Baseline/Randomization visit.  It is required that 
there be at least one serum potassium value obtained within [ADDRESS_1032824] 
monitoring will be performed between the screening and baseline/randomization visits.  The 
participant will wear the Medtronic SEEQ heart monitor for [ADDRESS_1032825] at 6 weeks and 32- 36 
weeks.  
6.3. Baseline/Randomization  Visit  (Day 0)  
The Baseline/Randomization visit will take place on a non -dialysis day  during the short 
(approximately 44- hour) inter -dialytic interval.  At this visit, medication use, v ital signs , a brief 
physical examination and adverse events will be recorded, and eligibility will be confirmed.  Once 
eligibility has be en confirmed, randomization to treatment group will be performed through the 
centralized Data Management System.     
Serum and plasma will be collected, aliquoted, and shipped for batched measurement of 
cardiac and inflammatory markers  and for long -term sto rage.  Whole blood will be collected for 
DNA extraction.  Blood will also be drawn for local measurement of chemistries  and complete 
blood count .  If blood cannot be collected on  the day of the Baseline/Randomization visit (Day 
0), it should be collected t he following day prior to the dialysis session and before the initiation 
of study  drug.  If blood for batched analyses, long- term storage , and DNA extraction cannot be 
obtained on the day of randomization or the following day, it is acceptable to obtain the blood 
within the 10 days prior to the Baseline/Randomization visit, and, if on a dialysis day, prior to 
initiation of the dial ysis session.  However, the blood for local measurement of chemistries and

visit rather than within 10 days prior.   
Tissue Doppler I ndex  echocardiography (TDI echo)  will be performed  on the day of the 
Baseline/Randomization visit.  If the TDI echo cannot be performed at that visit (Day 0) , it 
should be completed as soon as possible thereafter and within 7 days after the Baseline/Randomization visit.  The echo must be performed on a non- dialysis day during the 
short (approximately 44 hour) inter -dialytic interval.  A s ubset of parti cipants  will have  positron 
emission tomography ( PET scan ) (after exclusion of pregnancy) . 
A 2-week  supply of study drug will be dispensed and the participant  will be instructed to start the 
study drug  the following day , after dialysis . 
6.4. Week 1, Week 2, Week  3, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 6 Visits  (window for 
each: -4 to +3 days)  
Blood will be obtained for measurement of serum potassium at 3- [ADDRESS_1032826] include hypotension,  gastrointestinal 
symptoms, gyn ecomastia/breast tenderness , hyperkalemia and rash  (see Section 8.3.1) .  
Dialysis unit records will be  reviewed for inter -current laboratory values, the occurrence of 
hypotension, and changes to the dialysis prescription.  The dose of study drug may be reduced 
if a participant experiences dose- limiting adve rse events, as outlined in Section 6.8 and 6.9.   
A new supply of study drug will be dispensed and used pi[INVESTIGATOR_754515] 2, week 4, and week 6 visits as described in sections 5.9.3 and 5.9.4 .  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_754516], and unused study drug will be destroyed by [CONTACT_754584][INVESTIGATOR_754517].    
At the end of the dose escalation phase, participants in the heart rhythm monitoring sub-study 
will undergo heart rhythm monitoring using  the Medtronic SEEQ device.  The participant will 
wear the Medtronic SEEQ heart monitor for 7 consecutive days.  Participants will receive the 
monitor kit from the research team and will return the kit after  the monitoring period. 
6.5. Week 8  (-4 to +3 days), Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 28, and 
Week 32 Visits  (-7 to +7 days for all except Week 8)  
Participants  will be contact[CONTACT_633004] 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, [ADDRESS_1032827] as 
described in Section 6.4 .  Dialysis unit records will be reviewed for inter -current laboratory 
values , the occurrence of hypotension, and changes to the dialysis prescription.  If a serum 
potassium value is not available in the participant’s dialysis unit record, corresponding  to the 
date of the monthly study visit (plus window), blood will be obtained from the participant for 
measurement of serum potassium.  The dose of study  drug will be reduced for participants  
experienc ing dose- limiting adverse events as outlined in Sections 6.8 and 6.9 .

Participants in the heart rhythm monitoring sub- study will undergo heart rhythm monitoring using 
the Medtronic SEEQ device for a continuous 7 day period between Week s 32 and 36.   
Participants will receive the monitor kit from the research team and will return the kit after the 
monitoring period.  
6.6. Week 36 Visit  (End of Treatment)  (-7 to  +7 days)  
At the Week [ADDRESS_1032828] a PET scan  performed (following exclusion of pregnancy) .   
6.6.1.  Early Withdrawal Visit  
If a patient withdraws from the trial before the Week 36 milestone or if it becomes known that a participant will not be available for an in- person visit at Week 36 (e.g., due to relocation), an 
Early Withdrawal visit will be scheduled to conduct the final  comprehensive assessments that 
otherwise would be performed at Week 36.  For participants in the heart rhythm monitoring sub-
study, the assessments will include heart rhythm monitoring using the Medtronic SEEQ device 
for 7 continuous days at the time of early withdrawal, if possible.  Patients who stop taking study medication are not considered early withdrawal s and will be asked to continue to provide follow -
up data on the study schedule and to participate in the final comprehensive assessment at 
Week 36.   
6.7. Week 40 Visit  (-7 to +7 days)  
At the Week 40 visit (4 weeks after end of treatment), patients will be interviewed in person or 
by [CONTACT_754585] 6.4 .  Dialysis 
unit records will be reviewed for inter -current lab oratory values, the occurrence of hypotension, 
and changes to the dialysis prescription. 
6.8. Hypotension Management  
In the event of recurrent intra -dialytic hypotension or serious hypotension not attributable to 
acute events (see Section 3.2 .2 for definitions of intra -dialytic hypotension and serious 
hypotension) , study investigators will review the participant ’s non -study anti -hypertensive 
medications , dry weight , and volume status .  The participant ’s clinician will be contact[CONTACT_754586] -D Trial   Page 28

1) Decrease non -study anti -hypertensive medication(s)  
2) Increase dry weight if there is no evidence of peripheral or pulmonary edema  
3) Reduce ultrafiltration rate by [CONTACT_754587] 
4) Reduce dose of study drug if: 
a. Peripheral or pulmonary edema is present  
  AND  
b. There are no other anti -hypertensive medications prescribed OR other  
anti-hypertensive medications should not be discontinued (e.g., beta blocker 
following myocardial infarction) 
5) Discontinue study medication at the 3rd dose reduction 
Treating c linicians will be free to  manage hypotension according to standard clinical practices 
and are not obligated to follow the study guidelines with respect to non -study medication, fluid 
removal rate, or dry weight.  In contrast, dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug will be 
directly managed by [CONTACT_754588].   
6.9. Hyperkalemia  Management  
Serum  potassium will be measured at 3-5 days and 2 we eks after study drug i nitiation or dose 
increase as well as monthly throughout the duration of treatment .  In order to minimize the risks 
of hyperkalemia, all participants  will be provided with standardized, routine printed dietary 
informa tion about dietary sources of potassium at the Baseline/Randomization visit .  Treating 
clinicians  will continue to manage the dialysate potassium concentration according to local  
standards .  A hyperkalemia management guideline will be provided to treating clinicians .  Study 
staff will monitor potassium values and contact [CONTACT_238949] s in the event of hyperkalemia  to 
review the management guidelines and ensure that hyperkalemia is being actively managed.  
Treating clinicians  will be free to manage hyperkalemia according to local standards .  However,  
study drug dose reductions or discontinuation will be directly managed by [CONTACT_754589] (see Figure 2).    
As shown in Figur e 2, study drug will be discontinued if serum potassium is ≥7.0 mEq/L.  Study 
drug will also be discontinued if a 3rd study drug dose reduction is required.  Study drug dose will 
be reduced if serum potassium is 6.0 – 6.9 mEq/L and either a) remains ≥6.5 m Eq/L on repeat 
measurement or b) remains ≥6 mEq/L on repeat measurement despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a dialysate potassium bath 
concentration of ≤2.0 mEq/L.  Reversible causes of hyperkalemia should be considered and 
addressed when serum potassium is ≥6.0 mEq/L even if there are changes to study drug dosing.  
Reversible causes of hyperkalemia include vascular  access dysfunction, missed dialysis  sessions , 
shortened or technically compromised dialysis  sessions , dietary indiscretion  and ACEI or ARB 
use.  In general, these reversible causes  should be addressed prior to reducing  the dialysate 
potassium concentration.   Use of  1.0 mEq/L dialysate potassium is not recommended.   However, 
treating  clinicians are not prohibited from us ing low potassium dialysate solutions  in acc ordance 
with local practices.  Serum potassium will be rechecked within one week when potassium is ≥6.0 
mEq/L .  Results of serum potassium and recommendations for change in dialysis orders will be 
conveyed to treating clinicians and the dialysis unit nursi ng staff.

In the ev ent of persistent gynecomastia/breast tenderness,  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or 
anorexia without alternative cause, the dose of study  medication may be reduced.   Study drug 
should be discontinued if there is a rash that is not attributable to another cause.  
 
7. Statistical Plan  
7.1. Sample Size Determination  
Sample size considerations were framed using standard study design parameters to ensure 
80% power to  detect pre -specified effect sizes  utilizing intermediate outcomes.  However,  for 
this early phase pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the primary focus is directed at assessing safety and feasibility, with 
no attempt to create critical test result regions for standard hypothesis testing.  
From preliminary studies, we assumed estimated baseline parameters of E′ to be 5.8 ± 1.8 
cm/s.34, 43, 87, 88  Assuming a correlation ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1032829] -therapy E′, and a 10% 
dropout  rate of study participants by  [CONTACT_2054], a sample size of 125 (2:3; [ADDRESS_1032830] dose  x 3 active treatment arms ) will provide 80% power to 
detect effect size of 0.7SD (1.3 cm/sec) difference in change from baseline to 9 month endpoint 
in E′, equivalent to a 22% average reduction  across the [ADDRESS_1032831] of this magnitude54.   
For the safety endpoint of hyperkalemia incidence, we assumed a 5% incidence in the placebo 
arm.  With a sample size of 125, derived under the effect size considerations noted previously,  
this design provides 80% power to detect an average incidence of 22% across the [ADDRESS_1032832] dose 
arms.   Moreover, this same sample size also provides 80% power to detect a small difference of 
0.1 mEq/L in time- averaged serum potassium concentration, treated as a continuous variable, 
between placebo and treatment arms .  
7.2. Randomization and Stratification  
To ensure balance in treatment assignments within potential confounders, a stratified 
randomization procedure, blocking on four (4) strata formed by [CONTACT_941] 2 x 2 cross -classification of 
1) dialysis vintage (≥ 1 vs. < 1 year on dialysis) by 2) ACEI or ARB use  (yes, no),  within Clinical 
Centers  will be implemented within a web- based randomization module deployed centrally 
within the DCC.  Within each of the se strata, participants  will be randomly allocated to the 
placebo and the three SPL dose arms with the ratio of 2:1:1:1 .  
The treatment assignment code, corresponding to each treatment identifier number, will be 
known only to the person serving as the D CC Quality Assurance Director  and the IDS , until the 
completion of treatment and data collection on all participants.  At the end of a patient’s study phase, the participants  and the treating physicians will be asked to guess their treatment 
groups, and provide the basis for their judgments for analysis later, to determine whether the 
blinding has been broken.  However, except in the case of emergency unmasking, the treatment 
codes will not be identified until the DSMB has approved unblinding in preparation for the public dissemination of results.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  7.3. Intent -to-treat Analysis  and Missing Data 
An intent -to-treat analysis, in which all available data on all randomized participants ar e 
included, will be used for the primary comparison of treatments.  All attempts will be made to 
keep missing data to a minimum, and participants who withdraw from treatment will be 
encouraged to continue on study in order to provide complete follow -up inf ormation.  Thus, 
irrespective of withdrawal from treatment, all participants should continue to be followed with all scheduled outcome evaluations until the end of the study.  However, it is expected that up to 
10% of the randomized participants may withdraw prior to the final assessment of response at 
36 weeks.  These participants will be included in the denominator for evaluation of the response 
rates defined for the primary endpoint.  
The characteristics at the time of randomization for those participants  without complete  
follow -up will be examined; however, there will be limited statistical power to detect any but 
major differences between these participants and those with complete follow -up.  In addition, in 
order to assess the potential biases introduced by [CONTACT_93501], a comparison of withdrawal rates and/or time to withdrawal will be included as an ancillary 
analysis to the primary endpoint comparison.  
Secondary analyses will examine the all -treated, as -treated, and per- protocol populations as 
defined below:  
• All-randomized population/intention- to-treat (ITT)
:  Any participant  randomized into the 
study, regardless of whether they received study drug.  
• As-treated population :  Any participant  randomized into the study regar dless of whether 
they received study drug.  As -treated participants  will be analyzed according to the dose 
of study drug actually received.  
• All-treated population :  Any participant  randomized into the study that received at least 
one dose of study drug.  
• Per-protocol population :  Any participant  who was appropriately randomized, and 
received the protocol- dictated study drug exposure (≥75% of prescribed doses) and 
endpoint assessments  through 36 ± [ADDRESS_1032833] -biased analysis of treatment efficacy and safety, as -treated 
analyses provide important complementary information on  biological effectiveness of therapy 
(e.g. theoretical efficacy if drug were tolerated by [CONTACT_55473] ) and on the effects of actual

89.  For this reason, as -treated 
approaches provide important complementary information to ITT analyses and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_93469]
89.  Given a treatment 
protocol that allows for dose reduction of study medications, the as -treated analysis will provide 
critical information in this trial for assessing dose-related efficacy and the incidence of advers e 
events such as hyperkalemia.  As-treated analyses will assign treatment dose according to the 
dose used at the time of an adverse event (safety analyses) or according to the mean dose 
received during the trial (efficacy analysis).  
SPin -D Trial   Page [ADDRESS_1032834] descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics and study 
outcome measures at each follow -up visit, both overall, and within each treatment group.  
Examination of baseline characteristics will include estimates of the distribution of age, race, 
and ot her demog raphic characteristics,  lab measures  and study center .  Summary statistics 
theresuch as means, medians, and ranges will be produced for all measured variables.  
Frequencies will be computed for all categorical and ordinal variables.  Graphical methods 
including stem -and-leaf diagrams and boxplots will be used to examine distributions, identify 
potential influential points, and guide in the choice of transformations, if warranted.  The balance 
of baseline measures across the three treatment groups will be compared using appropriate k -
sample tests, including Kruskal -Wallis tests and Fisher’s exact tests . 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy and Safety Outcomes  Mean (± standard deviation) or median 
(interquartile values) of baseline and end of study measurement in the primary endpoint E ′ will 
be presented.  Change in E′ velocity at 36 weeks  will be assessed and reported quantitatively, 
and descriptive statistics for absolute and % change will be provided.  Mixed effects linear 
regression models with baseline covariate adjustments will be used for assessment of treatment 
effects.  Model assumptions regarding homoscedasticity and normality will be examined using standard techniques.   
For the primary safety endpoint, tables with percent incidence and incidence rate (for events 
that can occur more than once during follow -up) will be prepared.  Differences in incidence and 
incidence- rate will be assessed using logistic regression or Poisson regression with factors for 
assigned treatment and the stratification variable.  In particular, for safety endpoints, we will 
investigate the potential change  in potassium  level in placebo and treatment groups with 
monthly measure of potassium. Mixed effects linear regression models will be used to assess 
the direction and time averaged magnitude of change in potassium, with and without controlling for baseline covariates.  The proportion of serious hyperkalemia in treatment and placebo 
groups will be compared with Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test.  
The primary analysis will examine the intention to treat population.  All analyses will be repeated 
in the as-treated, all-treated and per -protocol populations ( see Section 7.3).  Secondary 
endpoint analyses will be presented using analogous techniques.  P<0.05 will be considered

7.4.2.  Secondary Analyses  
A number of secondary analyses will be conducted to evaluate the secondary efficacy 
outcomes.  Secondary efficacy parameters include cytokine concentration/markers of 
inflammation , circulating markers of fib rosis , aldosterone concentration, heart rate variability 
(sub- study), arrhythmias (sub- study), additional echocardiographic parameters  including c hange 
in resting and hyperemic myocardial blood flows between baseline and 36 weeks  and change in 
LVMI between 0 and 36 weeks , and coronary flow reserve (CFR) on myocardial PET (sub -
study) . Analysis for these secondary outcomes will be similar to that for the primary outcome. 
Distribution of the secondary parameters will be examined and appropriate transformation will 
be applied. 
7.4.3.  Interim Analysis  
No interim efficacy analysis is planned. 
 
8. Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1. Definitions  
Definitions are per the January 2007 Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Participants  or Others and Adverse Events, Office on Human 
Research Protection (O HRP ) Guidance. http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html   
8.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant’s involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant ’s participation in the res earch.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is any AE that is:  
• fatal or results in death  
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• an important medical event * 
*Important medical events  are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.

(See also Section 8. 3.4) 
An Unanticipated Problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria: 
• unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures 
that are described in the IRB- approved research protocol and informed consent 
document  and the characteristics of the participant  population being studied;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research; possibl y related means that 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459], and  
• suggests that the research places participants  or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
8.1.4.  Pre-Existing Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period. 
8.1.5.  General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At 
the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
8.2. Adverse Event Tracking  Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be tracked and reported is normally defined 
as the period from the initiation of study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up is [ADDRESS_1032835] each participant  to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the participant , or the participant ’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related 
to participation in this study.  The investigator will notify the DCC of any death or adverse event 
occurring at any time after a participant  has discontinued or terminated study participation that 
may reasonably be related to the  study.  The sponsor (NIDDK) will also be notified if the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a participant  that has participated in this study.  
8.3. Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_6635] , the investigator or site designee will seek information on 
adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate,  by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on 
adverse events will be recorded in the source document, and also on the adverse event log

• Breast tenderness  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms including: diarrhea, constipation, and nausea  
• Rash  
 
If the event meets the definition of serious as defined in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_1032836].  The clinical course of each event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.   
8.3.2.  Trial-Defined Events  
The hemodialysis population undergoes  frequent laboratory testing and has a high rate of  
peri-dialytic hypotensive events requiring change s in the dialysis prescription, adjustment of dry 
weight , or change in dialysis -related medications.  Due to the unique nature of this population, 
the following events are considered routine aspects of chronic dialysis therapy and will not be 
recorded as an adverse event  except as noted:  
• Anemia – will be reported when hemoglobin  is <8.0 mg/dL  
• Hyperkalemia – will be reported when potassium level ≥6.0 mEq/L    
• Hyperphosphatemia  – will be reported when phosphorous >9.5 mg/dL  
• Hypocalcemia – will b e reported when serum calcium < 7.0 mg/dL 
• Hypercalcemia – will be reported when serum calcium >11.0 mg/dL  
• Hyperparathyroidism  – will be reported when PTH  >1000 pg/mL  
• Hypotension – will be reported when it meets the criteria for recurrent or symptomatic 
intra- or inter -dialytic hypotension as defined in Section 3. 2.2.  
 
8.3.3.  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event  if:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test that was performed 
specifically to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity

discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
• The abnormality meets the criteria in Section 8.3.2 . 
8.3.4.  Anticipated Adverse Events  
The following adverse events are anticipated in the hemodialysis population and will not be 
considered to be Unanticipated Problems .  Note that the designation as “Anticipated” does not 
imply that the event is not an SAE but relates to the regulatory definition of Unanticipated 
Problems as provided in Section 8.1.3. 
• Death 
• Coronary Ischemia including:  
o Unstable angina 
o Acute MI  
o Coronary revascularization 
• Heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93470]

o Pneumonia 
o Vascular access infection  
o Bacteremia 
o Clostridium d ifficile infection 
 
8.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
Study sites are required to report SAEs  and Unanticipated Problems to the DCC within [ADDRESS_1032837] knowledge of the event.  To report such events, an SAE form or an Unanticipated 
Problem form will be completed by [CONTACT_754592].   The DCC will 
facilitate the timely medical review and reporting of the event to the NIDDK , the DSMB,  and the 
study sites in accordance with DSMB -approved study policies  and IRB  requirements . 
The investigator will keep a copy of the SAE form / Unanticipated Problem form on file at the 
study site.   At the time of the initial report, the following information should be provided:

 Study Center  
 Participant  number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current status   Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
 
Within the following [ADDRESS_1032838] be followed up to determine the 
final outcome.  Any SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly 
related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately . 
If a patient becomes pregnant while participating in the trial it will be reported as an adverse 
event and will trigger the collection of additional information about the pregnancy  on the 
Pregnancy Report Form .  Pregnancy outcomes will be collected, including the outcome of the 
infant and if the pregnancy was terminated.  Study Staff should complete the Pregnancy Report 
form when they learn about a pregnancy, and follow -up with the participant and update the form 
when additional information is available about the baby.  The Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the University of P ennsylvania IRB, and to the local site IRB as required . 
8.4.1.  Investigator R eporting  to the IRB  
Site investigators will report SAEs and Unan ticipated problems to their IRB in accordance with 
the reporting requirements of the local IRB  or with the Office of Human  Research Protections 
(OHRP) guidelines, whichever is sooner.  OHRP recommends that:  
1) Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events should be reported to the IRB within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the event; and   
2) Any other unanticipated problem should be reported to the IRB within 2 weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to participants  or others as noted above will be reported 
using the appropriate IRB -designated form or as a written report of the event (including a 
description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -
up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation).

• Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_754593] . 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the participant  to 
remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_754521], or affects the rights or welfare of participants . 
8.4.2.  DCC Notif ication to  Participating Investigators  
The DCC will notify all Clinical Center principal  investigators, in a written safety report, of 
any adverse event that meets the criteria for an unanticipated problem as described in 
Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_1032839] the DCC.  The circumstances of the 
event and rationale for unblinding will be described to the DCC P rincipal Investigator , or an 
appropriate designee, who may authorize unblinding if deemed necessary to preserve 
participant  safet y.  Following this, an SAE report  will be submitted  within 24 hours to the DCC 
and to the  local IRB as described in Sections 8. 4 and 8. 4.1.  The circumstances and need for 
unblinding should also be appropriately documented in the source documents.

Version 5.0, May 9 , 2016  Data management  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  9. Data management  
An internet -based registration system designed by [CONTACT_585283][INVESTIGATOR_754526]. The central registration system will include a randomization module 
for each study  that will confirm eligibility .  Central participant registration will also allow the DCC 
to generate recruitment reports across concurrent studies.  
An Oracle Clinical data management system designed by [CONTACT_754594], storage and management of data .  Site personnel will enter data directly using Oracle 
Clinical Remote Data Capture.  Electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) will incorporate range and 
logical edit checks, both within and across forms.   Data entry will be followed daily with manual 
and programmed checks and edits for errors and omissions.  
9.1. Data Quality  
The DCC will collaborate with the Clinical Center investigat ors to establish parameters for 
primary and secondary outcomes, safety, and descriptive values. The data management team 
will use a data validation plan, rule set specifications, and programming logic to implement data 
validation rules. The DCC staff will interact with Clinical Center study staff to verify queried data 
and track all queries to resolution.   
9.1.1.  Quality Control Activities  
The Quality Control Committee and the DCC will develop a quality assurance and control plan that ensures that study data are as precise  and reliable as possible.  
Manual of Procedures
 (MOP) – The MOP will describe the sequence of study conduct and 
provide detailed instruction for the performance of screening, baseline, enrollment, treatment allocation and follow -up procedures.  The MOP will provide instruction in case report form 
completion, use of the electronic data management system, and collection, documentation and 
transfer of specimens and tests to laboratories and reading centers.  
Training and certification procedures  – The DCC will conduct a training session before the study 
starts to train and certify personnel in the performance of study procedures.  
Site visits  – Site visits will be conducted as outlined in the Study Monitoring Plan.  Findings from 
site visits will b e used to resolve problems and develop corrective action plans.  
External data sources  – The DCC will monitor quality control of data received from study 
laboratories and reading centers.   
Internal quality control procedures  – A data validation plan, rule set specifications, and 
programming logic to implement data validation rules will be implemented.  
9.1.2.  Routine reports  
The DCC will develop a set of standard enrollment, tracking, quality review, and safety monitoring reports.  Adverse event reports, DSMB reports and reports for statistical analysis will 
be developed and produced on an  appropriate schedule.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  9.2. Data Security  
The data management system will be designed to prevent unauthorized access to trial data and 
to prevent data loss due to equipment failure or catastrophic events. The procedures to do so 
encompass user account management, user privilege assignment, data loss prevention 
(database backup), and DMS change management.  User access will be controlled by 
[CONTACT_93511].  
Study data collected at the Clinical Centers  will be entered into Oracle Clinical.  This data 
management system uses a secure connection between the client browser at the Clinical 
Center and the web server at the DCC.  Data transmitted over this connection is authenticated 
by [CONTACT_93512].  
Where applicable, e lectronic files containing data from hand held devices, central laborator ies, 
or central reading center s will be transferred to the DCC using secure FTP technology.  The 
DCC team will maintain a secure FTP server.  The files transmitted using this method will be 
encrypted during the exchange.  
The DCC project team will collaborate with the IDS and the biostatistics team to protect the 
blinding of treatment assignments and electronic access to information that could indirectly or directly lead to unblinding treatment assignment or codes.   Internal access to such information 
is stored in password- protected files .  Documentation is stored in the locked files of the IDS at 
the University of Pennsylvania.  Within the DCC this information is locked in files to which only 
department managers have access. 
9.2.1.  Confidentiality  
Information about study participants  will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed participant  authorization informing the participant  of the following:  
• What protected h ealth information (PHI) will be collected from participants  in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research participant  to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a participant  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant  
authorization.  For participants  that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the participant  is 
alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2.2.  Data Linkage  
Participants will be asked to consent to  provide their Social Security Number (SSN) to facilitate 
access to  long term clinical outcomes after study participation has ended, in national databases 
at the Social Security Administration, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) and 
the [LOCATION_002] Renal Data Systems (USRDS).  Providing the SSN and access to national 
databases is optional, and is not required for participation in the study .

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  9.3. Source Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data 
records include: dialysis unit records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory reports , memoranda, participant  diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_110799], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, x -rays, participant  files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3.1.  Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF will be recorded.  All missing data will be explained.  “N/D”  will be 
used to indicate on the CRF that a procedure was not done or a question was not asked rather 
than leaving a space blank.   “N/A” will be used to indicate that an item is not applicable to the 
individual case.   All entries will be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, 
to correct such an error, a single straight line will be drawn through the incorrect entry and the 
correct data will be entered above it.  All such changes will be initialed and dated.  Erasing or 
white -out will not be used for errors.   For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, the 
clarification will be printed above the item,  and the clarification will be initialed and dated. 
9.3.2.  Maintaining Anonymity of Submitted Medical Records  
Clinical site personnel will  de-identify all medical records before sending them to the DCC by 
[CONTACT_754595] (PHI).  Upon receipt, DCC personnel will review 
the records to ensure that no PHI is visible. 
If a SSN is provided by [CONTACT_754596], it will be maintained 
in a restricted-access section of  the data management system , and only DCC personnel who 
are directly involved in the collection of long term clinical outcomes data from national 
databases will be granted access .  Once the necessary outcome data  are obtained, the data will 
be linked to the participant ’s study ID number .  The SSN will be excluded from any shared data. 
9.3.3.  Data and Biosample Sharing  
Research results will be made available to the scientific community and public in a timely 
manner.  The primary method by [CONTACT_754597] -reviewed publications and presentation at scientific and professional society 
meetin gs.  In addition, data and results will be submitted to the NIH in the annual progress 
reports required under the terms and conditions of the funding award.  This study will also be 
registered with clinicaltrials.gov prior to initiation.  
Data from the study will be submitted to the NIDDK Data Repository in accordance with the 
NIDDK Data Sharing policy.  The policy requires that data sets be transferred no later than [ADDRESS_1032841].  Through the repository, the study data will be made available to external investigators.

9.3.4.  Reco rds Retention  
The site investigators will retain study documents , including participant  files and Regulatory  
Binders , for at least 5 years after the close of the study , or longer  depending on site institutional 
requirements.  
 
10. Study Compliance  
10.1.  Protocol  Deviations  and Exceptions  
A protocol deviation  is any change or alteration to the IRB -approved protocol without 
prospective IRB approval.    A protocol exception  is a one time, intentional change or alteration 
to the IRB -approved protocol that is approved by [CONTACT_14226].   
Major Deviation :   Any change/alteration that has or has the potential to: 1) adversely affect the 
rights, welfare or safety of the subjects, 2) adversely affect the integrity of the research data, or 3) affect the subject ’s willingness to participate.  
Examples of Major Deviations  
• Failure to obtain informed consent ( i.e., no documentation of informed consent or informed consent was obtained after initiation of study procedures)  
• Informed consent obtained by [CONTACT_87152]  
• Use of invalid consent form (i.e., consent form without IRB approval stamp, or 
outdated/expi[INVESTIGATOR_87046])  
• Enrollment of a participant who is ineligible for the study  
• Performing a research procedure not in the approved protocol  
• Failure to report serious adverse event to sponsor/DCC

[ADDRESS_1032867] (DSMB) Charter  
HD Novel Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93480] (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the National 
Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to monitor patient safety and 
evaluate the efficacy of the interventions.  The HD Novel Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93463] – Spin-D 
Protocol/Trial is funded by [CONTACT_49010].  
 
DSMB RESPONSIBILITIES 
 The initial responsibility of the DSMB will be to review the study protocols, consent documents and plans for data safety monitoring, and approve the initiation of these clinical trials. After this 
approval, and at periodic intervals during the course of the trials, the DSMB responsibilities are 
to:  
• review and approve major changes in the research protocol, informed consent documents 
and plans for data safety and monitoring, including all proposed revisions;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 
performance of the trial sites, and other factors that may affect study outcome;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such 
as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• protect the safety of the study participants;  
• report on the safety and progress of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the NIDDK, the Steering Committee and, if required, to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institution Review Boards (IRBs) concerning 
continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed 
beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
• if appropriate, conduct interim analysis of efficacy in accordance with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585260];  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring;  
• assist the NIDDK by [CONTACT_93521], enrollment, sample size, and/or data collection.  
 MEMBERSHIP  
 The DSMB will consist of at least eight members. Five participating members will constitute a quorum. The members have been appointed by [CONTACT_49010]. Members of the DSMB shall have 
no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the studies. Collaborators or associates of 
the investigators in this trial are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written documentation 
attesting to absence of conflict of interest is required.  
  
[CONTACT_93536] of University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_754555]. He is responsible for 
overseeing  the meetings and developi[INVESTIGATOR_754556], [CONTACT_93537] and [CONTACT_754610].  [CONTACT_585297] will serve as the DSMB Executive Secretary.  The Chairperson is the contact [CONTACT_100092].  Other NIDDK official  (s) or

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  NIDDK appointee (s) may serve as an ex -officio member (s) of the DSMB.  The DCC, University 
of Pennsylvania, shall provide the logistical management for the DSMB, in coordination with 
NIDDK ([CONTACT_93540], as point of contact). Whenever possible, [CONTACT_585298], Director of the 
Division of Kidney, Urology and Hematology of NIDDK will also attend meetings.  
 
BOARD PROCESS  
 
The DSMB will meet a minimum of once a year at the call of the Chair, with advance approval of 
the NIDDK Program Director.  An  NIDDK representative will be present at every meeting.  
 Meetings shall be closed to the public because discussions may address confidential patient data. Meetings are attended, when appropriate, by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_754557]/her  staff.   Meetings may be convened as conference calls/webinars as well as in person. An 
emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_585292]. The DSMB Chairperson should 
contact [CONTACT_93525].  
 MEETING FORMAT  
 
An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of open, closed and executive sessions. This 
format may be modified as needed. A brief closed and/or an executive session will usually be 
held before the open session.  
 
Open Session:  
 
The members of the DSMB, the NIDDK staff, the steering committee, including the study 
biostatistician will attend the open session.  Issues discussed will include the conduct and 
progress of  the study, including patient recruitment, data quality, general adherence and toxicity 
issues, compliance with protocol, and any other logistical matters that may affect either the 
conduct or outcome of the study.  Protocol amendments may also be presented in this session.  
 
Closed Session:  
 
The closed session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], representatives from the NIDDK, or its appointees, and the study biostatistician. The discussion at the closed session is 
completely confidential.  
 Analyses of blinded
 outcome data are reviewed by [CONTACT_93527], including 
baseline characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes, adverse events, adherence and 
dropouts, and examination of any relevant subgroups. However, the DSMB may request 
unmasking of the data for either safety or efficacy concerns.   
 
Executive Session:  
 The executive session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], and the NIDDK Staff, or its appointees.  
 The DSMB will discuss information presented to it during the closed and open sessions and 
decide whether to recommend continuation or termination, protocol modification or other 
changes to the conduct of the study in the Executive Session.  The DSMB can become unblinded if trends develop either for benefit or harm to the participants.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].   
Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, a full vote of the DSMB will be 
required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote will rule and a minority report should be 
appended.  Reasons for early termination may inc lude:  
• Serious adverse effects in the entire intervention group or in a dominating subgroup;  
• Greater than expected beneficial effects;  
• A statistically significant difference by [CONTACT_93528];  
• Logistical or data quality problems so severe that correction is not feasible.  
 
Final Open Session (optional):  
 
The final session may be attended by [CONTACT_93526], steering committee members, the study biostatistician or other study members, and the NIDDK staff.  
 
The Chairperson of the DSMB or  the NIDDK Staff shall report on the recommendations of the 
DSMB regarding study continuation and concerns regarding the conduct of the study.  Requests regarding data presentation for subsequent meetings will be made.  Scheduling of the next 
DSMB meeting may be discussed.  
 
REPORTS  
 Interim Reports: Interim reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_36909], located at 
the University of Pennsylvania.  The reports will be distributed to the DSMB and the NIDDK 
Program Director at least [ADDRESS_1032868] of two parts:  
 Part 1 ( Open Session Report ) provides information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status.  This report is generally shared with all investigators involved with the clinical trial.  The reports contained in this section may 
include:  
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_43380] 
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_93529] 
o Overall Subject Status by [CONTACT_93529], including: Subjects Screened, Enrolled, Active, 
Completed and Terminated 
o Demographic and Key Baseline Characteristics by [CONTACT_26374]  
o Treatment Duration for Subjects who Discontinue Therapy  
o A dverse Events/Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_754607] 2 ( Closed Session Report ) may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, 
including serious adverse events or termination.  Data will be presented by [CONTACT_754608]; however, the DSMB may request that the treatment groups be unblinded to ensure that 
there are no untoward treatment effects. This report should not be viewed by [CONTACT_93532].  
 Reports from the D SMB:  A formal report containing the recommendations for continuation or 
modifications of the study, prepared by [CONTACT_93533], 
will be sent to the Chair of the Steering Committee and the DCC PI. This report will also contain 
any recommendations of the NIDDK in reference to the DSMB recommendations.  It is the

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  responsibility of the DCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_754558].  
 Each report should conclude with a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This 
recommendation should be made by [CONTACT_7558]. A termination recommendation may 
be made by [CONTACT_93534]. The NIDDK is responsible for notifying the Chair of the Steering Committee of a decision to terminate the study. In the event of a split vote 
in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. 
The report should not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data, or any other 
confidential data.  
 
Mailings to the DSMB:  On a scheduled basis, (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety 
data should be communicated to all DSMB members and the NIDDK Program Director. Any 
concerns noted by [CONTACT_585296].  
 
Access to Interim Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as small 
a group as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the 
investigator of the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to randomize patients and helps protect the study from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 CONFIDENTIALITY  
 All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality .

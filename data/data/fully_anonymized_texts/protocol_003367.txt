Version 0 6/28/[ADDRESS_14720] become of incre ased importance.  
 The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is a neuromodulatory system that has recently emerged as a promising new therapeutic target with many potential applications. The ECS is comprised of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, endogenous cannabinoid ligands known as Endocannabinoids, and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of cannabinoids. The ECS is involved in regulating the inflammatory response to injury, as well as modulating pain and thus is a pharmacological target  in pain management.  
 Cannabidiol (CBD) has become a subject of growing interest since Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized Industrial Hemp (Cannabis Sativa plants containing <0.3% THC content) and its derivative cannabinoids, including CBD.  CBD is a non- psychotropic cannabinoid that has 
been reported to exhibit a range of therapeutic properties . It is well tolerated in humans with a low 
risk of side effects, and has not been shown to interact with, nor potentiate the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. This makes it an attractive target for managing post -operative pain.  
 However, CBD suffers from poor oral bioavailability (6- 1
 1%) due to extensive first pass 
metabolism via CYP3A4. To mitigate this issue, CBD will be administered in a proprietary Orally 
Disintegrating Tablet (ODT) provided by [CONTACT_15362]®. This formulation allows for 
transmucosal absorption of CBD via the buccal mucosa in the oral cavity. This delivery method reduces the effective dose of CBD needed to achieve relevant  plasma concentrations.  
 Given the potential risks treating  postoperative pain with prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], we are proposing 
a study to evaluate the effects  of CBD  as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. The refore, the purpose 
of the proposed study is to evaluate the analgesic effects of CBD  administered via this ODT  to 
patients that have undergone shoulder arthroscopy, with the goals of reducing  post-operative pain 
and lessening the need for prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]. Our hypoth esis is that CBD will reduce 
postoperative pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_15342].  
Study Design  
This will be a multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled study. The study is comparing 
postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_15343]: patients undergoing 
The use of cannabidiol (CBD) in pain reduction and opi[INVESTIGATOR_15338]. A Double -
Blind, Randomized Control Study  
   
Version 0 6/28/[ADDRESS_14721]- trial period to fill out a questionnaire pertaining to 1-
year outcomes. The questionnaire will be in the form of a single online survey including ASES score, VAS score, KJOC Shoulder score, and SANE score.  
Rationale for multi- center study:  
The second site is essential for this project, for both recruitment and logistical purposes. While  
NYULOH does have high-volume, a large proportion of these patients will be ineligible due to 
the exclusion criteria and will not want to participate given that this is a randomized, controlled, double blinded study. Additionally, the second site PI [INVESTIGATOR_15344], as well as securing the necessary funding for it happen. This study would not be feasible without their collaboration. Additionally, the second site PI [INVESTIGATOR_15345], and is instrumental in the education 
of the trainees here at our institution  
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to determine if there are any differences in post- operative 
pain between patients receiving CBD after shoulder arthroscopy compared to patients who do 
not receive it.  
 
Secondary Objective  
Secondary objective of the study is to determine if there are any  difference s in patient 
satisfaction , the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_15346], and the numbers of op ioids and 
CBD/placebo ODTs  consumed by [CONTACT_15363].

III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
Methods and Procedures   
Patients indicated and scheduled for a shoulder arthroscopy will be identified from faculty surgeon case logs at the NYU Langone Health, Langone Orthopedic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15348].   After informed consent is obtained, a chart review of patients’ medications and past medical histories will be performed based on their el ectronic medical records to identify any current pain 
medications or exclusion criteria. In order to maintain the blind, another surgeon not involved in 
the procedure will randomize the patient to one of two cohorts using REDCap. Both surgeons are 
members of the study team . The randomization will be block randomization, via a computer 
generator on RedCap.  
- Cohort 1: CBD ODTs to be administered with routine post -operative pain management 
regimen  
- Cohort 2: Will not receive CBD; but a visually indistinguishable placebo ODT instead.   
The resident physician, physician assistant , anesthesiologist, surgeon and study team members 
will remain blinded. Additionally, all patients will receive a traditional upper extremity interscalene block as per routine.   
 Immediate post -operative management will not be affected by [CONTACT_15365]. All patients will 
receive a standardized regimen of Percocet for pain management, which is standard of care post -
operative treatment. Patients will receive a standard dose of 5/325mg and be discharged with [ADDRESS_14725] cohort will receive a 25mg CBD ODT, every 4 -6 hours as needed, with instructions to take two CBD ODTs if they 
weigh more than 80 kg (total maximum of 50mg per dose every 4-6 hours as needed). Cohort 2 will receive the same instructions, but with the placebo ODT instead.  The dose of 25mg for 
subjects weighing >/= 80kg and 50mg for subjects weighing more than 80kg was selected based 
on recommendations from the FDA.

 All subjects will be required to refrain from use of THC, or other cannabis-related products for 
the duration of the study. 
 
Information to be recorded pre-operatively includes age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification. As well as baseline levels of complete blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, liver enzymes, gamma glutamate tran sferase (GGT), 
electrocardiogram, urine analysis, [ADDRESS_14726] will be assessed by [CONTACT_2363] a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) at 6, 24, and [ADDRESS_14727] their satisfaction with their management, on a 0- 10 scale, 24 hours, 2 days 
and 7 days, and 14 days after surgery.  Additionally, any nausea experienced by [CONTACT_15366] a VAS (0 = no nausea, 10 = worst nausea imaginable) at [ADDRESS_14728]- anesthesia

Data Analysis and Statistical Plan 
Our power analysis was based on the literature of post-operative pain control following shoulder 
arthroscopy. Under the assumption of a VAS of 3 and 1.8 for the control and CBD respectively, with a SD of 2: Group sample sizes of 45 in each group would achi eve 80% power to reject the 
null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference between Control and CBD is μ1 - μ2 = 3.0 - 1.8 = 1.[ADDRESS_14732] deviation for both groups of 2.0 at a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_14733]. Thus, to allow for a 5% drop-
out at 14-day follow-up, [ADDRESS_14734] will be performed, with a p -value of 0.05 set to determine 
statistical significance. Testing will be performed to determine whether sample distribution is normal; if not, non- parametric testing will be performed.  
 
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
To compare primary outcomes (VAS score), a T- Test test will be performed, with a p -value of 
0.05 set to determine statistical significance. Testing will be performed to determine whether sample distribution is normal; if not, non-parametric testing will be performed. Patients who do not complete at least 80% of follow -up visits will be considered lost to follow-up and will not be 
included in the analysis. 
 
Analysis of the  Secondary Endpoint(s) 
To compare secondary outcomes (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], satisfaction), complication rates), a T -Test will be 
performed, with a p- value of 0.05 set to determine statistical significance. For categorical 
variables, a Fisher’s exact test will be per formed. Testing will be performed to determine 
whether sample distribution is normal; if not, non- parametric testing will be performed. Patients 
who do not complete at least 80% of follow-up visits will be considered lost to follow-up and 
will not be inclu ded in the analysis.

deviations, study compliance and data accuracy  quarterly.   
 He will monitor whether or not: 
1. Collection and storage of patient data was performed in a sensitive and secure manner , 
as defined in the informed consent form and protocol, ensuring information is stored on REDCap. 
2. All study activities were conducted with primary emphasis on patient care and wellbeing, ensuring the patients are not in discomfort and have an abnormally hi gh 
VAS following the surgery. 
3. If there were any adverse events, and if so were addressed appropriately and per protocol  
4. The risk/benefit to patients has remained the same throughout the course of the study. 
 The study will be stopped if there are unexpect ed severe adverse events  in more than one patient. 
Adverse E vents (AEs) will be defined as negative reactions to the CBD treatment. We will 
submit summaries of data and safety monitoring to the IRB annually.  De -identified primary and 
secondary outcome dat a will be shared by [CONTACT_15367] [INVESTIGATOR_15350], and they will notify 
the host site PI (MJA) upon each enrolled patient.   The participating site PI [INVESTIGATOR_15351], and notifying the host site PI (MJA) of any protocol deviations. The plan for data safety monitoring in the second site will be for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15352] a similar quarterly review of safety (including any adverse response to CBD, LFTs, and C-SSRS), and provide both the raw cumulative data and a summary of the adverse events and outcomes of the safety  
monitoring to [CONTACT_15377]. Additionally, there will be a quarterly teleconference between the site PIs to discuss and the affiliate site will be monitored by [CONTACT_15368][INVESTIGATOR_15353], with NYU being the lead institution.  
 Data Storage and Confidentiality 
Data recorded from this study will be organized in REDCap. Participant medical information will only be available to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15354]. All patient health information will be de -identified and assigned a code. Information linking 
participants’ names, social security numbers and medical record numbers will be stored in a secure location separate from the medical information. No data will be shared to anyone outside of the study team.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:

 • results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that 
is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria fo r serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
  For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life- threatening or incapacitating.  
Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study- related 
documents such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
• Related or possi bly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])

 • Suggests that the research places subjects  or others at greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 
The
 clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part 
of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study agent and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
 For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug 
(dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists 
that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, defi nitive etiology 
documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a

 study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs 
will be captured on the appropriate RF. Information to be collected includes event description, 
time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by 
[CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolu tion. 
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded  as an AE. UPs will be recorded in 
the data collection system throughout the study.  Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as int ermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_15356] 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day o f study 
participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   
 All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the s ubject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_15357] a subject has discontinued or terminated stud y participation that may 
reasonably be related to this study.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_15358] a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.   Information about any breach of confidentiality will be documented in the electronic data collection system and/or on the paper CRFs, as appropriate. It will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15359] (SAE) that occurs during the course of the prospective data collection to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_15371].  
 Notifying the FDA  
The PI ( sponsor-investigator) is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to 
the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports.

IV. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
Risk  
This study involves risk of medication side effec ts as well as a breach of confidentiality. Oral 
CBD can cause the following side effects:  
• Fatigue  
• Diarrhea  
• Changes in appetite/weight 
 Rare side effects include:  
• Unusual tiredness or weakness 
• Hepatic toxicity  
• Testicular toxicity was observed in a preclinical study where mice were given CBD, although 
this has not been observed in clinical studies. 
 
Protection against Risks  
  
Patients will be screened for any contraindication to CBD or  Percocet use , including Cannabis 
dependence. Patients will receive baseline assessments for history and physical, including 
psychiatric exam, complete blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, liver enzymes, gamma glutamate transferase (GGT), electrocardiogram, urine anal ysis, 12- panel urine drug test, and urine 
pregnancy test.   Planned safety monitoring during the duration of the study will include monitoring for liver function, laboratory abnormalities and suicidality assessments throughout the study and for follow -
up visits. Liver function tests , including serum transaminase and bilirubin, will be obtained on Day 
2, Day 7, and Day 14. Elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels will be grounds for immediate removal from the study.  C -SSRS will be assessed at baseli ne, Day 7, and Day [ADDRESS_14736] will be less than 2mg/kg/day, well below levels associated with any  hepatic risk (Iffland & Grotenherman, 2017).

 CBD was not deemed to increase the severity of Percocet's opi[INVESTIGATOR_15361], as they act on different 
pathways. There is a potential for CBD to work in the same C450 cytochrome pathway as the 
acetaminophen, and thus no additional acetaminophen is to be prescribed outside of this, which is 
well below the maximum prescribing threshold of 4g per day.  The patients will stay in the rec overy unit until cleared for discharge by [CONTACT_15374]. They 
will be pro hibited from driving or operating a motor vehicle for [ADDRESS_14737] at all times and ensure it is not accessible to anyone other than themselves.   Additionally, all patients will be de -identified and given a code. Information linking the patient 
codes to the participants’ names and medical record numbers will be stored in a secure location separate from the medical information.  Access to the information linking the linkage codes with participant identifiers shall be restricted.   
 Potential Benefits to the Subject s
   
Patients may experience less pain post -operatively, and may require less narcotics use, which has 
a steeper side-effect profile. However, these benefits cannot be guaranteed.  Additionally, it is the hope of the research team that results of this study will benefit future patients and their physicians by [CONTACT_15375].  This will allow for a more open and informed dialogue, and possibly a change standard of care treatment.   Drug Shipment, Storage, Dispensing, Accountability, and Destruction:  The CBD and 
matching placebo ODTs will be shipped to the NYU Langone H ealth Research Pharmacy in 
bottles labeled CBD or Placebo 25mg ODT with the subject #, date of dispensing and # of ODTs. Subjects will be dispensed enough 25mg ODTs for a maximum dose of every 4-6 hours for 14 days (subjects weighing over 80kg will be dispensed twice the amount of ODTs to account for 2 ODTs per dose (a total of 50mg CBD or placebo per dose). Subjects will be reminded that they should take the CBD or placebo ODT orally, every 4-[ADDRESS_14738]’s diary.  
Subjects will need to bring the drug with them (including empty and unused bottles) to the site for their Day 7 and Day 14 visits for accountability. Any remaining drug will be collected at Day 14 and destroy ed per NYULH Research Pharmacy SOP.

Version 0 6/28/[ADDRESS_14739] IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT/ASSENT  
Meth od of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Appropriate patients, who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, who require a shoulder arthroscopy, will be identified from the clinical offices of the investigator surgeons. 
 
 Process of Consent  
Written consent will be obtained from subjects who are eligible candidates for shoulder arthroscopy based upon their medical condition (as determined by [CONTACT_9682]). The consent 
process will take place during the office visit when it is determined necessary to perform the procedure—at which time the investigator has determined subject’s voluntary participation has been upheld. Subjects will be informed about the study and the intended purpose. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions and receive thorough explanations. They will be made aware of the possible risks and anticipated benefits. They will also be informed of alternative procedures. Subjects will then be given another opportunity to ask questions and agree or disagree to consent.  
 Subject Capacity  
All subjects enrolled in this study will have capacity to provide informed consent.  
Consent Forms  
Written consent will be obtained from the patient.  
 
Documentation of Consent  
Signed consent forms will be kept in a binder and stored in a locked file cabinet.    
Costs to the Subject  
Subjects will not incur any additional financial costs as a participant in this study.  
 
Payment for Participation   
Subjects will be paid $100 for participating in this study .

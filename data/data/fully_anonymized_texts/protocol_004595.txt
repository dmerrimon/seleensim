Title  A Double-Blind Placebo- Controlled Phase 2 Study of VE303 for 
Prevention of Recurrent Clostr idium (Clostridioides) Difficile  Infection  
Protocol 
Number  VE303 -002 
Phase  2 
Study  Sites  Up to 80 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada 
Objectives and 
Endpoints  Objectives  
The primary objective is to determine the recommended VE303 Phase 3 
dose regimen(s) based on safety and efficacy, as indicated by [CONTACT_128460]  (C. difficile ) infection (CDI) recurrence rate . 
Secondary objectives are to characterize VE303 colonization and changes in the fecal microbiome.  
Endpoints  
Safety endpoints include the overall safety profile and treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
Efficacy endpoints include:  
• Proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence before or at Week  8 
(i.e., [ADDRESS_144832] dose of study drug). 
• Proportion of subjects without CDI recurrence before or at 
Week  4 (i.e., [ADDRESS_144833] dose of study drug), Week 12 
(i.e., [ADDRESS_144834] dose of study drug), and Week 24 
(i.e., [ADDRESS_144835] dose o f study drug). 
Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic endpoints include:  
• Fecal VE303 component bacteria colonization abundance and duration. 
• Changes in fecal microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition.  
• Changes in the fecal metabolomic profile, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids.  
Study Design  This Phase 2, randomized, parallel -arm, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose-selection study will evaluate the safety, microbiota changes, and efficacy of VE303 in the prevention of subseque nt CDI -associated 
diarrhea compared with placebo following completion of at least [ADDRESS_144836] -of-care (SOC) antibiotics for subjects with

 primary C. difficile  infection (pCDI) at high risk for recurrence or 
subjects with recurrent C. di fficile  infection (rCDI).  
Eligible subjects  will be randomized into 4 treatment arms in a 2:1:2:1 
ratio to receive VE303 high dose (10 capsules) :placebo high dose (10 
capsules) :VE303 low dose (2 capsules) :placebo low dose  (2 capsules), 
respectively. Approximately 60 to 80 subjects  are anticipated for 
enrollment.  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which will include independent 
clinicians with knowledge of the target population, a biostatistician, and Sponsor representatives, will be established to oversee subject  safety.  
Investigators and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study period. 
Randomization will be stratified by 1) number of previous CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_128420] (0 vs ≥ 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], excluding the qualifying epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]; i.e. 
Inclusion criterion 2a vs 2b/2c subjects), 2) SOC antibiotic treatment 
(non- vancomycin [fidaxomicin or metronidazole] or an alternative oral 
vancomycin dosing regimen vs vancomycin QID [four times a day; this category will include subjects who receive vancomycin QID on at least the last day of treatment ]), and 3) results of CDI laboratory diagnostic 
method (free toxin [enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Toxin A/B or Cell Cytotoxicity Neutralization Assay  (CCNA)] vs other [polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)/cytotoxic culture if EIA for Toxin A/B and/or CCNA results are negative or not available]) . 
On the last planned day of SOC antibiotic administration for a qualifying CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or no later than 1 day after completion of antibiotic dosing, subjects will be randomized and begin daily  oral administration of 
placebo or VE303 (both at low and high doses) for [ADDRESS_144837] dose of study drug. 
Study -specific Definitions 
An epi[INVESTIGATOR_128421] C. difficile  is 
characterized by ≥  3 loose/unformed bowel movements (Bristol Score 
5-7, see Appendix 1) within [ADDRESS_144838] 2 consecutive days or 
> 8 loose/unformed bowel movements within [ADDRESS_144839] another etiology. 
The following are specific protocol definitions : 
A prior occurrence of CDI is based on a subject’s medical history and 
defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_128422] 
C. difficile , with a stool sample that is positive for C. difficile  (e.g., PCR, 
or EIA for Toxin  A/B, and GDH antigen, or CCNA) . The CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_128423]303    Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144840] for free toxin or toxigenic C.  difficile . 
• Diagnostic tests for enrollment may be performed at the local  
laboratory  or at the central laboratory. Subjects with a positive 
test (either EIA for Toxin A/B or PCR or CCNA or toxigenic 
culture assay, performed at the local  laboratory or at the 
central laboratory ) may be enro lled in the study. Confirmation 
of a positive local test by [CONTACT_128461], provided documentation of a local positive test is available.  
• Subjects’ allocation to a proper stratum is dependent on timely 
repor ts of lab oratory  results from both local and central 
laboratories. To ensure subjects are allocated to a proper stratum, an effort should be made to obtain and send a stool 
sample to the central lab oratory  for confirmation of free toxin 
or toxigenic C. difficile  prior to randomization . Additional 
requirements are provided in Inclusion Criteria #3 and #4. 
A successful clinical response to antibiotic therapy by [CONTACT_128462] a subject to be eligible . A successful clinical response is defined as the symptomatic 
control of the qualifying/current CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , i.e., < 3 loose/unformed 
bowel movements within [ADDRESS_144841] 2 consecutive days.  
An on- study CDI recurrence is defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_128424] C. difficile  infection , which includes a 
stool samp le positive for free toxin (EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) per 
test performed at the  local laboratory or at the central laboratory . An 
on-study CDI rec urrence may occur at any time after administration of 
the first dose of study drug.  
• If recurrent CDI is suspected, a stool sample must  be collected for 
laboratory  confirmation. Regardless of the test(s) performed at the 
local laboratory, samples must  be c ollected from all subjects 
during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_128425] a central laboratory.  
• After an initial sample collected for suspected recurrence , it is 
required to collect and submit samples on subsequent day(s) if the laboratory  test results are not available or negative for free toxin 
(EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) before initiating antibiotic therapy.

VE303    Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144848]’s study participation, including assessment of adverse events (AEs)  reported by a 
subject or observed by [CONTACT_128465] 6- month  follow-up period, evaluation of 
gastrointestinal symptoms, electrocardiograms, physical examination, assessment of vital signs, and clinical laboratory measurements. Adverse 
events will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities at the time of study initiation, and the severity of AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. 
Stool samples must be collected at the time points specified in Table 7-1 
for C. difficile testing (e.g., EIA for T oxin A/B, PCR,  CCNA, toxigenic 
culture assay ) and for the exploratory analyses (microbiota composition, 
VE303 component bacteria detection, antibiotic concentrations, metabolomics, culture, detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria  (ARB) 
other than C. difficile  (e.g., carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
[CRE], extended spectrum β -lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae 
[ESBL], or vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus [VRE]), and calprotectin).  
Subjects will be continuously monitored for clinical events of diarrhea that may be indicative of a CDI recurrence.  
Guidance on 
Study Drug 
Discontinuation for Suspected on-Study CDI 
Recurrence  As per the Primary Efficacy Analysis, t he discontinuation of study 
treatment for subjects with suspected on -study CDI recurrence is based 
on the results of free toxin test (EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) performed 
at the local or the central laboratory regardless of the results of toxin 
PCR. If initial results of free toxin test are negative or not available and 
the symptoms persist, repeated samples should be collected and tested on subsequent day(s). The subjects will be continuously monitored (more 
than once/day by [CONTACT_756]) to determine if the suspected rCDI persists 
and the study drug needs to be discontinued.  
• If a subject has a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_128426] C. difficile  (Section  4.2) after starting the study drug but the 
free toxin test (EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) is negative or 
unavailable at the time and the SOC antibiotic is not administered 
for this epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the stud y treatment should be continued. This 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_128427] a CDI recurrence if free toxin test 
(EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) is negative or not available.  
• If a subject has a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_128421] C. difficile  after starting the study drug but the free toxin 
test ( EIA for Toxin A/B or CCNA) is negative or unavailable at 
the time and the SOC antibiotic is administered for this epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
VE303    Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144849] is negative or not 
available.  The discontinuation of study drug due to SOC antibiotic 
treatment in such a case will be considered a protocol deviation 
and should be reported as such in the eCRF. 
• If the subject has a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_128428] C. difficile  after starting the study drug and the 
free toxin test (EIA for Toxin A/B  or CCNA) is positive , the study 
treatment should be discontinued. This epi[INVESTIGATOR_128429] 
a CDI recurrence. Su ch an event should be reported as confirmed 
recurrence in the eCRF.  
Statistical 
Considerations  Final Analysis  
 Safety and efficacy endpoints will be based on approximately 60 to 80 subjects completing the intended duration of the study (through Week 24/Day 168) with descriptive statistics.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background of C. D ifficile  Infection  
Clostridium  difficile  (or more recently Clostridio ides di fficile  according to the US National 
Center for Biotechnology Information; C. difficile ) infection  (CDI)  is the most common 
health  care-associated infection, with an estimated incidence  of 453,000 cases and approximately 
29,000 deaths in the US in 2011 [ 1]. The health care costs related to CDI are estimated to be as 
high as US $4.8 billion for acute care facilities, which does not account for the increasing reports 
of CDI treatment occurring outside of acute care facilities, including community settings in 
which CDI may be diagnosed and treated without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [ 1]. 
C. difficile  is a gram -positive, spore forming anaerobic bacillus. The spores are resistant to heat, 
acid, and antibiotics; C. difficile  is transmitted among humans via the fecal -oral route. Follow ing 
oral ingestion, the spores resist the acidity of the stomach and germinate into the vegetative form 
in the small intestin e [2]. C arriage of C. difficile  occurs in 5% to 15% of healthy adults but may 
be as high as 84.4% in newborns and healthy infants and up to 57% in residents of long- term 
care facilitie s [3]. Th e two  biggest risk factors to infection are exposure to antibiotics and 
exposure to the organis m [4]. Thus, disruption of the commensal flora of the colon, typi[INVESTIGATOR_128432], allows C. difficile  to flourish and produce toxins that lead to 
colitis. The majority of infe ctions occur following iatrogenic nosocomial exposure, although 
spores are present in low levels in the environment and food supply, allowing for community -acquired infections [ 5]. M ore than [ADDRESS_144858] been identified, but 
only strains producing the exotoxins, Toxin A and Toxin B, are virulent. The toxins are endocytosed by [CONTACT_128469][INVESTIGATOR_1663], resulting in damage to the actin cytoskeleton, causing cell death, loss of intestinal barrier function, and neutrophilic colitis [ 5, 6].  
The clinical manifestations of infection with toxin -producing strains of C. difficile  range from 
asymptomatic carriage to mild or moderate diarrhea or fulminant colitis. Infection -related 
mortality has been reported in 5% of patients, with all- cause mortal ity up to 15% to 20% [ 5]. 
Symptoms of CDI usually begin soon after colonization, with a median time to onset of [ADDRESS_144859] common sym ptoms of  diarrhea, fever, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], abdominal discomfort, and 
peripheral leukocytosis  [7]. P atients with severe disease may develop colon ic ileus or toxic 
dilation and present with abdominal pain and distension but minimal or no diarrhea. Complications of severe C. difficile colitis include dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, 
hypoalbuminemia, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, hypotension, renal failure, systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and death. 
A prerequisite for developi[INVESTIGATOR_128433]. 
Factors associated with CDI vary across infected persons and include host susceptib ility, the 
virulence of the infecting C. difficile  strain, and the nature and extent of prior antimicrobial 
exposure. The BI/NAP1/027 strain is associated with severe C. difficile  disease and is 
characterized by a mortality rate 3 times as high as that associated with less virulent strains [5]. 
Advanced age, antineoplastic chemotherapy, and severe underlying diseases, particularly those that lead to altered immune  responses, also contribute to susceptibility [ 5]. The risk of CDI and 
its severity increases as age increases, even in healthy individuals.  
VE303    Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144860] been published by [CONTACT_128470][INVESTIGATOR_128434] [4, 7]. Cessation of the inciting antibiotic agent, if medically 
appropriate, is often sufficient for complete recovery of mild dise ase [8]. For more severe 
disease, antimicrobial therapy directed against C. difficile  is necessary, with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_128435]. Metronidazole can be used in cases of non- severe CDI 
when access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited. The antibiotics are considered equivalent 
for the treatment of mild to moderate disease, while vancomycin is more effectiv e for severe 
disease, including patients infected with the BI/NAP1/027 strain [ 5]. In addition, a Phase  [ADDRESS_144861] 
confirmed the noninferiority of fidaxomicin 200 mg administered orally twice daily for 10  days 
compared with vancomycin 125 mg administered orally 4  times daily (QID) for [ADDRESS_144862] recurrence, with a primary outcome of clinical cure (88% vs 86% and 88% vs 87% for the 2 trials, P  = not significant). 
Fidaxomicin had a lower recurrence rate compared with vancomycin, and the sustained clinical 
response (i .e., cure without recurrence) was superior with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin at 
25 days after the end of treatment in both trials (70% vs 57%, P = 0.0011; 72% vs 57%, 
P = 0.0004) [9, 10]. T here are no data on fidaxomicin compared with metronidazole for similar 
CDI populations. 
While most patients with initial CDI respond successfully to antibiotic treatment, approximately 
20% to 25% will have at least one recurrence of C. difficile -related  diarrhea following 
discontinuation of antibiotic  treatment [ 1, 7, 11] . Recurrent disease can be attr ibuted to relapse or 
re-infection and the mechanisms are similar in clinical practice.  Diagnosis and treatment of 
relapse and re- infection are the same.  
The proportion of patients who respond to treatment decli nes with multiple recurrences. The 
ability to cure subsequent recurrences is difficult because of the persistence of spores in the 
bowel or environment , inability to revert to a more normal eubiotic gastrointestinal microbiota, 
and the inability of the patient to mount an effective immune response to C. difficile  toxins. Risk 
factors for recurrent CDI (rCDI) include administration of inciting antibiotics after initial successful treatment of CDI; defective humoral anti -toxin immune responses; underlying 
comorbidities; older age; and use of proton-pump inhibitors [ 7]. Symptoms can recur following 
re-exposure of patients to C. difficile  spores transmitted from other patients or from the 
environment. Almost one -half of recurrences have been shown to be caused by [CONTACT_128471] a 
different bacterial strain rather than by [CONTACT_128472] [ 12, 13].  
The most common therapy for rCDI  is a second course of met ronidazole or oral vancomycin ; 
however, the 2018 IDSA guidelines favor the use of vancomycin regimens or fidaxomicin over metronidazole  [7]. The estimated efficacy of antibiotic therapy for a first recurrence is 50% [ 5]. 
Second recurrences can be treated with fidaxomicin or a tapering and/or pulsed regimen of oral vancomycin. The 2018 IDSA guidelines consider the latter recommendation to be of weak strength and based on a low Quality of Evidence ( 7). In addition, for a first recurrence, 
fidaxomicin appears to  be non-inferior to vancomycin. However, use of fidaxomicin has been

efficacy in controlled studies. Additionally, patients with fulminant colitis may require 
emergency colectomy, which increases their risk for mortality by [CONTACT_8622] 80% [5].  
Given that disruption of the indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota is a major risk for  CDI, 
particularly for recurrent infection, there has been increasing interest in fecal mic robiota 
transplantation (FMT). The procedure involves the transoral or rectal transplantation of feces 
from a healthy, pretested donor, and cessation of antibiotic  use in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Clinical 
experience with FMT indicates that this procedure is effective, although the precise components 
of the gastrointestinal microbiota that provide resistance against C. difficile  remain 
undetermined. Disease resolution has been reported to be as high as 89% following a single FMT administration to patients, with demonstra ted safety of the FMT itself, even in 
immunocompromised hosts, in whom the re were no SAEs or infectious complications related to 
the FMT and in whom several procedure- related  adverse events (AEs) were reported, with one 
death due to  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128436] [ 14,15]. FMT is also 
limited by [CONTACT_128473],  and, in addition, the 
procedure lacks standardizatio n [7]. Thus, while the FMT approach has provided the clinical 
evidence that changes to the gastrointestinal microbiota can be effective, there is a strong need 
for a defined uniform product that c an be produced and administered in a standardized and safe 
manner to a broader spectrum of patients and circumvent the safety issues associated with FMT, which include potential transmission of pathogens.

2.2.2 Clinical Studies  
A Phase 1a/1b, first- in-human, open- label, single -center, dose-escalation study to evaluate the 
safety and microbiota changes induced by [CONTACT_128478]303 with or without pretreatment with 
oral vancomycin (Study VE303-01 – “A Phase 1a/1b, First- in-human, Open-label Study of 
Escalating Doses of VE303 in Healthy Adult Volunteers after Vancomycin to Evaluate Safety, 
Dosing, and Pharmacodynamics”) has been completed  and final results can be found in the 
VE303 Investigator’s Brochure. 
The primary objective is to characterize the highest safe and well tolerated dose regimen of 
VE303 by [CONTACT_19693], including gastrointestinal symptoms, physical examinations, vital signs, and changes in clinical laboratory measurements. Secondary objectives include evaluation 
of gut colonization with VE303 com ponent bacteria, changes in the intestinal microbiota because 
of VE303 dosing, and metabolomic changes in stool. As of 21 September 2018, thirty- four (34) 
healthy adult subjects were enrolled and treated with vancomycin (Vancomycin Only cohort [N = 5]) and/or VE303 at escalating single doses (Cohorts 1 [N = 4], 2 [N  = 3], and 3 [N = 3]) 
and multiple doses (Cohorts 4 [N = 6], 5 [N = 8], and 6 [N = 5]) according to pre- defined 
dose-escalation guidelines at a total daily dose ranging from 1.6 × 10
9 to 1.7 × [ADDRESS_144868] of residual vancomycin in the stool on VE303 colonization. In 
addition, 1 cohort of subjects received only oral vancomycin to serve as a control group (N = 5). 
Subjects in Cohort 6 were not pretreated with vancomycin and received VE303 at the Cohort 5 dose level for 21 consecutive days. Subjects were admitted to an inpatient unit for baseline 
assessment, vancomycin dosing and washout (if applicable), for the duration of VE303 dosing, 
and for 5 days postdose to closely monitor the safety and tolerability of VE303 administration (Cohort 6 did not undergo inpatient postdose monitoring but attended a modified postdose 
follow -up with increased outpatient monitoring visits). The total duration of inpatient monitoring 
ranged from [ADDRESS_144869] ingestion of 
study drug. For all VE303-treated subjects who agree and provide written informed consent, additional visits for stool collection are scheduled approximately 6 and 12 months after initiation 
of VE303 dosing. 
Preliminary draft results are available. Demographics for the 34 subjects showed that 20 subjects 
were male and 14 were female, with a median age of 34 (range 25 to 59) years; 22 subjects were 
Black or African American, 11 were White, and 1 was mixed/other race. One subject in Cohort [ADDRESS_144870] capsules. The remaining 32 subjects ([ADDRESS_144871] 1 dose of 
VE303) completed dosing assignments as scheduled. 
Among the [ADDRESS_144872] 
frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were largely gastrointestinal in 
nature and included soft feces (21%), abdominal distension (18%), diarrhea (14%), and abdominal pain, hard feces, headach e, and increased lipase (each 11%). Most AEs (regardless of 
causal relationship to study treatment) were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with 4 of 28 
VE303- treated  subjects (14%) experiencing Grade 3 or higher TEAEs on study (all considered 
not related to VE303), including Grade 4 increased lipase in 2 subjects (7%); Grade [ADDRESS_144873] (4%); and Grade 4 acute kidney injury and Grade 4 increased blood creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) in [ADDRESS_144874] (4%).  
Among the [ADDRESS_144875] 1 dose of VE303, TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_128479]303 for 10 subjects (36%), [ADDRESS_144876] frequently attributed to VE303 treatment 
included abdominal distension and diarrhea (each 11%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and soft feces (each 7%). All VE303 -related 
TEAEs were Grade [ADDRESS_144877] 1 dose of vancomycin, TEAE s were considered by 
[CONTACT_128480] 14 subjects (48%). The TEAEs that were most 
frequently attributed to vancomycin treatment included abdominal distension and soft feces 
(each 17%), nausea (14%), abdominal pain and diarrh ea (each 10%), and decreased appetite, 
discolored feces, dysgeusia, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased lipase (each 7%). 
Most vancomycin related  TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with Grade 3 
vancomycin- related events including increased lipase (7%) and hypotension (3%). 
No deaths were reported. One subject in Cohort 2 experienced SAEs of Grade 4 acute kidney injury and Grade 4 increased blood CPK (> 60,000 U/L) that were judged to be unrelated to 
VE303 and occurred after discharge from the 5- day inpatient follow -up. 
Preliminary draft VE303 detection and colonization data are available for Cohorts 1 to 6. In the 
cohorts that received vancomycin, all 8 of the VE303 component bacteria were detectable in the 
stool within 2 days after dosing and colonized in a dose -dependent manner. The multiple dose 
cohorts (Cohorts 4 and 5) had more subjects colonize with more strains for a longer time period; 
however, durable colonization was observed even in the single-dose cohorts (2, 5, and 10 
capsules × 1 day). In many individuals, VE303 bacteria were detectable for at least [ADDRESS_144878] dose. VE303 bacteria appeared to favorably enhance subjects’ microbiota recovery 
after vancomycin ingestion. VE303 component bacteria colonization was reduced when subjects 
were not administered vancomycin. When compared with the vancomycin-only control cohort, subjects who ingested VE303 had earlier recovery of beneficial taxa (e.g., Bacteroides and 
Firmicutes) and reduction in potentially inflammatory taxa (e.g., Pro teobacteria).  
In summary, these preliminary results demonstrate that single and multiple doses of VE303 
ranging up to 1.7 × [ADDRESS_144879] of care (SOC) to prevent r CDI. After a first recurrence, the 
incidence of subsequent CDI recurrence increases, with rates of up to 45 % to 65% reported in 
some studies [ 31]. Thus, an unmet need exists for the patient s who present with their second 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (first recurrence)  of CDI , as they are at a higher  risk of additional recurrence s. Risk 
factors for multiple  recurrent CDI include age, use of antibiotics within 90 days before CDI 
diagnosis, use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) within 90 days of CDI diagnosis, chronic kidney 
disease, and diagnosis of CDI in a nursing home, among others [ 32]. This Phase [ADDRESS_144880] treatment setting outside of a clinical trial. Furthermore, study subjects will be closely monitored for stool changes and diarrhea- like events, particularly those that may signal a 
recurrence of CDI.  
The doses of VE303 to be evaluated in  this Phase 2 trial are based on the preliminary safety and 
VE303 detection and colonization  results from the Phase 1 vancomycin-treated normal healthy 
volunteer trial . The Phase 2 doses will include  the higher safe and  well tolerated doses from 
Study VE303-01 (the Cohort 5 dose of 10 capsules per day for 14 days ; total of 1.1  × 10
11 CFU) 
and the low dose ( 2 capsules per day for 14 days 2.2 × 1010 CFU).  
Study drug administration will begin on the last planned day of SOC antibiotic  administration  for 
a qualifying CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or no later than [ADDRESS_144881] ’s intestinal tract as  soon as possi ble. After a 14-day study drug 
administration period , subjects will be followed at [ADDRESS_144882] dose of study drug to monitor safety  and C. difficile  and VE303 colonization and clearance. This follow-up period will also 
provide sufficient time  to allow for identification and characterization of any CDI recurren ces.

randomized, the reason for screen failure will be recorded.  
7.1.1 Optional Pre -Screening Informed Consent  
Once identified as potential study candidates, where applicable, subjects or their LAR will sign a Pre-screening informed consent form to enable collection of a stool sample, which may be 
collected at home by a qualified home healthcare provider, to confirm the qualifying event of 
CDI recurrence in accordance with eligibility criteria. A history of C.  difficile infection and 
medications may also be reviewed.  
7.1.2 Screening  
Once identified as potential study candidates, subjects or their LAR will sign a n informed 
consent form to enable collection of a stool sample to confirm the qualifying event of pCDI  high 
risk for recurrence or r CDI in accordance with eligibility criteria. Th e stool collected on this day  
will also be used for baseline evaluations of stool microbiota composition, VE303 component bacteria detection, antibiotic concentrations, metabolomics, culture, detection of antibiotic  
resistant bacteria other than C. difficile  (e.g., CRE, ESBL, or VRE) , and calprotectin . Physical 
examination findings, vital signs, safety laboratory measurements, m edical history , and 
medications will also be reviewed  (see Table 7-1 ). 
Results from Screening evaluations, including laboratory  results and CDI confirmation, are 
required to confirm eligibility  and must be available before  randomization and study drug 
administration.  
7.[ADDRESS_144918] m embers of the Sponsor ’s senior management team , who do not interact with 
study sites and are not involved in execution of the study, will be unblinded at the treatment 
group level according  to the approved D ata A ccess and Unblinding P lan for development and 
future planning purposes only. This unblinding will have no impact on the ongoing study. In 
addition, as spelled out in the Data Access and Unblinding Plan, relevant members of the 
Systems Biology Department will be unblinded at the subject level to enable effective analysis of 
subjec t samples. 
7.2.1 Breaking the Blind 
Unblinding of study drug assignment  may be requested (see contact [CONTACT_128488] 1 ) in an 
emergency if unblinding is considered necessary for the medical management of a subject.  The 
Investigator will discuss the circumstances for the requested unblinding with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor. Emergency unblinding without the M edical Monitor’s input should occur only 
if knowledge of study drug assignment will affect the immediate workup or treatment of an AE. 
Communications related to unblinding will be documented, including the date , time,  and reason 
for the requested unblinding. 
7.3 Safety Assessment s 
Safety will be assessed throughout the study and the safety data will include reported AEs, 
SAEs, gastrointestinal symptoms, clinical laboratory data , electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
concomitant medications , physical examinations, and vital signs.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_144919] signs 
the informed consent form will  be recorded as medical history. 
In addition to general medical history, specific information relative to the qualifying CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_128445]:  
• Date of onse t of clinical symptoms of the qualifying CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 
• Whether the subject was inpatient (e.g., in an acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or outpatient at the time of onset of clinical symptoms of the qualifying CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]

Concomitant medications may  be administere d at the Investigator’s discretion to conform to 
standard practice , including routine medications a subject will continue during study 
participation as well as newly prescribed medications, except for those excluded medications 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Overall, VE303 has a low likelihood for eliciting clinically relevant 
drug-drug interactions; however, no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been done and the 
Investigator will need to use caution when prescribing concomitant medications. The 
Invest igator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_941] M edical Monitor when unsure of a possible 
drug- drug interaction.  
Initially, if clinically appropriate, gastrointestinal symptoms or sign s should be observed to 
determine whether they resolve without therapy. For routine treatment of constipation, a glycerin 
suppository per rectum is recommended as the initial treatment (other agents may cause 
interference with the colonization and detection of VE303 component bacteria) but other agents 
may be used at the Investig ator’s discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Antacids and Acid Reducers  
Use of medications changing the gastric acidity may potentially reduce the effectiveness of 
VE303. Use of these medication s should be restricted to the following: 
• Subjects should not consume food or fast-acting antacids (e.g., calcium- , aluminum -, or 
magnesium- containing products such as TUMS® or Maalox®) for at least [ADDRESS_144922] 1 hour after study drug ingestion. 
• Subjects should not receive a histamine 2-receptor antagonist (ranitidine, famotidine, etc.) 
within the 12 hours before or 1 hour after study drug ingestion. 
• Subjects should not receive a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole, pantoprazole, etc.)

 8.0 STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
8.1 Sponsor Discontinuation Criteria  
This study may be discontinued at any time due to safety concerns, failure to meet expected 
enrollment goals, administrative reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor. Should the study be terminated prema turely, the Sponsor will provide written notification to the Investigator and 
regulatory authorities and will specify the reason(s) for early termination. The Investigator must inform the IRB /EC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the termination as well as subject 
status of all participants at their site.  
8.[ADDRESS_144934] data, including samples 
(e.g., blood, serum, stool), collected up to the date of consent withdrawal (i.e., early t ermination ) 
will be included in the a nalyses.  
Wherever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for t he End of Treatment  Visit ( same as 
Day 14 [+ 1 day] ) will  be carried out at the time of discontinuation  of study drug. Subjects who 
discontinue study drug prematurely for reasons other than withdrawal of consent, lost to 
follow -up, or AE  event with an outcome of death will continue to be followed for the intended 
duration of the study (i.e., through Week 24/ Day 168).  The Sponsor will be notified of all study 
withdrawals.  
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must discontinue study drug dosing: 
• Subject experiencing related Grade 3 or higher AE and/or any related SAE 
• Any allergic reaction during study drug administration, regardless of grade, should 
prompt study drug discontinuation unless there is a clear alternative etiology for the 
event. The study drug may be restarted  if a clear alternative etiology for the event is 
identified  
• Withdrawal of consent /early termination  
• Pregnancy 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Discretion of the Investigator (e.g., protocol violations, noncompliance, continued study 
drug administration not in the subject’s best interest)  
• Study termination by [CONTACT_128493]303   Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144935] to study drug, and medication required to manage the event. 
Adverse events will be reported in accordance with the guidelines set forth in 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations ( CFR) 312.32 and International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) E6R2. 
9.1.1 Assessment of Toxicity Grade  
The toxicity grade of an AE refers to its s everity.  The severity of A Es will be categorized using 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , version 5.0 [ 33], which is appropriate for grading and assess ing the range of potential 
AEs that may be observed in the targeted study population of subjects with r CDI-associated 
diarrhea. This is because m ost of these subjects will be elderly, have multiple co -morbidities, and 
be taking a variety of prescription medications appropriate for the management of their comorbid conditions . For any term that is not specifically listed in the CTCAE scale, severity m ust be 
assigned a grade of 1 through 5 using the following CTCAE guidelines: 
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention i ndicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self- care activities  of 
daily living  
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5: Death related to AE  
9.1.2 Assessment of Causality  
Medical judgment will be used to determine the cause of the AE, considering all relevant facts 
such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, comorbidities , concomitant 
medication (s), medical  history, pattern of the AE  (continuous, intermittent, etc .), temporal 
relationship to the study drug, and de- challenge or re- challenge.  
The I nvestigator will be responsible for selecting “Yes” or “No” as detailed below for the 
relationship of each AE to the study drug.

 Yes (i.e., possibly, probably, or definitely related): there is a reasonable possibility that there is a 
causal relationship to  the study drug and one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of administration of the 
study drug. 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors,  or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject.  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug. 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. (It  should be noted 
that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon 
discontinuation of study dosing despi[INVESTIGATOR_128450]). 
No (i.e., unlikely, probably not related, or definitely not related): there is no reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug to the time of the AE . 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, concurrent illness, environmental or toxic factors,  or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject.  
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug. 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation, and it does not reappear or worsen 
when dosing is resumed. 
9.1.3 Action Taken with Study Drug  
For each AE reported, the action taken with the study drug as a result of the AE will be recorded 
as one of the following: 
• Drug withdrawn 
• Dose interrupted  
• Dose not changed 
• Unknown 
• Not applicable (i.e., for AEs occurring prior to first or after the last study drug administration)

at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requi res inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Based on appropriate medical judgment, represents an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes described above.  
9.2.1 Clarification of Serious Adverse Event Definition  
• Adverse event seriousnes s is not necessarily dependent on event severity. A Es that are 
Grade 3 or 4 in severity do not constitute SAEs unless SAE criteria are met, and events that are Grade 1 or 2 in severity may meet SAE criteria.  
• Death is an outcome of an SAE and not an SAE in itself. When death is an outcome, the event(s) resulting in death should be reported (e.g., “pulmonary embolism” with a fatal outcome). The appropriate diagnosis or term should be recorded and assigned severity 
Grade  5. 
• In instances of death due ultimately  to an  underlying disease, the cause of death should be 
indicated as the specific event or condition resulting in death to the extent possible. If no 
appropriate term with a Grade 5 severity in the CTCAE can be identified, then a term 
should be selected fr om the CTCAE category “Death”.  
• “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity. Grade 4 events (e.g ., thrombocytopenia) are not always 
serious unless they have life-threatening consequences or result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128451]/or convenience situations 
(e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) are excluded from SAE repo rting  unless they meet another SAE 
criterion .

 • Over age in dosing of either the study drug or a concomitant medication without overdose 
signs or symptoms unless the event meets SAE criteria (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) are 
excluded from SAE reporting; however, such events should still be recorded  on the 
appropriate e CRF page.  
9.2.2 Serious, Unexpected, Suspected Adverse Reactions  
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Sponsor or designee will immediately notify regulatory authorities and the Investigators, who will in turn notify their IRB /EC as necessary, of 
any AE associated with study drug administration or study procedures that is a serious, 
unexpected, suspected adverse reaction or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that 
suggests a significant ris k for human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
or carcinogenicity. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
previously observed. 
9.[ADDRESS_144938] due to the indication under study (CDI) and 
the nature of the investigational product (live bacteria) and potential for gastrointestin al or 
extraintestinal AE s: 
• Any clinically significant (Grade 2 or higher) gastrointestinal AE considered related to 
study drug. 
• Any clinically significant (Grade 2 or higher) bacterial infection considered related  to 
study drug. 
These A Es will be tabulated and analyzed separately from other A Es. 
9.3.1 Management of Diarrhea or Loose/Watery Stools 
Any clinical event of diarrhea or loose/watery stools (including events reported as C. difficile  
infection/recurrence) will be recorded as an AE . In addition to  recording the standard AE  
information, the I nvestigator will record the following information : 
• Maximum number of unformed (loose or watery) stools within a 24 -hour period that are 
associated with the event.  
• Whether a stool sample was collected for this ev ent; if so, the date of collection, method 
of delivery/collection (produced at study site or  brought to study site), and type of 
C. difficile  test(s) performed (with results) will be recorded along with protocol -mandated 
evaluations. 
• Whether colon endoscopy or surgery was performed for the event and whether 
pseudomembranes were present.  
• Whether there was another likely cause of the diarrhea (instead of or in addition to CDI) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], including, but not limited to, food/diet, non-study medication, or other infection.  
VE303   Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144939] ≥ 3 loose/unformed bowel movements within [ADDRESS_144940] 
2 consecutive days or > 8 loose/unformed bowel movements within 24 hours (or those with any 
diarrhea of concern to the  subject or Investigator) will be instructed to  contact [CONTACT_128494] a stool  sample. 
Whenever possible, collection of the stool sample should occur at the study site. However, because it is important to collect a stool sample while a subject is symptomatic, subjects will be provided with a kit and instructions for stool sample col lection at home , if necessary . These stool 
samples may be collected within [ADDRESS_144941] be obtained before administration of any antibiotics  or no later than on the day after antibiotics were started . Stool 
samples collected in association with an AE of diarrhea or loose/watery stools will be tested for 
C. difficile  at the central  laboratory  and in accordance with the S chedule of Events ( Table 7-1) 
and Section 7.4.1. All  other aspects of management of subjects with diarrhea or loose/watery 
stools (including local laboratory testing and any treatment for diarrhea/CDI) will occur  at the 
discretion of the I nvestigator based on clinical presentation. Subjects should remain in  the study 
(at the discretion of the Investigator) and continue to be followed per protocol. Use of any 
antibacterial treatments administered for CDI will be recorded (see Section 7.3.2).  If a subject 
develops diarrhea (as defined above) during the 14-day study treatment period and recurrent CDI 
diagnosis is confirmed by a positive EIA  for Toxin A/B or CCNA test, the study treatment 
should be discont inued  (See Section 4.4). Such an event should also be reported as confirmed 
recurrence in the eCRF .

Investigators must follow subjects with SAEs for a minimum of [ADDRESS_144945]  discontinue study dosing. Site 
personnel will notify the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using a Pregnancy N otification Form. Such pregnancies will be followed to outcome, 
as possible.  
9.6 Clinical Labo ratory Abnormalities 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal laboratory values as defined by [CONTACT_128496](s). All abnormal values assessed 
to be of clinical concern  and at least possibly related to the study drug or of uncertain causality 
will be repeated.  Persistent abnormal values or changes of possible clinical concern that remain 
within the normal range will be followed up and further evaluated at the discretion of th e 
Investigator.  
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an 
AE if : 
• a repeat test is performed,  when possible, to confirm the abnormality  
• an action on study drug dosing is made as a result of the abnormalit y 
• an intervention for management of the abnormality is required  
• or the Investigator  considers the abnormality to be  AE 
Abnormal test results must not be recorded as A Es unless they fulfill the aforementioned criteria.  
All abnormal laboratory  values, even if reported as an AE, will be categorized by [CONTACT_128497] a severity grade will be 
included in the eCRF.

 9.7 Review of Safety Data 
The designated M edical Monitor will be responsible for the ongoing review and evaluation of 
safety data, including AEs, clinical laboratory data, and any other safety evaluations (see 
Section  7.3). 
VE303   Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -[ADDRESS_144946]  54 subjects reach study W eek 8 . 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence before or at Week 8 (i.e., 
[ADDRESS_144947] dose of study drug). The difference in the proportion of subjects with CDI 
recurrence before or at Week 8 between each VE303 treatment group and placebo will be 
analyzed using a stratified Cochr an-Mantel -Haenszel method. Stratification will involve the 
stratification factors as determined from the clinical database, i.e., number of previous CDI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_128452] (0 vs ≥1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], excluding qualifying epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]), SOC antibiotic treatment 
(non-vancomycin [fidaxomicin or metronidazole] or an alternative oral vancomycin dosing regimen vs vancomycin QID), and results of CDI laboratory diagnostic method ( free toxin or 
other).  
10.[ADDRESS_144948] populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation of the data: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose 
of study drug . Subjects will be classified according to the planned study drug assignment. 
The FAS  will be the  default analysis set for all efficacy analyses, unless otherwise 
specified.  
• Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) : All subject s in the  FAS  who had no major protocol 
deviations. The PPS will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint 
analyses.  
• Safety Analysis Set: All subject s who were randomized  and receive d at least [ADDRESS_144949] s will be classified according to the actual study drug assignment. The  
Safety Analysis Set  will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data.  
10.2.1 Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted on the following efficacy variables for the FAS and PPS: 
• Sensitivity Analysis I: In addition to the CDI recurrence definition for the primary efficacy endpoint, the CDI recurrence definition for Sensitivity I will also include any 
recurrence that was diagnosed with a positive PCR test (including cytotoxicity ass ay) and 
treated with an antibiotic that targets C. difficile . 
VE303   Vedanta Biosciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study VE303 -002  Protocol Version 7.0 
 
15 July 2021 60 Confidential  
 • Sensitivity Analysis II: In addition to the CDI recurrence definition for the primary and 
Sensitivity I efficacy endpoints, the Sensitivity II CDI recurrence definition will include 
any recurren ce, in the absence of laboratory confirmation, that is treated with an 
antibiotic  that targets C. difficile . 
10.3 Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
In general, missing values for the primary efficacy endpoint will not be imputed. However, as a sensitivity analysis, subjects who discontinued prior to the Week 8 time point will be imputed as having a CDI recurrence at Week 8. Details will be provided in  a separate statistical  analysis 
plan ( SAP). 
10.[ADDRESS_144950] 54 subjects complete 8 weeks of the study. 
Further details of these administrative IAs will be described in the SAP , as appropriate.  
10.5 General Methods 
Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_30157] . Categorical data will be summarized 
with frequency counts and percentages by [CONTACT_30157] . 
In addition to the frequency (%), descriptive statistics, and confidence intervals, the hypothesis test for CDI recurrence rate (no treatment effect versus at least 1  dose is effective) will be 
conducted using a stratified C ochran- Mantel -Haenszel test  (stratified for the stratification factors 
used in randomization). 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of recurrences that meet the protocol defined 
recurrence definition  (Section 4.2); however, a supplemental analysis will be conducted for the 
incidence of recurrences that are both Toxin positive and Toxin negative/unknown. The null 
hypothesis is that the proportion of VE303 subjec ts with C. difficile  recurrence is greater than or 
equal to that of placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of VE303 subjec ts with 
C. difficile  recurrence is lower than that of placebo.  
This study may be prematurely terminated with a reduced sample size if , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_128453], there is sufficiently reasonable cause. In the event of such action, written notification 
documenting the reason for study termination will be provided to each Investigator. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_144951] current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  at the time of study initiation , and the severity of AEs and 
laboratory abnormalities will be graded using the NCI CTCAE, version  5.0 [33]. A by-subject 
AE data listing, including verbatim term, preferred term, system organ class, study drug arm, severity, and relationship to study drug, will be provided. The number of participants 
experiencing TEA Es and the number of individual TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_49129], 
system organ class, and preferred term. TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_128498]. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations and other safety assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_128499]-specified collection time point. A summary of change s from Baseline will also be 
presented for each protocol -specified time  point. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_144952] listin gs and summarized by [CONTACT_128500], including absolute values and 
changes from Baseline.  
Tabular and/or graphical summaries for the microbiome and VE303 detection analyses will be produced for VE303 strain presence, community composition (relative abundance of the top 10 species and VE303 strain abundance), community diversity (Shannon Index, Simpson Index, 
and Species Richness calculations), and relative abundance of all species detected in the sample. 
In addition, an analysis will be performed to evaluate the longitudinal microbiome composition and VE303 strains within each subject and within each study arm, including changes in diversity 
over time, changes in microbiome species over time, and changes in VE303 strains over time 
(both presence/absence and relative abundance). 
The Sponsor will also collect serum and stool samples (for stool antibiotic concentrations,  
metabolomics, antibiotic resistant bacteria other than C. difficile  [e.g., CRE, ESBL, or VRE], and 
culture) from clinical study participants and may analyze them for possible exploratory purposes 
and biomarkers. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_144953]’s safety may be  compromised without taking 
immediate action. In these circumstances, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor and the full IRB/EC  within [ADDRESS_144954] receive approval from the IRB /EC prior to implementation .

 APPENDIX 2: PROMIS® SCALE QUESTIONNAIRES  
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement  Information System ( PROMIS®) questionnaires (v1.0, 
dated 01 September 2016/v1.1 dated 01 October 2018) will be administered to subjects at the 
time points specified in the protocol. 
The following best practices for administration of the PROMIS® questionnaires must be 
followed:  
• PROMIS® self-reported measures are intended to be completed by [CONTACT_128512]. 
• If respondents are unable to answer on their own, have someone else (“proxy”) report on 
their behalf. Respondents requiring a proxy may include: young children, people in the early stages of dementia who may not recognize the extent of their impairment, people 
with cognitive or communication deficits, and people with severe disease burden. 
• Keep respondents’ privacy in mind, but have staff readily available to help with any 
issues that may arise.  
• It is acceptable f or staff to define a term (e.g., “nausea”), but not to define a concept 
where the respondent’s subjective interpretation is the goal of the question (e.g., “quality of life”).  
• Utilize the same method (e.g., computer, telephone, or paper) and mode (e.g., se lf vs.  
interviewer) of administration at every time point for every subject, when possible. 
• Provide respondents with the optimal time needed to capture the most relevant 
perspective and complete data (e.g., before/after clinician visit or in between visits).

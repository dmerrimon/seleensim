1Testing Adaptive Interventions to Improve Physical Activity for Sedentary Women
Study Protocol
I. Purpose & Overview
The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective adaptive intervention combining 
four efficacious treatments (enhanced physical activity monitor, motivational text messaging, 
motivational personal calls, group meetings) to increase physical activity (step counts per day, 
minutes moderate/vigorous physical activity/week) and improve cardiovascular health (aerobic 
fitness, body composition) among sedentary women. This study with 312 women aged 18 to 70 
will also assess treatment effects on intervention targets (benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and 
social support). The four adaptive interventions compared in this study consist of an initial 
treatment component (physical activity monitor  or physical activity monitor+text messaging) 
followed by [CONTACT_572827] (personal calls or group meetings) for those 
who do not respond to the initial treatment component. For ease of management, the research 
team will limit the augmented treatments to only two of the four factorial combinations of 
personal calls and group meetings. The research team will focus on personal calls only (least 
expensive) and group meetings (current standard) and accept inherent limitations. It is well-
established that without intervention physical activity remains unchanged. 
The combination of the two initial treatment components and the two augmented treatment 
components delivered to non-responders yields four adaptive interventions that will be evaluated 
in this study:
1. Start with enhanced physical activity monitor, augment with motivational personal calls 
for non-responders, and continue enhanced physical activity monitor for responders;
2. Start with enhanced physical activity monitor, augment with motivational group meetings 
for non-responders, and continue enhanced physical activity monitor for responders;
3. Start with enhanced physical activity monitor+text messaging, augment with 
motivational personal calls for non-responders and continue enhanced physical activity 
monitor+text messaging for responders; and 
4. Start with enhanced physical activity monitor+text messaging augment with motivational 
group meetings for non-responders and continue enhanced physical activity monitor+text 
messaging for responders.
A methodologically rigorous SMART design will be used to test these adaptive 
interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two initial treatment 
components: a) enhanced physical activity monitor only (physical activity monitor with goal 
setting and a physical activity prescription) treatment, or b) enhanced physical activity monitor+ 
motivational text messaging treatment for 8 weeks (early adoption phase). Week [ADDRESS_751981] not met their physical activity step goal (i.e., non-
responders). Non-responders will be those who a) fail to have valid wear time (i.e., wear a 
minimum of 3 days with 10 hours of wear time OR exceeding baseline step average), and b) 
average steps exceed the short-term goal of 600 steps above baseline average for two of the three 
weeks in weeks 6 to 8.. Non-responders to initial treatments will be randomly assigned to one of 
two augmented treatments: a) personal calls, or b) group meetings for Weeks 9-34 (later 
adoption phase). Responders will continue with their original treatment for Weeks 9-34 (later 
adoption). During Weeks 35-50 (maintenance), all women will receive enhanced physical 
activity monitors only. Data collection will occur at baseline and at Weeks 9-10 (end of early 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/2020
2adoption), 35-36 (end of later adoption), and 51-52 (end of maintenance). Data collection from 
the physical activity monitor (Fitbit Charge 2 or 3, hereafter referred to as Fitbit) will be ongoing 
and take place throughout the study. 
II. Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria
Participants will be recruited from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. 
Inclusion criteria are: 
1) Female employee at study site
2) Aged 18 to 70
3) Able to speak/read English
4) Owns a smartphone with text messaging capability
5) Willing to receive text messages at the proposed pace
6) We will include all participants who desire to be more physically active. However, we 
will also obtain present level of physical activity to assess if they meet or do not meet per 
self-report recommended moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity guidelines 
(moderate-intensity physical activity, >150 minutes/week; vigorous-intensity physical 
activity, >75 minutes/week).
7) We will include participants who have Type 1 diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes with an A1C 
≥ 9.0%, or have an A1C of ≥ 6.5% without a prior diabetes diagnosis, only if they have 
been given clearance by [CONTACT_78567]
8) Without a disability that inhibits walking as determined by [CONTACT_93780]-Q & You (Physical 
Activity Readiness Questionnaire)
The sample is limited to women due to the substantive findings, including our own, 
suggesting that women have a more favorable response when interventions are specifically 
designed for women. The second round of randomization includes the group meeting, which 
requires > 6 participants, and we cannot guarantee adequate numbers of same-language 
participants unless we limit the sample to English. Due to wide use of smartphones and text 
messages, participants' own smartphones will be used. 
Exclusion criteria are:
1) Major signs/symptoms of pulmonary or cardiovascular disease
2) Systolic BP > 160 and/or diastolic BP > 100
3) Sufficiently active, as determined by a physical activity monitor worn for one week, 
indicating averaging >7,500 steps per day (“somewhat active”) 
III. Recruitment & Setting
Researchers will use reactive strategies to recruit participants (i.e., women will be informed 
about the program, and those interested in participation will be able to initiate contact [CONTACT_572828]). The strategies will include e-mail communication from the employer human 
resource department, flyers, and using recruitment posters on electronic and paper employee 
bulletin boards located near work areas. All strategies will include a brief description of the 
program, provide a phone number to call for further information, program website URL, and 
program email address. 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/[ADDRESS_751982], which delivers state-of-the-science health care 
to its patients. The institution employs approximately 7,577 females from diverse ethnic 
backgrounds: African American (24%), Asian (10%), Hispanic (14%), White (47%), and other 
ethnicities (5%). The mean age of employees is 39.97 years (standard deviation = 19.22). 
Assuming that employed women fail to meet aerobic physical activity guidelines at a rate that is 
half the rate of the general population of women, we estimate that we will have a pool of 
approximately 1,[ADDRESS_751983] or more of their waking time at work, the 
worksite presents an ideal setting from which to recruit for participation in physical activity 
interventions. Low levels of physical activity are exacerbated by [CONTACT_572829] (defined as the physical environment in which people 
perform the majority of their vocational duties). The increase in sedentary occupational activity 
in the U.S. over the past [ADDRESS_751984] half of the U.S. work force. In addition to their work 
activities, 47% of employed women have children younger than 18 years, and 20% have other 
caregiving responsibilities, both of which serve as barriers to leisure-time physical activity.
For the proposed study, all research-related visits will be offered at the Rush University 
Medical Center worksite on both daytime and evening shifts. Data collection appointment 
assessments will be split over several days. Participants will be given Appointment Reminder 
forms with the date, time and location of their appointment.  Participants will also receive 
reminder phone calls and/or text messages regarding appointments, and to wear and sync their 
Fitbit, as well as to wear their Actigraph. Participants will also have the option for research-
related visits to be at a convenient location of their choosing (e.g., their home). Participants 
assigned to group meetings may use their phones for audio conferencing or Webex 
videoconferencing if they are unable to attend the group meeting in-person. Participants will be 
provided healthy snacks at the group meetings. Participants will be given $[ADDRESS_751985] after 
completing each of the four data collections (total received will be $160 in gift cards). 
Researchers will identify multiple means of remaining in contact [CONTACT_572830]: 
work, home, and cell phone numbers (including text messages); home and email addresses; and 
contact [CONTACT_572831]. 
Participants who are randomly assigned to receive the augmented group meeting component, 
will receive two reminder telephone calls, text messages, or e-mails one week before and one 
day before data collection and group meetings. If the participant misses the first session, they 
will be asked to meet individually with the interventionist, prior to the second group meeting 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/[ADDRESS_751986] and given a link to the Webex of the missed group meeting. The woman will 
be asked to view the Webex video within a week.. The number of regular and make-up sessions 
attended will be included in the analyses. 
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) will participate in this study as a performance site 
under the guidance of [CONTACT_572858] (site- PI) and will be responsible for the following:
1) Remote collection of physical activity data generated from the wearable activity monitors 
(Fitbit) that will be provided to enrolled study participants; and 
2) Delivery of the text-messaging intervention that has been developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Buchholz at 
Rush. 
UIC has developed a secure research application (iCardia) that allows researchers to remotely 
collect different physical activity properties (e.g. steps, intensity of activity, and sedentary 
minutes) from registered Fitbit wearable devices, and send personalized, short-messages service 
(SMS) text-messages participants’ cell phones through the Twilio communications platform. 
iCardia is password-protected and hosted in a HIPAA compliant environment at UIC. It will only 
be accessible by [CONTACT_572832]. Exportation of Fitbit data from 
iCardia is done using de-identified codes only. Text-messages send from iCardia will utilize the 
Twilio communications platform, which is also HIPAA compliant. Text-messages will be 
scheduled/programmed in iCardia by [CONTACT_572833]. 
UIC will NOT serve as a recruitment site or be involved in the recruitment process.

V. Physical Activity Goal 
All participants will receive an enhanced physical activity monitor treatment, which includes 
goal setting with a physical activity prescription, and self-monitoring with a physical activity 
monitor. We will follow the physical activity prescription guidelines that were successfully used 
in our prior work. First, steps walked per week and per day (step counts) are obtained from the 
Fitbit, which is distributed during initial eligibility screening and worn for one week prior to the 
start of the intervention. The baseline step count per day is identified by [CONTACT_572843]. Based on previously published step count data, 
counts per day have been classified as: < 5,000 = "sedentary"; 5,000-7,499 steps = “low active”; 
7,500-9,999 steps = “somewhat active”; 10,000-12,499 steps = “active”; and ≥ 12,500 steps = 
“high active”. Adults in the U.S. take an average of 5,117 steps per day. Adding 3,000 steps to 
5,117 steps per day would move an individual from the “low active” into the “somewhat active” 
category. Thus, each participant is given an overall goal to increase her steps above her baseline 
by a minimum of 3,[ADDRESS_751992] emphasize frequency (walking more times 
throughout the day), then duration (walking for longer periods of time), and finally intensity 
(walking at a faster pace). Walking is initiated by [CONTACT_572844]/unplanned physical activity throughout the day. Participants will be given an initial goal 
of walking 600 steps/day over their baseline mean, by 8 weeks, to increase their frequency of 
walking. 
Depending on participant preferences, for participants who reach the “somewhat active” 
classification through their routine physical activity, they may begin structured physical activity 
(e.g., leisure-time walking), continue to increase their routine physical activity with a focus on 
walking for longer periods of time, or combine both strategies as additional sources of steps. The 
“somewhat active” classification was selected as the point to introduce structured/planned leisure 
physical activity because the “active” classification is associated with intentional (structured) 
activities. Thus, participants in the “somewhat active” classification who choose to add 
structured bouts of walking may gradually increase over four weeks structured activity to a 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/2020
14duration of 30 minutes, frequency of three to four times per week, consistent with American 
College of Sports Medicine. Participants who are able to reach the “active” classification should 
have the conditioning to assume moderate-intensity walking, per American College of Sports 
Medicine recommendations, either during 30 minutes of planned walking or physical activity 
bouts of ≥ 10  minutes.  Participants at this level are encouraged to walk faster. 
The initial step count goal will be entered electronically into a Fitbit, a slim wristband 
physical activity monitor to be worn at all times except during bathing and swimming, through a 
Fitbit application on a mobile device using the Fitbit.com website. The physical activity monitor 
allows participants to self-monitor their walking steps, distance, and intensity. Participants 
automatically receive notifications in relation to their PA as follows: The Fitbit PA monitor 
gently vibrates to notify the participant when she has achieved 100% of her daily step goals. 
Also, the Fitbit mobile app generates an automatic notification in the form of a friendly message, 
when a participant has achieved 75%, 100% or 125% of her daily step goal provided that the 
Fitbit mobile app is on or actively running in the background.
 
Fitbit data will be collected using the iCardia application and be presented on a virtual 
dashboard. The dashboard will show the research team real time participant physical activity 
data. These data will be used to provide suggested physical activity step goals at the end of the 
early adoption (Week 8) and late adoption (Week 34) phases. The iCardia application will be 
used to send text-messages based on the incoming physical activity data. 
Text message reminders are sent to all of the participants every Monday to remind them to 
sync their Fitbit. If the participant has not synced their Fitbit in [ADDRESS_751993] synced or not. During Weeks 35-50 (maintenance), all participants will 
only be sent one text message weekly, and that will be a reminder every Monday to remind them 
to sync their Fitbit. 
The research team will create anonymous email and Fitbit accounts for all participants 
enrolled in the study. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, we will use unique Subject ID codes 
for the creation of online accounts. No personal or private identifiers will be stored in the Fitbit 
servers at any point in time. This account will be used only for the purpose of this study, where 
the email address will be used to communicate information about Fitbit data to the research team.
All participants will have a program orientation, which will include guidance on setting a 
physical activity goal and using their physical activity monitor, as well as viewing a video that 
will give information related to self-monitoring their steps, and proper walking and stretching 
techniques.
 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/2020
15VI. Text Message Component
In addition to the enhanced physical activity monitor half of the participants will also receive 
motivational TMs.  Participants who receive an enhanced physical activity monitor + 
motivational text message treatment from Week [ADDRESS_751994], participants will choose motivational physical activity text 
messages that they want to receive three times a week over the course of the next 8 months. They 
will provide the three days of the week they want to receive those text messages, along with the 
time of day they want to receive them. Second, at the beginning of each week, the research team 
will review the physical activity data to determine a woman’s daily mean steps the previous 
week. Based on their steps, they will be informed of their step classification the past week, using 
these published step count data: < 5,000 = "sedentary"; 5,000-7,499 steps = “low active”; 7,500-
9,999 steps = “somewhat active”; 10,000-12,499 steps = “active”; and ≥ 12,500 steps = “high 
active”.  
VII. Personal Call Component
Motivational personal calls will be based on the model consisting of five brief 
(approximately 10 minute) Motivational Interviewing telephone calls, made by [CONTACT_572845], every two weeks during the first 10 weeks of late adoption, and five calls every 
three weeks for the following 14 weeks (total 10 personal calls in late adoption Weeks 11-34). 
Participants will be given feedback based on their step counts in the prior week in relation to 
their goal (obtained from iCardia). The interventionist, who will be trained in Motivational 
Interviewing methods/techniques, will explore the participant’s feelings toward behavior change, 
assist in articulating self-efficacy in overcoming problems/barriers to physical activity, identify 
benefits of physical activity, and assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a plan to increase physical activity. Using 
Motivational Interviewing, the interventionist will tailor the discussion to match the participant’s 
needs, experiences, barriers, motivation, and confidence. Suggestions for addressing problems 
will only be provided after the participant has explored options and agreed to receive feedback. 
The interventionist will follow a semi-structured protocol that provides the basic flow of each 
call, allowing for discussion and reflective listening. The calls will emphasize how the 
participant can overcome barriers to obtain goal steps.
VIII. Group Meeting Component
The group meeting treatment consists of five 45-60 minute group meetings held every four to 
six weeks during late adoption (Weeks 9-34). Due to the time needed to schedule, group 
meetings will start at Week 12. Group meetings will be led by a trained interventionist, held in a 
private conference room on the worksite property, and scheduled between the day and evening 
shift times.  Participants will be able to attend in person or by [CONTACT_572846]: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/[ADDRESS_751995] meetings address personal and 
environmental problems that can interfere with increasing physical activity. The fourth group 
meeting focuses on anticipating disincentives for physical activity and handling relapses. These 
group meetings are targeted to address participant’s common barriers to physical activity, and 
identify benefits of physical activity. At the final group meeting, participants will share their 
experiences.
The group begins with a seven minute video of women role modeling (vicarious experience) 
by [CONTACT_572847], sharing experiences, and sharing approaches to problem solving and 
overcoming challenges pertinent to each group meeting. Following the video, each group 
meeting will include a 30-minute group discussion facilitated by [CONTACT_572848], provide guidance, and encourage participants to solve problems together. A customized 
manual, including content for each group meeting, will be used to guide the discussion. At the 
conclusion of each discussion, participants will examine their step counts from the prior week in 
relation to their goal, identify a strategy for meeting the goal, and rate their self-efficacy 
(confidence) to meet the goal on a scale of 0-10. If their confidence is <8, the interventionist will 
recommend that participants reset their goal to one in which they have higher confidence. At the 
End of each group meeting, participants will complete a Group Meeting Satisfaction Tool (4 
items assessing satisfaction with group meetings).
IX. Study Timeline and Compensation
Participants can expect to be involved in the study for 52 weeks from start to finish. At each 
visit except the final visit, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_751996] 
visit, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_751997] upon completion of the questionnaires, and a $[ADDRESS_751998] when they return their Actigraph. Successful completion of all 4 in-person study visits 
would therefore entail a total possible compensation of $[ADDRESS_751999] that allows them to view each study participant’s physical activity data 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/[ADDRESS_752000] sync, and send personalized text-
messages based on the incoming data. All Fitbit data pertaining to steps and intensity of physical 
activity are exportable to SPSS in a de-identified fashion (i.e. using random ID codes) for further 
statistical analysis. Training of research assistants and familiarization with the iCardia 
application will be coordinated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kitsiou.
XI. Randomization
At the conclusion of the baseline interview, participants will be randomized to one of two 
initial treatments (physical activity monitor, or physical activity monitor+text message) in a 1:1 
fashion.  The random allocation table will be integrated into the Baseline interview programmed 
in REDCap, allowing both participant and interviewer to be blind to initial treatment condition 
until the end of the consent process and baseline interview.
At the end of the 8-week initial treatment phase, non-responders (i.e., those with an average 
increases of <600 steps per day above baseline) will continue their initial treatment assignment 
(physical activity monitor, or physical activity monitor+text message) and be randomized to one 
of two augmented treatments (personal calls or group meetings) in a 1:1 fashion stratified by 
[CONTACT_572849] a random allocation table integrated into the Access database.  Research 
staff will be blind to augmented treatment assignment until responder status has been entered 
into the Access database at the Decision Point 1 Week 8 time point. After their Week 9-10 (D2) 
follow-up appointment and after they return their ActiGraph, the participant will be notified if 
they are receiving an augmented treatment.  
XII. Hypotheses and Data Analysis
Under the direction of [CONTACT_572859], SAS (v9.3) and R will be used for statistical analysis. 
[CONTACT_572860]-Shani is a methodological expert with a focus on developi[INVESTIGATOR_572822], including the Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial 
(SMART) and will consult with [CONTACT_572859] and members of the research team on use of the 
SMART design during the study.  Because multiple outcomes are being evaluated in the primary 
aim, a two-tailed .[ADDRESS_752001] analysis. Hypothesis testing will address four study aims. 
Aim 1. Aim 1 is to compare the two augmented treatments used for non-responders, personal 
calls and group meetings, in improving physical activity and cardiovascular health after 35 and 
50 weeks. 
Hypothesis: Group meetings will be more effective than personal calls in improving 
physical activity and cardiovascular health after 34 and 50 weeks, among non-responders to 
the initial treatment.
This hypothesis will be tested using a multilevel analysis with time nested within 
participant (i.e., non-responders only). The hypothesis of the study is that the non-responders 
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/2020
18who receive group meetings will demonstrate greater improvement in physical activity (self-
report life-style and occupational physical activity: minutes of moderate/vigorous physical 
activity/weeks; device: number of steps/day, minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity/ 
week) compared to those who receive personal calls. 
Aim 2a.  Aim 2a is to compare enhanced physical activity monitor with and without text 
messaging for improving the level of physical activity from baseline to 8 weeks. These analyses 
will parallel those used for Aim 1, but consider only two time points (baseline and 8 weeks) and 
include all participants. 
Hypothesis: Participants who receive enhanced physical activity monitor+text messaging 
as compared to those who receive enhanced physical activity monitor alone will show greater 
improvement on physical activity at the end of 8 weeks.
Aim 2b. Aim 2b is to compare the four adaptive interventions in improving physical activity 
and cardiovascular health from baseline to 8, 34, and 50 weeks. The analysis is parallel to that 
described in Aim 1, except that the participants are not assigned to treatment based on simple 
randomization. Instead, they are screened on the basis of response status, and, once it has been 
ascertained that they did not respond to the initial treatment, they are randomly assigned to a 
treatment condition. Due to this design, the contrasts used to estimate the efficacy of these 
effects are nonorthogonal. The weights associated with the four interventions are then scored as a 
4 for non-responder subgroups and 2 for responder subgroups. This is because responder 
subgroups are used twice in the design matrix (e.g., subgroup A is used in adaptive interventions 
1 and 2; Figures 2 and 3). The estimation of these models is then based on a weighted multilevel 
linear regression model that has terms for change over time, the initial treatment, the augmented 
treatment, the interaction between the two treatments, and the effects of baseline and time-
varying characteristics. The critical effect in this model is the time-by-adaptive-intervention 
interaction term. The null hypothesis is that there will be no interaction effect at all, while the 
alternative hypothesis is that adaptive intervention 4 (enhanced physical activity monitor+text 
messaging [initial] and enhanced physical activity monitor+text messaging with group meetings 
[augmented for non-responders]) will produce the largest improvement rates. 
Aim 3. Aim [ADDRESS_752002] on intervention targets (benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, social 
support). 
Hypothesis: The intervention targets (benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and social support) 
will mediate the effect of the initial and augmented treatments on physical activity (8, 34, and 
50 weeks) and cardiovascular health (34 and 50 weeks). 
Research Question: Do characteristics of participants (prior physical activity, demographics, 
BMI, depression) and their environment (walkability, crime) moderate the effects of the initial 
and augmented treatments on physical activity and cardiovascular health?
ORA: 17053108-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 12/18/2019   Amendment Date: 7/21/[ADDRESS_752003] by [CONTACT_3148] (e.g., initial treatment is less likely to impact 
social support). For intervention targets that are significantly impacted by [CONTACT_126810], we will test whether they serve as mediators of intervention effects on physical 
activity and health status outcomes using methods described by [CONTACT_38722]. Moderation 
effects will be tested by [CONTACT_572850]. Significant moderator effects (i.e., significant moderator-by-time-
by-treatment effects) will then be used to identify optimal decision rules for individual 
participants. The estimation of optimal decision rules will be achieved using a Q-Learning 
analysis, which is a modified regression analysis, adapted to address the SMART design. 
These optimal decision rules can then be cross-validated in future studies.
Aim 4. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the societal perspective, 
including the program and participant costs. For the cost measurement, quantities of resources 
used and their associated prices will be collected for the program (either amounts paid or the 
value of the interventionist’s time), and participant (i.e., the value of the participant’s time to 
participate in the program). All costs will be valued in [ADDRESS_752004] per participant. 
For the effectiveness measurement, effectiveness will be measured using physical activity 
and cardiovascular health outcomes for a total of six measures (physical activity steps, self-
reported light/moderate/vigorous physical activity, occupational physical activity, aerobic 
fitness, BMI, waist circumference). Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by [CONTACT_572851] (physical activity, cardiovascular health). 
We will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the four adaptive 
interventions: (1) enhanced physical activity monitor (initial) and enhanced physical activity 
monitor with personal calls (augmented); (2) enhanced physical activity monitor (initial) and 
enhanced physical activity monitor with group meetings (augmented); (3) enhanced physical 
activity monitor+text messaging (initial) and enhanced physical activity monitor+text 
messaging with personal calls (augmented); or (4) enhanced physical activity monitor+text 
messaging (initial) and enhanced physical activity monitor+text messaging with group 
meetings (augmented), such that the ICER = (Ci – Cj≠i)/(Ei  – Ej≠i), where C denotes total 
cost and E denotes effectiveness. Effectiveness will be measured as the change in each 
outcome between baseline and study completion at 51-52 weeks. Subscript i denotes 1 of the 
4 adaptive interventions, and subscript j denotes the comparison intervention group. We will 
calculate six sets of ICERs, one for each effectiveness measure; 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated to evaluate the uncertainty in these results. We will conduct one-way and 
multi-way sensitivity analyses for the key parameters to evaluate whether the ICERs are 
sensitive to plausible changes in their values. We will also plot acceptability curves based on 
varying threshold (willingness to pay) values for adherence and change in physical activity 
and cardiovascular health outcomes. Separate ICERs will be calculated from the program and 
participant perspectives.

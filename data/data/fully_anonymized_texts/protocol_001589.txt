2 (231) VERSION HISTORY 
Version 4.0, 13 December  2017  
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.  
The renal function and proteinuria components of renal response criteria will be 
modified by [CONTACT_153218] (eGFR) and 24- hour urine 
protein to creatinine rati o (UPCR) cut-off values. 
For complete renal response (CRR), the alternative complete renal response (aCRR), the 
partial renal response (PRR), graded CRR, and graded aCRR, the cut-off values for the renal function (eGFR) will be changed to:  
• eGFR to ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2 or no confirmed decrease of eGFR from 
baseline of ≥20%  
For CRR and aCRR, the cut- off value for proteinuria (24 -hour UPCR) will be changed to: 
• 24-hour UPCR to ≤0.7 mg/mg  
For graded CRR and graded aCRR, the cut -off values for proteinuria will be changed to : 
• For subjects with baseline 24-hour UPCR of >3 mg/mg 24-hour UPCR 
cut-off will be changed to ≤1 mg/mg 
• For subjects with baseline 24- hour UPCR of ≤3 mg/mg 24-hour UPCR 
cut-off will be changed to ≤ 0.7 mg/ mg 
The flare definition for proteinuria ( UPCR ) will be changed to >1.5 mg/mg. 
Changes to objectives 
aCRR and 24-hour UPCR will be added as exploratory objectives at Week 104.  
It will be clarified that the proportion of subjects achieving PRR or CRR at Week [ADDRESS_176640] of anifrolumab on lupus nephritis (LN) at this timepoint. 
Clarification will be added that International Society of Nephrology (ISN)/Renal Pathology 
Society (RPS) classification and National Institute of Health (NIH) indices will also be 
summarised based on CRR and PRR at Week 104.

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) v1.[ADDRESS_176641] 
SAP amendment will be completed prior to unblinding of data.  
 
 
Changes to statistical analysis 
Text will be added in Section 8.6 that strong control of the familywise error rate will be 
performed for the primary and secondary endpoints for the pooled anifrolumab group compared with placebo as well as the respective tests for the individual anifrolumab regimens 
and the testing strategy to account for multiplicity considerations will be de scribed. The power 
and minimal detectable difference will be updated based on primary endpoint for the pooled 
anifrolumab group compared with placebo in Section 8.2. The sample size will provide 
approximately 86% power with a 2-sided alpha of 0.049. 
Relevant sections in the protocol will be updated to be consistent with the SAP. 
• Text will be added that the primary and secondary endpoints will be 
based on the pooled anifrolumab group compared with the placebo group.  
• Three additional subgroups; ADA (positive at any time, negative), eGFR at baseline (<60 mL/min/1.73m
2, ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2) and oral 
corticosteroids ( OCS ) dose at baseline (≤20 mg/day, >20 mg/day) will be 
added to Section 8.5.10. The geographic region subgroup will be 
renamed placebo response region. 
• The age subgroups in Section 8.5.10 will be changed to ≥18 to 64 and ≥65 years.  
• In Section 8.[ADDRESS_176642] of the study would remain blinded until database soft lock. 
• In Section 8.5 it will be clarified  that nominal p -values could be 
presented for endpoints not included in the strategy for preserving type 1 
error rate.  
Other changes  
In Section 3.2.1, the exclusion criteria for a spratate transaminase (AST) and a lanine 
transaminase (ALT) were changed to >2 .5x upper limit of normal (ULN). 
It will be clarified that no increase in oral corticosteroids (OCS), or the use of intravenous (IV) 
intra-articular, tendon sheath or bursal injections is allowed from Week 40 until Week 52

6 (231) Version 3.0, 3rd September 2016  
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.  
Text was added to clarify the study design of the second year extension period. Eligible 
subjects enrolled in the original Phase 2 study will continue in their randomised treatment 
groups. The treatment groups will continue to receive IP infusions (anifrolumab 300 mg or 
placebo) every 4 week s (Q4W) starting at Week [ADDRESS_176646] of care (SOC) until Week 100. Final efficacy assessment will be made at Week 104. Safety follow -up will continue every 4 weeks until Week 112. 
Criteria for discontinuation of IP at Week 52 were added. 
Subjects not meeting the criteria to continue for the second year extension period will not receive any IP at Week 52 and will complete the study after completing the required follow -up 
visits.  
Subjects meeting the following criteria may continue to receive blinded IP between Weeks 52 
and 100. 
(i) Meeting all of the following criteria based on the renal portion of the P RR 
definition: 
• eGFR is:  
− ≥80 mL/min/1.73 m
2, if baseline eGFR was ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
− >85% of baseline eGFR, if baseline eGFR was <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
• Improvement in 24- hour UPCR:  
− For subjects with a baseline UPCR ≤ 3 gm/gm: <1.0 gm/gm 
− For subjects with a baseline UPCR >3 gm/gm: >50% improvement 
from baseline and ≤ 3.0 gm/gm  
Renal discontinuation criteria must be confirmed in two separate samples. The second UPCR measurement should be at least [ADDRESS_176647] measurement.  
(ii) No discontinuation of IP 
(iii) Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test after signing the Main informed consent form (ICF )

added: 
• All Week [ADDRESS_176649] be completed prior to initiation 
of second year extension period dosing 
• First dose in second year extension period must be between Week 52 
(+14 days) and Week 60 
• At Week 52, the 24-hour UPCR may be collected between Weeks 50 and 
52 to assess r esponse and eligibility for participation in the second year 
extension period 
• The eGFR measured between Week 50 and Week 52 will be used to 
assess eligibility for participation in the second year extension period 
• Safety assessments:  
The electrocardiogram ( ECG ) at Week 52 has to be done prior to dosing 
of IP. Pap smear, hepatitis B virus ( HBV ), QuantiFERON -tuberculosis 
(TB) are to be performed as per protocol. Results must be available prior 
to the Week 56 dosing of IP. The Week 56 dose  (or the Week [ADDRESS_176650] in the extension) cannot be administered without the results of the Pap smear, HBV and TB assessments  
Text was added to explain the treatments during the second year extension period:

allowed until Week 92 
− No change in OCS dose from Week 92 to Week 104 
− [ADDRESS_176651] and taper allowed between Week 52 and Week 92 
Effic acy and safety assessments in the second year extension period were added to Tables 4 
and 5 to clarify the time points of the assessments.  
Schedule of samplings was added to Tables 4 and 5 to clarify the time points of sampling. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The 
database will be locked and the primary analysis will be performed once all subjects complete 
Week 52 or discontinue the study prior to Week 52. The Sponsor and Sponsor 's delegates will 
be unblinded to treatment assignments at the time of the primary analysis.

Changes to the protocol are summarised below.  
Text was added to clarify that stratification sample for 24 - hour UPCR can be obtained within 
14 days prior to the expected date of randomisation. Without the results of this second 
(stratification) sample, subjects cannot be randomised. Turn- around time for results from 
central laboratory is up to 7 days. On rare occasion an extension of the 30- day screening 
window is allowed if the re collection of the sample is necessary or the results needed for randomisation are delayed. 
An error noted in relation to the duration of administration (first "12 weeks" instead of first "3 
doses of the IP") has been corrected throughout the protocol. 
Unit of UPCR has been corrected from "gm/gm" to "mg/mg" throughout the protocol. 
The abbreviatio n "SFI" has been deleted throughout the protocol and in Appendix L. The term 
SFI has been replaced by [CONTACT_123473] "  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 
2000 ( SLEDAI -2K) based Flare Assessment Instrument"  
The outcome measure to evaluate the saf ety and tolerability of anifrolumab has been updated 
as "extra- renal flares using SLEDAI -2K based Flare Assessment Instrument".  
For the exploratory objectives, the criteria to determine improvement in 24-hour UPCR for 
subjects with a baseline UPCR >3 mg/mg  has been updated as >50% improvement from 
baseline and ≥3.0 mg/mg (previously <3.0).  
A note has been added to clarify that MMF will be supplied by [CONTACT_153220]'s participation in the study. MMF has been updated as "Sponsor provided MMF" in relevant sections of the protocol. 
The criteria for discontinuing IP at any time have been updated to include:  the receipt of 
methylprednisolone pulse, discontinuation of MMF and initiation of another 
immunosuppressant.  In addition, text was added to clarify that decrease is eGFR is to be 
based on two independent samples.

Study Code D3461C00007 
Version 4.0  
Date 13 December 2017  
 
19 (231) Approximately 150 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two IV 
dosing regimens of anifrolumab or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 48 weeks in addition to 
SOC which will continue until Week 52. After the primary objective time point at Week 52, eligible subjects will continue with randomised treatment (anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo IV 
Q4W) until Week 104. Those subjects not eligible to continue with treatment based on the 
Week 52 assessments will complete the 8 weeks of additional safety follow-up to complete involvement in the study. The regimens for anifrolumab are as follows: 
• Basic Regimen : Anifrolumab 300 mg IV Q4W (13 doses) plus SOC 
• Intensif ied Regimen : Anifrolumab [ADDRESS_176675] 3 doses 
followed by 300 mg IV Q4W for an additional 10 doses plus SOC 
Subjects who  meet the criteria at Week 52 (as defined in Section 3.9) to continue in the 
second year extension will continue to receive blinded IP (anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo IV 
Q4W) for an additional 13 doses plus SOC for another 52 weeks (second year extension 
period). 
The primary objective in the study is to evaluate the efficacy of anifrolumab plus SOC 
compared with  placebo plus SOC in subjects with active proliferative LN measured by [CONTACT_153222] 52 in 24-hour urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), comparing the pooled anifrolumab group (Basic and Intensified) to the placebo group. 
After all randomised subjects have completed the 52-week double-blind period, the data base 
will be  soft-locked , and the primary analysis  will be performed, including the assessment of 
the primary, secondary, and safety objectives. This analysis will also encompass available data 
collected after the 52  week time point and details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SA P). At this stage the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegate who are not directly involved in 
the management of sites will be unblinded to randomised treatment, but the subjects and 
Investigators will remain blinded (single -blind). The end of  study analysis  will b e performed 
after all subjects have completed the second year extension period.  One interim analysis may 
be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed the Week [ADDRESS_176676] ( IP) will be administered as an IV infusion via an infusion pump over 
no less than [ADDRESS_176677] 3 doses of IP (Visits 1, 2, and 3). Star ting with Visit 4, IP 
can be administered as an IV infusion via an infusion pump over no less than 30 minutes. 
Randomisation will be stratified using two factors: 
• Results of Type I interferon (IFN) test using a 4- gene type I IFN test (IFN 
test-high versus IFN test -low) at screening

20 (231) • 24-hour UPCR ≤3.0 mg/mg versus >3.0 mg/mg (based on 24- hour UPCR 
performed on a sample obtained within 14 days prior to the expected date 
of randomisation). Without the results of the second (stratification) 
sample, subjects can not be randomised. Turn-around time for results 
from central laboratory is up to 7 days.  
On rare occasion s an extension of the 30-day screening window may be  allowed if the 
re-collection of the 24-hour UPCR or other required sample s is necessary or if the results 
needed for randomisation are delayed. Renal biopsy performed within 12 weeks prior to 
signing informed consent form (ICF) or during the screening period will be considered as the 
screening biopsy. Biopsies will be evaluated locally and the local classification will be used to confirm the eligibility criteria. The biopsy must reveal Class III (±Class V) or Class IV 
(±Class V) LN according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) or 2003 International 
Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society IS N/RPS classification. An external renal 
biopsy adjudication group will adjudicate renal biopsies post-randomisation. 
The overall study duration is approximately 116 weeks: 
• A Screening Period : Up to 30 days  
• Treatment Period :  
The total treatment period is up to 100 weeks (26 doses administered 
every 4 weeks).  
− 52 week double- blind treatment period : IP will be administered 
every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 48 for a total of 13 doses. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at Week 52. 
− Second year extension period : At Week 52, eligible subjects will 
continue treatment with IP (anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo) 
administration Q4W from Week [ADDRESS_176678] efficacy assessments will be performed at Week 104.  
• Follow- up: After the completion of the last IP treatment (Week 48 for 
subjects who are not participating in the second year extension period and 
Week 100 for subjects who participate in the second year extension 
period) subjects will continue in the study for another [ADDRESS_176679] administration of IP.

31 (231) The study Medical Monitor/Designee will confirm eligibility criteria based on electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, and from the central laboratory.  
Criteria for discontinuing investigational product at Week 52, Week 56 or Week 60: 
• Failure to obtain pap smear after Week [ADDRESS_176686]  
• Pap smear result not meeting the eligibility criteria  (see Appendix K) at 
Week 52, 56, or 60 of a P ap smear obtained after Week 48  
• Failure to obtain Week [ADDRESS_176687] at Week 60 and later: 
• OCS >7.5 mg/day (except one OCS burst and taper)  
• MMF >2 gm/day or >Week 52 dose, whichever is lower 
Subjects who discontinue the IP during the second year extension period will be followed 
until Week 104 (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176688] dose of IP for subjects for whom IP 
was discontinued within 12 weeks of Week 104). 
Statistical methods  
The primary estimand is evaluating the efficacy on disease activity of anifrolumab relative to 
placebo in subjects with active proliferative LN. This is measured by [CONTACT_153223] [ADDRESS_176689] 1 dose of IP (modified Intention- To-Treat) will be 
used, in order to reflect the effect of the initially assigned and dosed IP. 
Analysis Set  
The full analysis set will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy and safety 
data. This comprises all subjects randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of IP 
and will be analysed according to randomised treatment (modifie d Intention- To-Treat 
principle). Any major deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the safety data.  
Analysis method for primary endpoint  
The analysis will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures fitte d to log-
transformed data comparing the pooled anifrolumab group (Basic and Intensified) with  the 
placebo group, with fixed effects for treatment group, visit, stratification factors and log-
transformed 24 hour UPCR at baseline.  An interaction term for vi sit and treatment will also 
be included in the model to allow the relationship to differ across treatment groups. Note that 
visit will be fitted as a repeated variable in the model.  Model assumptions will be checked

32 (231) and, if not met, appropriate data transformations may be applied or non- parametric approaches 
will be considered. 
Analysis method for safety endpoints 
All safety variables will be analysed descriptively. The safety analysis will be based on the 
full analysis set.  
Interim analysis 
One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed 
the Week 52 visit.  
Sample size calculations  
A total of 150 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the two IV 
anifrolumab dosing regimens (Basic Regimen or Intensified Regimen) or placebo. 
The sample size is based on the following assumptions:  
• Reductions from baseline to Week 52 in 24-hour UPCR of 65% and 46% 
for the anifrolumab and placebo arms, respectively (ie, ratios of 24-hours 
UPCR from Week 52 to baseline of 0.35 and 0.54, respectively), based on data presented in Furie et al, 2014
1.  
• The log- transformed [ADDRESS_176690] deviation (SD) of 0.8, based on data from the anifrolumab 
Phase 2b study (CD1013). 
Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 50 subjects per arm would result in an observed 
relative difference in the change from baseline to Week 52 in 24-hour UPCR of 0.65 (here 
expressed as the ratio, comparing anifrolumab to placebo), and a corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of (0.50, 0.85) comparing the pooled anifrolumab group (Basic and Intensified) with the placebo group. If the interim analysis is performed, a 0.001 two -sided 
alpha will be spent, and the final analysis will based on a 2-sided alpha of 0.049 (East Version 6.4). This sample size provides approximately 86 % power with a [ADDRESS_176691] (relative difference =1) for comparing the pooled 
anifrolumab treatment group with placebo. The minimal detectable relative difference in the 
change from baseline to Week 52 in 24-hour UPCR between the pooled anifrolumab treatment 
group versus placebo is approximately 0.76, corresponding to a reduction from baseline to 
Week 52 in 24- hour UPCR of 59% in the pooled anifrolumab group (ratio of 24-hour UPCR 
from Week 52 to baseline of 0.41).

48 (231) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study  
Anifrolumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody directed 
against subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1). It is composed of 2 identical 
light chains and 2 identical heavy chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 
148 kDa. Anifrolumab inhibits binding of type I interferon (IFN) to IFNAR1 and inhibits the biologic activity of all type I IFN.  
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisyste m autoimmune disease of unknown 
aetiologies. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common major organ manifestation of SLE. It affects approximately 35 -60% of lupus patients and is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, 
such as African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics ( Borchers et al, 2010). Although renal 
outcome has improved with the introduction of immunosuppressive treatment, LN still represents a major risk factor for  the long-term outcome of patients with SLE and adversely 
affects the prognosis, as measured by [CONTACT_153224] ( Furst et al, 2013; Li et al, 2009; Mok et al, 2013; Pelletier et al, 2009 ). 
Renal survival rates in recent studies ranged from 83% to 92% at 5 years of follow -up and 
from 74% to 84% at 10 years of follow -up (summarised in Mok et al, 2013 ). The risk of 
end-stage renal disease is particularly high in patients with diffuse proliferative 
glomerulonephritis (reviewed in Mok et al , 2013). Several studies have shown that the 
standardised mortality ratio of patients with LN is 6 -9 fold higher compared to the general 
population and about 3 fold higher compared to patients with non- renal SLE (reviewed in 
Mok et al, 2013). The mortality rate increases with accumulation of renal damage and is 
highest in LN patients with end- stage renal disease. The life expectancy of SLE patients with 
renal disease and those with renal damage is reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 15 years and 23 years, 
respectively, compared to the general population ( Mok et al, 2013). Lupus nephritis is also a 
major factor contributing to SLE- related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153164] ( Furst et 
al, 2013; Li et al, 2009; Pelletier et al, 2009 ).  
There is substantial unmet medical need in the treatment of LN, particularly for patients with 
proliferative LN. There is no approved treatment for LN, but various treatment regimens are 
widely used as local standards of care.  The standard treatment for proliferative LN consists of 
6 to 12 months of intensive immunosuppressive therapy (usually cyclophosphamide or 
mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] with high -dose corticosteroids) followed by a longer period of 
less intensive maintenanc e therapy ( Bertsias et al, 2012 ; Hahn et al, 2012). Corticosteroid 
dosing frequently includes pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (500 mg to 1,000 mg/day) followed by [CONTACT_153225] (0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone-
equivalent) with a goal of reducing the dose to around 10 mg/day of prednisone- equivalent at 
6 months. Mycophenolate mofetil is the recommended agent by [CONTACT_40973] (ACR) ( Hahn et al, 2012) and the European League Against Rheumatism

49 (231) (EULAR) ( Bertsias et al, 2012 ) with a total daily dose of 2 to 3 gm orally for 6 months, 
followed by [CONTACT_153226].  
Two regimens of IV cyclophosphamide are recommended as alternatives: 1) low-dose 
“Euro -Lupus” cyclophosphamide (500 mg IV once every 2 weeks×3 months), followed by 
[CONTACT_153227] 2) high-dose cyclophosphamide (500 to 1000 mg/m
2 IV once a month×6 months), followed by [CONTACT_153228].  
Maintenance therapy is recommended for a minimum of 12 months with lower intensity immunosuppression with or without low- dose steroids (≤7.5 mg/day). Mycophenol ate mofetil 
(≤2 gm/day) or azathioprine are the most commonly used agents for maintenance ( Bertsias et 
al, 2012; Hahn et al, 2012; Radhakrishnan et al, 2012).  
Mycophenolate mofetil was chosen over cyclophosphamide in this study as s tandard of care 
(SOC), because the response rates are similar in all races and ethnicities, whereas African 
Americans and Hispanics respond less well to IV cyclophosphamide than Whites and Asians 
(Isenberg et al, 2010). The target dose of MMF recommended by [CONTACT_153229] (ACR, EULAR, and KDIGO) is 2 to 3 gm/day orally for [ADDRESS_176711] shown doses ≤2 gm/day lead to similar renal responses but lower frequency of adverse events (AEs) compared to doses of 3 gm/day ( Chan, 2012; Li et 
al, 2012; Mulic -Bacic et al, 2008 ; Ong et al, 2005 ). Consistent with these observations, the 
ACR guidelines recommend to target 2 gm/day for induction in Caucasian patients with LN (Hahn  et al, 2012 ), which is also the higher end of the range used for induction in Asian 
countries. Although a higher target dose is frequently used in patients of African descent, there is no  evidence to support this distinction. 
Multiple lines of evidence indicate a role of type I IFN in the pathogenesis of SLE and LN. 
For example, overexpression of type I IFN and proteins induced by [CONTACT_24975] I IFN (the “type I 
IFN signature”) have been associated with greater disease activity and organ system involvement in SLE ( Dall’Era et al, 2005 ; Bengtsson et al, 2000). High serum levels of type I 
IFN have been associated with high anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti- dsDNA) 
antibody titres, LN, and progressive skin rashes ( Bengtsson et al, 2000).  
The disease pathogenesis of SLE includes activation of innate immunity, with increased 
production of type I IFN, including IFN- α, and increased number of plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells and my eloid dendritic cells in involved tissue ( Baechler et al, 2003; Crow and 
Wohlgemuth, 2003; Baechler et al, 2004 ; Banchereau et al, 2004 ; Bengtsson et al, 2000; 
Crow, 2010; Dall’Era et al, 2005 ; Rönnblom and Alm, 2003). Specific humoral and cellular 
immune systems are activated. Autoantibodies are universally present and may precede 
development of clinically apparent disease by [CONTACT_153230] ( Arbuckle et al, 2003). Systemic 
lupus erythematosus- associated autoantib odies include anti- dsDNA, anti -nucleosomes, 
anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti -RNP) complex, and anti- Smith antibodies ( Rahman and Isenberg,

50 (231) 2008). Immune complexes containi ng anti -dsDNA or anti- RNP antibodies can activate type I 
IFN production by [CONTACT_153231] ( Bengtsson et al, 2000; Rönnblom and Alm, 
2003).  
A potential role of IFN in the pathogenesis of LN has been suggested by [CONTACT_153232]. 
Animal models: 
• Interferon -α can induce glomerulonephritis in normal mice and 
accelerates the onset of the spontaneous autoimmune disease of NZB/W 
mice ( Mathian et al, 2005).  
• A murine model of SLE, treated with a synthetic double stranded RNA ligand that induces type I IFN response, showed high titres of anti-
dsDNA antibodies, increased immune complex deposition, and increased 
metalloproteinase activity, which led to accelerated LN and death 
(Triantafyllopoulou et al, 2010).  
• Overexpression of systemic IFN- α accelerated LN in several murine 
models of LN ( Fairhurst et al 2008, Liu et al, 2011). Signalling blocked 
by [CONTACT_153233] I IFN receptor ( Jørgensen et al, 2007; Nacionales et 
al, 2007; Santiago -Raber et al, 2003 ) or an anti- IFN-α antibody ( Baccala 
et al, 2012) prevented or ameliorated LN.  
Human data:  
A role for IFN -α in the initiation of the autoimmune disease process is suggested more 
directly by [CONTACT_153234] -autoimmune disorders who are treated with 
IFN-α can develop antinuclear antibodies, anti -dsDNA antibodies, and occasionally also SLE 
(Rönnblom and Alm, 2003).  
Although no direct causal evidence has been established for type I IFN in human LN, several 
observations suggest that IFNs have an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease: 
• The formation of endothelial cell tubuloreticular inclusions found in LN is thought to be driven by [CONTACT_24975] I IFN, and other than in LN, they can only 
be seen in viral and IFN-induced nephropathies ( Anders et al, 2014 ). 
• Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are the main producers of type I IFN in SLE, are increased in number in the kidneys of LN patients ( Tucci et 
al, 2008).

51 (231) • Type I gene signature [CONTACT_153300] a subset of LN 
patients ( Peterson et al, 2004).  
• Some cross -sectional studies showed a positive correlation between the 
blood IFN signature [CONTACT_153301] a higher risk of renal flare ( Feng et 
al, 2006; Landolt-Marticorena et al, 2009), whereas other studies showed 
an association between the blood IFN signature a nd the presence or 
history of LN ( Baechler et al, 2003 ; Kirou et al, 2005).  
• A strong correlation between type I IFN-induced chemokine and LN was demonstrated in several studies ( Bauer et al, 2009 ; Manoharan et al, 
2010). Elevated serum IFN-induced chemokine levels were strongly 
associated with the risk of renal flare ( Bauer et al, 2009), whereas urine 
chemokine levels were proposed as biomarkers for active LN 
(Manoharan et al, 2010).  
Together, these pre- clinical and clinical data strongly support the hypothesis that type I IFN is 
involved in the immunopathogenesis of LN and therefore suppressing signalling through the type I IFN receptor may have clinical benefit in active LN.  
With the growing evidence that type I IFNs play an important role in autoimmune diseases 
such as SLE and LN, inhibition of the biological activity of type I IFNs with anifrolumab 
may, therefore, be a novel efficacious therapy for the treatment of LN and its significant unmet medical need.  
1.[ADDRESS_176712], and that anifrolumab will be well tolerated when 
given at the proposed dose for the duration of the study. 
To ensure adequate treatment, all subjects will receive SOC treatment with MMF and 
corticosteroids. This is consistent with both the EULAR ( Bertsias et al, 2012 ) and ACR ( Hahn 
et al, 2012) management guidelines and kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations ( Radhakrishnan et al, 2012) for the management of proliferative LN.

52 (231) The study will be randomised, placebo-controlled, and double-blind prior to the primary 
analysis to ensure a robust design and minimise bias. This is the preferred design as outlined 
in the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) Guidance for Industry Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-Developi[INVESTIGATOR_153165] ( US FDA, June 2010) and 
in the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of SLE and LN ( CHMP, February 2015). 
After the last subject completes the Week 52 visit, the primary analysis will be conducted, 
after which the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegates will be unblinded. Site investigators and 
subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment throughout the stu dy. 
Randomisation will be stratified using two factors: 
• Results of IFN test at screening using a [ADDRESS_176713] (IFN 
test-high versus IFN test- low) 
• 24-hour Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤3.0 mg/mg versus 
>3.0 mg/mg (based on 24-hour UPCR performed on a sample obtained within 14 days prior to the expected date of randomisation). Without the results of the second (stratification) sample, subjects cannot be 
randomised. Turn-around time for results from central laboratory is up to 
7 days.  
On rare occasion an extension of the 30-day screening window may be  allowed if the re -
collection of the 24-hour UPCR or other required sample s is necessary or if the results needed 
for randomisation are delayed.  
Stratification is implemented in order to minimise the risk of baseline imbalance(s) across 
treatment arms on potentially confounding variables. Baseline imbalances of these factors 
could impact efficacy and/or safety assessments of anifrolumab versus placebo. 
The duration of renal responses will be assessed in a second year extension period where 
eligible subjects will continue in their randomised treatment groups. Treatment assignment 
will remain blinded for the Investigators and subjects. At the time of primary analysis, after the last subject has completed the Week 52 visit, the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegates will be 
unblinded to treatment assignment. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_176714] is preservation of renal function. With current SOC, end- stage renal 
disease occurs late and with a relatively low frequency which makes it impractical for use as 
endpoint in clinical studies. Recent studies used various composite endpoints for renal

53 (231) response. The core elements of all these criteria are stable or improving renal function and a 
decrease in or n ormalisation of proteinuria. Improvement in proteinuria reflects control of 
inflammation and the subsequent repair of the kidney. Although the ultimate goal is to 
eliminate proteinuria, several studies have shown that reducing proteinuria (which in itself is 
toxic to the kidney) during the first year of treatment is associated with good long -term renal 
prognosis even if the proteinuria cannot be eliminated ( Korbet et al, 2013; Dall’Era et al, 
2011; Dall’Era et al, 2015 ) Therefore, showing a benefit in decreasing proteinuria at Week 52 
represents a clinically meaningful endpoint for an exploratory proof of concept study. 
Furthermore, maintaining renal function while decreasing oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose (worsening of renal function or not meeting clinically meaningful decreases in OCS doses are 
withdrawal criteria in the study) will provide supportive evidence for potential long- term 
efficacy in LN patients.

1.2.4 Rationale for d ose selection  
The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of anifrolumab across 2 dosing regimens: the 
Basic Regimen will test [ADDRESS_176716] 
of the treatment period.  
The selection of doses of 300 mg and 900 mg anifrolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) is based on 
safety and efficacy results from the interim analysis of a Phase 2b study in extra- renal SLE 
where 2 doses of anifrolumab (300 mg and 1000 mg) were evaluated relative to placebo. At the interim analysis of the Phase 2b study, clinically meaningful benefit was observed with the 300 mg dose, with no incremental benefit at 1000 mg (see Section 1.3 for details). In addition, 
a higher proportion of subjects reporting herpes zoster reactivations was observed at [ADDRESS_176717] 3 doses (Visits 1, 2, and 3) in LN subjects to account for potential IFN overexpression in the kidneys and potential loss of anifrolumab

54 (231) concentration due to proteinuria. Based on observations in the extra -renal SLE Phase 2b study, 
faster IFN signature [CONTACT_153302] [ADDRESS_176718] 3 doses of treatment (starting with the fourth dose all subjects will be switched to a dose of 300 mg) in order to 
limit the incidence of potential AEs related to anifrolumab. The 900 mg dose was chosen over 
1000 mg for ease of administration (anifrolumab is supplied in 150 mg vials). For these reasons, the selection of doses of 900 mg and 300 mg anifrolumab are justified for this study. 
1.2.5 Rationale for duration of infusion 
In a Phase 2b study where two doses of anifrolumab (300 mg and 1000 mg) in combination 
with SOC were compared to placebo combined with SOC, all doses were administered over approximately 60 minutes. Based on the interim analysis, the frequency of infusion- related 
reactions did not differ substantially between the 300 mg (2.0%) and 1000 mg (3.8%) groups and were lower than that observed in the placebo group (5.9%). Therefore, in this study the infusion time was reduced to a minimum of 30 minutes for the visits (starting with Visit 4), 
where all the subjects receive [ADDRESS_176719] 3 visits (Visits 1 to 
3), the time of infusion will be no less than [ADDRESS_176720] is an attractive goal, targeted by [CONTACT_153235]. To understand the 
relation ship between type I IFN expression and response to anti- IFN therapy, it is necessary to 
know if a specific patient’s disease is driven by [CONTACT_24975] I activation. Direct measurement of the 
IFN is challenging, so a transcript based marker, measuring the effect of  IFN, was developed 
to evaluate the effect of overexpression of the target protein on a specific set of messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) markers. The expression of these markers is easily detected in 
whole blood and demonstrates a correlation with expression in diseased tissue, such as skin, in 
SLE. The bimodal distribution of the transcript scores for SLE patients, as shown in the Figure  [ADDRESS_176721]-low subpopulation.

1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
A detailed assessment of the overall benefit/risk of anifrolumab is discussed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
There is significant unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with active proliferative 
LN. Since type I IFNs seem likely to have a role in SLE and LN, a therapy such as 
anifrolumab, that targets type I IFN receptors, may be beneficial.  
Overall benefit/risk assessment for Study D3461C00007 
Clinically relevant benefit has been recognized in subjects with moderately to severely active SLE treated with anifrolumab on a background of SOC. The benefit of anifrolumab was

56 (231) suggested over a range of efficacy endpoints in a Phase 2b study in SLE, when compared to 
placebo. The findings included the proportion of subjects achieving response in Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (4) (SRI[4]) with sustained reduction of OCS (<10  mg/day and less than or equal to the dose received on Day 1 by [CONTACT_2006] 85 (Week 12) and 
maintained between Days 85 and 169 (Week 24)) at Day 169, and the proportions of subjects achieving SRI(4) with sustained reduction of OCS (<10 mg/day and less than or equal to the dose received on Day 1, by [CONTACT_2006] 281 and maintained between Days 281 [Week 40] and 365 
[Week 52]) at Day 365.  
The efficacy observed with the primary and secondary endpoints was supported by a wide 
range of evidence. A higher proportion of subjects receiving anifrolumab met SRI ( 4) 
response criteria without the OCS taper requirement at Day 169 and Day 365, compared to placebo. Additionally, compared to the placebo group, a numerically higher proportion of anifrolumab treated subjects achieved SRI(5), SRI(6), SRI(7), and SRI(8) response, as well as 
a British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) ‑2004 based combined lupus assessment 
(BICLA) response.  
Higher response rates were also observed in organ- specific measures for anifrolumab treated 
subjects compared with placebo. In subjects with moderate or severe skin disease (Cutaneous 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index [CLASI] activity score ≥10) at baseline, a numerically higher proportion of subjects achieved at least 50% improvem ent from 
baseline in the CLASI activity score following anifrolumab treatment, compared to subjects receiving placebo.   
Anifrolumab was generally well tolerated. Herpes zoster reactivation with cutaneous 
presentation has been determined to be an identified risk for anifrolumab. No other infectious 
risks have been established; however, this continues to be closely monitored. 
SLE and lupus nephritis are thought to impair elements of the human immune system that 
contribute to the latency of herpes zoster (HZ) virus and prevent reactivation. The addition of 
a potent immunosuppressant like mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as standard of care may also diminish the immunologic forces that keep HZV latent, further increasing the likelihood of 
reactivation. Evidence to d ate from completed and ongoing studies that included 
administration of MMF as SOC suggest that HZ reactivations are mostly cutaneous, self -
limited and responsive to antiviral medications. Sequelae, such as post- herpetic neuralgia, 
have been reported infrequently. Overall, risk associated with HZ reactivations in the LN 
population is anticipated to be acceptable and similar to that reported in the SLE program. 
Compared to the general population, patients with SLE and LN have a higher rate of 
infections inclu ding serious and opportunistic infections. In the presence of 
immunosuppression with MMF and potentially also at the doses of anifrolumab administered 
in the Basic or Intensified Regimens Q4W in addition to SOC, there is a further theoretically 
increased l ikelihood of infections.

57 (231) Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including MMF are at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_153166], fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic 
infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. 
Immune surveillance related to development and progression of malignancy may be 
suppressed by [CONTACT_153236], potentially increasing the risk of malignancy, 
specifically lymphoma. However, at this time, no signal for malignancy risk has been recognized for anifrolumab. 
Risk associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and development of 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are expected to be unchanged in the LN study. Theoretically, the 
immunosuppressive effect of MMF may diminish adverse immune responses to anifrolumab.  
In order to minimise the risk associated with anifrolumab treatment, subjects with risk factors 
for serious infection, recurrent herpes zoster, malignancy, or immune deficiency disorders are 
specifically excluded from participation.  
Serious infections including non-opportunistic serious infections, opportunistic infections, anaphylaxis, malignancy, herpes zoster, TB (including latent TB), influenza, and vasculitis (non- SLE) are designated  as AESIs in this study so they are reported and assessed promptly. 
Careful systematic monitoring and ongoing blinded surveillance for all such events continues. 
In order to provide an independent periodic review of safety throughout the study, in addition 
to the ongoing, blinded review provided by [CONTACT_1034]/Designee Medical Monitor for 
detection of any potential safety signals, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) will review blinded and, if needed, unblinded safety data on a regular ba sis 
throughout the study (see Section 1.5.1).  
In conclusion, [COMPANY_008] believes there is an unmet medical need in the treatment of LN. Phase [ADDRESS_176722] of care. Immunosuppression may lead to increased 
susceptibility to infection MMF treatment has been associated with development of lymphoma. The proposed dosing regimens for Protocol D3461C00007 are adequately justified 
and the management plan for potential risks associated with anifrolumab is appropriate. The 
emerging  safety profile has not identified any risks that would preclude continued 
investigation of anifrolumab. [COMPANY_008] considers that anifrolumab in combination with 
SOC continues to demonstrate an overall positive benefit/risk balance to support its clinica l 
evaluation in subjects with active proliferative LN.  
1.4 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two IV treatment regimens of anifrolumab versus 
placebo, while taking protocol- specified SOC treatment with MMF and corticosteroids  (see

58 (231) Section 7.7.3 for details ), in adult subjects with active bio psy-proven proliferative LN. The 
study will be performed in adult subjects, 18 to 70 years of age. The study duration is 
approximately 116 weeks for those subjects who meet the criteria for the second year extension period and approximately 64 weeks for those subjects who do not meet the criteria 
for the second year extension period. 
In this study, approximately 150 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 
the two IV anifrolumab dosing regimens or placebo, which will continue until Wee k 52, as 
follows: 
• Basic Regimen : Anifrolumab 300 mg IV Q4W for 13 doses plus SOC or 
• Intensified Regimen : Anifrolumab [ADDRESS_176723] 3 doses 
followed by 300 mg IV Q4W for 10 doses plus SOC or 
• Placebo : IV Q4W plus SOC  
The primary objective will be evaluated at Week 52. After Week 52, eligible subjects will continue with randomised treatment plus SOC until Week 104. Those subjects not eligible to 
continue with treatment based on the Week [ADDRESS_176724] completed the 52 week double-blind period the data base 
will be soft -locked , and the primary analysis  will be performed, including the assessment of 
the primary, secondary, and safety objectives. This analysis will also encompass available data 
collected after the 52 week time point and details will be provided in the SAP. At this stage 
the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegate who are not directly involved in the management of sites 
will be unblinded to randomised treatment, but the subjects and investigators will remain blinded (single-blind). The end of study analysis  will be performed after all subjects have 
completed the second year extension period. One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed the Week [ADDRESS_176725] 3 doses (Visits 1, 2, and 3). Starting with Visit 4, IP  can be administered as an IV 
infusion via an infusion pump over no less than 30 minutes.  
Randomisation will be stratified using two factors: 
• Results of IFN test at screening using a [ADDRESS_176726] (IFN test -
high versus IFN test-low)

The total treatment period is up to 100 weeks (26 doses administered 
every 4 weeks).  
− 52 week double- blind treatment period : IP will be administered 
every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 48 for a total of 13 doses. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at Week 52.

continue treatment with IP (anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo IV Q4W) 
administration Q4W from Week [ADDRESS_176728] efficacy assessments will be performed at Week 104.  
• Follow- up: After the completion of the last IP treatment (Week 48 for 
subjects who are not participating in the second year extension period and 
Week 100 for subjects who participate in the second year extension 
period) subjects will continue in the study for another [ADDRESS_176729] administration of IP.  
At Week 52, eligible subjects will continue in their randomised treatment group for a second year of IP administration. The treatment groups will continue to receive IP infusions 
(anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo) Q4W starting at Week 52 for an additional 48 weeks in 
addition to SOC until Week 100. Final assessments will be performed at Week 104. After

3. SUBJECT SELECTION, ENROLMENT, RANDOMISATION, 
RESTRICTIONS, DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL  
Each subject should meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of  the exclusion criteria for this 
study.  Under no circumstances can there be excepti ons to this rule. If a subject does not meet 
eligibility criteria on the basis of a laboratory value, then the laboratory parameter may be 
repeated once within the screeni ng period; this will be re-testin g so that re-screening is not 
required. Please refer Section 4.1.1 for details on re-screen ing and re-testing.

be pre-fixed with ‘E’ in IXRS reports and on the screen (sites will have to enter the 
[ADDRESS_176746] data)  
3. Determine subject eligibility. Du ring the screening period, the study Medical 
Monitor/Designee will confirm eligibility criteria based on the data captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system, and from the central laboratory. Sites will be notified to either randomise the subject or to consider the subject as screen failed, 
prior to the planned randomisation date. 
4. On Day 1, the Investigator will confirm that all eligibility criteria are still fulfilled 
and will then perform the randomisation transaction in the IXRS. 
5. At randomisation the IXRS will assign eligible subjects a unique randomisation code and blinded IP kit number(s) to the subject. 
See additional information in S ection  3.5. 
Randomisation will be stratified using two factors:  
• Results of IFN test at screening using a [ADDRESS_176747] (IFN 
test-high versus IFN test- low) 
• 24-hour UPCR ≤3.0 mg/mg versus >3.0 mg/mg (within 14 days prior to 
the expected date of randomi sation). Without the second (stratification) 
sample, subjects cannot be randomised. Turn-around time for results 
from central laboratory is up to 7 days. On rare occasion an extension of 
the 30-day screening window may be  allowed if the re -collection of th e 
24-hour UPCR or other required sample s is necessary or if the results 
needed for randomisation are delayed.  
IP (anifrolumab or placebo) should, if possible, be administered the same day the IP kit 
number is assigned.

82 (231) Sponsor/Designee Medical Monitor and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153176]. The Sponsor/Designee must ensure all 
decisions are appropriately documented. 
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups  
On Day  1, the Investigator will confirm that all eligibility criteria and will then perform the 
randomisation transactio n in the IXRS. The IXRS will assign eligible subjects a unique 
randomisation code and blinded IP kit number(s). 
Specific information concerning the use of the IXRS will be provided in the separate user 
manual.  
Block randomisation using an IXRS will be used to randomise subjects in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive one of the two IV dosing regimens of anifrolumab (Basic Regimen/Intensified 
Regimen) or placebo. [COMPANY_008] Biostatistics group is responsible for generating the 
randomisation scheme for this study using the GRand system.  
3.[ADDRESS_176749] 3 doses of IP (Visits 1, 2, and 3) for all three arms. 
All packaging and labelling of IP is done in such way as to ensure blinding for all 
Sponsor/Designee and investigational site staff, other than the unblinded team member who is assigned to prepare the IP. The kits on the shelf, and the infusion bags when prepared, look 
identical. Neither the subject nor any of the Investigators or Sponsor/Designees who are 
involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of 
the treatment received. In the event that the treatment  allocation for a subject becomes known 
to the Investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the 
Sponsor/Designee must be notified immediately by [CONTACT_737].  
Investigators and subjects who continue in the second year extension period will continue to be blinded to their treatment. However, the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegates who are not directly involved in the management of sites will be unblinded at the time of the primary 
analysis at Week 52.

83 (231) Investigator must document and report the action to [COMPANY_008] or designee, without 
revealing the treatment given to subject to the [COMPANY_008] staff or the designee. Instructions 
for unblinding an individual subject’s IP allocation are contained in the IXRS manual. In 
general, unblinding should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be 
different based on the subject having received IP. In the majority of cases, the management of 
a medical emergency would be the same whether or not IP was received by [CONTACT_423]. If this 
was the case, the IP allocation should not be unblinded. Subjects who have been unblinded by 
[CONTACT_153247]. 
One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed 
the Week [ADDRESS_176751] completed the 52 week double-blind period the data ba se 
will be soft -locked , and the primary analysis  will be performed, including the assessment of 
the primary, secondary, and safety objectives. This analysis will also encompass available data 
collected after the 52 week time point and details will be provided in the SAP. At this stage 
the Sponsor and Sponsor’s delegate who are not directly involved in the management of sites will be unblinded to randomised treatment, but the subjects and investigators will remain 
blinded (single-blind). The end of study ana lysis will be performed after all subjects have 
completed the second year extension period. 
[COMPANY_008] or its designee retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited 
reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned 
analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject 
have been made and documented. 
Subjects who have been unblinded by [CONTACT_153248] (and who have 
not been unblinded to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_27362]/Designee Medical Monitor) will 
not, based on the unblinding alone, be discontinued from further receipt of IP. 
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised subject, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists at the study site.

discontinue IP during the 52 week double- blind treatment period will be followed until Week 
52 (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176768] dose of IP for subjects for whom IP was 
discontinued within 12 weeks prior to Week 52). If discontinuation occurs during the second 
year extension period, subjects will be followed until Week 104 (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176769]  dose of IP  for subjects for whom IP was discontinued within 12 weeks 
prior to Week 104). The subject may continue to receive Sponsor-provided MMF until the end of the subject’s participation in the study. 
3.9.6 Withdrawal of the informed consent  
Subjects are fr ee to withdraw from the study at any time ( IP and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.  
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) (see Section 3.9.2) 
and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator will follow-up AEs outside of the clinical 
study.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
3.9.[ADDRESS_176770]’s status at Follow -up Visit 2. A subject is considered lost to follow-up when the 
following attempts to contact [CONTACT_153252]:  
• Either phone calls, faxes or e-mails, and  
• Having sent 2 registered letters/certified mail, and  
• One attempt to check the status of the subject using publicly available 
sources, if allowed by [CONTACT_427] 
“Lost to follow-up” as a reason for study discontinuation must be documented by [CONTACT_153253], e -mails, text messages, numbers called, individuals spoken to if not 
subject, and documentation that 2 certified/registered letters were sent.

90 (231) that were received. The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last 
protocol- specified visit/assessment for the last subject in the study.  
A subject will be considered to have completed the double- blind treatment period if they were 
followed up until Week [ADDRESS_176772] 
was followed up until the end of the study (Week 112). 
3.9.[ADDRESS_176773]  
Discontinuation of IP does not necessari ly mean discontinuation of follow-up or termination 
of study participation. Subjects who are discontinued from the IP should be followed up to 
continue to undergo all study- related visits/procedures for the full treatment period ( Table 2) 
in order to support the final efficacy and safety analysis for anifrolumab (see Section 8).  
Subjects who discontinue IP earlier  than [ADDRESS_176774] as much data as possible for all subjects throughout the s tudy and 
especially all potential endpoint events. Complete withdrawal from the study (ie, withdrawal of consent) has a direct negative impact on the potential validity of all study data and should 
be avoided wherever possible. If the subject permanently discontinues IP prior to their 
completion of the study and wishes to continue with only selected study assessments; 
prioritised assessments are listed in Section 4.2.2. 
For subjects who wish to withdraw from the study completely refer to Section 3.9.4. If a subject  is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 
3.[ADDRESS_176775] the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Screen 
failure’( the potential subject  who does not meet one or more criteria required for part icipation

91 (231) in a trial, this reason for study withdrawal is only valid for not randomis ed subject s). For 
eligibility for re -screening of a subject refer to Section  4.1.1.  
3.11 Discontinuation of the study  
The study may be terminated at individual centres if the study procedures are not being 
performed according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or not recruiting . [COMPANY_008] may 
also terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study or in any other study with anifrolumab.  
The study may be stopped if, in the judgement of the Sponsor, study subjects are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that: 
• Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (see Section 3.9 for reasons for discontinuation of IP) or are otherwise considered significant 
• Are assessed as causally related to IP  
• Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests.

109 (231) 4.1 Screening/Enrolment  period 
At screening, subjects are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. Once the 
subject signs the ICF, they are considered enrolled in the study. Subjects who do not meet 
these criteria must not be randomised into the study. These subjects will be considered as screen failures (See Section  3.10).  
Screening procedures will be performed according to the Screening Study Plan ( Table 2), 
from Day [ADDRESS_176797] does not meet eligibility criteria on the basis of a laboratory value then the 
laboratory parameter m ay be repeated once within the screening period. 
On rare occasion an extension of the 30 day screening window may be  allowed if the re -
collection of the 24-hour UPCR or other required sample s is necessary or  if the results needed 
for randomisation are delayed.  Before the Week 0 (Day 1) visit, a notification from the study 
Sponsor/Designee Medical Monitor should be obtained, confirming that subject meets LN diagnosis related eligibility criteria. The details of eligibility confirmation process will be 
docum ented separately for the site (Site Manual), and for the study team (Eligibility Process).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_176798] fails screening for reason(s) which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may change 
to make the subject eligible, the subject may be re -screened one time. In this case, the subject 
will re -sign the informed consent document and all screening procedures will be performed 
except those assessments which may be still within the specified periods (eg, c hest X -ray, 
renal bi opsy, TB test). If a subject does not meet eligibility criteria on the basis of a laboratory 
value, then the laboratory parameter may be repeated once within the screening period; this will be re -testing so that re -screening is not required. If the subject fails screening twice, they 
may not undergo further screening for this study except on a case by [CONTACT_413], after 
discussion and approval from the Sponsor/Designee Medical Monitor. 
4.1.2 Medical history  
A complete medical history by [CONTACT_153255]. This will also 
include history of allergies and anaphylaxis, concomitant diseases, viral reactivation events, 
and previous manifestations of SLE. Various risk factors for atherosclerosis will be assessed 
as part of the demographics at  screening. On Day 1, the medical history will be reviewed and 
any changes since screening will be documented, if applicable.

parenteral corticosteroids; if these were discontinued, then reasons for discontinuation must be 
included. Any medications ongoing at the time of informed consent or received following 
signing the ICF are considered concomitant medications. Any non-prescription medications, eg, naturopathic or ayurvedic remedies ever used for SLE or for any other purpose should be 
documented, as well as continuing use of any non-prescription remedies not excluded from 
use during the study period. 
4.2 Treatment period  
Procedures during the t reatment period will be performed according to the Treatment Period 
Study Plan ( Table 2 and Table 4), from Week 0 (Day 1) to Week 104. The patien t-reported 
outcome assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_153256], and prior to the infusion, as disease assessments/clinical evaluations may confound the results.  
On Day 1, in addition to the eligibility confirmation by [CONTACT_153257]/Designee, the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153178], including Day 
1 assessments according to the Treatment Period Study Plan ( Table 2).  
Subjects confirmed to be eligible will be randomised.  
Subjects will have scheduled visits at 4 -week intervals to complete protocol- specified 
assessments and IP administration according to the Treatment Period Study Plan ( Table 2).  
The primary endpoint will be assessed at Week 52. For subjects who prematurely discontinue 
IP and are not willing to continue to participate in the study  refer to Section 3.9. 
The SLE Data Medical Review Team (Section  9.2.4) will perform an ongoing review of all 
SLE and LN data in conjunction with the relevant AE, concomitant medications and central laboratory data.  
For subjects who meet withdrawal criteria for worsening LN at Week 24 or later and for 
subjects not achieving CRR at Week 52, a second renal biopsy may be performed at the discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153179]. A separate consent is required for this second biopsy. 
4.2.1 Week 52 visit 
Study objectives will be assessed at Visit 14 (Week 52). A 24-hour UPCR must be performed 
to assess the primary endpoint. Investigational sites should contact [CONTACT_153258].

Subjects who agree to continue scheduled visits until Week 52 (if IP discontinued prior to 
Week 52) or Week 104 (if IP discontinued after Week 52): 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue IP (see Section 3.9) should have a 24-hour UPCR 
measurement within [ADDRESS_176803].  
Subjects who discontinue IP will be asked to return for all regular clinic visits. All study 
assessments will be performed if possible; however, at a minimum, the following assessments 
should be completed: 
• Lupus Serology tests (anti -dsDNA antibodies, C3, C4)

be asked about AEs/SAEs, lupus symptoms, and lupus medications. Steroid bursts will also be 
captured.  
Subjects who withdraw consent:  
If the subject indicates his/her intention to withdraw consent, attempts should be made to complete the Week 52 /discontinuation or Week 104/discontinuation visit as applica ble before 
the consent is withdrawn. However, no study procedures or data collection can occur after the subject withdraws consent.

medications an d AEs should be completed whenever a subject has an unscheduled visit. 
4.4 Follow -up period  
Procedures will be performed according to the Follow-up Period Study Plan ( Table 3 and 
Table 5).  
Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period (Week 52) but do not continue with 
IP treatment will have follow -up visits at Week [ADDRESS_176809] follow-up visits at Week 108 and Week 112. Subjects who 
discontinue the IP before Week 52 and are not continuing on the study schedule should 
complete the Week 52 procedures. Subjects who discontinue the IP between Week 52 and 
Week 104 and are not continuing on the study schedule should complete Week 104 procedures. All other early discontinuation subjects should be followed until Week 52 or 
Week 104 (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176810] dose of IP for subjects for whom IP was 
discontinued within 12 weeks prior to Week 52 or Week 104) (see Section 3.9).  
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The Investigator will ensure that all study assessment data are recorded in the eCRF and also 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of 
answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The Investigator will sign 
the completed eCRFs . A copy of the completed eCRF s will be archived at the study site.  
The Site Manual w ill include a description of specific procedures. All the assessments and 
laboratory tests (unless otherwise specified) will be done prior to administration of IP. 
5.1 Efficacy assessments  
Efficacy measurements will be made at the times indicated in the Study Pla n (for assessments 
to be performed at Screening and t reatment period, see Table 2 and Table 4, respectively,  and 
for those at Follow-up, see Table 3 and Table 5 ). 
The efficacy assessments based on laboratory tests include:  
• Urine protein to creatinine ratio: This consists of: 
− 24-hour UPCR : The 24-hour UPCR will be determined on a 24-hour 
UPCR  sample . 
This will be performed twice during the screening period, Weeks 0, 12, 24, 36, 52, 64, 76, 88, and 104 and at Early Discontinuation visit.

114 (231) During the screening period two samples will be required:  
• Screening sample at the start of the screening process, after the ICF is 
signed and  
• Stratification sample within 1 4 days prior to the expected day of 
randomisation. Without the results of the second (stratification) sample, 
subjects cannot be randomised. Turn-around time for results from central laboratory is up to [ADDRESS_176811] always be collected before the 
administration of IP . The sample collected at Week 0 (Day 1) will be the baseline sample 
which must be provided on Day [ADDRESS_176812] to store their urine sample, eg, a 
cool room or use a portable cooler with ice/ice pack. 
In case subject has a medical reason which would impact the validity of the assessment of 
proteinuria (eg, urinary tract infection, heavy menstruation), or the sample was not collected 
appropriately, the collection of the sample may be done/repeated as follows: 
• Screening samples: As soon as possible before the next scheduled sampling is due 
• Week 0: Prior to IP administration (which may require the Visit 1 to be 
postponed) 
• Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 64, 76, 88, and 104: Within 2 weeks of the actual date of visit when the collection was due and if applicable, before any change in SOC or concomitant medications is made (Week [ADDRESS_176813] be collected before second year extension period dosing) 
The 24-hour UPCR will be used only for the primary and secondary endpoints, the PRR, 
aCRR, graded CRR, and graded aCRR criteria at Week 52 and Week 104, the 24-hour UPCR and CRR at Week 104 and to determine withdrawal criteria at Weeks 12, 24 and 52.
 
• Spot UPCR: Spot UPCR will be performed at all visits and will be used 
for the ca lculation of SLEDAI- 2K and for the CRR and PRR 
classification , when evaluating time to achieve renal response modified to 
include OCS tapering requirement as well as for the CRR and PRR

115 (231) classification  for flare assessments. All assessments except as noted 
above for the 24-hour UPCR will be based on the spot UPCR. The 
change in proteinuria will also be assessed based on spot UPCR at Weeks 24, 52 and 104. The spot UPCR sample should be taken prior to 
administration of IP, on a clean catch urine sampling. The same urine 
sample can be used for spot UPCR and sediment analysis. 
• Urine sediment examination will be performed at all visits: Selected sites will perform local urinalysis including a microscopic examination. The microscopic examination must be assessed by  [CONTACT_21724], and can 
be assessed by [CONTACT_122840] a local laboratory. This data will be used for 
exploratory analyses. This will be in addition to the central laboratory 
urinalysis. 
• Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the MDRD formula calcul ated by [CONTACT_2237]. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
specifics.  
The efficacy assessments based on clinical evaluation include SLEDAI -2K (Section 5.1.2, 
Appendix F), PGA (Section 5.1.4), OCS reduction (Section 5.1.5), and SDI (Section 5.1.3). 
The assessments for quality of life and patient -reported outcomes are s ummarised in 
Section  5.3.1. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_176814] meet inclusion criterion number 6 and not meet exclusion criterion number 10. (Note: If renal biopsy is performed during the screening period, adequate 
time should be allowed before the next scheduled urine sample collection). 
Renal biopsy adjudication 
Biopsies will be evaluated locally and the local classification will be used to confirm the 
eligibility criteria. Screening biopsy s lides will then be submitted for adjudication by [CONTACT_153259]. 
The biopsies will be assessed for all elements of the ISN/RPS classification, the NIH activity, 
chronicity indices, and the presence of concomitant conditions. The submission of screening 
biopsies for adjudication is required to participate in the study. The process for adjudication will be defined in a separate document (Renal Biopsy Adjudication Charter). Data obtained 
during the adjudication will be used for exploratory and sensitivity analyses. 
A second renal biopsy is recommended for subjects who meet withdrawal criteria for 
worsening LN at Week 24 or later and for subjects not achieving CRR at Week 52. This 
biopsy will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator based on clinical indication and 
local practice. A separate consent is required for this second biopsy. Second biopsies will be

subject’s consent will be required prior to the biopsy slides being submitted for adjudication. 
5.1.2 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000  
The SLEDAI -2K index (see Appendix F ) consists of a list of organ manifestations, each with 
a definition. A certified Investigator or designated physician will complete the SLEDAI 2K 
assessment and decide whether each manifestation is “present” or “absent” in the last 30 days. 
The assessment also includes the co llection of whole blood for analysis of C3, and C4 
complement levels, and anti-dsDNA antibodies. 
The proteinuria descriptor should be scored using the spot UPCR.  
The SLEDAI -2K assessment consists of 24 lupus- related items. It is a weighted instrument, in 
which descriptors are multiplied by a particular organ’s “weight”. For example, renal 
descriptors are multiplied by 4 and central nervous descriptors by 8 and these weighted organ 
manifestations are totalled into the final score. The SLEDAI -2K score range is 0 to 105 points 
with 0 indicating inactive disease. The SLEDAI- 2K scores are valid, reliable, and sensitive 
clinical assessments of lupus disease activity. The SLEDAI -2K calculated using a timeframe 
of 30 days prior to a visit for clinical and laboratory values has been shown to be similar to the SLEDAI -2K with a 10-day window ( Touma et al, 2010). A timeframe of 30 days will be used 
in this study.  
Any missing SLEDAI -2K laboratory assessments should be repeated. 
5.1.3 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College 
Rheumatology damage index  
The SDI (Appendix N) has been developed to assess irreversible damage in SLE subjects 
independently of its cause (ie, included damage due to SLE activity, SLE- related scarring, 
therapy, comorbidities) but occurring after disease onset. Damage, ie, irreversible impairment 
since onset of SLE, is usually defined as a clinical feature that has to be continuously present 
for at least 6 months to score. In addition some irreversible events such as myocardial 
infarction or a cerebrovascular accident score as damage on their occurrence. Briefly, damage is defined for 12 organ systems; peripheral vascular, ocular, neuropsychiat ric, renal, 
pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, skin, endocrine (diabetes), gonadal, and malignancies. Damage over time can be stable or increase, theoretically to a maximum of 47 points ( Schwartz et al, 2009).  
5.1.4 Physician’s Global Assessment  
A trained and certified Investigator will complete the PGA. The PGA represents the physician’s overall assessment of average disease severity on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Anifrolumab   
Study Code D3461C00007 
Version 4.0  
Date  13 December 2017  
 
117 (231) scale with 0 (none) to 3 (severe) disease activity over the last [ADDRESS_176815] should be completed by [CONTACT_153261]. 
PGA may be completed after the visit, to allow for laboratory results  to be received, as long as 
this is done prior to the next scheduled visit. Therefore, the date of the associated scheduled 
visit (Week  0 etc.) will be used to determine baseline (and subsequent visits), and not the 
actual date of the assessment.  
The PGA i s a modification of the classic analogue scale in that it is anchored with numbers 
from [ADDRESS_176816] be a single line, nearly perpendicular to the axis of the VAS line and not an “X”. Any disease rated greater 
than 2.[ADDRESS_176817]’s lupus disease activity. It should not reflect non- lupus medical 
conditions. 
These instructions are quite discrete from those given f or other analogue (Likert) scales and 
are specific for the scoring of the PGA.  
5.1.5 Oral corticosteroid reduction  
Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for all information r egarding steroid tapering.  
5.2 Safety assessments  
Key safety assessments are AEs, AESIs, vital signs, physical examination, safety laboratory 
tests, ECGs, C -SSRS, PHQ -8, and SLEDAI-2K based Flare Assessment Instrument 
(Appendix M ). Safety assessments will be made at the times indicated in the Study Plan (see 
Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 , and Table 5).  
5.2.1 Adverse events  
Adverse events, SAEs, and AESIs are defined in S ections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, respectively.  
Recording of AEs is described in Section 6.5 and reporting of SAEs in Section 6.6.

Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be obtained 
at each visit. Specific information on vital signs surrounding the infusion is included in 
Section 7.2.4 (Subject Monitoring/Procedures During and After Infusions). Temperature should be measured by [CONTACT_153262] (eg, oral, tympanic) for a subject throughout 
the study. 
5.2.3 Physical examination 
Body height will be captured at screening only. Subjects will be weighed at each study visit. 
Medically significant changes from the Screening physical examination will be recorded as 
AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete physical examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at the visits specified in the Study Plan 
(Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5), and will include an assessment of the following: 
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, lungs heart, abdomen, joints, muscles and soft tissues, neurologic system, skin, and lymph nodes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Focused  physical examination 
The focused physical examination will include an assessment of the organ systems required to 
complete protocol- specified assessment tool (SLEDAI -2K). Additional assessments should be 
done as clinically indicated. Abnormal findings will be recorded as part of AE, SAE, AESI, or 
lupus activity, as appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pap smear  
Most cases of cervical cancer appear to be related to infection with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509]. 
Because of the potential for viral reactivation due to blockade of the interferon pathway, cervical dysplasia will be assessed in this study, although to date there has been no signal in 
the anifrolumab studies.  
Abnormal Pap smear results received anytime within the [ADDRESS_176818] eligibility. If a Pap smear performed within 2 years prior to 
signing the ICF was normal with no documented malignancy (eg, CIN III, CIS, or AIS), it 
does not need to be repeated. Subjects with abnormal Pap smear results of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_153181] (ASC -US), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_153182]- grade 
squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (HSIL) cannot be ruled out (ASC- H), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_138955] 
(AGC), or CIN grades I and II (CIN I and II) will be allowed to enter the study; please refe r to 
Appendix K for guidance.  
Female subjects with an intact cervix must have a Pap smear repeated between Week 48 and 
Week 52  and Week 100 and Week 104 to ensure that there is no evidence of new cervical 
dysplasia. If a Pap smear was performed between Week 48 and Week 52 and is not normal but

subject’s gynaecologist’s recommendations. If the subject’s gynaecologist has recommended a 
repeat Pap smear be performed at a specified interval, the Pap smear should be obtained as recommended and the report provided in the source document. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Cushingoid features  
Subjects will be assessed for Cushingoid features at the visits specified in the Treatment 
Period Stud y Plan ( Table  2 and Table 4). Features, such as moon face, buffalo hump, purple 
or violaceous striae, central obesity, hirsutism, acne, easy bruising, and fragile skin will be 
captured separately within the study eCRF to evaluate whether resolution of same can occur 
overtime with OCS reduction. 
5.2.4 Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG traci ng will be performed locally at the visits specified in the Study Plan 
(Table 2 and Table 4). The Investigator or qualified designee must review the ECG for 
clinically significant changes.  
5.2.5 Assessment of cardiovascular risk  
To understand the contribution of the chronic inflammatory response in SLE to dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_17939] 
(as a potential risk for accelerated subclinical arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease) and the 
potential effects of anifrolumab treatment, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (including high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]]) will be 
measured during the study. Current and previous concomitant medications received for 
cardiovascular indications and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes should be collected and recorded. Assessment of cardiovascular 
risk will be completed as indicated in the Study Plan ( Table 2 and Table 4 ).  
5.2.6 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a unique, simple, and short method of assessing both behaviour and ideation 
that track s all suicidal events, and provides a summary of suicidality ( Posner et al, 2007). It 
assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, 
controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide.  
The C -SSRS will be administered by a trained rater. The trained rater will record the clinical 
observation on the scale, which will be used as the source document. If at all possible, the 
same individual should perform the assessment at each visit to reduce scoring variability. In 
the event the primary rater is not available, a designated back -up rater who meets the same 
qualifica tions may perform the C-SSRS. If a subject indicates having a rating of type [ADDRESS_176819] should be referred to a mental health professional immediately. If

120 (231) the C -SSRS is administered by a rater other than the Investigator, it is recommended that the 
Investigator confirms suicidal ideation before making a referral to mental health services; 
however this should not delay the referral.  
5.2.7 Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale–8 
The PHQ -8 consists of eight of the nine criteria on which the DSM-IV diagnosis of depressive 
disorders is based ( American Psychiatric Association, 1994). It assesses symptoms of 
depression over the last [ADDRESS_176820] and scored by [CONTACT_153263] -up Study Plans ( Table 2 and 
Table 3). In addition to the [ADDRESS_176821]’s level of functioning.

5.2.9 Tuberculosis screening and monitoring  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening evaluation  
A blood test for TB will be done at screening using QFT -G. This is an interferon- gamma 
release assay (IGRAs) test. Evaluation of all subjects by [CONTACT_153265] -G test (to be performed by [CONTACT_153266]) and chest X -rays must be completed prior to randomisation. Refer

121 (231) Section 3.1, inclusion criteria 16 (d) (iii) and (e). If an adequate (posterior- anterior or 
anterior -posterior and lateral posterior- anterior, unless limited by [CONTACT_53246]) chest X -ray 
has been performed within 12 weeks prior to signing the ICF, it does not need to be repeated 
at the screening visit.  
Compared to culture confirmed TB, overall, 87.6% of subjects have a positive QFT -G result 
(Cellestis, 2005). The false negative rate in this setting appears to be over 12%. Further, the 
performance of the test in the setting of immunosuppressant drugs has not been evaluated. Nor 
has it been evaluated in ind ividuals with medical conditions other than, or in addition to, latent 
TB or TB disease. The guide also states that “Medical treatments or conditions that impair 
immune functions can potentially reduce IFN- γ responses and prevent detection of a specific 
response to the (secretory proteins) ESAT-6 and CFP- 10 (the test stimulators)”.  
Given the population to be enrolled in the LN study, false negative tests are possible, so a chest X -ray, posterior-anterior or posterior- anterior and lateral views is a relevant  technique 
and warranted technique (unless limited by [CONTACT_53246]) for detecting active pulmonary disease and minimising potential risk to study subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis results from screening evaluations  
• If the screening QFT -G test is negative and there is no known history of 
recent exposure to individuals with active TB, and chest radiograph 
shows no evidence of active TB, the subject may be randomised without 
prophylaxis. 
• If the screening QFT -G test is newly positive* and the chest radiograph 
shows no evidence of active TB, and the subject has no symptoms or medical history consistent with active TB, treatment for latent TB must 
be initiated prior to the first IP administration and the subject must 
commit to completing the full duration of prophylaxis, which may mean 
completing prophylaxis during the study. Subjects may be re- screened if 
necessary to allow for local guidelines on latent TB treatment initiation.  
*Note: Newly positive can be a positive result after a previous indeterminate or negative result.  
• If the QFT -G test is positive at screening but the subject is not newly 
positive , the subject may be randomised if: 
− Previous or current active TB infection was ruled out and  
− The subject was previously diagnosed with latent TB and has 
documentation conf irming completion of appropriate latent TB 
infection treatment or

122 (231) − The subject was previously diagnosed with latent TB and is currently 
receiving prophylactic treatment for latent TB and commits to completing the full duration of prophylaxis 
• If the screenin g QFT -G test is indeterminate, the test must be repeated at 
least one time by [CONTACT_153267]. The subject 
may be randomised if: 
− If the QFT -G test result remains indeterminate or becomes negative 
and 
− The chest radiograph shows no evidence of active TB and  
− There are no signs or symptoms of active TB and 
− There is no known recent close contact [CONTACT_153268] 
− There is no history of latent TB (unless diagnosed with documentation of completion of appropriate treatment) o r active TB  
Additionally, an expert specialising in TB may be consulted prior to randomisation, if deemed 
necessary in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], after discussion with the Sponsor/Designee Medical Monitor. If the subject is randomised, additional QFT- G testing will be performed 
according to the Study Plan ( Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis monitoring during the study  
If, during the study, a subject who had an indeterminate TB result at screening is determined to have a:  
• Positive QFT -G test result, confirm positive QFT -G on another blood 
sample and then the subject should be referred to a TB specialist. If a TB 
specialist is not available, the local country guid elines should be followed 
for further diagnostic work up and anti- TB treatment regimens. If no 
local guidelines exist for immunocompromised individuals, then CDC guidelines may be followed. This should also be reported as an AESI. 
Once latent TB is confirm ed, treatment must be instituted immediately 
and no IP may be administered until treatment of latent TB has begun  
• Negative QFT -G test result, then the subject does not need to continue 
TB testing outlined for subjects with indeterminate results at screenin g

124 (231) Tuberculosis questionnaire  
To aid in the early detection of new or reactivated TB, a TB questionnaire will be used to 
evaluate subjects for signs and symptoms of TB at every visit prior to receiving IP. If the 
evaluation raises suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a subject may have new or reactivated TB, an immediate and 
thorough investigation should be undertaken including, where possible, consultation with 
experts specialising in TB.  
Invest igators should be aware that TB in immunocompromised subjects may present as 
disseminated disease or with extra -pulmonary features and should be referred for appropriate 
treatment.  
5.2.10 Safety laboratory tests 
The following are the laboratory -based safety asse ssments: 
• Screening laboratory tests  
• Haematology  
• Serum chemistry  
• Lipid profile 
• Urine analysis  
• Pregnancy tests  
A Laboratory Manual will be provided to the sites that specifies the procedures for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of samples, as well as laboratory contact [CONTACT_3031], specific to this clinical research study.  
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed in a central clinical laboratory at the times indicated in the Study Plan ( Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 ).  
A serum pregnancy test (or serum FSH in post- menopausal females with menses absent for 
≥1 year) will be performed at screening at the central laboratory. If the result of the serum β 
hCG test is borderline or thought to be false positive the test can be repeated during the screening. The subject can continue if the repeat test is negative. At every visit after screening, 
urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site using a dipstick. During the treatment 
period, urine pregnancy tests should be performed at each visit before administering the IP 
and Sponsor-provided MMF. Abnormal safety laboratory results should be repeated as 
clinically indicated, as soon as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours).

compared with 3 reference genes; 18S, ACTB and GAPDH. The result is expressed as a score that is compared with a pre -established cut -off to classify subjects into 2 groups: low or high 
levels of IFN -inducible gene expression. The results of the test will not be used to determine 
eligibility and will not be shared with the investigative site (ie, all site personnel will remain blinded to IFN test results). 
5.7.5 Tissue biomarkers: immunostaining, epi[INVESTIGATOR_153186] (optional) 
These tests are in addition to the standard evaluation of renal biopsies and require a separate 
ICF. These studies will be done from existing clinical biopsy material (eg, fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue tissue). The studies will be limited to gain better understanding about the 
pathogenesis and the role of IFN in LN. A variety of techniques may be used, such as immunostaining for various inflammatory markers and gene expression and epi[CONTACT_151291]. Th e results from these investigations will not be reported in the CSR but in separate

causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre- existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run- in, treatment, 
washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153189]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity .  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject  or may 
require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol. 
If a subject decides to have surgery to correct a pre-study condition that has not worsened 
since the ICF was signed or the surgery was planned before the ICF was signed, then the

condition worsens and surgery is required, then the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153191]. 
6.3 Hy’s Law  
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law. 
6.[ADDRESS_176839] 
An AESI is one of scientific and medical concern specific to understanding biologics and requires close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_153192]/Sponsor’s delegate. An AESI may be serious or nonserious.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest will be assessed at each visit in the eCRF. The events of 
interest are serious infections, including non-opportunistic serious infections, opportunistic 
infections, anaphylaxis, malignancy, herpes zoster, TB (including latent TB), influenza, 
vasculitis (non-SLE), and MACE (including stroke, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death). 
An AESI that meets one of the seriousness outcomes listed in Section 6.[ADDRESS_176840]. Opportunistic infections are categorised as serious and reported as an SAE.  
Examples of opportunistic infec tions that may occur in SLE subjects include: Herpes zoster 
meningoencephalitis, Salmonella bacteremia, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia or progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

safety profile of this IP, including assessment of how anifrolumab may affect resistance to 
different types of infections, Investigators are asked to undertake appropriate microbiologic identification including culture and report culture results for all subjects who develop serious infections.

symposium convened by [CONTACT_153271] ( Sampson et al, 2006).  
6.4.4 Malignancy 
Malignancy is a neoplasm characterised by [CONTACT_153272], uncontrolled rapid 
growth with invasive and/or metastatic tendencies diagnosed based on pathologic and clinical 
standards. Understanding risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_153193] -risk profile for anifro lumab. Investigators are therefore requested to obtain biopsy 
results and have pertinent biomarker and/or genetic testing results performed and to report 
these for any malignancies reported during the study.  
6.4.5 Herpes zoster  
Herpes zoster is a viral infection  characterised by a cutaneous vesicular eruption on an 
erythematous base presenting along dermatome(s) and usually associated with prodromal pain. Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of Varicella zoster  virus; multiple 
dermatomes may be involved (> 3 indicates disseminated disease) and organ or systemic 
infection may occur (invasive; therefore an opportunistic infection). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of samples from vesicles , biopsy or other specimens (eg, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_13858]) may confirm the presence of Varicella zoster  virus. 
For additional information regarding herpes zoster, refer to the Investigator Brochure. As this is an AESI, the Sponsor will collect information including whether or not subjects have 
received vaccination for herpes zoster. The herpes zoster vaccine will be captured in the 
appropriate sections of the CRF.

136 (231) (IFN -γ release assay), radiographic imaging, body fluid and tissue sampling; presentation may 
include disseminated or latent disease. An infection may be new (at least conversion of a TB 
test to positive) or reactivation of do rmant disease (new active disease in a previously TB test 
positive subject without prior evidence of active disease). 
• A bacteriologically confirmed TB  case is one from whom a biological 
specimen is positive by [CONTACT_153273], culture or rapid diagnostic such as PCR or nucleic acid amplification test (Xpert MTB/RIF).  
• A clinically diagnosed TB  case is one who does not fulfil the criteria for 
bacteriological confirmation, but has been diagnosed with active TB by a clinician or other medical practitioner who has decided to give the subject 
a full course of TB treatment. This definition includes cases diagnosed on 
the basis of X-ray abnormalities or suggestive histology and extra-pulmonary cases without laboratory confirmation. Clinically diagnosed 
cases subseq uently found to be bacteriologically positive (before or after 
starting treatment) should be reclassified as bacteriologically confirmed.  
Bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed cases of TB are also classified according to: anatomical site of disease; history of previous treatment; drug resistance; and HIV status 
(World Health Organisation, 2014).  
Latent TB  is a mycobacterial infection without clinical, bacteriological findings, or radiologic 
findings consistent with active TB and a TB blood test such as an IGRA (QuantiFERON- TB 
Gold) or purified protein derivative skin test that is positive both at the time of provisional diagnosis and on repeat assessment.  
Subjects identified with latent TB will be assessed by a local TB specialist to confirm the 
diagnosis and local SOC that will be used in treatment. If no local guidelines exist for immunocompromised individuals, then CDC guidelines may be followed. Once latent TB is 
confirmed, treatment must be instituted immediately and no IP may be administered until 
treatment of latent TB has begun. Additionally, subjects with newly diagnosed latent TB must 
agree to com plete a locally recommended course of treatment for latent TB in order to 
continue receiving the IP. 
6.4.7 Influenza  
Influenza is a severe viral infection that includes the following symptoms: temperature greater than 100.8°F (38.2°C), and malaise, headache, or myalgia. It is often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], 
vomiting, and diarrhoea, and at least one of the following respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]: cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath. 
Laboratory criteria for influenza include at least one of the following: isolation of influenza 
virus from a clinical specimen, detection of influenza virus nucleic acid in a clinical specimen,

Date  13 December 2017  
 
137 (231) identification of influenza virus antigen by [CONTACT_153274] a clinical 
specimen, or influenza-specific antibody response. 
A conf irmed case of influenza meets the clinical and laboratory criteria for the viral illness. 
Laboratory confirmation should be done using locally available, rapid, commercial tests 
approved by [CONTACT_153275][INVESTIGATOR_153194].  
Not all u pper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153195]. In 
the case where a subject reports a viral infection severe enough to be considered, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], influenza, a viral test should be performed (if possible) to confirm 
the diagnosis. Whether or not a test to confirm the diagnosis has been performed, if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject has had influenza (the specific viral infection), this 
should be reported as an AESI. If the subject has had a viral infection that is less severe, then 
this should be reported as an AE only. 
6.4.8 Vasculitis (non -systemic lupus erythematosus)  
Vasculitis (non -SLE) is defined as an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels involving 
arteries and/or veins and characterised by [CONTACT_153276]/symptoms and 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_9256], imaging such as angiography or blood tests such as findings of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies consistent with the diagnosis. Underlying causes should be 
identified, such as medications including investigational drug, infections or systemic 
inflammatory syndromes, wherever possible. See Appendix G for a list of vasculitic syndromes excluded from the study.  
6.4.9 Major acute cardiovascular events  
As a measure of enhanced Pharmacovig ilance, an independent Cardiovascular Event 
Adjudication Committee (CV -EAC) will review deaths (due to any cause) and all SAEs in 
both the Cardiac and Vascular MedDRA System Organ Classes and all SAEs in the Central 
Nervous System Vascular Disorders Standard Medical Query for evaluation. The CV- EAC 
chair may adjudicate some events that do not fall into the above categories. 
The CV -EAC will review cases of interest to determine if they meet accepted diagnostic 
criteria. Causality assessments will not be made  by [CONTACT_153277]- EAC, nor will the committee 
possess governance authority. The CV-EAC will be blinded regarding any information 
relating to the randomisation group.

the study or until the outcome of pregnancy is known (whichever is later). 
6.5.[ADDRESS_176845]’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_153278]. The Sponsor retains the right to request 
additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if 
judged necessary.  
6.5.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped. For infusion- related AEs, in 
addition to date, time when the AE started and stopped must be collected  
• Maximum intensity  
• Whether the AE is serio us or not 
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to IP 
• Outcome of AE  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Onset Date (Date AE met criteria for serious AE)  
• Detection Date (Date Investigator became aware of serious AE)  
• AE is serious due to: 
(a) Death  
− Date of death  
− Autopsy performed  
− Primary/secondary cause of death

(e) Important medical event  
• Description of AE 
• Investigator causality assessment to concomitant medications  
• Investigator causality assessment to study procedures (yes or no) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_153279] 6.2. An SAE is an 
AE that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153189]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it mee ts the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Anifrolumab   
Study Code D3461C00007 
Version 4.0  
Date  13 December 2017  
 
140 (231) shown in Section 6.2. The Investigator should provide an assessment of the severity of each 
AE/SAE.  
6.5.4 Causality collection 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’ 
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for any other medication and study 
procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A. 
6.5.[ADDRESS_176846] or care provider or reported in response to the 
open question from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by [CONTACT_129158]. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to 
recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are 
other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
6.5.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests  
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the 
CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol mandated laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, and other safety assessments should therefore only be reported as AEs if they 
fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP. 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator will 
use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-mandated parameters  should be reported as AE(s). 
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE (or SAE, as appropriate).

141 (231) 6.5.7 Disease progression /worsening of systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus 
nephritis  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributabl e to 
SLE or LN. It may be an increase in the activity or severity of the existing manifestations of 
LN or SLE or the appearance of new manifestations. Disease progression should not be reported as an AE unless it fulfils criteria for SAE (please see Sectio n 6.2 for definition of 
SAE). However, worsening of SLE or LN will be recorded in the disease assessment tools (SLEDAI -2K, PGA and PtGA).  
6.[ADDRESS_176847] to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. All safety forms and supportive documentation include laboratory tests, imaging reports, diagnostic test results, biopsy reports, and discharge summaries is to be sent to the Sponsor’s delegate Medical Services.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it.  
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site or designee within 1 business day  of initial receipt for all SAEs.  
For fatal or  life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel should inform [COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow -up information on a previously reported SAE 
immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the DataLabs system, an automated e- mail alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.  
If the DataLabs system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel reports the SAE to the Sponsor’s delegate Medical Services on the study specific paper SAE form by [CONTACT_756], FAX, or e- mail. The SAE report form must be completed in the electronic 
system as soon as the system is available again.  
SAE information should be sent to the S ponsor’s delegate Medical Services.  
The Sponsor’s delegate Medical Services, on behalf of [COMPANY_008], is responsible for 
reporting certain SAEs as e xpedited safety reports to applicable regulatory authorities, Ethics 
Committees (ECs), and participating Investigators, in accordance with International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements. 
Sponsor/Designee may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7

submit additional information requested by [CONTACT_2728]/Sponsor’s delegate as soon as it become s 
available.  
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s Brochure.  
6.[ADDRESS_176848] will be assessed by [CONTACT_153280], 
relationship  to the IP, possible aetiologies, and whether the event also meets criteria of an 
SAE. All AESIs (serious or nonserious) will be recorded on the AE CRF (using a recognised medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event).  
The reporting period for AESIs is the period immediately following the time that written 
informed consent is obtained through the end of subject participation in the study. All serious 
AESIs and nonserious AESIs are required to be reported within 24 hours and 72 hours of knowl edge of the event, respectively, to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative.  
6.8 Overdose  
• An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose CRF module. 
• An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module. 
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_176849] occur within 30 days. 
6.9 Pregnancy  
All pregnancies occurring du ring the subjects' participation in the study and the outcomes of 
pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_008] or designee. In addition, if Investigators become 
aware of pregnancies occurring after the subject's participation in the study ended they should report them to [COMPANY_008] or designee in the following cases:

randomisation until [ADDRESS_176850] dose of Sponsor-provided MMF administration (whicheve r is 
later).  
• Male subject: Any conception of female partner of the subject that occurs from the date randomisation until [ADDRESS_176851] dose of Sponsor-provided MMF administration (whichever is later). Informa tion on the pregnancy of a subject's partner 
must be obtained directly from the subject's partner. Therefore, prior to 
obtaining information about the pregnancy, the Investigator must obtain 
the consent of the subject's partner. 
The outcome of any conception should be followed up and documented on the pregnancy 
outcome form and reported within 1 day (no later than 24 hours) of when the Investigator 
becomes aware of it.  
6.9.[ADDRESS_176852] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth de fects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth  or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the subject 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives or designee within 1 day, ie, immediately 
but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it.  
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153196] 1 or 5  calendar days for SAEs  (see Section 6.6) and within [ADDRESS_176853] who becomes pregnant during the course of the study will be followed up until 
the outcome of pregnancy is known so that the pregnancy outcome can be determined and reported to [COMPANY_008] or designee and the regulatory authorities.

Medication error includes situations where an error.  
• occurred  
• was identified and intercepted before the subject received the drug  
• did not occur, but circumstances were recogni sed that could have led to an error 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
• Drug name [CONTACT_2976] 
• Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given 
to the subject  
• Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration  
• Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be take n as a 
solid tablet  
• Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature  
• Wrong subject  received the medication (excluding IVRS /IWRS  errors)  
• Wrong drug administered to subject  (excluding IVRS /IWRS  errors)  
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:

Drug Substance Anifrolumab   
Study Code D3461C00007 
Version 4.0  
Date  13 December 2017  
 
145 (231) • Errors related to or resulting from IVRS/IWRS - including those which lead to one of 
the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error  
• Subject  accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication  
• Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)  
• Subject  failed to return unused medication or empty packaging 
• Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in 
open-label studies, even if an AZ product  
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.   
If an medication error occurs  in the course of the study, then the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153197] 1  day ie, 
immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153198] 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE 
associated with the medication error (see Section  6.6) and within [ADDRESS_176856] to administer prophylactically an antihistamine and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol for the comfort and safety of the subject prior to subsequent 
infusions. Prophylactic use of glucocorticosteroids prior to subsequent infusions is not 
permitted.  
6.11.2 Infections  
When an infection is reported as an SAE or AESI, cultures should be obtained and culture 
results should be reported with the event. Other specific laboratory or other investigations (eg, 
chest X -ray for pneumonia) that confirm or aid in the diagnosis or treatment should be

Drug Substance Anifrolumab   
Study Code D3461C00007 
Version 4.0  
Date  13 December 2017  
 
146 (231) obtained when indicated and results should be reported with the SAE or AESI. Failure to 
obtain this information will impair the Spons or’s ability to characterise the benefit -risk profile 
of anifrolumab. 
Subjects who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with IP should receive 
appropriate medical therapy, as determined by [CONTACT_104130], and be monitored closely until 
the condition resolves. IP should not be administered to a subject with a clinically significant, 
active infection as determined by [CONTACT_737] (see Section 3.8). For any active infection 
(eg, V aricella zoster  infection/chickenpox) or significant exposure to any infection (eg, 
Varicella zoster  infection in a naive subject, bacterial pneumonia), the Investigator should 
consider whether to interrupt IP administration, and should notify the Sponsor/Designee 
Medical Monitor.  
Similarly, if a subject presents with signs or symptoms where opportunistic infections are 
considered (eg, Central nervous system symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy or herpes encephalitis, or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_153199]), IP should be interrupted until the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153200]. 
If dosing is resumed after resolution of a safety concern (ie, infection or other AE) the IP must 
be administered within 14 days of the scheduled time of the missed dose. If this is not 
possible, dosing should be resumed at the time of the next scheduled dose. 
6.11.3 MMF -related warnings and precautions  
During the screening period while discussing informed consent, potential study subjects 
should be informed on the risks of using MMF based on the local prescribing information. The risks of using MMF include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Embryofoetal toxicity/teratogenic potential: Exposure to MMF dur ing 
pregnancy is associated with increased first -trimester foetal loss and 
increased risk of congenital malformation. MMF should not be used in lactating females. Due to the risk of male to female transfer of MMF and 
metabolites in seminal fluid, all male subjects treated with MMF should 
use condoms. Please refer to Section 3.1 for additional information on contraception requirements for this study. 
• Serious infection: The use of immunosuppression, including MMF, is associated with increased risk of infectio n with bacterial, viral, protozoal, 
fungal, reactivated viral and/or opportunistic infections. Infections may result in sepsis and may be fatal.  
• Malignancy: The use of immunosuppression, including MMF, alone or in 
combination, poses an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_153201], especially of the skin.

147 (231) • Haematologic abnormalities: Neutropenia may be associated with MMF. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia have been reported with MMF in combination with other immunosuppression. 
• Gastrointestinal: MMF has been associated with infrequent cases of gastrointestinal ulceration, haemorrhage, pancreatitis, and perforation.

149 (231) • IP must be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_83750] a peripheral vein. A physician must be present at 
the site or immediately available to respond to emergencies during all 
administrations of IP. 
• Because compatibility of anifrolumab with IV medications and solutions 
other than 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, (US Pharmacopeia), is not 
known, the IP solution should not be infused through an IV line in which 
other solutions or medications are being administered. 
• IP will be administered as an IV infusion via an infusion pump over no 
less than [ADDRESS_176863] 3 doses (Visits 1, 2, and 3). Starting with Visit 4, IP can be administered as an IV infusion via an infusion pump 
over no less than 30 minutes.  
• Immediately following the completion of IP dosing, up to an additional 
25 mL of saline will be given via infusion pump at the same pump speed utilised at the completion of the IP dosing. 
• An emergency cart should be available in the infusion suite. See 
Appendix L. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_176864] monitoring/procedures during and after the infusion  
Subjects will be monitored during the administration of the IP and for at least [ADDRESS_176865] 3 infusions (Weeks 0, 4, and 8). If there are no safety concerns, for subsequent infusions 
subjects will be monitored during administration of the IP and for a minimum of one hour 
after completion of the IV infusion thereafter (Week 12 to Week 100).  
Monitoring will include vital signs (temperature, BP, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) in a sitting 
position at the following times:  
• Shortly before the IV infusion (up to 20 minutes before the IP infusion starts ) 
• Every 15±5 minutes during infusion 
• Immediately after completion of administration of IP, including post-dose 
saline flush (within [ADDRESS_176866]-dose saline flush) 
• Every 30±5 minutes after completion of IP infusion (not including saline 
flush) fo r at least [ADDRESS_176867] 3 doses (Week 0 
[Day 1] to Week 8) and for at least 1 hour, thereafter (Week 12 to Week 100)

150 (231) • Samples for PK laboratory assessments should be collected 15±5 minutes 
after completion of IP infusion (not including saline flush) after dosing 
on Week 0 (Day 1) and Week [ADDRESS_176868] should only be discharged from the site after the minimum monitoring period and 
when judged stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]/designee. Blood pressure and pulse rate 
will be taken prior to discharge from the site.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_176869] administration 
Both the duration of the IP infusion and the duration of IP administratio n will be recorded. 
The duration of IP infusion and duration of IP administration will be calculated as follows: 
• Duration of infusion: the amount of time elapsed from the infusion start 
time to the infusion stop time. Infusion start time is defined as the time 
point where IP is first infused into the subject. Infusion stop time is 
defined as the time point where the infusion pump completes infusion of 
the IP, not including the saline flush. 
For example: an infusion with a start time of 12:[ADDRESS_176870] an 
infusion duration recorded as 30 minutes (the time between 12:00 PM 
and 12:30 PM). 
• Duration of administration: the amount of time elapsed from the infusion pump start time to the infusion pump stop time PLUS the time required to 
complete the additional f lush of saline. The duration of administration 
will always be greater than the duration of infusion and will always include the additional flush of saline.

Date  13 December 2017  
 
155 (231) The target dose of MMF will be 2 gm/day during the 52 week double-blind treatment period, 
where the dose is titrated to the target dose between randomisation and Week 8. Adjustments 
of the dose due to suboptimal response, toxicity, or intolerability are allowed if needed according to guidelines described below. A maximum dose of 3.0 gm/day is allowed up to 
Week 24 for subjects with suboptimal response between Weeks 8 and 24, and needs to be 
reduced to ≤2.0 gm/day by [CONTACT_10585] 32. The dose of MMF has to be stable from Week [ADDRESS_176874] to receive 2 gm/day of MMF if local treatment standards 
dictate a lower dose to be given (eg, for constitutionally small subjects). During the 52 week double-blind treatment period, the minimum dose of MMF is 1.0 gm/day between Week 8 and 
Week 52. Subjects who do not tolerate the minimum MMF dose will be considered non-
responders for responder analyses (such as CRR), but will be allowed to continue to r eceive 
investigational product. 
In the second year extension period, MMF dose should be ≤2 gm/day or ≤Week 52 dose, 
whichever is lower. If MMF dose >2 gm/day at Week 52, taper to ≤2 gm/day will be required by [CONTACT_10585] 60. Failure to do so will lead to withdrawal from IP. A decrease in MMF dose is 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion between Week [ADDRESS_176875] be stable from Week 92 to Week 104. 
During the second year extension period there is no minimum dose requirement for MMF. 
However, if MMF is discontinued and a different immunosuppressant is started at any time 
during the study, IP will be discontinued. A decrease below the minimum dose or withholding 
MMF for 14 days or less for MMF -related side effects, such as gastrointestinal side effects, 
cytopenias or infection is acceptable at any time throughout the study. (If during the [ADDRESS_176876] will be considered a non-responder for responder analyses 
(such as CRR), but may continue to receive IP. This will not be considered as non- compliance 
or protocol deviation, because the withdrawa l of MMF is for safety reasons).  
Subject with premature discontinuation of IP will continue to receive Sponsor-provided MMF 
(unless subject is pregnant) at the investigator’s discretion until subject’s participation ends. 
Initial adjustment of MMF dose to achieve or maintain the target dose (Randomisation 
through Week 8) 
• Subjects who are receiving MMF at a dose of 2 gm/day at Week 0 (Day  1) will continue this dose 
• Subjects who are not taking MMF at Week 0 (Day 1), or subjects who are taking less than 2 gm/d ay, the dose will be titrated up with the goal of 
achieving a dose of 2 gm/day (or the therapeutic target dose if local

156 (231) treatment standards dictate a lower dose) by [CONTACT_10585] 2 (but not later than 
Week 8, if dose escalation is limited by [CONTACT_153283]).  
Titra tion of MMF should follow accepted local practice guidelines, 
including appropriate laboratory monitoring for toxicity. 
• Subjects, who at Week 0 (Day 1) are taking MMF doses >2 gm/day will have their dose reduced to 2 gm/day by [CONTACT_10585] 8 unless they meet crite ria 
for suboptimal response (see below for suboptimal response) 
MMF dose between Week 8 and 24  
The dose of MMF will be kept stable from Week 8 through Week 24 unless dose escalation to 
a maximum of 3 gm/day is necessary for suboptimal response (defined below) or a dose reduction is necessary to manage toxicity or intolerability.  
Criteria for suboptimal response:  
A suboptimal response is defined by [CONTACT_153284] 2 weeks apart:  
• Spot UPCR >3 mg/mg and  
• Spot UPCR <15% decrease compared to baseline spot UPCR  
If a subject meets the criteria at or after Week 8, the dose may be escalated or kept above 2 
gm/day. After initial confirmation of suboptimal response, MMF can be increased up to 3 
gm/day until Week [ADDRESS_176877] be kept stable from Week 16 unless suboptimal response criteria are met or dose 
reduction is necessary for intolerability or MMF- related AEs. A temporary decrease below the 
minimum dose, or withholding MMF for 14 days or less, for MMF- related side effects, such 
as gastrointestinal side effects, for cytopenias or infection is acceptable.  
Mycophenolate mofetil dose between Week 24 and Week 52:  
For subjects who are taking >2 gm/day of MMF at Week 24, the dose of MMF must be 
decreased to a maximum dose of 2 gm/day by [CONTACT_10585] 32. The dose can be decreased below 2 
gm/day after Week [ADDRESS_176878] be stable from Week 40 through Week 52 (unless a dose reduction is necessary to 
manage toxicity or intolerability).  
MMF dose from Week 52 to Week 104: 
For subjects who continue in the second year extension the target dose of MMF will be 
≤2 gm/day or ≤Week 52 dose, whichever is lower. I f the MMF dose is >2 gm/day at Week  52,

157 (231) it must be tapered to ≤2 gm/day by [CONTACT_10585] 60. Failure to achieve MMF dose ≤2 gm/day by 
[CONTACT_10585] 60 will lead to discontinuation from IP. A decrease in MMF dose or discontinuation of 
MMF is allowed at the investigator’s dis cretion between Week 52 to Week 92. If the MMF 
dose is decreased during the extension period, return to an MMF dose of ≤2 gm/day but not exceeding the Week [ADDRESS_176879] not be changed from Week 92 to Week 104.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Corticosteroids  
Initial corticosteroid treatment to control LN and SLE:  
Subjects may enter the study taking daily OCS at a maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone-equivalent not to exceed 40 mg/day. In addition, subjects will receive IV (or oral, if applicable) methylpredniso lone pulse 500 mg on the day of randomisation, prior to 
receiving the IP, unless they received a methylprednisolone pulse of ≥500 mg within 10 days 
prior to randomisation. Subjects may also receive one additional (optional) dose of IV (or oral, if applicab le) methylprednisolone pulse (≤500 mg) for renal or extra -renal disease activity 
after the Week 0 (Day 1) visit up to and including the Week [ADDRESS_176880] not exceed 500 mg.  
Steroid tapering during the 52 week double -blind treatment period:  
Oral corticosteroid dose tapering is required during the study with the goal of tapering OCS to prednisone- equivalent of ≤10 mg/day by [CONTACT_10585] 12 and prednisone -equivale nt of ≤7.5 mg/day 
by [CONTACT_10585] 24. The rate of tapering is at the discretion of the Investigator; a recommended tapering schedule is provided in Appendix O . If subjects experience an increase in SLE 
disease activity upon tapering of OCS their dose may be return ed to a dose equal or less as the 
dose prior to the taper. The return to the pre-taper dose will not be considered an OCS “burst and taper”. The pre-taper dose for various periods is defined as follows: 
• Week 0 to Week 12: dose at randomisation 
• After Week 12 to Week 24: the Week 12 dose 
• After Week 24 to Week 40: the Week 24 dose 
Subjects unable to taper OCS to ≤15 mg/day at Week 12 or <15 mg/day at Week 24 will be discontinued from IP treatment. However, subjects who exceed the maximum daily OCS dose 
at the  Week 12 or Week 24 visits may continue to receive IP if the current dose is part of a 
protocol- allowed  temporary OCS dose (eg, burst and taper) increase. Subjects who cannot be 
returned to their pre-increase dose within [ADDRESS_176881] their IP 
discontinued at the next visit.

158 (231) The subjects discontinued from IP treatment will be followed until Week 52 (or for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_176882] dose of IP for subjects for whom IP was discontinued within 
12 weeks prior to Week 52). 
Investigators will not be required, but may continue, to taper OCS dose beyond the target of 
7.5 mg/day up to Week 40. Steroid tapering will not be permitted from Week 40 to Week 52.  
Steroid “burst and taper”  
A steroid burst is defined as one of the following:  
Oral corticosteroid increase up to a maximum daily dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (maximum 
40 mg/day) prednisone-equivalent dose for up to a total of [ADDRESS_176883] year 
(starting after Week 0) and Week 92 during the second year extension period (starting after Week 52), regardless of when the course was started. 
OR 
A maximum of 1 instance of intra-articular, tendon sheath or bursal injections (for a total 
methylprednisolone ≤80 mg or equivalent) can be given. Subjects who receive any 
intra-articular/tendon sheath/bursal injections should not receive OCS burst (and vice versa).  
Steroid burst is allowed as follows: 
• From randomisation to Week 40: One burst and taper of corticosteroids for increased SLE disease activity or for non -SLE activity is allowed.  
Subjects who receive more than one steroid “burst and taper” or who 
violate the above criterion may continue to receive IP after approval by 
[CONTACT_2728]/Designee Medical Monitor, but will be considered non-
responders for subsequent responder analyses (such as CRR), regardless 
of whether the OCS “burst” was administered for increased SLE activity or non- SLE causes.  
• Increase in corticosteroids from Week 40 to Week 52 : No increase in 
OCS, or the use of IV or intra-articular, tendon sheath or bursal injections 
is allowed from Week 40 until Week 52 assessment.

159 (231) Corticosteroid dose fro m Week 52 to Week 100 
• If the OCS dose is >7.5 mg/day at Week 52, tapering to ≤7.5 mg/day is 
required by [CONTACT_10585] 60. Failure to achieve ≤7.5 mg/day by [CONTACT_10585] 60 will 
lead to discontinuation from IP. 
• OCS dose must be tapered to ≤5 mg/day at Week 80. OCS tapering 
below 5 mg/day is allowed at any time until Week 92.  
• No change in OCS dose will be allowed from Week 92 to Week 104.  
• One burst and taper will be allowed between Week 52 and Week 92. 
Increase in corticosteroids for the prevention of adrenal insufficiency  
For a severe illness, surgery, or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, if clinically warranted, the following can be used, in addition to the “burst and taper” described above: 
• Oral or IV hydrocortisone up to [ADDRESS_176884] day followed by [CONTACT_153285] 2 days before returning to their usual dose 
or 
• Subjects who are taking ≤7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent will be allowed to receive up to an additional 7.5 mg/day to a total of 15 mg/day 
oral prednisone or equivalent for a total of up to [ADDRESS_176885]’s 
safety and wellbeing, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the 
appropriate sections of the electronic Case Record Form (eCRF). Subjects should not start 
naturopathic, herbal, ayurvedic remedies, nutritional/dietary supplements, vitamins, and/or minerals without discussing with the Investigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_153203] (eg, topi[INVESTIGATOR_153204], topi[INVESTIGATOR_153205]) is permitted. During the study, topi[INVESTIGATOR_153206].

study. Subjects should use sunscreen (list as concomitant medication for SLE) and avoid sun 
exposure for the duration of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti -proteinuric agents (ACEI or ARB)  
Use of these are allowed during the study if they had been started at least 10 days prior to the 
assessment of the second screening 24 -hour UPCR sample (the first sample for 24-hour UPCR 
is collected at the start of the screening process and the second sample is collected within 14 
days prior to the expected date of randomisation). The dose may be adjusted to optimise 
anti-hypertensive effects or to reduce ACEI/ARB -related side effects up to Week 4. The dose 
must be kept stable from Week 4 through Week 104 (unless discontinued IP). Decreases in the 
dose are allowed only to reduce ACEI/ARB- related side effects such as hypotension, increase 
in creatinine, or cough. If cough develops, AC EI can be changed to ARB.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti -malarials 
The dose of anti- malarials will remain stable throughout the study except where a reduction of 
dose is necessary to manage anti -malarial related AEs. Any anti -malarial related abnormality 
should be managed according to local standards. Discontinuation of anti- malarials is allowed, 
if necessary, to manage anti- malarial related AEs. The subject can remain in the study even if 
anti-malarials are stopped.  
Randomised subjects who receive anti -malarial therapy within [ADDRESS_176886] an eye exam by a qualified professional either within 12 months prior to 
signing the ICF or subjects who start on anti- malarial therapy during the Screening Period 
within 12 weeks after signing the ICF. Anti- malaria-related abnormalities should be managed 
according to local standards. Anti -malaria l-related abnormalities do not exclude subjects if 
they meet all other eligibility criteria. If eye exam is not performed within the protocol-
specified timeframe, it will be  considered to be a protocol deviation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
No increase in the dose of or initiation of a new prescription non- steroidal anti- inflammatory 
drug (NSAID) should be made between signing the ICF and randomisation. For subjects receiving NSAIDs, concomitant proton pump inhibitors should be considered according to 
local practice and in concordance with considerations in the mycophenolate label. 
• The dose of prescription NSAIDs must remain stable from randomisation 
through Week 104 (unless discontinued IP) but can be reduced for 
reasons of toxicity but not for efficacy. Prescription NSAIDs should not 
be administered with other NSAIDs (including over-the-counter NSAIDs) except for low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤325 mg/day).

prior to unblinding of the data. Details of all analyses, including sensitivity analyses are 
presented in  the SAP.  
8.2 Sample size estimate  
A total of 150 subjects will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive one of the two IV anifrolumab 
dosing regimens (Basic Regimen or Intensified Regimen) or placebo. 
The sample size is based on the following assumptions: 
• Reductions from baseline to Week 52 in 24- hour UPCR of 65% and 46% 
for the anifrolumab and placebo arms, respectively (ie, ratios of 24-hours 
UPCR from Week 52 to baseline of 0.35 and 0.54, respectively), based 
on data presented in Furie et al, 2014. 
• The log- transformed [ADDRESS_176889] deviation (SD) of 0.8, based on data from the anifrolumab 
Phase 2b study (CD1013) 
Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 50 subjects per arm would result in an observed relative difference in the change from baseline to Week 52 in 24 -hour UPCR of 0.65 (here 
expressed as the ratio, comparing anifrolumab to placebo), and a corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of (0.50, 0.85) comparing the pooled anifrolumab group ( Basic and 
Intensified ) with  the placebo group. If the interim analysis is performed, a 0.001 two -sided 
alpha will be spent, and the final analysis will be based on 2-sided alpha of 0.049 (East Version 6.4). This sample size provides approximately 86 % power with a 2-sided alpha of 
0.[ADDRESS_176890] (relative difference =1) for comparing the pooled 
anifrolumab treatment group with placebo. The m inimal detectable relative difference in the 
change from baseline to Week 52 in 24-hour UPCR between the pooled anifrolumab treatment group versus placebo is approximately 0.76, corresponding to a reduction from baseline to Week 52 in 24- hour UPCR of 59% i n the pooled anifrolumab group (ratio of 24-hour UPCR 
from Week 52 to baseline of 0.41).

SLEDAI -2K 
The effect of anifrolumab compared with  placebo on SLEDAI- 2K score will be evaluated 
using the difference in mean change from baseline to Week 52 and to Week 104.  
Non-rena l SLEDAI -2K 
Extra -renal disease activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_153287] -2K score without the renal 
components (“non- renal SLEDAI -2K”). The effect of anifrolumab compared with  placebo on 
non-renal SLEDAI -2K will be evaluated using the difference in mean change from baseline to 
Week 52 and to Week  104. 
Physician’s Global Assessment  
The effect of anifrolumab compared with  placebo on PGA will be evaluated using the 
difference in mean change in PG A from baseline to Week 52 and to Week 104.  
SLICC/ACR Damage Index  
The endpoint used to evaluate the effect of anifrolumab compared with placebo on irreversible 
damage in SLE subjects is the mean change in SDI global score from baseline to Week 52 and 
to Week 104. 
8.4.4 Patient -reported outcome variables  
Patient Global Assessment  
The difference between anifrolumab and placebo in the mean change from baseline in PtGA 
(measured on a VAS ranging from 0 to 100 mm) to Week 52 and to Week 104 will be 
assessed.  
8.4.5 Safety  variables 
The following safety data will be collected: vital signs, physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, 
haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, reported AEs (including AESIs, see Section  6.4), 
PHQ-8 (up to Week 52) , C-SSRS (up to Week 52), tuberculosis questionnaire, assessment  of 
Cushingoid features, assessment  of cardiovascular risk (fast lipid profile), and extra- renal 
flares using SLEDAI -2K based Flare Assessment Instrument. Marked abnormal ECG values 
or changes from baseline will be identified based on pre- determined criteria. Occurrence of

made will be calculated for relevant measurements. Adverse events will be summarised by 
[CONTACT_153288].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events  
Durin g the evaluation of the AE data, a medically qualified expert from Sponsor/Sponsor’s 
delegate team will review: 
• AESI: AESI  are listed in Section 6.4. These will be reported in the CSR.  
• A list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs, or AEs leading to 
discontinuations: Based on the expert's judgement, significant AEs of 
particular clinical importance may, after consultation with the Astra 
Zeneca Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant AEs (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR. Examples of these are 
marked haematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction, or significant additional treatment. 
8.4.6 Immunogenicity variables 
ADA assessments will be conducted utilising a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titre). The presence of nAb will be tested only in samples that were previously found to contain ADA, using a ligand binding assay. 
Immunogenicity variables will also be assessed for the second year extension period.  
8.4.7 Pharmacokinetic variables  
Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessments for both anifrolumab and 
mycophenolic acid will  be primarily based on the observed steady-state serum trough 
(pre-dose) concentrations, Ctrough. For anifrolumab, maximum concentrations after the first 
and last dose will also be evaluated. 
Only C
trough will be assessed for the second year extension period. 
8.4.8 Lupus serology variables 
The outcome variable for anti-dsDNA antibodies, C3 and C4 complement levels will be the 
mean change from baseline over time in subjects with abnormal complement level at baseline, defined as complement level below lower limit o f normal  or elevated anti -dsDNA antibodies 
at baseline.

8.5 Methods for statistical analyses  
Missing data 
The study was designed to reduce the risk for missing data as much as possible through the 
following measures (see Section 7.7.3 for details):  
• From randomisation to Week 40, the study design allows for one burst and taper of corticosteroid for increased SLE disease activity or non- SLE 
causes.  
• The dose of MMF may be increased up to 3 gm/day in case of suboptimal 
response. 
• Subjects will receive IV methylprednisolone 500 mg on Week 0 (Day 1), prior to receiving the IP. 
• Subjects may also receive up to one additional (optional) dose of IV methylprednisolone (≤500 mg) for renal or extra -renal disease activity 
between Week 0 (Day 1) visit and Week 8 visit. 
• Subjects who require additional bursts of OCS wi ll still be allowed to 
remain in the study, but will be considered non-responders for subsequent 
responder analyses (such as CRR).  
Subjects who discontinue IP will be followed up to come to each visit for the scheduled 
assessments through the Week 52 visit (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176897] dose of IP for 
subjects for whom IP was discontinued within 12 weeks prior to Week 52).  
The following measures will be applied to the second year extension period to also reduce the 
risk for missing data:  
• From Wee k [ADDRESS_176898] and 
taper of corticosteroid. 
• Subjects who require additional bursts of OCS during the second year extension period will still be allowed to remain in the study, but will be

172 (231) considered non- responders fo r subsequent responder analyses (such as 
CRR at Week 104). 
Subjects who discontinue IP in the second year extension period will continue to be followed 
until Week 104 (or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_176899] dose of IP for subjects for whom IP 
was discontinued within 12 weeks prior to Week 104).  
Sensitivity analyses where missing data is handled in different ways will be carried out. 
Details will be pre -specified in the SAP.  
Presentation of results  
All data will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, 
and counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables. 
Summary tables will be presented by [CONTACT_20625] a pooled group comprising of 
both anifrolumab regimens. Details are presented in the SAP.  
95% CIs will be presented for estimated differences between treatments. If a model is used to 
estimate the treatment difference, the corresponding 95% C I according to the model will be 
presented. Otherwise, the unadjusted 95% CI will be used. Nominal p- values may be 
presented  for endpoints not included in the strategy for preserving the type [ADDRESS_176900] 1 dose of IP 
(modified Intention- To-Treat), will be used, in order to reflect the effect of the initially 
assigned and dosed IP. Further details regarding multiplicity adjustments can be found in 
Section 8.6. 
The analysis will be performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) fitted to 
log-transformed data comparing the pooled anifrolumab group with the placebo group, with 
fixed effects f or treatment group, visit, stratification factors and log -transformed 24 hour 
UPCR at baseline.  An interaction term for visit and treatment will also be included in the 
model to allow the relationship to differ across treatment groups.  Note that visit wi ll be fitted 
as a repeated variable in the model. Model assumptions will be checked and, if not met,

Non-responder imputation is used, ie, subjects treated with restricted treatments beyond 
protocol- allowed  threshold, and those discontinued for other reasons, will be regarded as 
non-responders. This estimand answers a clinically relevant question comparing the number 
of subjects able to both tolerate therapy sufficiently to remain on treatment to a given point in 
time and to achieve adequate response without further medication being required. 
The proportion of subjects achieving CRR in the anifrolumab pooled gr oup will be compared 
to that in the placebo group using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel approach (Cochran, 1954) 
stratified by:  
• Results of IFN test at screening using a [ADDRESS_176902] 
(IFN test -high versus. IFN test- low) 
• 24-hour UPCR ≤ 3.0 mg/mg versus >3.0 mg/mg (within 14 days prior to 
the expected date of randomisation). Without the results of the second 
(stratification) sample, subjects cannot be randomised. Turn-around time 
for results from central laboratory is up to [ADDRESS_176903] (ie, the difference in response rate for the pooled  anifrolumab 
group versus the placebo  group ) and corresponding 95% CI for the difference at Week 52 and

within each pooled and treatment group will be presented. The treatment effect at other time 
points may also be evaluated in a similar way.  The individual anifrolumab regimens will also 
be assessed and presented similarly . 
Further, longitudinal presentations of results over time based on the same analysis, with the corresponding 95% CI, will be created. In addition, the individual components of the composite endpoints will be summarised by [CONTACT_1570].  
CRR will also be assessed at Week 104 using the same methodology. Please see Section 8.4.2 for more details.  
8.5.3 Analysis of exploratory variables  
All exploratory analyses will be performed using the pooled and individual anifrolumab 
groups, as well as placebo. No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested, but nominal p -
values may be presented.  
Exploratory binary responder endpoints (at l east PRR, aCRR, graded CRR, graded aCRR, 
sustained reduction of OCS, modified CRR and modified PRR) will be assessed similarly to 
CRR endpoint as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Response rate and the corresponding 95% CI comparing each anifrolumab group (including pooled anifrolumab group) with the placebo 
group will be presented. The treatment effect s at Week 52 and Week 104 will be evaluated. 
Analyses  of ordinal outcomes (such as CRR, PRR, no response) will also be performed. 
Further details are presented in the SAP.  
The time to achieve renal response and time to first renal flare will be reported descriptively.  
The number of renal flares and the flare rates will also  be summarised.  Details are presented 
in the SAP.  
Continuous endpoints (including eGFR, spot UPCR, SLEDAI -2K, PGA, SDI, and PtGA) will 
be analysed using MMRMs with fixed effects for the appropriate baseline value, treatment 
group, visit, stratification f actors and visit- by-treatment interaction term. Results will be 
presented in terms of the adjusted means for each treatment group, estimates of treatment 
differences, and associated CIs. Model assumptions will be checked and, if not met, appropriate data t ransformations may be applied or non- parametric approaches will be 
considered. Details are presented in the SAP.  
Exploratory renal variables which are assessed at Week 52 will also be assessed at Week 104 
using the same methodology. 24- hour UPCR will also be assessed at Week 104 as an 
exploratory variable. Please see Section 8.4.3 for more details.

8.5.11 Interim analysis 
Primary efficacy and safety analyses will be performed once all data from the main study (up 
to and including Week 52) is available, cleaned and frozen . The study will also be unblinded 
at this stage for the team performing the analysis.  
One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects have completed 
the Week 52 visit.  
Even though there is no provision to stop the study early due to an 
efficacy claim, if the interim analysis is performed, a portion of the 2-sided alpha will be spent. A Peto-Haybittle spending function would therefore be used with a fixed 2-sided p-value threshold of 0.1% at the interim. The p- value threshold at the final analysis will be 
adjusted to account for the interim an alysis , based on the actual observed information fraction 
for the primary endpoint. If as planned there are 75 patients included at the interim and 150 patients at the final analysis, the critical threshold at the final analysis will be 4.9% (East 
Version 6.4). 
Additional and repeat analyses as previously defined will be performed at the end of the 
second year extension period. Additional details are provided in the SAP. 
8.6 Testing strategy to account for multiplicity considerations  
While the primary and secondary objectives are defined based on the comparison between the 
pooled anifrolumab and placebo groups, the respective endpoints will also be tested for the 
individual anifrolumab regimens. The following hierarchical testing strategy (presented in Figure 3) will be used to provide strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER). As

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_144109]/the centre should comply with all the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the C SA, or equivalent, for this study.  In the event of any inconsistency 
between this clinical study protocol ( CSP) and the C SA, the terms of C SP shall prevail with 
respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subject s and in all other respects, not 
relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the CSA  shall prevail.  
Agreements between [COMPANY_008] and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153210]- related procedures can take place, or subjects are enrolled.  
9.2.3 Archiving of study documents  
The Investigator follows the principles outlined in the CSA. 
9.2.4 SLE Data Medical Review Team  
Data for SLE disease activity and damage indices (SLEDAI -2K, PGA, and SDI) as well as 
SLEDAI -2K based Flare Assessment Instrument will be reviewed by [CONTACT_153292]’s delegate Medical Team. The SLE Data Medical Review Team (MR team) members are medically qualified individuals. The MR team will review all LN and SLE data in 
conjunction with any other relevant data (including medical history, AE, laboratory data, and 
concomitant medications as appropriate) that is necessary to characterise the subject’s SLE. 
The MR team members will have access to an internal expert on SLE disease activity and damage indices for unanticipated issues with regard to interpretation of t hese indices.  
A separate procedure will outline the review and escalation details. The MR Team will be utilised throughout the study to confirm SLEDAI- 2K, PGA, SLEDAI -2K based Flare 
Assessment Instrument, and SDI scoring. The purpose of the independent review is to ensure 
medical plausibility, coherence, consistency, and clarity of data. The MR team will query any 
inconsistent scoring and follow for resolution of any discrepancy. The MR team will monitor trends in issues encountered during their review and liaise with the study team for additional 
training to be provided for the site staff or study monitoring team as appropriate. The MR 
team will remain blinded for the duration of the study. The MR team is separate from the Medical Monitoring team and works closely with the Medical Monitoring team.

2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
According to the CDC, cigarette smoking is associated with profound morbidity and mortality. In the [LOCATION_002] alone, cigarette smoking is responsible for about 443,000 deaths per year and it costs the nation nearly $200 billion annually. About 20% of all adults smoke in the [LOCATION_002] and by 12th grade, 42% of students report having smoked. Starting, however, is one problem and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_777196]. Cigarette smoking is a disease of chronic relapse. Indeed, once having started, smokers will make as many as 20 quit attempts before they are successful [1] and abstinence rates can be as low as 7%, even following NRT with the patch, gum, or nasal spray [2]. As with other addictions, cue-induced craving contributes to relapse following a quit attempt [3]. Along with cue-induced craving and relapse, addicts also suffer from drug-induced devaluation of natural rewards, as evidenced by [CONTACT_777205] a sweet in anticipation of the availability of drug in rats [4] and weaker responses to monetary rewards in striatum (a key brain reward region) in humans waiting to smoke [5, 6]. Importantly, those subjects (rats and humans) found least responsive to the natural reward are, in turn, most responsive to drug [4, 7]. 
From a global perspective, it would seem that there are three options for the treatment of 
cigarette smoking: no support (unaided cessation), behavioral support of one manner or another, and/or pharmacological intervention. With nearly 70% of smokers reporting that they would like to quit, yet most failing, we must assume that will, alone, is not sufficient. Certainly, the ability to quit any addiction can be bolstered by [CONTACT_777206]/or pharmacological support. Contingency management is a behavioral intervention where abstinence is reinforced with tangible incentives such as money. However, and as alluded to, addicts may be insensitive to the very reward upon which their behavior is contingent. NRT is a long-standing and widely used smoking cessation tool. Yet, as discussed, NRT too is only modestly effective. We propose that the limited effectiveness of NRT is due, at least in part, to a failure to prevent cue-induced craving and relapse and to a failure to attenuate drug-induced devaluation of natural rewards. In support, NRT treatment does not attenuate either stimulus-elicited drug seeking [8] or the reduction in reward-related activity in the striatum of smokers [9].  Here we propose a novel alternative to the steady-state delivery of nicotine (i.e., to the standard patch) for the treatment of smoking cessation. Specifically, we propose to use an oral film to treat smokers wishing to quit with random, rather than steady-state, delivery of nicotine prior to and following the quit date.
2.2 Previous Data
Support for our random delivery hypothesis is provided by [CONTACT_777207] (i.e., uncontrollable/unpredictable) delivery of drug impairs the development of cue-drug associations, retards or disrupts responding for drug or alcohol, and can even render the drug aversive. In rats, yoked delivery of ethanol retarded later acquisition of ethanol self-administration [10] and, in our hands, a history of yoked delivery of cocaine [11] disrupted the willingness to work for the drug on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Although fixed ratio (FR) responding appears normal in rats with a history of yoked delivery of cocaine, the averaged data occlude the fact that rats yoked to high drug-takers actually took only about 4 infusions/hour on the FR schedule. To be effective, however, yoked delivery of drug needs not only delay acquisition in drug inexperienced rats, but must effectively rescue subjects with a strong drug habit. In accordance, Twining and Mueller (in preparation) found that yoked delivery of cocaine rescued cocaine-experienced rats by [CONTACT_777208]-taking during subsequent FR testing. In humans, Donny et al. [12] reported that yoked delivery of cocaine led to an increase in mean systolic and diastolic STUDY0000087 3
Approval: 1/26/201 7
Page 4 of 25 (V.06/19/2014)blood pressure in response to the drug because of a lack of cue-supported tolerance. 
Scheduled availability of ethanol led to a marked decrease in intake of ethanol in a controlled setting [13].  Finally, a meta-analysis showed that pre-cessation treatment with a standard (i.e., steady state) nicotine patch doubled the odds of quitting smoking relative to subjects that received only post-cessation treatment with the nicotine patch ([14] but see [15, 16] ).  Rose and Behm [17], too, found abstinence enhanced by [CONTACT_094]-cessation treatment with the nicotine patch and, in an early study, Foulds reported that use of the nicotine patch while smoking led to a 14% reduction in expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514] (CO), reduced satisfaction from smoking, and fewer and weaker reported urges to smoke [18].  These marked effects are thought to be due, at least in part, to separation of blood nicotine levels from the act of smoking [16].  Dissociation of smoking behavior and cues from nicotine is expected to be even greater with random nicotine delivery.
2.3 Study Rationale
There is, as yet, no ‘random patch’. Random delivery via a subcutaneously placed chip or pump is conceivable, but would be invasive and expensive. Here we propose to test the merits of our hypothesis, simply, by [CONTACT_777209]-layer film that has been tested and is safe for use in humans [19, 20].  Plasma nicotine levels induced by [CONTACT_777210] a similar dose of Nicorette gum.  Preliminary pharmacokinetics studies found that 1mg films increased plasma nicotine levels by [CONTACT_21316] 2 ng/ml [21].  It has been demonstrated that smokers in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_777197] 50 ng/ml [22].  The manufacturer of the film, [CONTACT_777225], states that the 4mg film has been tested for taste in human nonsmokers and to the best of his knowledge was well-tolerated.  [CONTACT_729703], as a nonsmoker, has also taken an 8mg film without experiencing any ill effects.  The film is easy to use and tastes pleasant to humans. No water is required, as the film simply adheres to the roof of the mouth until dissolved (about 5-10 min). Indeed, unlike nicotine gum, there are no complicated instructions regarding how and when to chew. The film can be used to deliver any dose of nicotine desired over time and placebo films are readily available. Finally, if the hypothesis proves correct, this novel treatment should be fairly inexpensive and available over the counter. As such, it will be both accessible and affordable, even for low-income smokers.
If this ‘random film’ were to work as predicted, cigarette cues would be dissociated from the act 
of smoking, sensitivity to alternative natural rewards would be enhanced and, most importantly, smokers maintained on the random film would be more likely to achieve cessation. This would be a remarkable advance for the treatment of smoking and would inform the treatment of other addictions as well.

7.4.1 Description
Nicotine orally dissolving films (ODF) will be provided in doses of 0, 2, or 4 mg.  The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Nicotine ODF is nicotine polacrilex (20%, USP). The film used in Nicotine ODF has a muco-adhesive property, i.e. it can adhere to the oral mucosa and allow the drug to be absorbed through oral mucosa.   After placement in the oral cavity, nicotine ODF dissolves over a 5-10 minute period.  The unit-dose dosage is in the form of a 1 in x 1 in square and weighs about 100 mg.  Nicotine films are not available in the [LOCATION_002] in a non-investigational setting. See table below for composition information.

Page 17 of 25 (V.06/19/2014)11.3 Method of collection of safety information
All data, including safety data, will be coded directly into REDCap electronic case report forms during study visits.  
11.4 Frequency of data collection
Safety data will be collected intermittently at each study visit.  
11.5 Individual’s reviewing the data
The study coordinator will be responsible for the daily oversight of subject safety and will provide updates to the Principal Investigators to review participants’ progress and their experiences with the study, including any adverse events.  
In the event of adverse event(s) during the conduct of the study, we have a mechanism in place to ensure that the event(s) will be assessed by [CONTACT_777218] a timely manner.  All adverse events (AEs) occurring during the course of the study must be collected, documented, and reported to the Principal Investigators and [CONTACT_158916], Professor of Medicine and Chief of Division of Internal Medicine at Penn State Hershey,. All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_777199] a serious adverse event (SAE). Serious adverse events, as defined by [CONTACT_1622], will be systematically evaluated at each clinic visit. Any SAE, whether or not related to study participation, will be reported to the IRB, and NIDA. The initial SAE report will be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a completed SAE report . Outcome of SAEs will be periodically 
reported to NIDA. A summary of the SAEs that occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to NIDA.  Each week a study investigator will review the AE Forms from the previous week for events that were reported as new or continuing.  The study investigators will follow all AEs to the point of a satisfactory resolution.  A study participant may have their participation discontinued if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_777200] a participant. 
Where any participant had a serious adverse event (systolic BP>160, vomiting or any other symptoms requiring their participation in the study to be interrupted/terminated), [CONTACT_777228] will immediately review the case and make a recommendation both on management of that individual case but also continuation of the study at the planned doses.  
The study leadership group (Drs. Grigson, Foulds, Wilson and Sciamanna) will make appropriate recommendations for changes in protocol, if needed.  All product related adverse events of a non-serious nature will be reported to the IRB at the time of renewal.  Serious adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_777219] 2 business days of our receipt of information regarding the event and written reports will be submitted within 10 days.  The study leadership group will review all serious or unexpected adverse events and provide recommendations. 
We will inform NIH of any significant action taken as a result of findings of reviews of serious 
AEs. We will inform the subjects of any changes in risk.  
Responsibility for data quality, provision of reporting of AEs to the IRB and NIH, and appropriate 
response to recommendations of the leadership group lies with the PI.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a summary of the DSM report to NIDA on an annual basis as part of the progress report. The DSM report will include the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, treatment retention rates, any quality assurance or regulatory issues that occurred during the past year, summary of AEs and SAEs, and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol.

11.8 Suspension of research
Due to the low risk of the intervention, it is unlikely that there will be a need to suspend the research.  However, should the study doctor ([CONTACT_158916]) identify any issues after reviewing the data, they can develop stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_777201]. 
12.[ADDRESS_1067460] Leaders.  The major risks associated with the study are related to the use of nicotine (which is similar to the nicotine received from smoking) and nicotine withdrawal. 
Additional potential risks include:
•Nicotine withdrawal symptoms:   It is possible for subjects to experience short-term nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms (e.g. irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, anxiety).  Those receiving placebo films may experience more serious nicotine withdrawal symptoms. 
•Risk to fetus and breast fed infants:   Nicotine is known to be harmful to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_777202], either from cigarettes or at the dose being used in this study.  For this reason women must not be pregnant or nursing in order to participate in the study.   
•Risks of IV catheter for blood draw: The discomfort associated with the IV insertion by 
[CONTACT_48571] (by [CONTACT_777221] a vein) for removing blood is a slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_264391]. The risks include mild discomfort and/or a black and blue mark at the site of puncture. Less common risks include a small blood clot, infection or bleeding at the puncture site, and on rare occasions fainting during the procedure.  
•Loss of confidentiality:   There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if information is obtained by 
[CONTACT_127774].  Precautions will be taken to prevent this including direct coding of data in REDCap.
•Randomization:  Participants will be assigned to a treatment program by [CONTACT_3364].
•Discomfort from questionnaires:   It is possible that some of the questions in the 
questionnaires may make participants uncomfortable.  They will be instructed that they are free to skip any questions that make them uncomfortable.
•Nicotine film side effects:  Excess nicotine can cause mild symptoms such as nausea, 
dizziness, diarrhea and rapid heartbeat.  Occasionally these  symptoms are more severe (e.g. vomiting) such as when an individual receives more nicotine than they are accustomed to.  This, however, is unlikely to occur with the doses used in this study. Additional side effects of the film may include hiccups.  STUDY0000087 3

Page 19 of 25 (V.06/19/2014)•Possible effects on the oral cavity.  In order to assess local toxicity of the study product, the 
CRC nurse assisting with the clinic visit will perform an oropharyngeal exam at the beginning of the visit prior to the participant receiving the study product as well as at the end of the visit after study product use is complete.  Any changes will be assessed and documented.  During the visit, after each film administration, participants will be asked to report side effects including any mouth discomfort or irritation via a questionnaire.  If indicated, participant would discontinue study product use.  Lesions of the oral mucosa are not anticipated as daily dissolution of several 2 mg sublingual nicotine tables (range 1-12/day over a 6 month period) led to only mild and transient effects on the oral mucosa[24]
•Incidental Finding:  None of the tests carried out in this study are intended to provide 
diagnoses for clinical purposes, but participants will be alerted to findings that should be discussed with a healthcare provider (such as high blood pressure) 
The participant may be removed from the research study without his or her permission because the 
participant does not follow the instructions for the study, has an adverse reaction to the study product (irregular heartbeat, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia (resting heart rate persistently greater than 100 beats per minute), has symptoms of nicotine overdose such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, or rapid heartbeat, or has symptoms of an allergic reaction.Participants are instructed to please call the Principal Investigator, Patricia Sue Grigson, Ph.D., at [PHONE_16171] during business hours or [PHONE_16172] after business hours if they:

21.0 Adverse Event Reporting
21.1 Adverse Event Definitions
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug
Suspected 
adverse reactionAny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
•Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse 
event or Serious suspected adverse reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Life-threatening 
adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, 
in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Unexpected 
adverse event or Unexpected suspected adverse reaction.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.
21.2 Recording of Adverse Events
All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study team believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:
•The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_777222]0000087 3
Approval: 1/26/201 7
Page 22 of 25 (V.06/19/2014)•The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or 
medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy
•The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of 
subject participation in the clinical research study
•The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].
21.[ADDRESS_1067466] findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship 
to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.
21.4 Reporting of Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the FDA  
21.4.1 Written IND Safety Reports
The Sponsor-Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 
3500A) to the responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be a serious and unexpected, suspected adverse reaction.  Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be provided to all participating investigators (if applicable) and sub-investigators.
Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, 
later than 15 calendar days following the Sponsor-Investigator’s receipt of the respective adverse event information and determination that it meets the respective criteria for reporting.
For each written IND Safety Report, the Sponsor-Investigator will identify all previously 
submitted IND Safety Reports that addressed a similar suspected adverse reaction experience and will provide an analysis of the significance of newly reported, suspected adverse reaction in light of the previous, similar report(s) or any other relevant information.
Relevant follow-up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable 
review division of the FDA as soon as the information is available and will be identified as such (i.e., “Follow-up IND Safety Report”).
If the results of the Sponsor-Investigator’s follow-up investigation show that an adverse event 
that was initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the Sponsor-Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report as soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.
21.4.2 Telephoned IND Safety Reports – Fatal or Life-threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reactions
In addition to the subsequent submission of a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed 
FDA Form 3500A), the Sponsor-Investigator will notify the responsible review division of the FDA by [CONTACT_74170], fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction. STUDY0000087 3

22.1 Study Monitoring Plan
22.1.1Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Data will be collected from participants and coded directly by [CONTACT_461909] (participant entered data) or through REDCap data entry forms (researcher entered data).  The codes that link the name [CONTACT_264439]. Any paper forms (consent) will be securely transported to the PI’s data entry center. 
Study data will be managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). 
REDCap is a secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-friendly web-based case report forms, real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). The system was developed by a multi-institutional consortium which includes The Pennsylvania State University and was initiated at Vanderbilt University. The database is hosted at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine data center, which will be used as a central location for data processing and management. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_59881]. This iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy for individual studies. 
REDCap is HIPAA compliant. Data are stored on a secure server; data in REDCap are 
encrypted; access to the database requires authentication (a unique username [CONTACT_2383]); data are accessed based on the individual’s role on the project; every interaction with the data is logged, creating an audit trail.STUDY0000087 3
Approval: 1/26/201 7
Page 24 of 25 (V.06/19/2014)Random data entry checks will be implemented regularly to identify problems with data 
entry.  Data quality tools  included in REDCap will be utilized to identify incorrect data 
types, out of range data and outliers.  In addition, electronic edit checks, and random internal quality and assurance checking will be performed manually.  Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_264436]. If necessary, re-training of researchers will be conducted.
The responsibility for data quality and study conduct lies with the PI. 
22.1.2Safety Monitoring
